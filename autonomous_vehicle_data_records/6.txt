AB This paper is concerned with the cooperative target tracking of multiple autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) under switching interaction topologies. For the target to be tracked, only its position can be measured/received by some of the ASVs, and its velocity is unavailable to all the ASVs. A distributed extended state observer taking into consideration switching topologies is designed to integrally estimate unknown target dynamics and neighboring ASVs' dynamics. Accordingly, a novel kinematic controller is designed, which takes full advantage of known information and avoids the approximation of some virtual control vectors. Moreover, a disturbance observer is presented to estimate unknown time-varying environmental disturbance. Furthermore, a distributed dynamic controller is designed to regulate the involved ASVs to cooperatively track the target. It enables each ASV to adjust its forces and moments according to the received information from its neighbors. The effectiveness of the derived results is demonstrated through cooperative target tracking performance analysis for a tracking system composed of five interacting ASVs.

AB In limit conditions, autonomous vehicles face the risk of lateral instability. The integrated control of steering and braking, an important measure for improving the stability of autonomous vehicles, has been extensively studied. A novel steering and braking integrated model predictive path tracking control (PTC) based on a dimension reduction model is proposed in this study. This method aims at the dilemma of the real-time limitation of the current integrated model predictive PTC based on nonlinear vehicle dynamics in practical applications and the unsatisfactory control effect of the integrated model predictive PTC based on the linearised vehicle dynamics in limit conditions. The core concept of this study is to reduce the input dimension of the integrated controller model by designing a model dimension reduction method, thereby reducing the decision variables of the optimisation problem and improving the real-time performance. The model dimension reduction method is designed based on the optimal utilisation of tire force to ensure the control performance of the proposed integrated control method in limit conditions. The integrated control method based on the dimension reduction model is compared with several existing integrated control methods in limit conditions to demonstrate its validity and superiority. The simulation tests with Simulink and CarSim indicate that the proposed method can reduce the calculation time by more than 40 $ \% $ % on the premise of ensuring path tracking accuracy and vehicle stability in limit conditions. Moreover, the hardware-in-the-loop tests prove the practicability of the presented method.

AB Many studies have begun investigating possible transportation landscapes in the autonomous vehicle (AV) era, but empirical results on longer-term decisions are limited. We address this gap using data collected from a survey designed and implemented for Georgia residents in 2017-2018. Focusing on a hypothetical all-AV future, this section of the survey included questions regarding advantages/disadvantages of AVs, short-term mode choice impacts, medium-term impacts on activity patterns, and long-term behavioral changes - specifically, whether/how AVs will influence individuals to change residential location and the number of cars in the household. We hypothesize that AVs could act in concert with attitudinal preferences to stimulate changes in these long-term decisions, and that some medium-term activity changes triggered by AVs could motivate people to relocate their residence or shed household vehicles. We applied exploratory factor analysis to measure the perceived likelihood that AVs would prompt various medium-term changes. We then included some of those measures, among other variables, in a cross-nested logit (CNL) model of the choice of the residential location/vehicle ownership bundle. Although more than half of respondents expected "no change" in their bundle, we found that younger, lower income, pro-suburban, and pro-non-car-mode individuals were more likely to anticipate changing their selections. In addition, some expected medium-term impacts of AVs influenced changes in these longer-term choices. We further applied the CNL model to two population segments (Atlanta and non-Atlanta-region residents). We found notable improvement in goodness of fit and different effects of factors across segments, signifying the existence of geography-related taste heterogeneity.

ID EXPLORATION
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have become promising tools for marine geological surveys to collect information such as the topography of the seafloor and the location of hydrothermal plumes. Visual surveys and sampling are mainly conducted using human-occupied vehicles or remotely operated vehicles. To obtain detailed visual data more efficiently, a hovering-type AUV (Hobalin), which has the novel ability to autonomously navigate within a vent field, was developed to explore hydrothermal deposits. This vehicle was deployed in an active hydrothermal vent field located in the western offshore of Kumejima Island at a depth of approximately 1,400 m. Visual observations were performed with submillimeter image resolution via low-altitude navigation using still cameras. Moreover, a height estimation method for chimney structures was proposed utilizing an obstacle avoidance system composed of a sheet laser and a forward-looking camera with hovering maneuver capability. It was determined that hovering-type AUVs can facilitate the effective survey of hydrothermal vents and the acquired data can be utilized for subsequent sampling by human-occupied vehicles and remotely operated vehicles.

AB This paper studies the effect of automated vehicle implementation on transport system emission from a macroscopic point of view. The paper considers several scenarios differing in passenger car unit (PCU) and the penetration share percent of automated vehicles in the system using PTV Visum software. The study presents that automated vehicles reduce total emission by both the effect of smooth driving of each automated vehicle independently and the spread of automated vehicles in the network. Furthermore, apart from considering the effect of different PCU values and penetration levels, the developed model takes into account three different types of emissions and seven different vehicle classes.

AB Dynamic vehicle detection and tracking is crucial for self-driving in urban environments. The main problem of the previous beam-model-based algorithms is that they cannot detect and track dynamic vehicles that are occluded by other objects. In this paper, we develop a novel dynamic vehicle detection and tracking algorithm to solve this problem for our autonomous land vehicle (ALV), which is equipped with a Velodyne LIDAR and a GPS-aid inertial navigation system. For detection, our improved two-dimensional virtual scan is presented to detect the potential dynamic vehicles with a scan differencing operation. Then, for each potential dynamic vehicle, a novel likelihood-field-based vehicle measurement model is proposed to weight its possible poses. Finally, our newly modified scaling series algorithm and the importance sampling technique are adopted to estimate the initial pose and the corresponding velocity for each vehicle, respectively. The scaling series algorithm coupled with a Bayesian filter (SSBF) was previously used to handle the tactile localization problem in static background scenes. For tracking dynamic vehicles, we improve the SSBF by adding the ego-motion compensation so that the improved algorithm is able to update the pose and velocity for each vehicle in dynamic background scenes. Both the quantitative and qualitative experimental results validate the performance of our dynamic vehicle detection and tracking algorithm on the KITTI datasets and the Velodyne data collected by our ALV in dynamic urban environments.

AB There are great expectations around the future of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Such visions often picture vehicles that work everywhere without human interference. In this article we use empirical data from a pilot project taking place in the Norwegian Arctic to explore the place-specificity of such technologies. The case study is used to demonstrate how new configurations of emergent technologies are shaped by the places where the trial unfolds; and how insights produced through working on and with this site contribute to changing visions of AV technologies into questioning issues of transferability and scalability. In this way, the paper contributes to discussions of how pilot projects and testing of emergent technologies in the real world relates to the re-configuring of visions and expectations. The paper highlights how emerging technologies might transform societies, infrastructures and vehicles towards more computerized configurations in ways that are not anticipated or discussed in public and therefore seldom governed.

AB This study proposes an entire hardware and software architecture from operator input to motor command for the autonomous area coverage mission using multiple unmanned aerial vehicles. Despite the rapid growth of commercial drone services, there are many limitations on operations, such as a low decision-making autonomy and the need for experienced operators to intervene in the whole process. For performing the area coverage mission more efficiently and autonomously, this study newly designs an optimization problem that allocates waypoints created to cover that area to unmanned aerial vehicles. With an optimized list of waypoints, unmanned aerial vehicles can fill the given areas with their footprints in a minimal amount of time and do not overlap each other during the mission. In addition, this study performs both various simulations for quantitative analysis and an outdoor experiment through real hardware implementation in order to verify the performance sufficiently. The methodologies developed in this study could be applied to endless applications using unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with mission-specific sensors.

AB This paper proposes an event-triggered saturation-tolerant solution to the problem of trajectory tracking control with application to autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) considering quantitative transient behaviors. To prespecify the transient tracking behaviors quantitatively and avoid the possible violation of behavioral functions induced by input saturation, a saturation quantitative prescribed performance control (SQPPC) is proposed, where auxiliary subsystems are devised to monitor the input saturation and modify the behavioral boundaries, such that SQPPC can automatically adapt to the input saturation without transgressing the exact output constraints. Intermittent measurement-based uncertainty and disturbance estimator (IMUDE) is devised to reconstruct the lumped disturbances with reduced communication resource usage. Building upon the estimation results obtained from IMUDE, an event-triggered control law is designed, attaining ultimately uniformly bounded (UUB) results, where a relative threshold-based event-triggered mechanism (RTETM) is constructed to reduce the communication resource dissipation along the controller-to-actuator channel. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy in controlling an omni directional intelligent navigator, simulation results are provided and analyzed.

AB This paper proposes a coordinated control system of autonomous vehicles' lateral stability based on state estimation and path tracking, which contributes to enhancing path-tracking capability and at the same time maintaining the stability of autonomous vehicles driving in complex and dynamic road conditions. First, an extended Kalman filter observer is designed to estimate the vehicle parameters. Then, based on the single-point preview theory, an adaptive preview time model is built for the accuracy of path tracking. When designing the direct yaw-moment controller, sideslip angle and yaw rate, two critical parameters for lateral dynamic stability control are considered, and the single-wheel braking method is utilized to reasonably distribute the additional yaw moment to a certain wheel. To make full use of active front steering and direct yaw-moment control, the critical steering angle of the front wheel is determined, and a switching function is formulated. Co-simulation shows that the suggested coordinated control system can effectively strengthen maneuvering stability and simultaneously satisfy tracking accuracy.

AB In this study, a finite-time velocity-free rendezvous control method is considered for multiple autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) systems with intermittent undirected communication. First, we develop a distributed finite-time observer for each AUV to estimate its own state information. Second, we design a rendezvous control algorithm that utilizes the estimated state information intermittently through a communication network in the absence of velocity measurement. A homogeneous method is used to prove that all AUVs in the group can achieve rendezvous in finite time for a network with intermittent communication, even without velocity measurements. The proposed method is shown to reduce the communication load of the system. More importantly, the control algorithm achieves the control goal of the system and is proven to be viable for many practical applications of multiple AUV systems from both economic and security perspectives. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control protocol is demonstrated via numerical simulations.

DE Security; autonomous vehicle; blockchain; attacks; industry 4.0
AB Vehicles automation is one of the applications of smart transport system (STS), and has already been used by many automotive industries, such as Uber, Google, and Toshiba, on trial basis across the globe. These trials have faced many safety, privacy, and security issues, such as impersonation, Denial-of-Service (DoS), timing, and wormhole attacks, which raises many questions and concerns over the usage of these, keeping in view of the safety of the passengers. Although there exists many solutions in the literature for the above issues, but most of these are based upon the centralized architecture having a single point of failure. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, in this paper, we analyze and discussed the threat classification pertaining to autonomous vehicles (AV) by using the authentication, accountability, and service availability. We highlighted the countermeasures for AV cyberattacks along with their implementation issues and explore how blockchain can overcome these issues. Also, a blockchain-based integrated AV architecture is discussed to mitigate the security and privacy issues with service availability. Finally, we explore the open issues and challenges of blockchain-based AV system. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Modeling and predicting human-driven vehicle behaviors are critically important for the planning and control of autonomous vehicles in mixed traffic which includes both autonomous and human-driven vehicles. Despite the tremendous efforts on this problem, the traditional general driver model-based approaches are subject to prediction accuracy issues and the state-of-the-art data-driven heuristic approaches are subject to scalability issues. To this end, this paper proposes a novel inverse model predictive control (IMPC) based approach to address these issues. The approach can learn the internal control process of human drivers through the automatic learning of their cost functions in a novel IMPC setup, which could result in improvements in both the accuracy and scalability. The approach was implemented and validated with realistic human driver studies. The experiments illustrated that the proposed approach could achieve a better accuracy and a better scalability for unseen scenarios compared to existing approaches.

ID AUTOMATED VEHICLES
AB Truck lane restriction is one of the most common highway lane management strategies; it ensures that heavy vehicles mostly use the outer lanes of a multilane highway. A higher percentage of heavy vehicles in the design lane increases the required load-bearing capacity of the pavement structure and therefore increases construction cost. This study considers three probable strategies to control this cost trend for flexible pavement: distribution of trucks across multiple lanes, design of heterogeneous pavement structures across lanes, and separation of car lanes from truck lanes. It was found that the construction cost of one unit length of highway is less for each strategy than the cost incurred with truck lane restriction in place. In order to take advantage of platooning, cars and trucks may not continue to use highway lanes in the traditional way. The cost advantages reported here can be exploited for selecting future highway lane management strategies in the environment of connected and autonomous vehicles.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Digital twins can improve the level of control over physical entities and help manage complex systems by integrating a range of technologies. The autonomous agricultural machine has shown revolutionary effects on labor reduction and utilization rate in field works. Autonomous vehicles in precision agriculture have the potential to improve competitiveness compared to current crop production methods and have become a research hotspot. However, the development time and resources required in experiments have limited the research in this area. Simulation tools in unmanned farming that are required to enable more efficient, reliable, and safe autonomy are increasingly demanding. Inspired by the recent development of an open-source virtual simulation platform, this study proposed an autoware-based simulator to evaluate the performance of agricultural machine guidance based on digital twins. Oblique photogrammetry using drones is used to construct three-dimensional maps of fields at the same scale as reality. A communication format suitable for agricultural machines was developed for data input and output, along with an inter-node communication methodology. The conversion, publishing, and maintenance of multiple coordinate systems were completed based on ROS (Robot Operating System). Coverage path planning was performed using hybrid curves based on Bezier curves, and it was tested in both a simulation environment and actual fields with the aid of Pure Pursuit algorithms and PID controllers.

AB This paper proposes a fuzzy logic based autonomous flight controller for UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles). Three fuzzy logic modules are developed for the control of the altitude, the speed, and the roll angle, through which the altitude and the latitude-longitude of the air vehicle are controlled. The implementation framework utilizes MATLAB's standard configuration and the Aerosim Aeronautical Simulation Block Set which provides a complete set of tools for rapid development of detailed 6 degree-of-freedom nonlinear generic manned/unmanned aerial vehicle models. The Aerosonde UAV model is used in the simulations in order to demonstrate the performance and the potential of the controllers. Additionally, Microsoft Flight Simulator and FlightGear Flight Simulator are deployed in order to get visual outputs that aid the designer in the evaluation of the controllers. Despite the simple design procedure, the simulated test flights indicate the capability of the approach in achieving the desired performance.

AB The time that a vehicle merges in a lane reduction can significantly affect passengers' safety, comfort, and energy consumption, which can, in turn, affect the global adoption of autonomous electric vehicles. In this regard, this paper analyzes how connected and automated vehicles should cooperatively drive to reduce energy consumption and improve traffic flow. Specifically, a model-free deep reinforcement learning approach is used to find the optimal driving behavior in the scenario in which two platoons are merging into one. Several metrics are analyzed, including the time of the merge, energy consumption, and jerk, etc. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed framework can reduce the energy consumed by up to 76.7%, and the average jerk can be decreased by up to 50%, all by only changing the cooperative merge behavior. The present findings are essential since reducing the jerk can decrease the longitudinal acceleration oscillations, enhance comfort and drivability, and improve the general acceptance of autonomous vehicle platooning as a new technology.

AB Presence of autonomous vehicles (AVs) affects traffic flow characteristics of a mixed traffic stream comprising human-driven vehicles. To model the impact of AVs on the saturation flow of arterials and highways, we propose analytical models to derive the expected value and variance of headway of a traffic stream with mixed AVs and conventional human-driven (or normal) vehicles (NVs), given the expected penetration rate of AVs. The proposed model considers the arrangement (order) of AVs and NVs in the mixed stream and the expected, the lowest, and the highest achievable headways and their variability are analytically derived. Moreover, the total delay of a two-lane road with interrupted traffic flow is analytically modeled for various possible lane allocation policies: (a) dedicated lanes, (b) mixed-mixed lanes, (c) mixed-NV lanes, and (d) mixed-AV lanes. Microsimulation experiments demonstrate the validity of the developed models for the average headway and its variability, as well as the delay formulas.

ID LABRADOR SEA; WINTER; TURBULENCE; REGIMES
AB The authors present a new modality for direct measurement of ocean flow, achieved by combining the resolution and precision of an acoustic Doppler velocimeter with the mobility of an autonomous underwater vehicle. To obtain useful measurements, two practical integration issues must first be resolved: the optimal location for mounting the velocimeter probe to the vehicle, and alignment of the velocimeter with the vehicle's attitude sensors. Next, it is shown how to extract earth-referenced flow velocities from the raw measurements. Vehicle hull's influence on flow velocity measurement is removed by modeling the vehicle as a spheroid in potential flow. This approach was verified by a tow tank experiment in the David Taylor Model Basin. The authors then describe mission configuration and signal processing for a deployment in the Labrador Sea to study deep ocean convection during the winter of 1998. Analysis of the vertical flow velocity data not only shows that this form of measurement can detect ocean convection, but also gives detailed information about convection's spatial structure.

   Texas network with charging infrastructure decisions
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES

   vehicles; Taxi fleet simulations
ID FLEET
AB Shared autonomous vehicles, or SAVs, have attracted significant public and private interest because of their opportunity to simplify vehicle access, avoid parking costs, reduce fleet size, and, ultimately, save many travelers time and money. One way to extend these benefits is through an electric vehicle (EV) fleet. EVs are especially suited for this heavy usage due to their lower energy costs and reduced maintenance needs. As the price of EV batteries continues to fall, charging facilities become more convenient, and renewable energy sources grow in market share, EVs will become more economically and environmentally competitive with conventionally fueled vehicles. EVs are limited by their distance range and charge times, so these are important factors when considering operations of a large, electric SAV (SAEV) fleet.
   This study simulated performance characteristics of SAEV fleets serving travelers across the Austin, Texas 6-county region. The simulation works in sync with the agent-based simulator MATSim, with SAEV modeling as a new mode. Charging stations are placed, as needed, to serve all trips requested (under 75 km or 47 miles in length) over 30 days of initial model runs. Simulation of distinctive fleet sizes requiring different charge times and exhibiting different ranges, suggests that the number of station locations depends almost wholly on vehicle range. Reducing charge times does lower fleet response times (to trip requests), but increasing fleet size improves response times the most. Increasing range above 175 km (109 miles) does not appear to improve response times for this region and trips originating in the urban core are served the quickest. Unoccupied travel accounted for 19.6% of SAEV mileage on average, with driving to charging stations accounting for 31.5% of this empty-vehicle mileage. This study found that there appears to be a limit on how much response time can be improved through decreasing charge times or increasing vehicle range.

AB This paper presents an online path planning approach for an autonomous tracked vehicle in a cluttered environment based on teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO), considering the path smoothness, and the potential collision with the surrounding obstacles. In order to plan an efficient path that allows the vehicle to be autonomously navigated in cluttered environments, the path planning problem is solved as a multi-objective optimization problem. First, the vehicle perception is fully achieved by means of inertial measurement unit (IMU), wheels odometry, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR). In order to compensate the sensors drift to achieve more reliable data and improve the localization estimation and corrections, data fusion between the outputs of wheels odometry, LiDAR, and IMU is made through extended Kalman filter (EKF). Then, TLBO is proposed and applied to determine the optimum online path, where the objectives are to find the shortest path to reach the target destination, and to maximize the path smoothness, while avoiding the surrounding obstacles, and taking into account the vehicle dynamic and algebraic constraints. To check the performance of the proposed TLBO algorithm, it is compared in simulation to genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and a hybrid GA-PSO algorithm. Finally, real-time experiments based on robot operating system (ROS) implementation are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed path planning algorithm.

AB To support the U.S. Air Force's global reach concept, a Common Aero, Vehicle is being designed to support the global strike mission. Waypoints are specified for reconnaissance or multiple payload deployments and no-fly zones are specified for geopolitical restrictions or threat avoidance. Because of time critical targets and multiple scenario analysis, an autonomous solution is preferred over a time-intensive, manually Iterative one. Thus, it real-time or near real-time autonomous trajectory optimization technique is presented to minimize the flight time, satisfy terminal and Intermediate constraints, and remain within the specified vehicle heating and control limitations. This research uses the hypersonic cruise vehicle as a simplified two-dimensional platform to compute an optimal analytical solution. An up-and-coming numerical technique is it direct solution method involving discretization and then dualization, with pseudospectral methods and nonlinear programming used to converge to the optimal solution. This numerical technique Is first compared to the previously derived 2-D hypersonic cruise vehicle analytical results to demonstrate convergence to the optimal solution. Then, the numerical approach is applied to the 3-D Common Aero Vehicle as the test platform for the flat Earth three-dimensional reentry trajectory optimization problem. The culmination of this research is the verification or the optimality or this proposed numerical technique, as shown for both the two-dimensional and three-dimensional models. Additionally, user Implementation strategies art, presented to improve accuracy, enhance solution convergence, and facilitate autonomous implementation.

AB Automated driving systems (ADSs) promise a safe, comfortable and efficient driving experience. However, fatalities involving vehicles equipped with ADSs are on the rise. The full potential of ADSs cannot be realized unless the robustness of state-of-the-art is improved further. This paper discusses unsolved problems and surveys the technical aspect of automated driving. Studies regarding present challenges, high-level system architectures, emerging methodologies and core functions including localization, mapping, perception, planning, and human machine interfaces, were thoroughly reviewed. Furthermore, many state-of-the-art algorithms were implemented and compared on our own platform in a real-world driving setting. The paper concludes with an overview of available datasets and tools for ADS development.

AB The Navlab group at Carnegie Mellon University has a long history of development of automated vehicles and intelligent systems for driver assistance. The earlier work of the group concentrated on road following, cross-country driving, and obstacle detection. The new focus is on short-range sensing, to look all around the vehicle for safe driving. The current system uses video sensing, laser rangefinders, a novel light-stripe rangefinder, software to process each sensor individually, a map-based fusion system, and a probability based predictive model. The complete system has been demonstrated on the Navlab I I vehicle for monitoring the environment of a vehicle driving through a cluttered urban environment, detecting and tracking fixed objects, moving objects, pedestrians, curbs, and roads.

AB Multi-Target tracking is a central aspect of modeling the environment of autonomous vehicles. A mono camera is a necessary component in the autonomous driving system. One of the biggest advantages of the mono camera is it can give out the type of vehicle and cameras are the only sensors able to interpret 2D information such as road signs or lane markings. Besides this, it has the advantage of estimating the lateral velocity of the moving object. The mono camera is now being used by companies all over the world to build autonomous vehicles. In the expressway scenario, the forward-looking camera can generate a raw picture to extract information from and finally achieve tracking multiple vehicles at the same time. A multi-object tracking system, which is composed of a convolution neural network module, depth estimation module, kinematic state estimation module, data association module, and track management module, is needed. This paper applies the YOLO detection algorithm combined with the depth estimation algorithm, Extend Kalman Filter, and Nearest Neighbor algorithm with a gating trick to build the tracking system. Finally, the tracking system is tested on the vehicle equipped with a forward mono camera, and the results show that the lateral and longitudinal position and velocity can satisfy the need for Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Navigation On Pilot (NOP), Auto Emergency Braking (AEB), and other applications.

AB Fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles (FCHEVs) have zero harmful emissions, fast refueling times, and long driving ranges. Autonomous FCHEVs add benefits such as collision avoidance and driver convenience yet increase vehicle energy usage due to sensors and computation. Thus, it is important to optimize vehicle speed trajectories and the energy management strategy (EMS) of autonomous FCHEVs to minimize energy use. This article uniquely proposes to achieve this goal using convex optimization, with detailed vehicle loss calculations that can be run in real time. The two novel approaches proposed are: 1) the successive method, which solves the speed problem then the EMS problem, and 2) the integrated method, which uniquely feeds back the fuel cell efficiency to the speed algorithm to solve the problem in an iterative integrated manner. The simulation results show that the integra?ted method uses 0.19% to 2.37% less hydrogen than the successive method on short drive cycles with varying accessory loads, and 10.12%-21.62% less hydrogen than an arbitrary constant speed profile. On longer real-world drive cycles, the integrated method reduces hydrogen use by 1.43% to 2.82% just through speed optimization. Compared to a dynamic programming benchmark, which is not implementable in real time, the integrated method uses less than 1% more hydrogen.

AB Traffic characteristics such as signalized intersections and high vehicle density combined with low vehicle speeds account for 12-55% increase in commute time. Increasing the number of lanes in the highway infrastructure can help increase the highway capacity and consequently reduce the associated commute delay. However, due to human-related features such as driver behavior and vehicle interaction as well as induced demand, it is recommended to limit the number of highway lanes to four. Recently, in view of the rising discussion regarding the deployment of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), it is important to study the effect of the number of highway lanes on traffic characteristics with respect to AVs. This will provide insights into the full potential of AVs in terms of reducing commute time as well as provide crucial insights into the design of future road networks. Therefore, in this study, RL-based AV frameworks are developed to investigate the effect of the number of highway lanes on traffic characteristics. Specifically, we study the effect of the number of lanes on traffic characteristics in terms of travel speed, collision, and driving on the right-most lane. Results with two well-known RL-based AV frameworks simulated on highways with lanes ranging from 2 to 8 and increasing vehicle count respectively show improved traffic characteristics as the number of lanes increases. However, improvement depends on the RL algorithm employed.

AB This paper proposes a novel algorithm for decision-making on autonomous lane change manoeuvre in vehicles. The proposed approach defines a number of constraints, based on the vehicle's dynamics and environmental conditions, which must be satisfied for a safe and comfortable lane change manoeuvre. Inclusion of the lateral position of other vehicles on the road and the tyre-road friction are the main advantages of the proposed algorithm. To develop the lane change manoeuvre decision-making algorithm, first, the equations for the lateral movement of the vehicle in terms of manoeuvre time are produced. Then, the critical manoeuvring time is calculated on the basis of the constraints. Finally, the decision is made on the feasibility of carrying out the manoeuvre by comparing the critical times. Numerous simulations, taking into account the tyre-road friction and vehicles' inertia and velocity, are conducted to compute the critical times and a model named TUG-LCA is presented based on the corresponding results.

AB Self-driving vehicles must be controlled by navigation algorithms that ensure safe driving for passengers, pedestrians and other vehicle drivers. One of the key factors to achieve this goal is the availability of effective multi-object detection and tracking algorithms, which allow to estimate position, orientation and speed of pedestrians and other vehicles on the road. The experimental analyses conducted so far have not thoroughly evaluated the effectiveness of these methods in road driving scenarios. To this aim, we propose in this paper a benchmark of modern multi-object detection and tracking methods applied to image sequences acquired by a camera installed on board the vehicle, namely, on the videos available in the BDD100K dataset. The proposed experimental framework allows to evaluate 22 different combinations of multi-object detection and tracking methods using metrics that highlight the positive contribution and limitations of each module of the considered algorithms. The analysis of the experimental results points out that the best method currently available is the combination of ConvNext and QDTrack, but also that the multi-object tracking methods applied on road images must be substantially improved. Thanks to our analysis, we conclude that the evaluation metrics should be extended by considering specific aspects of the autonomous driving scenarios, such as multi-class problem formulation and distance from the targets, and that the effectiveness of the methods must be evaluated by simulating the impact of the errors on driving safety.

AB In the near future, autonomous vehicles (AVs) will travel sharing the current freeways with human driven vehicles. The efficiency of this mixed traffic scenario will depend on the ability of AVs to behave cooperatively. Otherwise, the introduction of uncoordinated AVs might lead to capacity reductions. Connected AVs (CAVs) traveling in platoons represents a promising management strategy to get the most from the AVs' technological revolution. Most of previous research has used traffic microsimulation tools to assess platooning and other CAVs' cooperative driving strategies, achieving good results. However, the robust macroscopic modeling alternative, which typically yields the necessary insights and fundamental knowledge to set the foundations for the development of management and control strategies, remains almost unexplored. This paper contributes to fill this research gap by providing a generalized macroscopic model to estimate the average CAVs platoon length for a given traffic demand and penetration rate of CAVs. Two different platooning schemes are compared (i.e. cooperative and opportunistic) representing the best and worst case scenarios. The estimation of CAVs platoon length is of much importance as it is the main factor driving capacity improvements on freeways, which under the appropriate conditions could exceed 10.000 vehicles per hour and lane.

AB Previous work by the authors focused on obstacle avoidance in large, high-speed autonomous ground vehicles within unknown and unstructured environments. This work resulted in a nonlinear model predictive control based algorithm that simultaneously optimises both the speed and steering commands. The algorithm can exploit the dynamic limits of the vehicle to navigate it to a target position as quickly as possible without compromising safety. In the algorithm, a model of the vehicle is used explicitly to predict and optimise future actions, but in practice the model parameter values are not known exactly. Thus, in this paper, the robustness of the algorithm to parametric uncertainty is evaluated. It is first demonstrated that using nominal parameter values in the algorithm leads to safety issues in 24% of the evaluated scenarios with the considered parametric uncertainty distributions. To improve the algorithm's robustness, a novel double-worst-case formulation is developed that simultaneously accounts for the robust satisfaction of the two safety requirements of high-speed obstacle avoidance: collision-free and no-wheel-lift-off. Results from simulations with stratified random scenarios and worst-case scenarios show that the double-worst-case formulation renders the algorithm robust to all uncertainty realisations tested. The trade-off between robustness and the task completion performance is also quantified.

We leverage B-spline curve properties to include vehicle's constraint requirements, thus lowering the search dimensionality. An algorithm, which combines competent exploratory nature of the randomized search methods with vector-valued parameterization steering, is developed here. Vehicle's limitations, along with obstacle's constraints, are satisfied without being hindered by numerical integration and control space discretization of traditional randomized kinodynamic planners. We rely on newly developed theoretical underpinnings to overcome performance issues in rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) solutions. Rigorous simulations and analysis demonstrate that this new approach outperforms recently proposed planners by using an efficient bidirectional RRT-based search, by maintaining continuous state and control spaces, and generating C-2 continuous paths, which are realistic inputs suited for mobile robotic applications and passenger vehicles.

AB Autonomous electric vehicles (A-EVs), regarded as one of the innovations to accelerate transportation electrification, have sparked a flurry of interest in trajectory planning and charging scheduling. In this regard, this work employs mobile edge computing (MEC) to design a decentralized hierarchical algorithm for finding an optimal path to the nearby A-EV parking lots (PLs), selecting the best PL, and executing an optimal charging scheduling. The proposed model makes use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assist edge servers in trajectory planning by surveying road traffic flow in real time. Furthermore, the target PLs are selected using a user-driven multiobjective problem to minimize the cost and waiting time of A-EVs. To tackle the complexity of the optimization problem, a greedy-based algorithm has been developed. Finally, charging/discharging power is scheduled using a local optimizer based on the PLs' real-time loads, which minimizes the deviation of the charging/discharging power from the average load. The obtained results show that the proposed model can handle charging/discharging requests of on-move A-EVs and bring fiscal and nonfiscal benefits for A-EVs and the power grid, respectively. Moreover, it observed that user satisfaction in terms of traveling time and traveling distance is increased by using the edge-UAV model.

AB In this work, the leading-tracking control problem for heterogeneous and uncertain nonlinear autonomous vehicles is addressed. These latter communicate their status information over a wireless communication network and engage in cooperative movements in extraurban traffic environment. The nonlinear vehicle dynamics are affected by time-varying parameter uncertainties, and the air-drag reduction caused by platooning is explicitly considered. The variation of V2V links as a result of cooperative manoeuvres is modelled by incorporating switching into the communication network topology. To this aim, we develop a novel robust distributed Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)-like control protocol which ensures that all vehicles within the platoon robustly track the behaviour of the leader, despite the presence of both unknown parameters uncertainties and network switching. The analytical stability of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated using Lyapunov theory. Sufficient stability conditions are expressed as a set of feasible Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) whose solution allows the robust control gains to be properly tuned. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated via the Mixed Traffic Simulator (MiTraS) co-simulation platform, which combines MATLAB/Simulink with SUMO microscopic traffic simulator. The exhaustive simulation analysis, involving the Monte Carlo method, is carried out considering different cooperative platooning manoeuvres, and confirms the theoretical derivation.

AB In the multiple fields covered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), path planning is undoubtedly one of the issues that cover a wide range of research lines. To be able to find an optimal solution, which allows one or several vehicles to establish a safe and effective way to reach a final state from an initial state, is a challenge that continues to be studied today. The increasingly widespread use of autonomous vehicles, both aerial and ground-based, make path planning an essential aspect for incorporating these systems into an endless number of applications. Besides, in recent years, the use of Multi-Robot Systems (MRS) has spread, consisting of both Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), gaining versatility and robustness in their operation. The possibility of using heterogeneous robotic teams allows tackling, autonomously, and simultaneously, a wide range of tasks with different characteristics in the same environment. For this purpose, path planning becomes a crucial aspect and, for this reason, this work aims to offer a general vision of trajectory planning, to establish a comparison between the methods and algorithms present in the literature for the resolution of this problem within MRS, and finally, to show the applicability of these methods in different areas, together with the importance of these methods for achieving autonomous and safe navigation of different types of vehicles.

AB This paper proposed an improved artificial physics (AP) method to solve the autonomous navigation problem for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)/unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) heterogeneous coordination in the three-dimensional space. The basic AP method has a shortcoming of easily plunging into a local optimal solution, which can result in navigation fails. To avoid the local optimum, we improved the AP method with a random scheme. In the improved AP method, random forces are used to make heterogeneous multi-UAVs/UGVs escape from local optimum and achieve global optimum. Experimental results showed that the improved AP method can achieve smoother trajectories and smaller time consumption than the basic AP method and basic potential field method (PFM).

AB Chinese firms are grappling with the four paradigm shifts around electric, connected, shared, and autonomous vehicles that are roiling the rest of the global auto industry. This article, which follows my earlier MOR article about the auto industry (Teece, 2018a), looks briefly at the development of capabilities in these fields by Chinese firms. It then analyzes the prospects for Chinese firms to use them to gain a stronger foothold in the global market, and for multinationals to continue to prosper in China. The paradigm shifts are creating new entry points for Chinese firms to capture value in the industry, and some potential global contenders have demonstrated solid dynamic capabilities in electric vehicles (Geely), shared vehicles (Didi Chuxing), and autonomous vehicles (Baidu). However, multinationals are also moving forward in the same fields and have strong complementary assets such as respected brands and well-honed dynamic capabilities.

AB This work demonstrates the feasibility of applying a sliding mode fuzzy controller to motion control and line of sight guidance of an autonomous underwater vehicle. The design method of the sliding mode fuzzy controller offers a systematical means of constructing a set of shrinking-span and dilating-span membership functions for the controller. Stability and robustness of the control system are guaranteed by properly selecting the shrinking and dilating factors of the fuzzy membership functions. Control parameters selected for a testbed vehicle, AUV-HM1, are evaluated through tank and field experiments. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed controller in dealing with model uncertainties, non-linearities of the vehicle dynamics, and environmental disturbances caused by ocean currents and waves.

AB This paper deals with the design, improvement, and implementation of a nonlinear control strategy to solve the trajectory tracking problem for an autonomous underwater vehicle under model uncertainties and external disturbances. First, a disturbance observer based on high-order sliding mode control is designed to counteract the negative impact of both parametric uncertainties and bounded external disturbances. Then, the nonlinear control is enhanced through injecting the disturbance estimation into the designed controller. The stability of the closed-loop system with the enhanced proposed nonlinear controller is proven by Lyapunov arguments. Finally, real-time experimental results are also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

DE Terrain referenced navigation; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Vision based

AB A vision-based terrain referenced navigation (TRN) system is addressed for autonomous navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A typical TRN algorithm blends inertial navigation data with measured terrain information to estimate vehicle's position. In this paper, however, we replace the low-cost inertial navigation system (INS) with a monocular vision system. The homography decomposition algorithm is utilized to estimates the relative translational motion using features on the ground with simple assumptions. A numerical integration point-mass filter based on Bayesian estimation is employed to combine the translation information obtained from the vision system with the measured terrain height. Numerical simulations are constructed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that the precise autonomous navigation of unmanned aircrafts is achieved by the vision-based TRN algorithm.

AB This paper addresses the novel application of an autonomous rotary-wing unmanned air vehicle (RUAV) as a cost-effective tool for the surveillance and management of aquatic weeds. A conservative estimate of the annual loss of agricultural revenue to the Australian economy due to weeds is in the order of A$4 billion, hence the reason why weed control is of national significance. The presented system locates and identifies weeds in inaccessible locations. The RUAV is equipped with low-cost sensor suites and various weed detection algorithms. In order to provide the weed control operators with the capability of autonomous or remote control spraying and treatment of the aquatic weeds the RUAV is also fitted with a spray mechanism. The system has been demonstrated over inaccessible weed infested aquatic habitats.

AB This paper assesses the effectiveness of cooperative localization for improving the performance of closed-loop control systems for networks for autonomous multi-vehicle navigation. Nonlinear dynamic models of two- and three-dimensional vehicles are presented along with their linearized forms. A nonlinear control algorithm is then presented based on the dynamic model. Relative position measurement equations and their linearized forms are introduced. The state and measurement equations are then employed for the propagation and update steps of an EKF-based cooperative localization algorithm. Initially, a series of experiments with networks of quadcopters and mobile robots are presented to validate the performance of cooperative localization for state estimation with the continuous or intermittent presence of absolute measurements or their complete absence. Finally, the performance of the control algorithm is evaluated with and without cooperative localization to demonstrate its effectiveness for improving performance.

AB The shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) is an emerging intelligent transportation mode driven by artificial intelligence, and the vehicle scheduling method is a crucial technology for SAVs. However, researches on the scheduling method of hybrid demand in SAVs lack consideration of dynamic travel time and an analysis of the impact of demand characteristics on system performances. According to the distinct submission and processing approaches of reservation and realtime demands, this paper proposes two hybrid demands scheduling methods for SAV system: the scheduling method with no demand priority (NDP) and the scheduling method that prioritizing short-term reservation demands (PSRD). The NDP method processes the short-term reservation and real-time demands together. The PSRD method processes the short-term reservation demands first, then inserts other requests into the arrangements of reservation demands. A method for calculating dynamic travel time using the ant colony algorithm is proposed. This method aims to identify the optimal path according to the future road network conditions. The results indicate that the PSRD method can give full play to the advantage of knowing the travel information of reservation demand in advance and has good system performance and running efficiency, especially when the number of reservation demands is large. This forms the foundation for advancing research in the SAV traffic systems.

AB The advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is likely to introduce new mobility experiences for travelers. In particular, AVs would allow travelers to get off at the destinations and then drive themselves elsewhere to park rather than cruise for parking or park at a location with a high parking fee. The self-parking capability is likely to increase the utility of private-owned AVs (PAVs) and make this mobility option more attractive than human-driven vehicles. The present study investigates the dynamics of travelers shifting to PAVs from other transport modes and its negative impact on road traffic congestion. To this end, we propose an agent-based demand model which considers different travel cost components depending on crucial travel attributes such as trip purpose and activity duration. The estimated demand is then fed into a mesoscopic traffic simulation model to examine the resulting road traffic conditions. As charging private vehicles for the congestion they cause is an effective tool for demand management and congestion alleviation, we also integrate a distance-based pricing scheme into the overall modeling framework to investigate its impact on mode choice and transport network performance. A case study is conducted in Melbourne, Australia to demonstrate the proposed methodology. The results indicate that the distance-based pricing scheme can effectively limit the usage of PAVs and reduce traffic congestion, especially in the city center and peripheral suburbs.

AB Wireless charging to autonomous underwater vehicle effectively prolongs the attended time and extends the endurance mileage. As the most promising underwater power feeding technique, inductive power transfer is also faced with challenges such as the attenuation in seawater, ocean current disturbance, etc. Special concerns in terms of power quality, efficiency improvement, and mechanical fixing need to be considered when designing the underwater electromagnetic coupling structure. An attenuation model in seawater is established in this article. The optimal working frequency range is refined for a specific transmission media. Different from the wireless power transfer system in the air, the underwater WPT system features tight coupling between the transmitter and receiver. The optimal range of coupling coefficient needs to be redesigned, as high coupling coefficient incurs frequency splitting and the increase of harmonic component, while low coupling coefficient results in low efficiency. Based on the theoretical analysis, a self-latching coupling structure is proposed with lightweight design on receiver side. System parameters are optimized correspondingly and a 3-kW experiment validates the theoretical analysis.

AB Building robust perception systems for autonomous vehicles requires addressing multimodal data fusion and large-scale deep network training challenges. This work puts forth an integrated methodology based on specialized deep learning architectures including Faster R-CNN and DeepLabV3 adapted for autonomous driving tasks. The approach encompasses a robust data curation pipeline handling multimodal data preprocessing, including sensor synchronization for temporal alignment, normalization using standardization techniques, quality enhancement via noise filtering and controlled augmentation via techniques like cropping and brightness variation. For perception, Faster R-CNN leverages a region proposal network to generate candidate object bounding boxes, followed by a classification network using Feature Pyramid Networks for multi-scale object detection and localization. DeepLabV3 adopts atrous convolutions with varying dilation rates and multiple spatial pyramid pooling modules for semantic segmentation and pixel-level scene understanding. Further elements include object tracking using similarity metrics between extracted features, trajectory forecasting based on past motions, sensor fusion mechanisms like early and mid-level fusion to combine complementary modalities, and coordinated training procedures leveraging joint losses tailored for autonomous driving datasets. Extensive comparative benchmarks demonstrate the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, with top scores of 94% accuracy, 93% precision and 94% AUC and low error rates such as MSE, RMSE, and MAE on tasks corresponding to object localization, segmentation and scene understanding. Ablation studies provide detailed insights into optimal configurations. The comprehensive methodology unifies deep neural perception pipelines tailored for autonomous driving, serving as a crucial enabler for next-generation intelligent vehicle systems. Thorough experimentation validates its effectiveness in handling diverse sensory data and complex real-world scenarios.

DT Article
DE deep reinforcement learning; lane-free traffic; autonomous driving
AB Lane-free traffic is a novel research domain, in which vehicles no longer adhere to the notion of lanes, and consider the whole lateral space within the road boundaries. This constitutes an entirely different problem domain for autonomous driving compared to lane-based traffic, as there is no leader vehicle or lane-changing operation. Therefore, the observations of the vehicles need to properly accommodate the lane-free environment without carrying over bias from lane-based approaches. The recent successes of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for lane-based approaches, along with emerging work for lane-free traffic environments, render DRL for lane-free traffic an interesting endeavor to investigate. In this paper, we provide an extensive look at the DRL formulation, focusing on the reward function of a lane-free autonomous driving agent. Our main interest is designing an effective reward function, as the reward model is crucial in determining the overall efficiency of the resulting policy. Specifically, we construct different components of reward functions tied to the environment at various levels of information. Then, we combine and collate the aforementioned components, and focus on attaining a reward function that results in a policy that manages to both reduce the collisions among vehicles and address their requirement of maintaining a desired speed. Additionally, we employ two popular DRL algorithms-namely, deep Q-networks (enhanced with some commonly used extensions), and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), which results in better policies. Our experiments provide a thorough investigative study on the effectiveness of different combinations among the various reward components we propose, and confirm that our DRL-employing autonomous vehicle is able to gradually learn effective policies in environments with varying levels of difficulty, especially when all of the proposed rewards components are properly combined.

AB The activities of the most enterprises are related to the difficulties while adapting to the current market demand, therefore, it is vitally important to define and solve the arising problems. Today consumers require non-expensive, personalized, ecological products just on time to their doorstep. Most government policies in this area are focused on the customer rights, demand in sustainable products and on stemming the environmental impacts of unsustainable production practices. However, the authors' of the current scientific publications are discussing the limited possibilities to achieve the cost effective performance and sustainability. The conducted literature analysis indicates that there is a lack of industry 4.0 practices for supply chain management. The presented publication considers the competitiveness strategy, which contributes to sustainable and optimal costs management. The supply chain must evolve and shift from the traditional to more sustainable solutions. The Internet of Things, big data analytics, cloud computing, cyber-physical systems along with autonomous vehicles and logistic clusters can help to maintain the competitiveness advantage in the long-run. The proposed approach also provides flexibility, redundancy and adaptive abilities to manage the logistic cluster, which allows limit the trade-offs between sustainability and cost effective performance. The simulation of the logistic network was done using the real data from the specialists' interviews within the food industry. The obtained results showed that by implementing the autonomous vehicles strategy along with the consolidation warehouses CO2 emission level can be decreased by 22%. Moreover, the rest stops are not required during the trip because of the autonomous vehicles implementation in the supply chain. The proposed strategy also decreased costs of the whole logistic network. Currently the practical implementation of the developed distribution strategy is limited by the legislation and infrastructure issues, which should be solved aiming to reach sustainable supply chain and cost effective performance.

AB As a special application of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), the Autonomous Truck Mounted Attenuator (ATMA) vehicle system is promoted to reduce fatalities in work zone locations. In this manuscript, we focus on the Operational Design Domain (ODD) problem of two-lane highways, i.e., under what traffic conditions should an ATMA be deployed. Due to the dramatic speed difference between ATMA vehicles and general vehicles, a queue will be formed, leading to a percent-time-spent-following (PTSF) increase during maintenance. General vehicles in the queue will assess a gap on the opposite lane to perform a passing maneuver, which is broken down into multi-stage merging behavior. As such, an analytical model is first made, based on queuing theory in which the arrival rate and service rate are analyzed to estimate the PTSF. In this way, the linkage between annual average daily traffic (AADT) and level of service (LOS) is analytically established. Then, the proposed model is validated by comparing the estimated PTSF with that of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) values. The comparison results show that the mean error is 9.58%, and the mean absolute error is 12.36%, which demonstrate that the developed model is able to generate satisfactory results when compared with the HCM model. Numeric analysis also shows that roadway performance is sensitive to the K factor and D factor, as well as the operating speed of an ATMA. If LOS = C is a desirable design objective, a good AADT threshold to use would be around 11,000 vehicles per day.

AB The higher social attention and negotiation among road users while crossing the road is as much a challenge for self-driving cars as it is for pedestrians. Self-driving cars in their current state are not able to understand cues from other road users and are rather reactive to pedestrian behavior, which may result overall in a slower traffic flow. In this paper, a vehicle-pedestrian negotiation model is proposed describing the processing and exchange of negotiation cues from both parties in order to speed up the traffic flow. The motion strategy for the vehicle approaching the pedestrian is formulated in order to negotiate its best chance to pass first, a process that closely mimics the common scenarios of everyday negotiation on roads. Simulation results show an improvement in the overall travel time of the vehicles as compared with the current best practice behavior (always stop) of autonomous vehicles. The cost-benefit analysis of negotiation among both parties is also discussed in this paper.

AB This paper studies the problem of optimal overtaking of a slow-moving leading vehicle in the presence of oncoming and/or adjacent vehicles with varying but known longitudinal speeds. A computationally efficient modeling approach is introduced, in which the overtaking problem is formulated by sampling in relative distance to the leading vehicle, replacing velocity state with its inverse and utilizing a nonlinear change of control variables. These three steps achieve a computationally efficient nonlinear control problem that can be solved using the sequential quadratic programming. Measures have been taken to ensure the feasibility of the nonlinear problem, even when the sequential quadratic programming iterates are stopped prematurely. A case study is presented, where this new formulation is compared with the previously published formulations in terms of solution quality and computation time.

AB Driver lane-changing behaviors have a significant impact on the safety and the capacity of the vehicle-based traffic system. Therefore, modeling lane-changing maneuvers has become an essential component of driving behavior analysis. Among microscopic LC models, game theory-based lane-changing models highlight the interaction of drivers, which reveal a more realistic image of driving behaviors compared to other classic models. However, the potential of game theory to describe the human driver's lane-changing strategies is currently under-estimated. This paper aims to review the recent development of game-theoretic models that are classified according to their different methodologies and features. They are designed for both human-driven and autonomous vehicles, and we hope they can find applications in future AV industries.

AB An approach to a new kind of recommendation system design that suggests safe speed on the road is presented. Real data obtained on roads were used for the simulations. As part of a project related to autonomous road sign development, a number of measurements were carried out on both local roads and expressways. A speed recommendation model was created based on gathered traffic data employing the traffic simulator. Depending on the traffic volume and atmospheric conditions prevailing on the road, as well as the surface conditions, the proposed system recommends the safe speed for passing vehicles by influencing the distance from the preceding vehicle to prevent collisions. The observed effect of the system application was an increase in the minimal distance between vehicles in most simulations.

AB Autonomous moving vehicles facilitate mining of ore in underground mines. The vehicles are usually equipped with many sensor-based devices (e.g., Lidar, video camera, proximity sensor, etc.), which enable environmental monitoring, and remote control of the vehicles at the control center. Transfer of sensor-based data from the vehicles towards the control center is challenging due to limited connectivity enabled by the multi-access technologies of the communication infrastructure (e.g., 5G, Wi-Fi) within the underground mine, and the mobility of the vehicles. This paper presents design, development, and evaluation of a concept and architecture enabling continuous machine learning (ML) for optimizing route selection of real-time streaming data in a real and emulated underground mining environment. Continuous ML refers to training and inference based on the most recently available data. Experiments in the emulator indicated that utilization of a ML-based model (based on the RandomForestRegressor) in decision making achieved similar to 5-13% lower one-way delay in streaming data transfers, when compared to a simpler heuristic model.

AB Perception systems play a crucial role in autonomous driving by reading the sensory data and providing meaningful interpretation of the operating environment for decision-making and planning. Guaranteeing a safe perception performance is the foundation for high-level autonomy, so that we can hand over the driving and monitoring tasks to the machine with ease. With the motivation of improving the perception systems' safety, this survey analyzes and reviews the current achievements of safety-related standards and definitions, sensory modeling, and metrics for perception tasks in autonomous driving applications. Furthermore, it covers the generic categorization of potential failures and causal analysis in perception tasks, correlates the effect with the scenario modelling choices, and highlights major triumphs and noted limitations encountered by current research efforts. The new safety challenges laid out by the information exchange stage of the connected autonomous vehicle application have also been summarized. The open research questions and future directions are outlined to welcome researchers and practitioners to this exciting domain.

AB In this paper we solve the problem of trajectory tracking control of an underactuated autonomous aerial vehicle in the presence of unknown time-varying dynamics. We begin our approach with the design of a Kalman filter for the linear motion subsystem under non-vanishing perturbations. The filter attenuates the noise of position measurements, and simultaneously estimates the linear velocity of the vehicle as well as an unknown term of lumped dynamics, which includes model parametric uncertainty and exogenous perturbations. The output and residual of the filter are then fed to a nonlinear controller whose thrust actuation is bounded with respect to the position and velocity errors. The total error stemming from the closed-loop system is shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Experimental results and comparison data are presented to showcase the performance of our strategy in different real-world applications using a quadrotor vehicle. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Haptic shared control has proven to be an effective method to assist a driver in controlling a vehicle. This method is now being considered for use in developing strategies for smooth transitions between manual and autonomous driving modes. This article has two objectives. First, it proposes to adapt an existing haptic shared control strategy to achieve transitions between manual and autonomous modes and to evaluate this approach with real drivers on a driving simulator. Second, it proposes to evaluate four different transition profiles in an obstacle-avoidance context. The first profile is a gradual transition from the autonomous mode to shared control mode, followed by another transition from the shared control mode to autonomous mode once the obstacle is passed. The second is a gradual transition from autonomous mode to manual mode. The third is a binary transition from autonomous mode to manual mode. Finally, in the fourth condition, the driver overrides the autonomous mode. These transition profiles were evaluated in curves and straight lines on a driving simulator. The results first validated the use of the haptic shared control strategy to execute transitions between manual and autonomous modes. The distribution of the torques delivered by the automation system and the driver corresponded to the progression of the expected sharing level. Second, the gradual transitions showed advantages over binary transitions and the override of the autonomous mode, both in terms of steering performance and subjective evaluation.

Consequently, researchers thought to put all that newly added computational power to use for other endeavors. Hence, Autonomous Vehicular Cloud Computing (AVCC) models were introduced. Nevertheless, this goal is not an easy undertaking, the dynamic nature of autonomous vehicles introduces a critical challenge in the development of such a distributed computing platform. Furthermore, it presents far complicated issues as far as security and protection of services associated with this framework. In this paper, we center around securing programs running on AVCC. Here, we focus on timing side-channel attacks which aim to leak information about running code, which can be utilized to reverse engineer the program itself. We propose to mitigate these attacks via obfuscated compilation. In particular, we change the control flow of an input program at the compiler level, thereby changing the program's apparent behavior and accompanying physical manifestations to hinder these attacks. We improve our previous ARM-based implementation to address its limitations and provide more comprehensive coverage for different programs. Our solution is software-based and generically portable - fitting different hardware platforms and numerous input program languages at the source level. Our findings prove a considerable improvement over our previous technique, which may provide more defense against timing side-channels.

AB Precise estimations of the roll and sideslip angles of autonomous vehicles are essential for autonomous driving, which requires further information about the vehicle state. As such, novel deep learning approaches have been introduced for this purpose. However, the majority of deep learning works focusing on vehicle dynamics estimations have yet to delve into learning strategies specifically for this task. Here, we argue that simply applying an adequate learning strategy to the task can boost the estimation performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective curriculum learning strategy for better estimations of the roll and sideslip angles simultaneously. In addition, we compare our curriculum using a self-taught scoring function with a curriculum sorted by prior human knowledge, demonstrating its superiority. The proposed method outperforms the non-curriculum method by a large margin (up to a 16.5% decrease for sideslip as validation and 3.7% on a test), especially with regard to cornering (up to a 4% decrease).

AB Autonomous driving in urban environments requires intelligent systems that are able to deal with complex and unpredictable scenarios. Traditional modular approaches focus on dividing the driving task into standard modules, and then use rule-based methods to connect those different modules. As such, these approaches require a significant effort to design architectures that combine all system components, and are often prone to error propagation throughout the pipeline. Recently, end-to-end autonomous driving systems have formulated the autonomous driving problem as an end-to-end learning process, with the goal of developing a policy that transforms sensory data into vehicle control commands. Despite promising results, the majority of end-to-end works in autonomous driving focus on simple driving tasks, such as lane-following, which do not fully capture the intricacies of driving in urban environments. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a detailed comparison between end-to-end autonomous driving systems that tackle urban environments. This analysis comprises two stages: a) a description of the main characteristics of the successful end-to-end approaches in urban environments; b) a quantitative comparison based on two CARLA simulator benchmarks (CoRL2017 and NoCrash). Beyond providing a detailed overview of the existent approaches, we conclude this work with the most promising aspects of end-to-end autonomous driving approaches suitable for urban environments.

DT Article
AB This paper investigates two guidance laws of standoff cooperative tracking static and moving of multiple autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles for targets from the perspective of the control system design. In the scheme of the proposed guidance laws, one vehicle is chosen as leader and others as followers. The leader only needs the measurement of the target, and the followers only measure the leader and its neighbors in the communication topology network. By using the proposed guidance laws, it is guaranteed that all vehicles can track a static or moving target with an evenly spaced formation of circle. Considering the coupling of tracking and cooperation, the stability analysis is performed by constructing two relatively independent subsystems based on Lyapunov theory, and the corresponding rigorous proofs of stability are given. By comparing with the Lyapunov vector field guidance law, the simulation results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed guidance laws.

AB Autonomous navigation has recently gained great interest in the field of reinforcement learning. However, little attention was given to the time-optimal velocity control problem, i.e. controlling a vehicle such that it travels at the maximal speed without becoming dynamically unstable (roll-over or sliding). Time optimal velocity control can be solved numerically using existing methods that are based on optimal control and vehicle dynamics. In this letter, we develop a model-based deep reinforcement learning to generate the time-optimal velocity control. Moreover, we introduce a method that uses a numerical solution that predicts whether the vehicle may become unstable and intervenes if needed. We show that our combined model outperforms several baselines as it achieves higher velocities (with only one minute of training) and does not encounter any failures during the training process.

AB Drifting is a complicated task for autonomous vehicle control. Most traditional methods in this area are based on motion equations derived by the understanding of vehicle dynamics, which is difficult to be modeled precisely. We propose a robust drift controller without explicit motion equations, which is based on the latest model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm soft actor-critic. The drift control problem is formulated as a trajectory following task, where the error-based state and reward are designed. After being trained on tracks with different levels of difficulty, our controller is capable of making the vehicle drift through various sharp corners quickly and stably in the unseen map. The proposed controller is further shown to have excellent generalization ability, which can directly handle unseen vehicle types with different physical properties, such as mass, tire friction, etc.

DE motion planning; autonomous vehicles; racing; sampling; dynamic

AB In motion planning for autonomous racing, the challenge arises in planning smooth trajectories close to the handling limits of the vehicle with a sufficient planning horizon. Graph-based trajectory planning methods can find the global discrete-optimal solution, but they suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, to achieve low computation times despite a long planning horizon, coarse discretization and simple edges that are efficient to generate must be used. However, the resulting rough trajectories cannot reach the handling limits of the vehicle and are also difficult to track by the controller, which can lead to unstable driving behavior. In this paper, we show that the initial edges connecting the vehicle's estimated state with the actual graph are crucial for vehicle stability and race performance. We therefore propose a sampling-based approach that relies on jerk-optimal curves to generate these initial edges. The concept is introduced using a layer-based graph, but it can be applied to other graph structures as well. We describe the integration of the curves within the graph and the required adaptation to racing scenarios. Our approach enables stable driving at the handling limits and fully autonomous operation on the race track. While simulations show the comparison of our concept with an alternative approach based on uniform acceleration, we also present experimental results of a dynamic overtake with speeds up to 74 m/s on a full-size vehicle.

AB Potential fields have been integrated with local path-planning algorithms for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to tackle challenging scenarios with dense and dynamic obstacles. Most existing potential fields are isotropic without considering the traffic agent's geometric shape and could cause failures due to local minima. We propose a three-dimensional potential field (TriPField) model to overcome this drawback by integrating an ellipsoid potential field with a Gaussian velocity field (GVF). Specifically, we model the surrounding vehicles as ellipsoids in corresponding ellipsoidal coordinates, where the formulated Laplace equation is solved with boundary conditions. Meanwhile, we develop a nonparametric GVF to capture the multi-vehicle interactions and then plan the AV's velocity profiles, reducing the path search space and improving computing efficiency. Finally, a local path-planning framework with our TriPField is developed by integrating model predictive control to consider the constraints of vehicle kinematics. Our proposed approach is verified in three typical scenarios, i.e., active lane change, on-ramp merging, and car following. Experimental results show that our TriPField-based planner obtains a shorter, smoother local path with a slight jerk during control, especially in the scenarios with dense traffic flow, compared with traditional potential field-based planners. Our proposed TriPField-based planner can perform emergent obstacle avoidance for AVs with a high success rate even when the surrounding vehicles behave abnormally.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AV) are being widely tested around the world. California is one of the jurisdictions permitting extensive AV testing. Field testing resulted in approximately 0.02 AV crashes per 1,000 AV miles traveled, as well as incidents leading to driver disengagement of the AV systems. Factors related to human error, system failure, surrounding vehicles, and roadway features could cause an AV-involved crash to occur or result in pre-crash disengagement. This study focuses on AV crashes in which the AV was operating in active AV mode or shortly after the test operator had disengaged the AV to resume conventional control. AV crash data were extracted for the years 2017 to 2021 from California's AV crash database maintained by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to account for the rapid pace of AV development and focus on current causes of incidents. This paper utilized multiple statistical approaches to quantitatively investigate AV crashes and disengagement events. Investigation of latent manifest using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted and ordinal logit models and decision trees were employed in this study. EFA clarified latent variables that could identify an AV crash, in which operator involvement, incorrect maneuver decision, crash severity, and environmental conditions were the manifests obtained from the analysis. Results from the logistic regression and the decision trees showed that collision type, AV movement type, and other vehicle movement type are significant factors contributing to AV crashes.

AB This paper reviews the state of the art on autonomous vehicles as of 2017, including their impact at socio-economic, energy, safety, congestion and land-use levels. This impact study focuses on the issues that are common denominators and are bound to arise independently of regional factors, such as (but not restricted to) change to vehicle ownership patterns and driver behaviour, opportunities for energy and emissions savings, potential for accident reduction and lower insurance costs, and requalification of urban areas previously assigned to parking. The challenges that lie ahead for carmakers, law and policy makers are also explored, with an emphasis on how these challenges affect the urban infrastructure and issues they create for municipal planners and decision makers. The paper concludes with strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analysis that integrates and relates all these aspects.

ID UNDERWATER ROBOTIC VEHICLES; NETWORKS; APPROXIMATION; ALGORITHM
AB This paper describes a neuro-fuzzy controller for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) of which the dynamics are highly nonlinear, coupled, and time-varying. The neuro-fuzzy controller is based on the fuzzy membership function-based neural networks (FMFNNs) with advantages of fuzzy logics and neural networks, such as inference capability and adoption of human operators' experience with fuzzy logics, and universal approximation and learning capability with neural networks. Unlike other conventional control approaches, the presented FMFNN controller does not require any information about the system, off-line learning procedures, or human intervention to adjust parameters. On-line learning of the FMFNN controller is achieved by using an inner-loop learning scheme and simplified derivatives of the vehicle system. Simulation results show effectiveness of the FMFNN controller for AUVs. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB A control methodology for aerial or aquatic vehicles is presented that leverages intelligent distributed sensing inspired by the lateral line found in fish to directly measure the fluid forces acting on the vehicle. As a result, the complex robot control problem is effectively simplified to that of a rigid body in a vacuum. Furthermore, by sensing these forces, they can be compensated for immediately, rather than after they have displaced the vehicle. We have created a sensory shell around a prototype autonomous underwater vehicle, derived algorithms to remove static pressure and calculate total force from the discrete measurements using a fitting technique that filters sensor error, and validated the control methodology on a vehicle in the presence of multiple fluid disturbances. This sensing control scheme reduces position tracking errors by as much as 72% compared to a standard position error feedback controller.
   Accurate manoeuvring of autonomous aerial and aquatic robots requires detailed knowledge of the fluid forces, which can be challenging especially in turbulent water or air. A control method for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) uses intelligent distributed sensing inspired by fish 'lateral line' sensing. This is used by many species of fish to feel the flow around them and respond instantly, before they are displaced by disturbances. An AUV designed with such a sensory shell similarly compensates for disturbances and has improved position tracking.

AB The inevitable transition from conventional to self-driving vehicles is a large-scale process involving a series of interactions and related to major challenges for human society. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) considered as a future of road transport, have the potential to significantly reduce transport costs, improve road safety by significantly reducing road accidents and fatalities, make vehicles more environmentally friendly, reduce the travel time and increase the number of passengers. Taking into account all the benefits of AVs, the rapid development of AVs in all countries is becoming a very important factor. This research considers the assessment of the households welfare influence on the development of AVs. To ensure realistic future scenarios modelling was supported by empirical data. The obtained modelling results made it possible to predict a significant reduction in traffic accidents and environmental pollution, and to consider some policy recommendations to promote the development and a broader range introduction of AVs. The method of agent-based modelling was used to develop the market penetration simulation, which allowed quantifying consumer motives and opportunities in choosing AVs, the development trends of AVs, and providing policy recommendations not only for aggregated country level situations, but for households and individuals as well. The proposed model and results may be useful for planners and researchers working on long-term solutions related to safer and less polluting AVs and predicting purchasing behaviour of households.

AB A proof of concept and validation mission was conducted by ConocoPhillips to test the ability of autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs) to (1) collect and validate metocean data, (2) monitor loop and eddy currents, and (3) detect surface oil slicks with accompanying in-situ measurements. During this mission, four AMVs, two equipped with meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) sensors and two equipped with hydrocarbon (SEEP) sensors, were deployed. The METOC vehicles were equipped with Teledyne RDI Workhorse acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) and were launched to monitor and delineate eddy current features at near-surface depths in the vicinity of the ConocoPhillips asset, Magnolia platform in the Gulf of Mexico. The SEEP vehicles monitored areas identified with natural seep-related hydrocarbon surface expressions. With respect to mission objectives, the sensors were deployed in challenging oceanographic conditions, thus reducing demands on people and large vessels. Mission-based statistics per vehicle were gathered and tabulated capturing the total days at sea (59 days), distance traveled (881.45-1526.49 nautical miles), and average speed (0.66-1.08 knots) for validation of AMV as a platform. The mission showed a novel way of using technology that is safe and environmentally friendly and at a lower price point than traditional data acquisition methods. The AMV, hence, provides a substantial competitive advantage to acquiring data in a safe, reliable manner with greater operational efficiencies.

AB Optimal design of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) consists of various subsystems and disciplines such as guidance and control, payload, hydrodynamics, power and propulsion, sizing, structure, trajectory and performance. The designed vehicle is also employed in an operational environment with tactical parameters such as distance to target, uncertainty in estimation of target position and target velocity. Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) is the best way for finding both optimum and feasible designs. In this paper, a new optimization design framework is proposed in which Multidisciplinary Feasible (MDF) as MDO framework and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as optimizer were combined together for optimal and feasible conceptual design of an AUV. Initially, we found an optimal system design by using MDF-PSO methodology in engineering space for any single tactical situation (locally tactical parameters). Then the optimal off-design AUVs in tactical subspaces were found by minimizing the difference between the locally optimized objective function and suboptimal objective function. In this framework, we have shown that not only is the tactical situation affected by AUV design parameters, but an optimal AUV for each tactical regions are also found.

AB The development of autonomous surface vehicles, such as the Boeing Liquid Robotics Wave Glider, has revolutionized our ability to collect surface ocean-lower atmosphere observations, a crucial step toward developing better physical understanding of upper-ocean and air-sea interaction processes. However, due to the wave-following nature of these vehicles, they experience rapid shifting, rolling, and pitching under the action of surface waves, making motion compensation of observations of ocean currents particularly challenging. We present an evaluation of the accuracy of Wave Glider-based ADCP measurements by comparing them with coincident and collocated observations collected from a bottom-mounted ADCP over the course of a week-long experiment. A novel motion compensation method, tailored to wave-following surface vehicles, is presented and compared with standard approaches. We show that the use of an additional position and attitude sensor (GPS/IMU) significantly improves the accuracy of the observed currents.

ID TRACKING
AB This paper develops a novel integrated collision avoidance strategy for autonomous vehicles in an emergency based on steering and braking. Specifically, the framework of the collision avoidance strategy is composed of two parts: an up-level decision-making layer and a low-level controller layer. The purpose of the up-level is to select the appropriate control strategy based on the vehicle information, and the low-level is to drive the vehicle according to the instructions generated by the up-level. More concretely, a novel control strategy is proposed by integrating four-wheel steering, active rear steering, and differential braking with guaranteed path-tracking accuracy and driving stability by adaptive model predictive control (AMPC). Finally, extensive co-simulations in MATLAB/Simulink and CarSim are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed collision avoidance strategy in terms of tracking error, yaw rate, and roll angle.

ID MODEL
AB We present a framework for autonomous driving which can learn from human demonstrations, and we apply it to the longitudinal control of an autonomous car. Offline, we model car-following strategies from a set of example driving sequences. Online, the model is used to compute accelerations which replicate what a human driver would do in the same situation. This reference acceleration is tracked by a predictive controller which enforces a set of comfort and safety constraints before applying the final acceleration. The controller is designed to be robust to the uncertainty in the predicted motion of the preceding vehicle. In addition, we estimate the confidence of the driver model predictions and use it in the cost function of the predictive controller. As a result, we can handle cases where the training data used to learn the driver model does not provide sufficient information about how a human driver would handle the current driving situation. The approach is validated using a combination of simulations and experiments on our autonomous vehicle.

AB Internet of Things(IoT) facilitates key technologies that rely on sensing, communication and processing in daily routines. As an IoT-enabled paradigm, mobile crowdsensing (MCS) can offer more possibilities for data collection to support various IoT applications and services. As an extension, MCS can be used for data gathering amid COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Bridging Artificial Intelligence and IoT can achieve not only maintaining low infection rates of COVID-19 but can also facilitate an effective rapid testing strategy to reduce community spread. In this research, an intelligent strategy to deploy autonomous vehicle-based mobile testing facilities is proposed to enable early detection of infected cases based upon MCS data acquired through smart devices via wireless communications such as Wifi, LTE and 5G. To this end, a Self Organizing Feature Map is designed to manage MCS-based data for planning of the autonomous mobile assessment centers. Pre-identified zero-day locations and worst-case scenario are considered to determine the best combination for MCS participation rate and budget limitations. Numerical results demonstrate that once 30% of MCS participants are recruited, it becomes possible to cover the pre-identified zero-day locations and enable detection of infected cases under the worst case scenario to determine the AV routes more efficiently than other options for a certain number of neurons in SOFM. The worst-case scenario demonstrates that 30% participant rate ensures detection of infected cases in 27 days for 81 stops even infected cases are outside of the autonomous vehicle testing coverage.

ID STRATEGIES
AB Autonomous vehicle requires a general planner for all possible scenarios. Existing researches design such a planner by a unified scenario description. However, it may significantly increase the planner complexity even in some simple tasks, e.g., car following, further resulting in unsatisfactory driving performance. This work aims to design a general planner which can 1) drive in all possible scenarios and 2) have lower complexity in some common scenarios. To this end, this work proposes a pertinent boundary for multi-scenario driving planning. The total approach is named as Pertinent Boundary-based Unified Decision system. Based on the original drivable area, the pertinent boundary can further support motion status and semantics of the traffic elements, which provides the potential of pertinent performance for given scenarios. The pertinent boundary can support unified driving with the drivable area, in the meantime, can be pertinently modified to support the pertinent driving decisions for identified driving scenarios (e.g., car-following, junction left turning). It will further avoid the bump between the connections of the scenarios due to the continuity of space boundary. Thus, the planner is suitable for the fully autonomous driving. The proposed method is validated in different classical driving decision scenarios. Results show that the proposed method can support pertinent driving decisions in identified scenarios, in the meantime, assure generalized cross-scenario planning when no scenario information is available. Such a method shed light on fully autonomous driving by pertinence improvement of multi-scenario decision in the complex real world.

AB This paper presents an autonomous vehicle's path planning and tracking system optimized for collision avoidance on slippery roads. During path planning, a path that can induce the maximum possible lateral acceleration is generated through the fifth-order spline in consideration of the tire-road friction. The generated path is tracked based on the model predictive control (MPC), and the nonlinearity generated by the tire and low friction surface is reflected through the extended bicycle model and the combined brushed tire model. Inside the controller, a new type of yaw rate constraint considering side-slip angles is utilized to prevent the vehicle from becoming unstable on slippery roads and maximize lateral maneuver of the vehicle at the same time. The proposed system is verified by the vehicle dynamics software CarSim, and the simulation results show that it significantly increases the possibility of collision avoidance in slippery road conditions.

The proposed architecture explores the use of the Android-based Control Ecosystem, which integrates the Operating System Android, as part of the open-source control of the vehicle. The objective of this work is to design a platform that enables connectivity with the cloud for monitoring and remote controlling purposes. Results are reported about the feasibility of sending and storing information and in general interacting with a remote server. Vehicle control signals and sensor data were shared remotely at a rate of 200ms per cycle. The data sent for storage in the cloud reconstructed very well the signals, with no data loss, proving its potential for monitoring purposes. This work also presents a brief discussion about the weakness and strengths of the concept, and the future work toward the potential impact and integration with autonomous driving.

AB Vehicle autonomous present a major important problem for modem commercialized four wheel drive electric vehicle (4WDEV) propulsion system. The supply of electric vehicles with batteries is limited by state of charge (SOC) and the type of batteries technologies used. To overcome problem of energy variation in several speed and road topology condition, the proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) is presented as best solution of energy management. In this paper we focus the behavior of PEMFC for 4WDEV controlled by direct torque control based space vector modulation (SVM-DTC). The proposed controller law is very appropriate to electric traction systems. To test the performances of PEMFC, we undergo 4WDEV to several tests. Direct torque control based on space vector modulation (SVM-DTC) is proposed. The Obtained results under Matlab/Simulink present satisfactory. The DTC-SVM law increases the utility 4WDEV autonomous under several scenario considerations. Moreover, the future industrial's vehicle must take into considerations the obtained results into design steps. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Automated vehicles are expected to influence human drivers' behavior. Accordingly, capturing such changes is critical for planning and operation purposes. With regard to car-following behavior, a key question is whether existing car-following models can replicate these changes in human behavior. Using a data set that was collected from the car-following behavior of human drivers when following automated vehicles, this paper offers a robust methodology based on the concept of dynamic time warping to investigate the critical parameters that can be used to capture changes in human behavior. The results indicate that spacing can best substantiate such changes. Moreover, calibration and validation of the intelligent driver model (IDM) suggest its inability to capture changes in human behavior in response to automated vehicles. Thus, an extension of the IDM that explicitly models stochasticity in the behavior of individual drivers is applied, and the results show such a model can identify a reduction in uncertainty when following an automated vehicle. This finding also has implications for a stochastic extension to other models when analyzing and simulating a mixed-autonomy traffic flow environment.

AB This paper proposes a novel system to inspect the LiDAR sensor misalignment on a vehicle during the sensor assembly process in the autonomous vehicle productions. The inspection system is primarily designed for deployment in the factory-level assembly process for commercial vehicles with ADAS and autonomous driving functions. To obtain sub-degree and millimeter accuracy levels of the LiDAR sensor alignment or the extrinsic pose from the vehicle body, this study proposed a new concept of LiDAR sensor extrinsic calibration method using a target board with embedded photodetector(PD) arrays, named the PD-target system. Furthermore, the proposed system requires only the simple design of the target board at the fixed pose in a close range to be readily applicable in the automobile manufacturing environment. From the estimation of the extrinsic pose of the LiDAR sensor from the target board, the LiDAR sensor alignment with respect to the vehicle body can be easily derived in the controlled factory environment, where positions of both the target board and the vehicle are assumed to be known. The experimental evaluation of the proposed system on low-resolution LiDAR sensor showed that the LiDAR sensor offset pose can be estimated within 0.1 degree and 3 mm levels of precision. The high accuracy and simplicity of the proposed calibration system make it practical for production of reliable and safe autonomous transportation.

AB The aim of the study is to define and mathematically describe the universal IDM. An important result of this research is that the model uses a single system of differential equations. It is able to simultaneously describe the dynamic operations of the IDM systems for all different vehicle sequences. The aim of the study is to support the driving of autonomous vehicles by taking into account the dynamic variations in the state characteristics of traffic processes. The approach used is motivated by important issues in current modelling techniques that address significant economic problems in the application of large-scale ITS network models. This also points to a new opportunity in the key area of vehicle traffic management, in the related targeted fundamental research, particularly in the analysis of traffic processes in large-scale dynamic networks.

ID DESIGN; CHALLENGES; DYNAMICS; FIELD
AB This paper presents detailed mathematical modeling, controller design, and flight test results for the autonomous mission of a nonconventional fixed-wing biplane micro air vehicle (MAV) called Skylark having span and chord length within 150 mm. Although numerous fixed-wing MAV designs are reported in the open literature, an MAV's reliable autonomous flight is still a challenge. The primary difficulties in performing the autonomous mission of fixed-wing MAV are system integration within the weight and power budget, center of gravity (CG) management, and flight controller design for fast dynamics. In this paper, the key challenges are addressed by using the higher payload capacity of Skylark, suitable selection and design of avionics components, and design of controller after detailed development of the mathematical model, including the additional effect of propeller wash and motor countertorque. An autonomous flight test is successfully demonstrated after the validation of algorithms and software architecture through nonlinear six-degrees-of-freedom simulation. The detailed design and development approach will increase the MAV's performance and reliability in civil and military applications. (C) 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB In this paper, RBF neural network consensus-based distributed control scheme is proposed for nonholonomic autonomous vehicles in a pre-defined formation along the specified reference trajectory. A variable transformation is first designed to convert the formation control problem into a state consensus problem. Then, the complete dynamics of the vehicles including inertia, Coriolis, friction model and unmodeled bounded disturbances are considered, which lead to the formation unstable when the distributed kinematic controllers are proposed based on the kinematics. RBF neural network torque controllers are derived to compensate for them. Some sufficient conditions are derived to accomplish the asymptotically stability of the systems based on algebraic graph theory, matrix theory, and Lyapunov theory. Finally, simulation examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID VEHICLE DETECTION
AB Future self-driving cars and current ones with advanced driver assistance systems are expected to interact with other traffic participants, which often are multiple other vehicles. Object vehicle tracking forms a key part of resolving this interaction. Furthermore, descriptions of the vehicle group behaviors, like group formations or splits, can enhance the utility of the tracking information for further motion planning and control decisions. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic method to estimate the formation and evolution, including splitting, re-grouping, and so on, of object vehicle groups and the membership conditions for individual object vehicles forming the groups. A Bayesian estimation approach is used to first estimate the states of the individual vehicles in the presence of uncertainties due to sensor imperfections and other disturbances acting on the individual object vehicles. The closeness of the individual vehicles in both their positions and velocity is then evaluated by a probabilistic collision condition. Based on this, a density-based clustering approach is applied to identify the vehicle groups as well as the identity of the individual vehicles in each group. An estimation of the state of the group as well as of the group boundary is also given. Finally, detailed numerical experiments are included, including one on real-time traffic intersection data, to illustrate the workings and the performance of the proposed approach. The potential application of the approach in motion planning of autonomous vehicles is also highlighted.

AB Vehicles in the platoon can sufficiently incorporate the information via V2X communication to plan ecological speed trajectories and pass the intersection smoothly. Most existing eco-driving studies mainly focus on the optimal control of a single vehicle at an individual signalized intersection, while rarely involving the cooperative optimization of a group of vehicles at successive signalized intersections. In this study, a hierarchical cooperative eco-driving control for a connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) platoon is proposed to enhance traffic mobility and energy efficiency, wherein the velocity trajectory of the leading vehicle at each isolated signalized intersection is planned using the pseudo-spectral method, and then the cooperative optimization of following vehicles in the platoon is conducted via rolling optimization, with the aim of improving driving comfort, safety and energy economy for the platoon. The simulation results highlight that the proposed hierarchical cooperative eco-driving strategy can lead to preferable vehicle-following behaviours and platoon driving performance, and the overall energy consumption and trip time of vehicle platoon are respectively reduced by 26.10% and 2.83%, compared with that under manual driving. Furthermore, the overall energy economy is promoted by 4.95% and 4.60%, compared with cooperative adaptive cruise control and intelligent driver model-based platoon control strategies.

AB In this paper, a collision-free navigation method for a group of autonomous wheeled vehicles is investigated. The position and orientation information of individual vehicles is transformed to navigation variables, which are the distance left to the goal position, the angle made by the orientation of the vehicle at the goal position and the vehicle-to-target (v-to-t) vector, and the angle made by the heading direction of the vehicle and the v-to-t vector. As a Lyapunov function for deriving a smooth control law that drives all the vehicles from an initial configuration to a goal configuration, a new navigation function that incorporates the squared norm of the navigation variables, the boundaries of collision-free areas, and the angles made by the vehicle heading direction and the vehicle-to-obstacle (v-to-o) vectors is proposed. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is proved. The effectiveness of the developed algorithm is illustrated through three simulations (three vehicles in a free environment, three vehicles in the presence of a static obstacle, and eight vehicles operating along a corridor) and two experiments (static and moving obstacles avoidance). The proposed algorithm has been implemented on a real forklift and the navigation of the forklift from an arbitrary initial configuration to a goal configuration while avoiding collisions has been demonstrated.

TI GAP-MM: 5G-Enabled Real-Time Autonomous Vehicle Platoon Membership
   Management Based on Blockchain
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS

ID ENABLED INTERNET; COMMUNICATION
AB Autonomous Vehicle Platoon (AVP) is the most anticipated application of 5G ultrareliable and low latency communications. By joining the preexisting platoon to form the real-time AVP (RAVP), individual vehicles could gain benefits such as fuel consumption reduction and traffic safety enhancement. Unlike the scheduled AVP which only contains fixed vehicles, members in RAVP change frequently since individual vehicles would want to join or leave the platoon any time. Besides, malicious vehicles may attempt to sneak into the RAVP and try to manipulate the platoon. Public key cryptography and access control mechanisms can be adopted to create a relatively isolated area for communication inside the platoon. Nevertheless, there exist few works that take into account the regulation of the dynamic change members in RAVP. In this paper, we propose a membership management scheme for 5G-enabled RAVP by integrating revocable attribute-based encryption (RABE) and blockchain, namely, GAP-MM. It realizes fine-grained access control of key distribution and malicious vehicle's key revocation efficiently. The sufficient evaluations and security analysis indicate that GAP-MM is practical for RAVP scenario in terms of both efficiency and security.

AB This paper presents a joint optimization of the timetable, bus formation, and vehicle scheduling in a flexible public transport (PT) system that utilizes autonomous modular vehicles (AMVs). In this system, AMVs have the capability to detach or join with each other at intermediate stops along the route to dynamically adjust the bus formation (capacity). To increase vehicle utilization, a flexible scheduling strategy is proposed that allows AMVs to detach from one modular bus and join another modular bus in either direction of a bidirectional line. In particular, the penalty cost for each detachment or joining operation, as well as the limited number of available AMVs is explicitly considered. We formulate a unified model for the integrated optimization of the modular bus service (timetable and bus formation) and vehicle scheduling by introducing two types of decision variables. The objective is to minimize overall system costs, including passenger waiting time cost, operational costs, and detachment/joining penalty costs. The two types of decision variables are coupled by a vehicle resource consistency constraint, ensuring the con-formity of the modular bus service and vehicle scheduling decisions. To tackle the complexity of our model, the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is employed to decompose it into two subproblems, which can be efficiently solved using a customized forward dynamic programming algorithm and a commercial solver. The model is validated using illustrative ex-amples and a real-world instance from the Beijing Public Transport system, and it is compared with two benchmark models. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of the ADMM-based solution framework for solving the integrated optimization model. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the use of AMVs in PT systems can lead to reduced overall system costs and increased vehicle utilization.

AB Urban autonomous driving is both complex and dangerous. A multitude of road types, road users, and potential traffic rule violations all make it challenging for an autonomous vehicle to safely navigate an urban environment. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose a risk assessment framework capable of reliably predicting and assessing the possibility of collision in urban environments involving the concurrent occurrence of various road types, road users, and traffic rule violations. The proposed framework reliably predicts and assesses the possibility of collision by means of long-term motion prediction-based risk identification, unified risk measures, and probabilistic risk reasoning under a distributed reasoning architecture. The framework is tested and evaluated through real-world testing conducted not only on private urban test roads under a great variety of driving scenarios but also on public urban roads under real traffic conditions. Experimental results show the performance of the framework to be sufficiently reliable for urban autonomous driving in terms of risk assessment.

AB There are many constraints to be considered to plan a safe and feasible trajectory for autonomous mining trucks due to the rough terrain in open-pit mines. It is difficult to handle these constraints uniformly within a trajectory planning framework. To overcome this limitation, a novel trajectory planning framework is proposed in this paper. Different from many existing studies which characterized the spatial positions of vehicles at the sampling time points as decision variables, we characterize the time points at the sampling spatial positions as decision variables to conveniently address the terrain constraints. Based on such a formulation, we further consider the kinematic constraints, engine power constraints and time window constraints. Various objectives (e.g., transport efficiency, fuel economy) can be considered in this trajectory planning framework, and the formulated trajectory planning problems can be efficiently solved. Finally, several case studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory planning framework.

AB Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is the integrated and on-demand offering of new mode-sharing transport schemes, such as ride-share, car-share or car-pooling. MaaS schemes may solve some of the most pressing mobility problems in large conurbations like London. However, MaaS schemes pose significant implementation challenges for operators and city authorities alike. With the existing transport and traffic planning tools, even basic questions do not have easy answers: e.g. how many vehicles are needed; how should they be deployed; what infrastructure changes are needed, and what will happen with congestion? This paper reports on the novel integration, through co-simulation of two independent agent-based simulators: MATSim and IMSim. MATSim generates realistic transport demand for a city: allocating travellers to the best mobility option according to their preferences; while IMSim provides a highly realistic operational execution of autonomous and manually driven transport fleets. We show how the simulation tools complement each other to deliver a superior Autonomous Mobility on Demand (AMoD) modelling capability. By combining the two, we can evaluate the impact of diverse AMoD scenarios from different standpoints: from a traveller's perspective (e.g. satisfaction, service level, etc.); from an operator's perspectives (e.g. cost, revenue, etc.); and from a city's perspective (e.g. congestion, significant shifts between transport modes, etc.). The coupled simulation methods have underpinned the extensive MERGE Greenwich project investigation into the challenges of offering ride-share services in autonomous vehicles in the Royal Borough of Greenwich (London, UK) for travellers, service-operators, the city, and vehicle manufacturers.

AB The automobile industry has developed dramatically in recent years, the supply of vehicles has also increased, and thus it has become deeply established in everyday life. Recently, as the supply of vehicles with autonomous driving functions increases, the safety of vehicles is also an emerging issue. Various car-following models for the safe driving of vehicles have long been studied by various people, and recently, a Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) model has been proposed by Mobileye. However, in existing car-following models or the RSS model, the safe distance between vehicles is presented using only vehicle speed and acceleration information, so there is a limitation in that it cannot respond to changes in road conditions due to the weather. In this paper, in order to ensure safety when the RSS model is applied to a variable focus function camera, an improved RSS model is presented in consideration of the changes in road conditions due to changes in weather, and a safety distance is derived based on the proposed model.

AB Safety guidelines for autonomous vehicles (AVs) in many regions or countries require AV service providers to have the means to communicate with vehicles and the ability to stop them safely in case of emergencies. The transition to full deployment of AV services is dependent on more advanced monitoring methods. This study uses a survey of approximately 2000 residents of Japanese cities to investigate how monitoring methods affect their intentions to use these services. In particular, the survey is designed to understand how individuals react to unattended operations and remote monitoring in road passenger services including buses and taxis; the survey includes direct questions about intentions to use autonomous buses and taxis and a stated choice experiment based on the respondents' preferences over their current mode of transportation and autonomous taxis. The results show that monitoring methods have mixed impacts. On one hand, monitoring could affect the general acceptance of AV services. The difference in the overall resistance to using these services is particularly large between the onboard human and remote monitoring options. Individuals tend to express stronger resistance to more advanced remote monitoring. On the other hand, the stated choice results show that the effects of these monitoring factors could be less significant in the actual settings of transportation mode choices; the effects of travel cost and time factors are likely to be more significant. These results suggest that when individuals consider AVs in the context of real-world decisions, their resistance to new technologies is diminished in comparison to their responses to abstract questions.

AB In this paper, a novel multirate lane-keeping system (LKS) is introduced by using a kinematic-based model considering a look-ahead distance. First, we developed a kinematic lateral motion model for LKS with respect to the road. To increase a system damping of vehicle, the unique look-ahead output measurement matrix was introduced. The decentralized multirate lane-keeping control scheme with a multirate Kalman filter was also applied to resolve the asynchronous and irregular sampling time of multi sensors in autonomous vehicles. We validated the performance of the proposed kinematic-based multirate LKS using the dynamic vehicle solver CarSim, MATLAB/Simulink, and electric power steering hardware-in-the-loop system. Experimental validation was also conducted using a real test vehicle. Both simulation and experimental results showed that the proposed kinematic-based LKS performed lane-keeping capability comparable to that of dynamic-based LKS. In particular, the experimental results showed that the proposed method, compared to a human driver, can also maintain the lane within reasonable specifications. The experimental validation was performed at vehicle speeds of up to 120 km/h.

TI Nonholonomic Source Seeking With Tuning of Angular Velocity
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL
LA English
DT Article
DE Nonholonomic unicycle
AB We consider the problem of seeking the source of a scalar signal using an autonomous vehicle modeled as the nonholonomic unicycle. The vehicle does not have the capability of sensing its position or the position of the source but is capable of sensing the scalar signal originating from the source. The signal field is assumed to decay away from the position of the source but the vehicle does not have the knowledge of the functional form of the field. We employ extremum seeking to steer the vehicle to the source. Our control strategy keeps the forward velocity constant and tunes the angular velocity, a setting suitable for most autonomous vehicles, including aerial ones. Because of the constant forward velocity constraint, after it has converged near the source, the vehicle exhibits extremely interesting and complex motions. Using averaging theory, we prove local exponential convergence to an "orbit-like" attractor around the source. We also present a thorough analysis of non-local behaviors and attractors that the vehicle can exhibit near the source. The richness and complexity of behaviors makes only some of them amenable to analysis, whereas others are illustrated through a carefully laid out simulation study.

AB This article provides a general overview of the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) research thrusts being pursued within the Perceptual Robotics Laboratory (PeRL) at the University of Michigan. Founded in 2007, PeRL's research centers on improving AUV autonomy via algorithmic advancements in environmentally based perceptual feedback for real-time mapping, navigation, and control. Our three major research areas are (1) real-time visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), (2) cooperative multi-vehicle navigation, and (3) perceptiondriven control. Pursuant to these research objectives, PeRL has developed a new multi-AUV SLAM testbed based upon a modified Ocean-Server Iver2 AUV platform. PeRL upgraded the vehicles with additional navigation and perceptual sensors for underwater SLAM research. In this article, we detail our testbed development, provide an overview of our major research thrusts, and put into context how our modified AUV testbed enables experimental real-world validation of these algorithms.

AB This paper presents a manned-vehicle/unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) mission system that enables an operator in a manned aircraft to issue mission level commands to an autonomous aircraft in real time. A natural language interface allows the manned and unmanned vehicle to communicate in languages understood by both agents. A task scheduler transforms the commands into a dynamic mission plan consisting of task waypoints. These are then given to a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)-based trajectory optimizer, which safely guides the vehicle through a partially known environment in real time. The MILP trajectory planning formulation and its implementation are discussed in detail. Integrated simulation and June 2004 flight-test results that used an F-15 and an autonomous T-33 equipped with Boeing's unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) avionics package are. presented. These activities were part of the Capstone Demonstration of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency-sponsored Software Enabled Control effort. The flight tests mark the first time that an onboard MILP-based guidance system was used to control a UAV They also mark the first time that a natural language interface was used by a manned vehicle to task a UAV in real time.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have great potential to improve road transportation systems. Most existing strategies for CAVs' longitudinal control focus on downstream traffic conditions, but neglect the impact of CAVs' behaviors on upstream traffic flow. In this paper, we introduce a notion of Leading Cruise Control (LCC), in which the CAV maintains car-following operations adapting to the states of its preceding vehicles, and also aims to lead the motion of its following vehicles. Specifically, by controlling the CAV, LCC aims to attenuate downstream traffic perturbations and smooth upstream traffic flow actively. We first present the dynamical modeling of LCC, with a focus on three fundamental scenarios: car-following, free-driving, and Connected Cruise Control. Then, the analysis of controllability, observability, and head-to-tail string stability reveals the feasibility and potential of LCC in improving mixed traffic flow performance. Extensive numerical studies validate that the capability of CAVs in dissipating traffic perturbations is further strengthened when incorporating the information of the vehicles behind into the CAVs' control.

AB While a computerized simulation can be useful to gather user inputs during the new service development (NSD) process, it requires the active involvement of users/customers and can be costly and time-consuming compared to other practices such as surveys, focus groups, and interviews. However, when the service is rendered in the machine-to-machine (M2M) environment, the NSD process can exploit a simulation platform to assess service alternatives without customer involvement. This article contributes to the NSD research by identifying the services in the M2M environment as the suitable application area where a simulation platform can be effectively and efficiently implemented for data collection and analysis. We consider the autonomous charging service to demonstrate how a simulation-based analytical framework can help developing a new service in the M2M environment. As the electric vehicle (EV) industry has been evolving tremendously over the past decade, it becomes necessary to undertake significant modernization and autonomy adoption in the future charging infrastructure. Since the currently deployed charging infrastructure has not been designed to service autonomous EVs (AEVs) in an unsupervised manner, service plans to upgrade this infrastructure need to be developed to serve AEVs without any human intervention. Numerical experiments demonstrate how the simulation platform helps analyze autonomous charging station alternatives, provides recommendations for operational decisions, and creates a potential value for stakeholders and businesses during the NSD process.

AB Construction site preparation tasks rely on experienced operators and heavy machinery for clearing debris, earthmoving, leveling, and soil stabilization. These actions require complex collaboration between human teams to survey the site, estimate the material condition, and guide the operators accordingly. In recent years there has been a critical labor shortage due to increasing demands in construction. Integrating autonomous systems can mitigate this gap by replacing traditional methods with robotic solutions. However, while ideal conditions for automatic systems are static and highly controlled, construction sites are dynamic and unstructured environments. The ability of autonomous systems to overcome these conditions during outdoor construction site preparation tasks relies on their capacity to map the material on-site and continuously perform localization. This study suggests a solution to these problems by collaborating between an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV). In this method, the UAV produces a material map and monitors the UGV's location relative to known static landmarks. These measurements are then sent to the ground vehicle and are added to the onboard sensors using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) approach. Thus, the UAV enhances the operation of the UGV by providing an accurate localization and mapping from the air and allowing it to perform a site-preparation task beyond mere sensing. This approach is examined with simulation and validated by outdoor experiments. Additionally, this method is integrated within Shepherd, a custom-developed plugin for computer-aided design applications.

AB Classical artificial potential approach of motion planning is extended for emulating human driving behaviour in two dimensions. Different stimulus parameters including type of ego-vehicle, type of obstacles, relative velocity, relative acceleration, and lane offset are used. All the surrounding vehicles are considered to influence drivers' decisions. No emphasis is laid on vehicle control; instead, an ego vehicle is assumed to reach the desired state. The study is on human-like driving behaviour modelling. The developed motion planning algorithm formulates repulsive and attractive potentials in a data-driven way in contrast to the classical arbitrary formulation. Interaction between the stimulus parameters is explicitly considered by using multivariate cumulative distribution functions. Comparison of two-dimensional (lateral and longitudinal) performance indicators with a baseline model and generative adversarial networks indicate the effectiveness and suitability of the developed motion planning algorithm in the mixed traffic environment.

With this paper, we propose a novel data-driven algorithm for AUVs team for adaptive sampling of oceanic regions, where each agent shares its knowledge of the environment with its teammates and autonomously takes decision in order to reconstruct the desired oceanic field. In particular, sampling point selection is made in order to minimize the uncertainty in the estimated field while keeping communication contact with the rest of the team and avoiding to repeatedly sampling sub-regions already explored. The proposed approach is based on the use of the emergent behaviour technique and on the use of artificial potential functions (interest functions) to achieve the desired goal at the end of the mission. In this way, there is no explicit minimization of a cost functional at each decision step. The oceanic field is reconstructed by the application of radial basis functions interpolation of irregularly spaced data. A simulative example for the estimation of a salinity field with sea data obtained using the Mediterranean Sea Forecasting System is shown in the paper, in order to investigate the effect of the different uncertainty sources, including sea currents, on the behaviour of the exploration team and ultimately on the reconstruction of the salinity field.

AB The formulation of the current geometric design standard for freeways considers the influence of the "human-vehicles-road-environment" system. In the fully autonomous environment, the driver has been liberated from the system, which means that the influence of "human" will be reduced. The requirements or limitations of the freeway geometric design standard, which consider the driver's psychological and physical factors in the traditional driving environment, can be more flexible in the fully automatic driving environment. By using the methods of comparative analysis, theoretical analysis, and theoretical calculation, this article researches the geometric design standard for freeways in an autonomous driving environment from four aspects: control elements of geometric design, horizontal alignment, vertical alignment, and cross-section elements. The main contribution of this article is to propose the recommended values of the geometric design standard for freeways in a fully autonomous driving environment, which can provide reference for the formulation of relevant standards or specifications for autonomous driving roads in the future.

TI Signal Timing Optimization with Connected Vehicle Technology: Platooning
   to Improve Computational Efficiency
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID INTERSECTION CONTROL; TRAFFIC CONTROL
AB This paper develops a real-time traffic signal optimization algorithm in the presence of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). The proposed algorithm leverages information from connected vehicles (CVs) arriving at an intersection to identify naturally occurring platoons that consist of both CVs and non-CVs. Signal timings are then selected to optimize the sequence at which these platoons are allowed to discharge through the intersection to minimize total vehicle delay. Longitudinal trajectory guidance that explicitly accounts for vehicle acceleration and deceleration behavior is provided to the lead autonomous vehicle (AV) in any platoon to minimize the total number of stopping maneuvers performed by all vehicles. Simulation tests reveal that the proposed platoon-based algorithm provides superior computational savings (over 95%) compared with a previously developed algorithm that focuses on optimizing departure sequences of individual vehicles, with negligible changes in operational performance. The computational savings allow the platoon-based algorithm to accommodate intersections with four multi-lane approaches and left turns, whereas large computational costs limited the previous vehicle-based algorithm to only two single-lane approaches without conflicting left turns. Additional simulation tests of the platoon-based algorithm on these more realistic intersection configurations show that intersection performance increases as the penetration rate of CAVs in the vehicle fleet increases. However, the marginal benefits decrease rapidly after the fleet is composed of 40% CAVs.

ID CRUISE CONTROL; FRAMEWORK
AB Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) for human and autonomous self-driving aims to achieve active safe driving that avoids vehicle accidents or traffic jam by exchanging the road traffic information (e.g., traffic flow, traffic density, velocity variation, etc.) among neighbor vehicles. However, in CACC, the butterfly effect is encountered while exhibiting asynchronous brakes that easily lead to backward shock-waves and are difficult to remove. Several critical issues should be addressed in CACC, including (i) difficulties with adaptive steering of the inter-vehicle distances among neighbor vehicles and the vehicle speed, (ii) the butterfly effect, (iii) unstable vehicle traffic flow, etc. To address the above issues in CACC, this paper proposes the mobile edge computing-based vehicular cloud of the cooperative adaptive driving (CAD) approach to avoid shock-waves efficiently in platoon driving. Numerical results demonstrate that the CAD approach outperforms the compared techniques in the number of shock-waves, average vehicle velocity, average travel time and time to collision (TTC). Additionally, the adaptive platoon length is determined according to the traffic information gathered from the global and local clouds.

AB The research presented in this paper approaches the issue of navigation using an automated guided vehicle (AGV) in industrial environments. The work describes the navigation system of a flexible AGV intended for operation in partially structured warehouses and with frequent changes in the floor plant layout. This is achieved by incorporating a high degree of on-board autonomy and by decreasing the amount of manual work required by the operator when establishing the a priori knowledge of the environment. The AGV's autonomy consists of the set of automatic tasks, such as planner, perception, path planning and path tracking, that the industrial vehicle must perform to accomplish the task required by the operator. The integration of these techniques has been tested in a real AGV working on an industrial warehouse environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes risk-informed decision-making and control methods for autonomous vehicles (AVs) under severe driving conditions, where many vehicle interactions occur on slippery roads. We assume that the AV should approach a specific safe zone in case of vehicle malfunctioning. In normal situations, the driving behavior of the AV is based on the deterministic finite-state machine (FSM) that makes an appropriate realtime decision depending on the driving condition, which is efficient when compared with some conventional decision-making algorithms; alternatively, in emergency situations, the AV first has to be prevented the rear end conflicts while the specific safe zone is simultaneously determined by evaluating the level of risk via two safety level indicators, i.e., Time-To-Collision (TTC) and Deceleration Rate to Avoid the Crash (DRAC). The safe path that guides the AV to avoid car crashes is generated based on the trajectory optimization theory (i.e., Pontryagin maximum principle), and the AV follows it based on the linear time-varying model predictive control (LTV-MPC), which ensures the AV's lateral stability. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed decision-making and control strategies in various test scenarios, and the results show that the AV behaves appropriately according to the behaviors of surrounding vehicles and road condition.

AB In this work, we improve the semantic segmentation of multi-layer top-view grid maps in the context of LiDAR-based perception for autonomous vehicles. To achieve this goal, we fuse sequential information from multiple consecutive LiDAR measurements with respect to the driven trajectory of an autonomous vehicle. By doing so, we enrich the multi-layer grid maps which are subsequently used as the input of a neural network. Our approach can be used for LiDAR- only 360 degrees surround view semantic scene segmentation while being suitable for realtime critical systems. We evaluate the benefit of fusing sequential information using a dense semantic ground truth and discuss the effect on different classes.

It includes a 'target-less' multi-LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), and Camera-LiDAR calibration, sensor fusion, and a fast and accurate point cloud ground classifier. Our calibration methods do not require complex setup procedures, and once the sensors are calibrated, our framework eases the fusion of multiple point clouds, and cameras. In addition we present an original real-time ground-obstacle classifier, which runs on the CPU, and is designed to be used with any type and number of LiDARs. Evaluation results on the KITTI dataset confirm that our calibration method has comparable accuracy with other state-of-the-art contenders in the benchmark.

AB Major trends in the automotive industry are reconfiguring digital mobility business models. From a compre-hensive, combined Dynamic Capabilities and Ecosystems approach, this study characterizes the digital mobility business models linked to sustainability, connectivity, and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) adopted by four car -makers (Volkswagen, Stellantis, Toyota, and Honda). Results show that carmakers differ in their focal digital mobility value propositions, based mainly on the carmakers' own mobility strategies. Volkswagen exhibits an integral proposition with personalized services, while Stellantis is focusing on electric mobility and its solutions, Toyota on autonomous and connectivity services, and Honda on a user-centric perspective via connected and shared mobility. The main sources of income are multiple personalized services linked to connectivity that specifically provide driver assistance, along with remote and digital platform services. Those carmakers pursuing sustainable, autonomous, or shared mobility strategies find their primary income sources in services like remote electric driving, autonomous door-to-door deliveries, and car-sharing. Such services are deployed not only due to technical resources, such as digital skills and data exchange systems, but primarily through organizational ca-pabilities like a "team-player mentality" and a customer-focused vision. Finally, differences in sustainability have been highlighted, but in general terms, all manufacturers are striving to address the battery and charging-point issue through various business models to promote electric mobility. Carmakers are governing a digital mobility ecosystem configured by multiple service and technology providers that are developing transportation solutions.

AB In this paper, Vulnerable Road User (VRU) trajectory prediction for autonomous driving based on the Intention-Attention-Gate Recurrent Unit (IA-GRU), Improved Social Force Model (ISFM) and Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) is systematically investigated. Firstly, a novel IA-GRU is proposed for VRU (pedestrian, cyclist, and electric cyclist) trajectory prediction. VRU intention (waiting/crossing), VRU heterogeneity (age and gender), VRU-VRU interactions and VRU-dynamic vehicle interactions are taken into account. Attention is used to obtain the influence weights of the above factors used for VRU trajectory prediction. Secondly, a micro-dynamic ISFM is developed for VRU trajectory prediction. The impact of zebra crossing, collision avoidance with vehicles and VRUs, and VRU heterogeneity are considered. Moreover, traffic data collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is obtained and analyzed, and the parameters of the ISFM are calibrated by the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Finally, a data-driven integrated approach based on the IA-GRU and ISFM is proposed, and AdaBoost is used to prevent the model from overfitting and improve the prediction accuracy. The results indicate that the integrated model outperforms the existing methods, and the prediction accuracy is improved by more than 11% based on the collected traffic data, which can give us great confidence to use the integrated model in the autonomous driving domain to improve the safety of VRUs.

AB This article investigates the issue of fixed-time path-following control for autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) with completely unknown parameters subject to preset error constraints. Before converging the path-following errors, a fixed-time prescribed performance control (PPC) protocol is developed to guarantee the selected nonsingular sliding manifold evolving within the preset boundaries. Then, the fixed-time PPC target for the preview error of the AGV can be achieved by satisfying the parameter inequality. Furthermore, the designed adaptive laws can ensure the control accuracy without knowledge of vehicle parameters. Finally, the hardware-in-the-loop tests of multiple maneuvering conditions demonstrate that the proposed fixed-time PPC protocol can provide superior comprehensive path-following performance for the AGV over the conventional fixed-time controller, and the preview error can never violate the prescribed performance constraints.

ID NON-SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS; AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE; BEHAVIOR
AB One of the major challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs) is how to drive in shared pedestrian environments. AVs cannot make their decisions and behaviour human-like or natural when they encounter pedestrians with different crossing intentions. The main reasons for this are the lack of natural driving data and the unclear rationale of the human-driven vehicle and pedestrian interaction. This paper aims to understand the underlying behaviour mechanisms using data of pedestrian-vehicle interactions from a naturalistic driving study (NDS). A naturalistic driving test platform was established to collect motion data of human-driven vehicles and pedestrians. A manual pedestrian intention judgment system was first developed to judge the pedestrian crossing intention at every moment in the interaction process. A total of 98 single pedestrian crossing events of interest were screened from 1274 pedestrian-vehicle interaction events under naturalistic driving conditions. Several performance metrics with quantitative data, including TTC, subjective judgment on pedestrian crossing intention (SJPCI), pedestrian position and crossing direction, and vehicle speed and deceleration were analyzed and applied to evaluate human-driven vehicles' yielding behaviour towards pedestrians. The results show how vehicles avoid pedestrians in different interaction scenarios, which are classified based on vehicle deceleration. The behaviour and intention results are needed by future AVs, to enable AVs to avoid pedestrians more naturally, safely, and smoothly.

AB In this study, a novel traffic flow modeling framework is proposed considering the impact of driving system and vehicle mechanical behavior as two different units on the traffic flow. To precisely model the behavior of Connected and Autonomous (CA) vehicles, three submodels are proposed as a novel microscopic traffic flow framework, named Integrated-Hybrid (IH) model. Focusing on the realization of the car following behavior of CA vehicles, the driving system (vehicle control system) and the vehicle mechanical system are modeled separately and linked by throttle and brake actuators model. The IH model constitutes the key part of the Full Velocity Difference (FVD) model considering the mechanical capability of vehicles and dynamic collision avoidance strategies to ensure the safety of following distance between two consecutive vehicles. Linear stability conditions are derived for each model and developing methodology for each submodel is discussed. Our simulations revealed that the IH model successfully generates velocity and acceleration profiles during car following maneuvers and throttle angle/brake information in connected vehicles environment can effectively improve traffic flow stability. The vehicles' departure and arrival process while passing through a signal-lane with a traffic light considering the anticipation driving behavior and throttle angle/brake information of direct leading vehicle was explored. Our numerical results demonstrated that the IH model can capture the velocity fluctuations, delay times, and kinematic waves efficiently in traffic flow.

AB Considering that when a vehicle travels on a low friction coefficient road with high speed, the path tracking ability declines. To keep the performance of path tracking and improve the stabilization under that situation, this article presents approaches to estimate the parameters and control the vehicle. First, the key states of the vehicle and the road adhesion coefficient are estimated by the unscented Kalman filter. This is followed by applying the linear time-varying model-based predictive controller to achieve path tracking control, and the initial tire steering angle control rate is obtained. Finally, the steering angle compensation controller is simultaneously designed by a simple receding horizon corrector algorithm to improve vehicle stability when the path is tracked on a low-adhesion coefficient or at high speed. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by software CarSim and MATLAB/Simulink. Simulation results show that an improvement in the performance of path tracking and stabilization can be achieved by the integrated controller under the variable road adhesion coefficient condition and high speed with 110 km/h.

AB In this paper, the adaptive cruise control problem of autonomous vehicles is considered and we propose a novel predictive cruise control approach to improve driving safety and comfort of the host vehicle. The main idea of the approach is that the predicted acceleration commands of the host vehicle are stair-likely pre-planned to satisfy their changes along the same direction within the prediction horizon. The predictive cruise controller is then computed by online solving a finite horizon constrained optimal control problem with a decision variable. Besides explicitly handling safety constraints of vehicles, the obtained controller has abilities to efficiently attenuate peaks of the cruise commands while reducing computational load of online solving the optimization problem. Hence, the ride comfort and safety performances of vehicles are improved in terms of softening acceleration response and constraint satisfaction. Moreover, the ride comfort, following and safety performances of vehicles are summed with varying weights to cope with various traffic scenarios. Some classical cases are adopted to evaluate the proposed adaptive cruise control algorithm in terms of ride comfort, car-following ability and computational demand.

ID FRAMEWORK; INTERNET
AB Vehicle trajectory prediction is crucial in achieving safe and reliable autonomous driving decision-making. The accuracy of the prediction is affected by many different factors, such as the integrity and efficiency of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) data transfer, the complex environmental factors of the surrounding roads and the perception range of vehicle sensors. However, most existing methods cannot capture the dynamic interactive information of vehicles at different time steps. In this paper, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Interactive Graph Convolutional Network (STI-GCN) that predicts future trajectories by acquiring spatiotemporal features of vehicles. In the spatial dimension, we construct a kernel function based on spatial autocorrelation and use it as prior knowledge to describe the degree of mutual influence between vehicles in real traffic scenarios. In addition, the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is used to dynamically capture the spatial features of vehicles to solve the dynamic making graph problem of vehicles in the real traffic scene. In the temporal dimension, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract the temporal feature in the historical trajectory of the vehicle. Finally, we experimented with our method and existing methods on the public Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset. The experimental results show that the error of our model is reduced by about 10% compared with the state-of-the-art model. And it also improves about 10 times in two key metrics, namely the number of parameters and inference time.

AB Despite rapid advances in vehicle intelligence and connectivity, there is still a significant period in mixed traffic where connected, automated vehicles and human-driven vehicles coexist. The behavioral uncertainty of human-driven vehicles makes decision-making a challenging task in an unsignalized intersection scenario. In this paper, a decentralized multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) based on an attention representations algorithm (Attn-MAPPO) was developed to make joint decisions at an intersection to avoid collisions and cross the intersection effectively. To implement this framework, by exploiting the shared information, the system was modeled as a model-free, fully cooperative, multi-agent system. The vehicle employed an attention module to extract the most valuable information from its neighbors. Based on the observation and traffic rules, a joint policy was identified to work more cooperatively based on the trajectory prediction of all the vehicles. To facilitate the collaboration between the vehicles, a weighted reward assignment scheme was proposed to focus more on the vehicles approaching intersections. The results presented the advantages of the Attn-MAPPO framework and validated the effectiveness of the designed reward function. Ultimately, the comparative experiments were conducted to demonstrate that the proposed approach was more adaptive and generalized than the heuristic rule-based model, which revealed its great potential for reinforcement learning in the decision-making of autonomous driving.

AB The menace of floating spills is frequently solved using a team of ships towing a boom. This operation involves specific control and coordination aspects. Some automatic advice, on board the ships, could be helpful for the pilots. Moreover, it could be convenient to have the alternative of using unmanned boats, especially if the spill represents a danger for humans. This paper studies the control and coordination needs for automatically towing a boom, and proposes the use of unmanned boats with autonomous control. The research is supported by simulations and experiments with scaled boats towing a boom. Promising results have been obtained. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID FEATURES
AB Recently, autonomous systems become a hot research topic among industrialists and academicians due to their applicability in different domains such as healthcare, agriculture, industrial automation, etc. Among the interesting applications of autonomous systems, their applicability in agricultural sector becomes significant. Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used for suitable site-specific weed management (SSWM) to improve crop productivity. In spite of substantial advancements in UAV based data collection systems, automated weed detection still remains a tedious task owing to the high resemblance of weeds to the crops. The recently developed deep learning (DL) models have exhibited effective performance in several data classification problems. In this aspect, this paper focuses on the design of autonomous UAVs with decision support system for weed management (AUAV-DSSWM) technique. The proposed AUAV-DSSWM technique intends to identify the weeds by the use of UAV images acquired from the target area. Besides, the AUAV-DSSWM technique primarily performs image acquisition and image pre-processing stages. Moreover, the Adam optimizer with You Only Look Once Object Detector-(YOLOv3) model is applied for the detection of weeds. For the effective classification of weeds and crops, the poor and rich optimization (PRO) algorithm with softmax layer is applied. The design of Adam optimizer and PRO algorithm for the parameter tuning process results in enhanced weed detection performance. A wide range of simulations take place on UAV images and the experimental results exhibit the promising performance of the AUAV-DSSWM technique over the other recent techniques with the accy of 99.23%.

AB Autonomous moving objects (AMOs), such as automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and autonomous robots, have widely been used in the industry for decades. In an intelligent transport system with a great number of AMOs involved, it is important to eliminate potential congestion and deadlocks among AMOs to maintain a well-organized traffic flow. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that adapts bitonic merge sort algorithm for concurrent scheduling and routing of a great number (i.e., 4n(2)) of AMOs on an n x n mesh topology of path network without congestion or deadlocks among AMOs during their moves. The results are tested by experiments with randomly generated data and the comparison of a related model.

ID CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW; TRANSPORT; ADOPTION; IMPACTS
AB The autonomous vehicles (AVs) could make a positive or negative impact on reducing mobile emissions. This study investigated the changes of mobile emissions that could be caused by large-scale adoption of AVs. The factors of road capacity increase and speed limit increase impacts were simulated using a conceptual modeling approach that combines a hypothetical speed-emission function and a traffic demand model using a virtual transportation network. The simulation results show that road capacity increase impact is significant in decreasing mobile emissions until the market share of AVs is less than 80%. If the road capacity increases by 100%, the mobile emissions will decrease by about 30%. On the other hand, driving speed limit increase impact is significant in increasing mobile emissions, and the environmentally desirable speed limit was found at around 95 km/h. If the speed limit increases to 140 km/h, the mobile emissions will increase by about 25%. This is because some vehicles begin to bypass the congested routes at high speeds as speed limit increases. Based on the simulation results, it is clear that the vehicle platooning technology implemented at reasonable speed limit is one of the AV technologies that are encouraging from the environmental point of view.

AB In this paper, we examine a problem of autonomous vehicle decision making for search operations performed by undersea autonomous vehicles. Specifically, we consider the problem of determining whether to continue with preplanned search paths or to switch to focused local search efforts in the presence of limited contact information. Using techniques from information theory, we develop a context of search channel capacity from which rapid computations of performance bounds can be computed based on sensing capabilities and prior search information. These bounds characterize search planning alternatives and are useful in making the initial online determination of search plan adaptation. We illustrate the utility of our approach with numerical examples applying multiple undersea searchers.

One of the effective issues of self-driving vehicles is path planning issue. In this paper, a new system is proposed for addressing the potential of using multi-agent systems (MAS) to address path planning problems in autonomous vehicles. The system is called Cloud Multi-Agents for Self-Driving Vehicles as A Services (CMSV). It is used to solve the dependent delivery problem, where the vehicle transmits the goods/deliveries, that are dependent on each other, to specific locations in ordering or with specific directions. The new system consists of three phases: (1) converting the problem into TSP sub problems according to deliveries dependency, (2) applying GDC to select the good solutions (3) applying multi-agent system to select the optimal solution. The proposed system is compared with systems that use a genetic algorithm, Ant Colony algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization and The Harris hawk optimization (HHO) algorithm. From the findings, we find that the proposed system is more efficient than the other systems.

AB Smart agile Micro Aerial Vehicles are becoming ubiquitous in industrial applications; however, their compu-tational efficacy poses a constraint limiting their deployment. The challenge mentioned above is mitigated in the context of a Micro Aerial Vehicle vision-based navigation task. RPNet, a computational-efficient model, is proposed as a Micro Aerial Vehicle navigational controller. RPNet comprises a sequential arrangement of generic imaginary and real Gabor filters for computation reduction. Further, a novel rotational pooling mech-anism that induces online feature descriptors augmentation is proposed and plugged after each convolutional block in RPNet for robustness and increase in performance. RPNet is initially trained on synthetic data for domain knowledge and further trained and tested in a real-world setting using a Micro Aerial Vehicle. Extensive experimental verification of RPNet based on four evaluation metrics shows satisfactory performance compared to the reference trajectories. Further, via comparisons, RPNet attains better error distribution of about +/- 5 m, and computational conservation of around 9% than the first runner-up comparator among the state-of-the-art models in the vision-based Micro Aerial Vehicle navigation task.

AB Information on the trajectories of turning vehicles at signalized intersections can be used in numerous applications, such as movement planning of autonomous vehicles, realistic representation of surrounding vehicle movements in driving simulator and virtual reality applications, and in microscopic simulation tools. However, no proper framework is currently available to realistically model and estimate trajectories of turning vehicles reflecting the intersection geometries, which is critical for the reliability of simulation models. This study explores the applicability of the minimum-jerk principle, which has been initially applied in neuroscience and robotics domains, to model and simulate free-flow trajectories of turning vehicles. The modeling method is validated by comparing model outputs with empirical trajectories collected at several signalized intersections in Nagoya, Japan. The capability of the model in realistically capturing the variations in turning trajectories based on intersection geometry (e.g., intersection angle and turning radius) is also explained. Further, the applicability of the modeling framework at intersections with different geometric features under different speeds and accelerations are also discussed.

AB This paper presents a vision algorithm that enables automated jellyfish tracking using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) or autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The discussion focuses on algorithm design. The introduction provides a novel performance-assessment tool, called segmentation efficiency, which aids in matching potential vision algorithms to the jelly-tracking task. This general-purpose tool evaluates the inherent applicability of various algorithms to particular tracking applications. This tool is applied to the problem of tracking transparent jellyfish under uneven time-varying illumination in particle-filled scenes. The result is the selection of a fixed-gradient threshold-based vision algorithm. This approach, implemented as part of a pilot aid for the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute's ROV Ventana, has demonstrated automated jelly tracking for as long as 89 min.

AB Detecting transient changes in heart rate and heart rate variability during experimental simulated autonomous driving scenarios can indicate participant arousal and cognitive load, providing valuable insights into the relationship between human and vehicle autonomy. Successfully detecting such parameters unobtrusively may assist these experimental situations as well as naturalistic driver monitoring systems within an autonomous vehicle. However, non-contact sensors must collect reliable and accurate signals. This study aims to compare the in-seat, non-contact Plessey EPIC sensor to the gold standard, contact Biopac sensor. Thirty participants took part in fiveminute simulated autonomous vehicle journeys in a city environment and a rural environment, and a five-minute resting condition. To ensure the seat sensor was sensitive to elevated heart rate values, heart rate was also collected following the energetic Harvard Step Test. Lin concordance coefficients and Bland-Altman analyses were employed to assess the level of agreement between the non-contact Plessey EPIC sensor and the contact Biopac sensor for heart rate and heart rate variability. Analyses revealed a high level of agreement (rc > 0.96) between both sensors for one-minute averaged heart rate and five-minute averaged heart rate variability during simulated autonomous driving and rest, and one-minute averaged heart rate following the Harvard Step Test. In addition, the non-contact sensor was sensitive to significant differences during tasks. This proof of principle study demonstrates the feasibility of using the non-contact Plessey EPIC sensor to accurately detect heart rate and heart rate variability during simulated autonomous driving environments.

ID GAME-THEORETIC APPROACH
AB Autonomous driving requires efficient and safe decision making and motion planning in dynamic and uncertain environments. Future movement of surrounding vehicles is often difficult to represent. Besides, most existing studies consider decision making and planning/control separately. Both them may lead to the oscillation and unsafe for autonomous driving. This paper proposes an integrated framework of decision making and motion planning with oscillation-free capability. The proposed approach overcomes the shortcomings of autonomous driving for lane change/keeping maneuvers and is able to: i) make oscillation-free behavior decisions given biased prediction; ii) cut through in the traffic efficiently and safely when being in squeezed; iii) accelerate computation efficiency by building a state transfer model based on prediction uncertainty; iv) reduce the dissonance between decision-making and motion planning. A belief decision planner is designed with the uncertainty of the prediction trajectories. Lateral and longitudinal drivable corridors including the reference state and the related boundary constraints are built, which provide better suited information for planning to solve the optimal motion sequence more quickly and stably, and improve its consistency with decision module. Finally, the problem is formulated as an optimal control problem considering the vehicle dynamics and some soft constraints and the motion trajectory is solved by OSQP. Simulation and experimental tests are implemented to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Test results show that the integrated approach can make proper, safe and continuous decision and planning for autonomous vehicles and the calculation time is very low.

AB Efficient pedestrian detection is a key aspect of many intelligent vehicles. In this context, vision-based detection has increased in popularity. Algorithms proposed often consider that the camera is mobile (on board a vehicle) or static (mounted on infrastructure). In contrast, we consider a pedestrian detection approach that uses information from mobile and static cameras jointly. Assuming that the vehicle (on which the mobile camera is mounted) contains some sort of localization capability, combining information from the mobile camera with the static camera yields significantly improved detection rates. These sources are fairly independent, with substantially different illumination and view-angle perspectives, bringing more statistical diversity than a multicamera network observing an area of interest, for example. The proposed method finds applicability in industrial environments, where industrial vehicle localization is becoming increasingly popular. We implemented and tested the system on an automated industrial vehicle, considering both manned and autonomous operations. We present a thorough discussion on practical issues (resolution, lighting, subject pose, etc.) related to human detection in the scenario considered. Experiments illustrate the improved results of the joint detection compared with traditional independent static and mobile detection approaches.

AB We describe the development of feedback control for autonomous underwater gliders. Feedback is introduced to make the glider motion robust to disturbances and uncertainty. Our focus is on buoyancy-propelled, fixed-wing gliders with attitude controlled by means of active internal mass redistribution. We derive a nonlinear dynamic model of a nominal glider complete with hydrodynamic forces and coupling between the vehicle and the movable internal mass. We use this model to study stability and controllability of glide paths and to derive feedback control laws. For our analysis, we restrict to motion in the vertical plane and consider linear control laws. For illustration, we apply our methodology to a model of our own laboratory-scale underwater glider.

AB Progress in advanced vehicular technologies and computer science leads to driverless vehicles becoming a reality. The standard ambulances might be replaced by driverless ambulances operated by an autopilot that provides passengers with a secure regime. Therefore, the study's aim was to collate two different countries regarding the consumers' preparedness to travel on such autonomous ambulances. To obtain a more demonstrative result, a questionnaire survey was conducted in two countries (Hungary and Kazakhstan). It also gathered 'affect' measures in order to figure out if 'affect' served as a medium between the ambulance mode and readiness to ride, and to understand whether emotions play any role during the decision making. The necessary data were collected through the so-called Autonomous Ambulance Acceptance Questionnaire. After conducting 't-Test', 'ANOVA', and Mediation analysis, the findings have been discussed. The results help to realize the necessity of developing educational guides to prepare potential patients for Autonomous Vehicles technology.

AB Over the last decades, deep neural networks (DNNs) have penetrated all fields of science and the real world. As a result of the lack of quantifiable data and model uncertainty, deep learning is frequently brittle, illogical, and challenging to provide trustworthy assurance for autonomous vehicles' (AVs) perception. This hole is filled by the suggested approach to uncertainty quantification. Nevertheless, most of the previous studies focused on the methodology and there is still a lack of research on the application of AV. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first time to review the application of uncertainty in the field of AV perception and localization. First, this survey analyzes the sources of uncertainty in autonomous perception, including the uncertainty brought on by sensor internal and external factors as well as the sensor distortion caused by complex scenes. Second, we propose an evaluation criterion and use the criterion to carry out a quantitative analysis of the perception field of application for AVs, and we discuss the mainstream datasets. Third, we put forward a number of open issues and raise some future research directions, which are of guiding significance to readers who are beginning to enter this field. We believe that epistemic uncertainty is currently the dominant research direction and that there is still a long way to go in the study of aleatoric uncertainty. And this survey will be devoted to promoting the development of uncertainty research on AV perception.

AB The rapid increase of human activities with direct influence on the environment has motivated the global awareness of the need to efficiently monitor the natural resources. Among the wide range of problems addressed, such as overuse of agrochemicals, uncontrolled waste, etc., the contamination of water resources plays a protagonist role, given its close links with biodiversity and the food chain. Water monitoring is considered one of the most efficient ways to deal with these problems, especially through the use of autonomous vehicles, which can boost the capabilities and efficiency of the monitoring routines with appropriate strategies. In this work, the monitoring problem is addressed by means of the Non-Homogeneous Patrolling Problem with closed circuits. This problem has a great computational complexity, especially when multiple targets are included in a monitoring mission. A formulation based on closed metric graphs and the application of a multi-objective genetic algorithm is proposed to provide Pareto-efficient monitoring solutions for a variable number of Autonomous Surface Vehicles. To address the multi-agent, multi-objective and constrained paradigm, efficient genetic operators have been designed for the generation of valid solutions in an affordable time. The method results in Pareto-efficient solutions for scenarios with disjoint and uncorrelated objectives, which outperform the fitness of other solutions by a factor of 2, on average. The results provide decision makers a method to find different non-dominated strategies depending on the monitoring needs, depending on fleet and vehicle size.

AB Autonomous vehicle driving systems (AVDSs) have independent decision structures from the users to manage and control the operations of the vehicles both in normal conditions and unexpected situations. Although there are some advantages, such as decreasing accidents reasoned by human errors and efficient energy usage, it is obvious that some risks are rooted in this technology usage. Therefore, it will be beneficial to realize a risk assessment application for autonomous vehicles (AVs) and/or driving systems (DSs) since whose risks are crucial to test and solve. In this paper, a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methodology integrating DEcision MAking Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), Analytical Network Process (ANP), and VlseKriterijuska Optimizacija I Komoromisno Resenje (VIKOR) techniques under spherical fuzzy environment have been suggested to evaluate AVDS alternatives in terms of considered risk criteria. Spherical fuzzy sets (SFS), which are the extension of the ordinary fuzzy sets, have been used to consider the hesitancy of experts and decision-makers as well as uncertainty and impreciseness in the available data. In the application, six AVDS alternatives have been evaluated in terms of seven main criteria and forty sub-criteria. The factors "Software Specifications'' and "Reliability'' have been determined as the most important main and sub-criteria with the weights 0.193 and 0.066, respectively. Additionally, comparative and sensitivity analyses have been applied to present flexibility, validation and verification of the proposed methodology together with the sensitivity of the given decisions. Based on the application results and conducted analyses, possible implications by views of theoretical, managerial, and policy context have been discussed. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Underwater Inspection, Maintenance, and Repair operations are nowadays performed using Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) deployed from dynamic-positioning vessels, having high daily operational costs. During the last twenty years, the research community has been making an effort to design new Intervention Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (I-AUV), which could, in the near future, replace the ROVs, significantly decreasing these costs. Until now, the experimental work using I-AUVs has been limited to a few single-vehicle interventions, including object search and recovery, valve turning, and hot stab operations. More complex scenarios usually require the cooperation of multiple agents, i.e., the transportation of large and heavy objects. Moreover, using small, autonomous vehicles requires consideration of their limited load capacity and limited manipulation force/torque capabilities. Following the idea of multi-agent systems, in this paper we propose a possible solution: using a group of cooperating I-AUVs, thus sharing the load and optimizing the stress exerted on the manipulators. Specifically, we tackle the problem of transporting a long pipe. The presented ideas are based on a decentralized Task-Priority kinematic control algorithm adapted for the highly limited communication bandwidth available underwater. The aforementioned pipe is transported following a sequence of poses. A path-following algorithm computes the desired velocities for the robots' end-effectors, and the on-board controllers ensure tracking of these setpoints, taking into account the geometry of the pipe and the vehicles' limitations. The utilized algorithms and their practical implementation are discussed in detail and validated through extensive simulations and experimental trials performed in a test tank using two 8 DOF I-AUVs.

AB For the safe and successful navigation of autonomous vehicles in unstructured environments, the traversability of terrain should vary based on the driving capabilities of the vehicles. Actual driving experience can be utilized in a self-supervised fashion to learn vehicle-specific traversability. However, existing methods for learning self-supervised traversability are not highly scalable for learning the traversability of various vehicles. In this work, we introduce a scalable framework for learning self-supervised traversability, which can learn the traversability directly from vehicle-terrain interaction without any human supervision. We train a neural network that predicts the proprioceptive experience that a vehicle would undergo from 3D point clouds. Using a novel PU learning method, the network simultaneously identifies non-traversable regions where estimations can be overconfident. With driving data of various vehicles gathered from simulation and the real world, we show that our framework is capable of learning the self-supervised traversability of various vehicles. By integrating our framework with a model predictive controller, we demonstrate that estimated traversability results in effective navigation that enables distinct maneuvers based on the driving characteristics of the vehicles. In addition, experimental results validate the ability of our method to identify and avoid non-traversable regions.

TI Potential of Private Autonomous Vehicles for Parcel Delivery
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Using the same vehicles for both passenger and freight transport, to increase vehicle occupancy and decrease their number, is an idea that drives transport planners and is also being addressed by manufacturers. This paper proposes a methodology to simulate the behavior of such vehicles within an urban traffic system and evaluate their performance. The aim is to investigate the impacts of resignation from fleet ownership by a transport service company (TSC) operating on a city-wide scale. In the simulation, the service provider hires private autonomous cars for tour performance. Based on assumptions concerning the operation of such vehicles and TSCs, the software Multi-Agent Transport Simulation (MATSim) is extended to model vehicle and operator behavior. The proposed framework is applied to a case study of a parcel delivery service in Berlin serving a synthetic parcel demand. Results suggest that the vehicle miles traveled for freight purposes increase because of additional access and egress trips. Moreover, the number of vehicles en route is higher throughout the day. The lowering of driver costs can reduce the costs of the operator by approximately 74.5%. If the service provider additionally considers the resignation from fleet ownership, it might lower the operation cost by another 10%, not taking into account the costs of system transfer or risks like vehicle non-availability. From an economic perspective, the reduction of the overall number of vehicles in the system seems to be beneficial.

AB With the high focus on autonomous aerial refueling (AAR), it becomes increasingly urgent to design efficient methods or algorithms for solving the AAR problems in complicated aerial environments. A vision-based technology for AAR is developed in this paper, and five monocular and binocular visual algorithms for pose estimation of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are adopted and verified in this AAR system. The real-time on-board vision system is also designed for precise navigation in the UAVs docking phase. A series of out-door comparative experiments for different pose estimation algorithms are conducted to verify the feasibility and accuracy of the vision algorithms in AAR.

AB Autonomous vehicular clouds, as the combination of cloud computing and conventional vehicular ad hoc networks, will provide abundant resources and services by sharing under-utilized resources of future high-end vehicles such as computing power, storage and internet connectivity. Autonomous vehicular clouds will have significant impact if widely implemented in the intelligent transportation system. However, security and privacy issues are still big challenges in autonomous vehicular clouds. In this paper, after analyzing the particularity of autonomous vehicular clouds, we implement a two-layered architecture, in which vehicles are self-organized without the help of roadside units. Then based on the architecture, we put forward an effective key management protocol to distribute a group key efficiently and also provide the authentication and confidentiality that lots of current secure schemes ignore. In addition, according to the different scenarios and security levels we categorize the way of message transmitting into three kinds. At last, with performance evaluations, the proposed protocol can perform more efficiently than other well-known available schemes.

AB Due to recent technological developments, both academia and the market have become interested in utilizing shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). Gaining insight into preferences and priorities for using the next generation of shared mobility was the primary motivation for this study. The goal is to explore the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a shared mobility service using a detailed user preference analysis for alternative automation types and incentive and policy options. The data was collected between March to May 2020 during the COVID-19 lock -down period in the United States via an online survey and analyzed by the Adaptive Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis (ACBC) method. The results of this study show that respondents distinctly preferred fully automated vehicles (SAVs) over shared human-driven vehicles (SHVs), tended to use a door-to-door service rather than a pooled service with a short walking distance, and were more interested in using advanced built-in amenities in the vehicle, not inclined to share their travel with others, and likely to pay less money to avoid potential delays. Comparing the results before and during the COVID-19 period showed that respondents afterward have markedly less willingness-to-share their trips with other riders compared to the survey analysis done before the COVID-19 period.

AB This article proposes an adaptive robust formation control scheme for the connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) swarm system by utilizing swarm property, diffeomorphism transformation, and constraint following. The control design is processed by starting from a 2-D dynamics model with (possibly fast) time varying but bounded uncertainty. The uncertainty bounds are unknown. For compact formation, the CAV system is treated as an artificial swarm system, for which the ideal swarm performance is taken as a desired constraint. By this, formation control is converted into a problem of constraint following and then a performance measure beta is defined as the control object to evaluate the constraint following error. For collision avoidance, a diffeomorphism transformation on space measure between two vehicles is creatively performed, by which the space measure is positive restricted. For uncertainty handling, an adaptive robust control scheme is proposed to render the beta-measure to be uniformly bounded and uniformly ultimately bounded, that is, drive the controlled (CAV) swarm system to follow the desired constraint approximatively. As a result, the system can achieve the ideal swarm performance; thereout, compact formation is realized, regardless of the uncertainty. The main contribution of this article is exploring a 2-D formation control scheme for (CAV) swarm system under the consideration of collision avoidance and time-varying uncertainty.

AB Subterranean openings, including mines, present a unique and challenging environment for robots and autonomous exploration systems. Autonomous robots that are created today will be deployed in harsh and unexplored landscapes that humanity is increasingly encountering in its scientific and technological endeavors. Terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments pose significant challenges for both humans and robots: they are inhospitable and inaccessible to humans due to a lack of space or oxygen, poor or no illumination, unpredictable terrain, a GPS-denied environment, and a lack of satellite imagery or mapping information of any type. Underground mines provide a good physical simulation for these types of environments, and thus, can be useful for testing and developing highly sought-after autonomous navigation frameworks for autonomous agents. This review presents a collective study of robotic systems, both of individual and hybrid types, intended for deployment in such environments. The prevalent configurations, practices for their construction and the hardware equipment of existing multi-agent hybrid robotic systems will be discussed. It aims to provide a supplementary tool for defining the state of the art of coupled Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV)-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems implemented for underground exploration and navigation purposes, as well as to provide some suggestions for multi-agent robotic system solutions, and ultimately, to support the development of a semi-autonomous hybrid UGV-UAV system to assist with mine emergency responses.

AB Safe and reliable operation of future autonomous vehicles requires ultra-low latency vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) networking. However, due to scalability issues of purely ad hoc network, vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication is still in demand. To avoid interference between V2V and V2I communications, conventional network association such as handover may generate a large amount of control and signaling overhead, especially in environments with high-speed mobility and small-coverage access points. Taking the additional latency caused by the overhead into consideration, a vehicle-centric approach is proposed to guarantee the low-latency requirements of the V2V networks. Different from solely optimizing the latency performance, the proposed approach focuses on effectively operating the network association and resources re-allocation. This avoids the massive exchange of control information and signaling and reduces its impact on latency. The proposed framework for V2V networking can underlay different virtual cells with a constrained network association rate and we can derive the corresponding upper bound of the latency performance. Analysis and simulation results indicate that our scheme successfully guarantees the upper bound of the latency and simultaneously constrains the network association rate, thus limiting the additional control exchange and signaling overhead.

ID ENTRY
AB Vehicle automation has been one of the fundamental applications within the field of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) since the start of ITS research in the mid-1980s. For most of this time, it has been generally viewed as a futuristic concept that is not close to being ready for deployment. However, recent development of "self-driving" cars and the announcement by car manufacturers of their deployment by 2020 show that this is becoming a reality. The ITS industry has already been focusing much of its attention on the concepts of "connected vehicles" (United States) or "cooperative ITS" (Europe). These concepts are based on communication of data among vehicles (V2V) and/or between vehicles and the infrastructure (V2I/I2V) to provide the information needed to implement ITS applications. The separate threads of automated vehicles and cooperative ITS have not yet been thoroughly woven together, but this will be a necessary step in the near future because the cooperative exchange of data will provide vital inputs to improve the performance and safety of the automation systems. Thus, it is important to start thinking about the cybersecurity implications of cooperative automated vehicle systems. In this paper, we investigate the potential cyberattacks specific to automated vehicles, with their special needs and vulnerabilities. We analyze the threats on autonomous automated vehicles and cooperative automated vehicles. This analysis shows the need for considerably more redundancy than many have been expecting. We also raise awareness to generate discussion about these threats at this early stage in the development of vehicle automation systems.

AB The failure to estimate friction on the road is a significant cause of roadway departure crashes. It is even more relevant to autonomous vehicles (AVs) as they are currently not designed to measure the skid resistance of roads. Most traditional measurements are too inefficient for real-time AV control. Thus, in this paper, we propose a dynamic method to estimate pavement friction level using computer vision. We collect 100 sets of high-quality road images and their resistance values to train the model, and design two major methods for analysis: 1) texture identification, consisting of grayscale-enhanced local binary pattern and the gray-level gradient co-occurrence matrix and 2) a deep neural network based on domain knowledge (TLDKNet). We introduce two standards of classification for model training and propose three indices-underestimation error, overestimation error, and accuracy-to verify the performance of our algorithms. The results showed the great correlation between pavement texture and skid resistance. The TLDKNet yielded the best performance with an accuracy of 90.67% and only 2.67% underestimation error, showing that it is sufficiently conservative with regard to safety. Based on the proposed method of estimation, a framework for anti-skid driving control is developed regarding the car-following behavior and turning movements. The anti-skid control framework provides new insights into enhancing the AV safety performance.

ID MULTIROBOT TASK ALLOCATION; DATA FUSION; ALGORITHM; NAVIGATION
AB This paper presents the architecture developed in the framework of the AWARE project for the autonomous distributed cooperation between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), wireless sensor/actuator networks, and ground camera networks. One of the main goals was the demonstration of useful actuation capabilities involving multiple ground and aerial robots in the context of civil applications. A novel characteristic is the demonstration in field experiments of the transportation and deployment of the same load with single/multiple autonomous aerial vehicles. The architecture is endowed with different modules that solve the usual problems that arise during the execution of multipurpose missions, such as task allocation, conflict resolution, task decomposition, and sensor data fusion. The approach had to satisfy two main requirements: robustness for operation in disaster management scenarios and easy integration of different autonomous vehicles. The former specification led to a distributed design, and the latter was tackled by imposing several requirements on the execution capabilities of the vehicles to be integrated in the platform. The full approach was validated in field experiments with different autonomous helicopters equipped with heterogeneous devices onboard, such as visual/infrared cameras and instruments to transport loads and to deploy sensors. Four different missions are presented in this paper: sensor deployment and fire confirmation with UAVs, surveillance with multiple UAVs, tracking of firemen with ground and aerial sensors/cameras, and load transportation with multiple UAVs.

ID CRACK DETECTION; PAVEMENT; MODELS
AB Road surface defects are crucial problems for safe and smooth traffic flow. Due to climate changes, low quality of construction material, large flow of traffic, and heavy vehicles, road surface anomalies are increasing rapidly. Detection and repairing of these defects are necessary for the safety of drivers, passengers, and vehicles from mechanical faults. In this modern era, autonomous vehicles are an active research area that controls itself with the help of in-vehicle sensors without human commands, especially after the emergence of deep learning (DNN) techniques. A combination of sensors and DNN techniques can be useful for unmanned vehicles for the perception of their surroundings for the detection of tracks and obstacles for smooth traveling based on the deployment of artificial intelligence in vehicles. One of the biggest challenges for autonomous vehicles is to avoid the critical road defects that may lead to dangerous situations. To solve the accident issues and share emergency information, the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) introduced the concept of vehicular network termed as vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) for achieving security and safety in a traffic flow. A novel mechanism is proposed for the automatic detection of road anomalies by autonomous vehicles and providing road information to upcoming vehicles based on Edge AI and VANET. Road images captured via camera and deployment of the trained model for road anomaly detection in a vehicle could help to reduce the accident rate and risk of hazards on poor road conditions. The techniques Residual Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet-18) and Visual Geometry Group (VGG-11) are applied for the automatic detection and classification of the road with anomalies such as a pothole, bump, crack, and plain roads without anomalies using the dataset from different online sources. The results show that the applied models performed well than other techniques used for road anomalies identification.

AB This article reports on a multirobot system that collaboratively obtains above-water, surface, and below-water information on a floating target. This capability allows a ship to autonomously survey and obtain situational awareness on a floating unresponsive target from a safe stand-off before inspecting it more closely or navigating around it. The target could be another ship, structure, or a navigational obstruction like an iceberg. The proposed solution is a collaborative system with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV), and an unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The UAV captures visual imagery to create a 3-D model of the target's above-water geometry using photogrammetry. The UUV surveys the target's submerged hull with integrated imaging and profiling bathymetric sonars. The USV hosts an intelligent mission-planning node which manages the robotic collaboration in a centralized architecture by autonomously planning and distributing the missions for the UUV and UAV. The intelligent node also adaptively plans the USV's trajectory to support the other autonomous assets, specifically reducing and bounding the UUV's state-estimate error through collaborative localization. The resulting above- and below-water sensor data is fused at the waterplane, using a sliding correlation algorithm, to yield a 3-D representation of the floating unresponsive target. The contributions from this article include the cross-domain robotic collaboration and autonomous mission-planning toward acquiring and fusing data from heterogeneous robots. The autonomous mission-planning and data-merging algorithms are presented. The setup and results from simulations and in-water testing with an UUV, USV, and UAV are described.

AB Incidents of hydraulic or oil spills in the oceans/seas or ports occur with some regularity during the exploitation, production and transportation of petroleum products. Immediate, safe, effective and environmentally friendly measures must be adopted to reduce the impact of the oil spill on marine life. Due to the difficulty to detect and clean these areas, semi-autonomous vehicles can make a significant contribution by implementing a cooperative and coordinated response. The paper proposes a concept study of Hybrid Monitoring Detection and Cleaning System (HMDCS-UV) for a maritime region using semi-autonomous unmanned vehicles. This system is based on a cooperative decision architecture for an unmanned aerial vehicle to monitor and detect dirty zones (i.e., hydraulic spills), and clean them up using a swarm of unmanned surface vehicles. The proposed solutions were implemented in a real cloud and were evaluated using different simulation scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed HMDCS-UV can detect and reduce the level of hydraulic pollution in maritime regions with a significant gain in terms of energy consumption.

AB This study focuses on motion planning and reference trajectory tracking control of an autonomous agricultural vehicle to achieve precise row following and turning. The smooth time-varying feedback control method was adapted to the system to generate the required control commands. The mathematical representations for motion planning and controllers were constructed based on the car-like robot model. An algorithm to detect trees and rows of trees of an orchard was developed using the Hough transform approach. A new type of turning procedure, called knot-like turning, was proposed to perform turning from one row to another. A simulation environment was created to test and analyze the developed system. To obtain the real data from a field, the trees and rows of trees of a cherry orchard were scanned using a laser scanner rangefinder sensor. Then, the scanned data were moved to the simulation environment to generate the desired trajectory, which was followed by an autonomous agricultural vehicle. The simulation environment made it possible to determine the performance of the proposed motion planning, reference trajectory generation, tracking control and turning procedures. The results presented here indicate that the proposed methodology could be used for desired trajectory tracking tasks for agricultural operations in the case that minimum tracking errors in both straight and turning motions are needed.

AB Due to the particularity of the structure, the dynamic properties of multiunit articulated rubber-wheel autonomous rail rapid transit system are very complex, which increases the difficulty of studying its braking stability. In this paper, a dynamic analysis model for the emergency braking of a multiunit articulated rubber-wheel autonomous rail rapid transit system is established by introducing the axle load transfer, suspension deformation compatibility equation, articulation force relationship equations, etc. Based on an in-depth analysis of the risks of the lateral swing instability and their formation mechanisms, an active control strategy for the multiunit articulated rubber-wheel autonomous rail rapid transit system under emergency braking conditions is innovatively proposed to ensure the stability of the vehicle, with the shortest braking distance as the optimization goal. Through simulation and experimentation, the established dynamic model is confirmed to approach the real vehicle well, and the feasibility of the active control strategy is proved.

AB Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly enabling firms to develop services that utilize autonomous vehicles (AVs). Yet, there are significant psychological barriers to adoption, and insights from extant literature are insufficient to understand customer emotions regarding AV services. To allow for a holistic exploration of customer perspectives, we synthesize multidisciplinary literature to develop the Customer Responses to Unmanned Intelligent-transport Services based on Emotions (CRUISE) framework, which lays the foundation for improved strategizing, targeting, and positioning of AV services. We subsequently provide empirical support for several propositions underpinning the CRUISE framework using representative multinational panel data (N = 27,565) and an implicit association test (N = 300). We discover four distinct customer segments based on their preferred degree of service autonomy and service risk. The segments also differ in terms of the valence and intensity of emotional responses to fully autonomous vehicle services. Additionally, exposure to positive information about AV services negatively correlates with the likelihood of membership in the two most resistant segments. Our contribution to service research is chiefly twofold; we provide: 1) a formal treatise of AV services, emphasizing their uniqueness and breadth of application, and 2) empirically validated managerial directions for effective strategizing based on the CRUISE framework.

AB One promising area that can be serviced by edge computing in real-time is autonomous driving. Fully self-driving vehicles can operate on roads and in buildings, such as indoor parking lots, using various sensors and communication modules. However, because the communication between indoor parking lots and the outside world is limited, and autonomous vehicles currently lack the real-time performance capabilities needed to process all information independently, it is necessary to develop a control scheme for fully self-driving vehicles in indoor settings. In this study, we propose a smart parking lot for self-driving vehicles based on edge cluster computing. A smart parking lot consists of fixed edges and mobile edge vehicles and uses grid maps for parking lot management. To evaluate the performance of smart parking, we compared parking time and moving distance in existing parking environments. Furthermore, the resource cost and number of data transmissions were analyzed to confirm the number of edges for effective service provision and maintenance.

AB Intersection management is one of the most representative applications of intelligent vehicles with connected and autonomous functions. The connectivity provides environmental information that a single vehicle cannot sense, and the autonomy supports precise vehicular control that a human driver cannot achieve. Intersection management solves the fundamental conflict resolution problem for vehicles-two vehicles should not appear at the same location at the same time, and, if they intend to do that, an order should be decided to optimize certain objectives such as the traffic throughput or smoothness. In this paper, we first propose a graph-based model for intersection management. The model is general and applicable to different granularities of intersections and other conflicting scenarios. We then derive formal verification approaches which can guarantee deadlock-freeness. Based on the graph-based model and the verification approaches, we develop a centralized cycle removal algorithm for the graph-based model to schedule vehicles to go through the intersection safely (without collisions) and efficiently without deadlocks. Experimental results demonstrate the expressiveness of the proposed model and the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

AB Occupancy Grid maps provide a probabilistic representation of space which is important for a variety of robotic applications like path planning and autonomous manipulation. In this paper, a SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) framework capable of obtaining this representation online is presented. The H-SLAM (Hilbert Maps SLAM) is based on Hilbert Map representation and uses a Particle Filter to represent the robot state. Hilbert Maps offer a continuous probabilistic representation with a small memory footprint. We present a series of experimental results carried both in simulation and with real AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles). These results demonstrate that our approach is able to represent the environment more consistently while capable of running online.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is becoming one of the most promising alternatives to improve mobility for people with disabilities. Nevertheless, how people with disabilities perceive AV as transportation services has not been explored. Also, limited information exists about how public transit agencies comprehend and perceive autonomous vehicle transportation (AVT) services. This study discusses mobility issues for people with disabilities and explores the potential of AVT to serve that population, particularly those with visual impairments or physical disabilities. Researchers conducted six focus groups comprising people with disabilities (N = 23) and public transit service experts (N = 10) in Austin, Texas and Houston, Texas. Each session was audio-recorded and analyzed using conventional content analysis. This study identified people with disabilities' mobility issues related to: (1) current transit services (including fixed-route and paratransit services) and (2) the quality of neighborhood built environments. Both people with disabilities and transit experts expected that AVT could mitigate current mobility issues, especially in improved built environments. However, participants with disabilities also expressed concerns and anxieties regarding AVT. Transit experts agreed that more targeted strategies would be needed to overcome possible barriers to AVT for people with disabilities. This study provides insights on shaping AVT strategies and policies relevant to improving mobility for people with disabilities. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous marine vehicles instrumented with seismic sensors allow for new efficient seismic survey designs. One such design is the swarm survey, where a group, or swarm, of slow moving autonomous marine vehicles record seismic data from shots fired by a source vessel sailing around circles within the swarm. The size of the swarm is dictated by the maximum offset requirement of the survey, and it can be shaped to acquire wide- and full-azimuth data. The swarm survey design equation describes the relationship between the source and receiver positions of the survey and the subsurface coverage or fold. It is used to adapt the swarm to the seismic survey requirements and to calculate survey duration time estimates as function of available equipment. It is shown that a survey conducted by a slowly moving swarm requires six times fewer shots than an equivalent seabed node survey conducted over 85.5 km(2). Swarm surveys can also be adapted to efficiently conduct infill surveys and replace multi-vessel undershoots. The efficiency of the survey can further be increased when the autonomous marine vehicles are towing short streamers with multiple receivers. Synthetic tests show that the seismic images for swarm surveys are comparable to those from streamer surveys, while little variation in image quality is found when reducing the number of autonomous marine vehicles but equipping them with a short streamer with multiple receivers.

AB Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) could provide inexpensive mobility on-demand services. In addition, the autonomous vehicle technology could facilitate the implementation of dynamic ride-sharing (DRS). The widespread adoption of SAVs could provide benefits to society, but also entail risks. For the design of effective policies aiming to realize the advantages of SAVs, a better understanding of how SAVs may be adopted is necessary. This article intends to advance future research about the travel behavior impacts of SAVs, by identifying the characteristics of users who are likely to adopt SAV services and by eliciting willingness to pay measures for service attributes. For this purpose, a stated choice survey was conducted and analyzed, using a mixed logit model. The results show that service attributes including travel cost, travel time and waiting time may be critical determinants of the use of SAVs and the acceptance of DRS. Differences in willingness to pay for service attributes indicate that SAVs with DRS and SAVs without DRS are perceived as two distinct mobility options. The results imply that the adoption of SAVs may differ across cohorts, whereby young individuals and individuals with multimodal travel patterns may be more likely to adopt SAVs. The methodological limitations of the study are also acknowledged. Despite a potential hypothetical bias, the results capture the directionality and relative importance of the attributes of interest.

We focus on three different aspects of the problem, battery chemistry, pack management and in situ charging. We look at a number of choices for battery chemistry and evaluate these based on the requirements of maximizing power density and low temperature operation particular to AUVs. We look at the issues involved in combining individual cells into large battery packs and at the problems associated with battery monitoring, and the charging and discharging of packs in a typical AUV application. Finally, we present a methodology for charging an AUV battery pack in situ in support of long term deployments at remote sites.

AB Motion sickness in self-driving cars is a key human factor that aggravates the passengers' health in autonomous vehicles and is investigated in the following pages. As drivers turn into passengers and passengers dwell into other activities, the probability of car sickness is inevitable in self-driving cars. Path planning could serve an important role in reducing sickness. The present study establishes thresholds that contribute to motion sickness from a vehicle's dynamic point of view to generate at first the most susceptible reference track to motion sickness, then redesigned using B-spline, Bezier, and Hermite curves to investigate the thresholds. Trajectory tracking of an eight degree of freedom vehicle model within the Autodriver algorithm is then studied using curvature dependent and curvature independent controllers to draw a comparison. Results are then compared and evaluated to find the optimal transition curve to minimize motion sickness probability. Furthermore, the findings are applied to lane changing maneuvers using various transition curves. Results indicate that four out of five of the motion sickness thresholds were successfully addressed in this investigation. Further research is recommended to address the fifth motion sickness threshold by utilizing the transition curve's key characteristics like local control and non-uniformity.

AB Several types of vehicles including sedans, trucks, and buses simultaneously navigate roads. Information on the length and width of vehicles can be useful for tracking in scenarios such as autonomous driving. In this Letter, a vehicle-length estimation method using data from automotive frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radars is proposed. Based on the similarity of the range profile between up-and down-chirp spectra, the authors can consistently determine the vehicle length. In addition, they consider the generation of different targets for long vehicles. Therefore, the proposed method can adaptively estimate the vehicle length. The authors verify the feasibility of the proposed method using on-road measurement data.

AB With the developments in underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) technology, UWOC can be used in conjunction with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for high-speed data sharing among the vehicle formation during underwater exploration. A beam alignment problem arises during communication due to the transmission range, external disturbances and noise, and uncertainties in the AUV dynamic model. In this article, we propose an acoustic navigation method to guide the alignment process without requiring beam directors, light intensity sensors, and/or scanning algorithms as used in previous research. The AUVs need stably maintain a specific relative position and orientation for establishing an optical link. We model the alignment problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) that takes manipulation, navigation, and energy consumption of underwater vehicles into account. However, finding an efficient policy for the POMDP under high partial observability and environmental variability is challenging. Therefore, for successful policy optimization, we utilize the soft actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm together with AUV-specific belief updates and reward shaping based curriculum learning. Our approach outperformed baseline approaches in a simulation environment and successfully performed the beam alignment process from one AUV to another on the real AUV Tri-TON 2.

AB As one of the core issues of autonomous vehicles, vehicle motion control directly affects vehicle safety and user experience. Therefore, it is expected to design a simple, reliable, and robust path following the controller that can handle complex situations. To deal with the longitudinal motion control problem, a speed tracking controller based on sliding mode control with nonlinear conditional integrator is proposed, and its stability is proved by the Lyapunov theory. Then, a linear parameter varying model predictive control (LPV-MPC) based lateral controller is formulated that the optimization problem is solved by CVXGEN. The nonlinear active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) method is applied to the second lateral controller that is easy to be implemented and robust to parametric uncertainties and disturbances, and the pure pursuit algorithm serves as a benchmark. Simulation results in different scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes, and a comparison is made to highlight the advantages and drawbacks. It can be concluded that the LPV-MPC has some trouble to handle uncertainties while the nonlinear ADRC performs slight worse tracking but has strong robustness. With the parallel development of the control theory and computing power, robust MPC may be the future direction.

DE Autonomous underwater vehicle; Backstepping; Nonlinear dynamics;

ID FEEDBACK-CONTROL; MODEL; AUVS; DESIGN
AB Designs of hybrid autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), which use internal actuators instead of control surfaces to steer, have emerged recently in the ocean engineering community. This paper focuses on the heading autopilot design for a REMUS AUV by using an internal moving mass. A nonlinear dynamical system is first derived which describes the horizontal-plane motion of the vehicle coupled with an internal moving mass. It is shown that a displacement of the internal mass in the sway direction can affect the flow of the dynamical system in phase space. Using displacement as the system input, a LQR controller is designed to stabilize the heading angle of the vehicle by taking advantage of the position and inertia of the internal moving mass. The linear controller cannot deal with large perturbations due to the constraints on the maximum displacement and movement speed of the internal moving mass. Consequently, a tunnel thruster is added to the design in order to address the problem. A nonlinear full state feedback law is derived based on backstepping and Lyapunov redesign technique to control the displacement of the internal mass and the force exerted by the tunnel thruster. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The number of studies on Autonomous Vehicle (AV) ethics discussing decision-making algorithms has increased rapidly, especially since 2017. Many of these studies handle AV ethics through the eye of the trolley problem regarding various moral values, regulations, and matters of law. However, the literature of this field lacks an approach to weighting and prioritizing necessary parameters that need to be considered while making a moral decision to provide insights about AVs' decision-making algorithms and related legislations as far as we know. This paper bridges the gap in the literature and prioritizes some main criteria indicated by the literature by employing the best-worst method in interval type-2 fuzzy sets based on the evaluations of five experts from different disciplines of philosophy, philosophy of law, and transportation. The criteria included in the weighting were selected according to expert opinions and to the qualitative analysis carried out by coding past studies. The weighing process includes a comparison of four different approaches to the best-worst method. The paper's findings reveal that social status is the most important criterion, while gender is the least important one. This paper is expected to provide valuable practical insights for Autonomous Vehicle (AV) software developers in addition to its theoretical contribution.

ID TRACKING
AB Autonomous security unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently gained popularity as an effective solution for accomplishing target/intrusion detection and tracking tasks with little or no human intervention. In this context, we aim at developing an autonomous UAV system for detecting a dynamic and uncertain intrusion within an area, in which the intruder/target moves from one location to another within the area according to an unknown random distribution. The problem of finding an uncertain target while considering the energy causality constraint of the UAV's battery and the uncertainty of the target movement is mathematically formulated as a search benefit maximization problem, which cannot be directly optimized due to the uncertain unknown target movement. Thus, we reformulate the optimization problem as a Markov-decision process that can be solved using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. Then, we implement an RL-based algorithm to solve the reformulated benefit maximization problem by enabling the UAV to autonomously learn the dynamics of the intruder/target. Specifically, different design variants of the RL-based algorithm are implemented that differ in the used temporal difference methods (i.e., Q-learning or state-action-reward-state-action), and in the exploration algorithms (convergence-based or $\epsilon$-greedy). Simulation results show RL algorithms' superiority and effectiveness over existing random and circular target detection algorithms.

In this work, we describe a simulation framework that can help engineering students who are starting out in the field of aerial robotics to acquire the necessary competences and skills for the development of autonomous drone navigation systems. In our framework, drone behavior is defined in a graphical way, by means of very intuitive state machines, whereas low-level control details have been abstracted. We show how the framework can be used to develop a navigation system proposal according to the rules of the "ESII Drone Challenge" student competition. We also show how the proposal can be evaluated in different test scenarios.

AB Monitoring and patrolling large water resources is a major challenge for nature conservation. The problem of acquiring data of an underlying environment that usually changes within time involves a proper formulation of the information. The use of Autonomous Surface Vehicles equipped with water quality sensor modules can serve as an early-warning system for contamination peak-detection, algae blooms monitoring, or oil-spill scenarios. In addition to information gathering, the vehicle must plan routes that are free of obstacles on non-convex static and dynamics maps. This work proposes a novel framework to obtain a collision-free policy using deterministic knowledge of the environment by means of a censoring operator and noisy networks that addresses the informative path planning with emphasis in temporal patrolling. Using information gain as a measure of the uncertainty reduction over data, it is proposed a Deep Q-Learning algorithm improved by a Q-Censoring mechanism for model-based obstacle avoidance. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for both cases in the Ypacarai monitorization task. Simulations showed that the use of noisy-networks are a good choice for enhanced exploration, with 3 times less redundancy in the paths with respect to - greedy policy. Previous coverage strategies are also outperformed both in the accuracy of the obtained contamination model by a 13% on average and by a 37% in the detection of dangerous contamination peaks. Finally, the achieved results indicate the appropriateness of the proposed framework for monitoring scenarios with autonomous vehicles.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Vehicle collision avoidance system is a kind of auxiliary driving system based on vehicle active safety, which can assist the driver to take the initiative to avoid obstacles under certain conditions, so as to effectively improve the driving safety of vehicle. This paper presents a collision avoidance system for an autonomous vehicle based on an active front steering, which mainly consists of a path planner and a robust tracking controller. A path planner is designed based on polynomial parameterization optimized by simulated annealing algorithm, which plans an evasive trajectory to bypass the obstacle and avoid crashes. The dynamic models of the AFS system, vehicle as well as the driver model are established, and based on these, a robust tracking controller is proposed, which controls the system to resist external disturbances and work in accordance with the planning trajectory. The proposed collision avoidance system is testified through CarSim and Simulink combined simulation platform. The simulation results show that it can effectively track the planning trajectory, and improve the steering stability and anti-interference performance of the vehicle.

AB The tracking of flying insects is one of the main challenges in the field of ecosystem and biodiversity protection. In the case of invasive insects such as Asian hornets, extensive considerations must be made in estimating the habitat because of the limitations of available sensors and environmental uncertainty. In this study, we propose an approach for localizing and autonomously tracking radio-tagged flying insects and developing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based robotic system. The extended Kalman filter is applied to the received signal strength emitted from a radio telemetry transmitter to estimate the insect's position while reducing the measurement error and noise. The proposed autonomous tracking strategy involves a method in which the UAV rotates around one point to measure the signal strength and control its position in relation to the direction of the strongest signal. We also designed a system architecture that includes a tracking sensor system and a UAV system for radio-tagged flying insects. The effectiveness of the proposed system for estimating and autonomously tracking the target position was evaluated via numerical dynamics simulation. Furthermore, feasibility tests with unmanned ground vehicle replacements for insects and UAVs were performed to validate the proposed approach. Finally, to verify the UAV system, field tests were conducted to track a fixed radio-tagged flying target on a vast flatland. This study is unique because we propose and validate a novel mobile robot-based tracking system to localize radio tags of flying insects.

AB Safety considerations call for deployment of autonomous ground vehicles in defense and high risk zones for transport of goods from one point to another. Such vehicles face the threat of an intelligent autonomous adversary that may disrupt the transfer of material. This article investigates the challenges involved in autonomous protection of a delivery agent, via a land-based rescue agent, before interception of the delivery agent by the adversary occurs. In particular, we study how effectively an adversary equipped with a vision sensor can be handled by an autonomous rescue agent operating without vision support and relying only on wireless communication with the delivery agent. Taking capabilities and weights of the three vehicles into account, the delivery agent is assumed to be the slowest while the adversary operates at the highest speed among the three vehicles. A geometric framework based on Apollonius circles is proposed to analyze the interaction between the delivery and rescue agents. The adversary's speed and its moves (based on the direction of the delivery agent) are taken into account, along with the Apollonius circles for the rescue-delivery agent pair, to determine the possibility of capture. Regions in the plane where the delivery and rescue agents can meet, prior to a capture by the adversary, are obtained to compute safe regions for the delivery agent. Algorithms adopted by the delivery agent, rescue agent, and the adversary are described. We, then, explore the challenges in rescue of multiple delivery agents from a vision-guided adversary by introducing additional rescue agents. In particular, we study protection of k delivery agents (from an adversary) via k rescue agents. Algorithms to compute 1) multiple meeting points, one each for a delivery agent-rescue agent pair and 2) the strategy of the adversary to capture any one of the k delivery agents are presented. Experiments with multiple agents show that the delivery and rescue agents can execute their strategies using simply low-end microcontrollers without external memory.

AB Older adults face outdoor mobility challenges due to age-related changes and problems linked to the transportation system. The advent of fully-autonomous vehicles (AVs) is expected to benefit older adults by facilitating their outdoor mobility. However, research exploring the implications of AVs from older adults? perspective is limited. This study explores older adults? perception of the opportunities and concerns regarding AVs, in relation to their outdoor mobility needs and challenges. Using a qualitative design, we explore these issues based on in-depth interviews conducted with participants (?65 years) in Greater Manchester, UK. The results revealed that older adults perceive opportunities in AVs enhancing their physical activity, promoting social interaction and offering stress-free door-to-door mobility. They, however, expressed concerns including safety, cost, possible erosion of road etiquettes and a desirable driving culture as a result of automation, a lack of social interaction with a human driver, and possible difficulties in using AVs. The participants? most preferred use options (i.e., public transport and shared autonomous services) are grounded in their need for social interaction, physical activity, safe and less stressful, and affordable travel. The implications of these findings for policy at the intersection of mobility and healthy ageing in future cities are discussed.

AB The unpredictable nature of the marine environment, combined with nonlinear dynamics and parameter uncertainty of underwater vehicles makes the control system design for such vehicles a challenging task. Based on these issues, hybridizing robustness and adaptation in the control system could result in more successful marine missions. This article proposes a robust adaptive control (RAC) scheme for trajectory tracking of an autonomous underwater vehicle. The proposed RAC scheme has been developed by exploiting the advantages of a robust sliding mode controller and an adaptation law. Lyapunov arguments are proposed to prove the exponential stability and finite-time convergence of the resulting closed-loop dynamics tracking error to an invariant set, S (very close to zero). Scenarios-based real-time experiments are conducted with the Leonard ROV prototype to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAC approach. The control design performance indices (root mean square error, integral absolute error, and integral square error) and a comparative analysis with a recent control scheme from the literature confirm the interest of the proposed RAC scheme for marine applications.

AB This article focuses on an industrial system for the intelligent inspection of subsea cables based on a flight-style autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that tracks the route of subsea cable guided by electromagnetic localization signals. The intelligent inspection system consists of electromagnetic localization and autonomous tracking control modules. The electromagnetic localization algorithm for subsea cable is geometrically derived based on the electromagnetic sequences measured with two triaxial sensors that are symmetrically mounted on the forewings of a flight-style AUV. The argument results on the singularity, sensitivity, and consistency of the localization algorithm provide guidelines for designing the cable-tracking AUV prototypes and planning the near-bottom cable-tracking tasks. Subsequently, the cable-tracking control schemes for decoupled AUV heading and diving subsystems are developed by using the localization results. Particularly, the vector field guidance based on the localization results is designed to overcome the challenges, including underactuation and the lack of cable-tracking error dynamics. To minimize the electromagnetic noise interference and to relax the dependence on the accurate AUV hydrodynamics, the kinematic virtual control signals are filtered with low-pass filters, and neural networks are applied to approximate dynamics. Finally, an integrated simulation study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed electromagnetic localization-guided autonomous cable-tracking system.

AB The developed experimental models of self-driving car demonstrate high accuracy (about 99%), but there is still a need to improve the overall safety of real traffic on the roads. Especially when there are people in the car, if the autonomous vehicle loses control on the road, the quick intervention to prevent a possible crash or a more serious road accident can be only through voice com-mands between the person and the execution control devices of self-driving car. The existing self-driving car control models are mainly based on incoming from mounted on the autonomous vehicle video cameras information, processed from deep learning neural networks and artificial intelligence. This paper proposes to extend these models with voice commands recognition, spoken by a person in the car, in order to correct the self-driving car movement, to prevent possi-ble traffic accidents, and therefore to increase traffic safety. For this purpose deep learning neural network with artificial intelligence is developed to recog-nize the spoken by the person voice commands, which can be interpreted by the executive control devices of the autonomous vehicle. The presented results from simulation tests show the ability of the proposed extended self-driving car control model to correct with voice commands the self-driving car motion on the road leading to essential increase of the safety of traffic.

AB Recently, research concerning autonomous self-driving vehicles has become very popular. In autonomous vehicles (AVs), different decision-making and learning architectures have been proposed to predict multiple tasks (MTs) or MTs from various datasets or to improve performance among different MTs. In this paper, a novel and unified multitask learning framework, called Multi-Modal DenseNet (M-2-DenseNet), is proposed to predict MTs in a single network in which three long short-term memory units act as the output (MTs). Accordingly, the proposed M-2-DenseNet can predict three different motion decision-making tasks, i.e., the steering angle, speed, and throttle, to control AV driving. Moreover, M-2-DenseNet can greatly reduce the time complexity (e.g., to less than 5 ms) because the different prediction tasks can be predicted simultaneously. We conduct comprehensive experiments with the lane-keeping task based on two control mechanisms using the proposed M-2-DenseNet and other existing methods to evaluate the performance. The experiments demonstrate that M-2-DenseNet significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with the accuracies of the three control tasks being approximately 98%, 99%, and 98%, respectively. The mean squared error between the predicted value and the ground truth is reported in the experiments, with values for the steering angle, speed, and throttle of 0.0250, 0.0210, and 0.0242, respectively.

AB As autonomous robot and sensor technologies have advanced, utilisation of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) in material handling has grown quickly, owing especially to their scalability and versatility compared with automated guided vehicles (AGVs). In order to take full advantage of AMRs, in this paper, we address an AMR scheduling and routing problem by dividing the entire problem into three sub-problems: path finding, vehicle routing, and conflict resolution. We first discuss the previous literature on characteristics of each sub-problem. We then present a comprehensive framework for minimising total tardiness of transportation requests with consideration of conflicts between routes. First, the shortest paths between all locations are calculated with A*. Based on the shortest paths, for vehicle routing, we propose a new local search algorithm called COntextual-Bandit-based Adaptive Local search with Tree-based regression (COBALT), which utilises the contextual bandit to select the best operator in consideration of contexts. After routing of AMRs, an agent-based model with states and protocols resolves collisions and deadlocks in a decentralised way. The results indicate that the proposed framework can improve the performance of AMR scheduling for conflict-free routes and that, especially for vehicle routing, COBALT outperforms the other algorithms in terms of average total tardiness.

AB A current trend in automotive research is autonomous driving. For the proper testing and validation of automated driving functions a reference vehicle state is required. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are useful in the automation of the vehicles because of their practicality and accuracy. However, there are situations where the satellite signal is absent or unusable. This research work presents a methodology that addresses those situations, thus largely reducing the dependency of Inertial Navigation Systems (INSs) on the SatNav. The proposed methodology includes (1) a standstill recognition based on machine learning, (2) a detailed mathematical description of the horizontation of inertial measurements, (3) sensor fusion by means of statistical filtering, (4) an outlier detection for correction data, (5) a drift detector, and (6) a novel LiDAR-based Positioning Method (LbPM) for indoor navigation. The robustness and accuracy of the methodology are validated with a state-of-the-art INS with Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) correction data. The results obtained show a great improvement in the accuracy of vehicle state estimation under adverse driving conditions, such as when the correction data is corrupted, when there are extended periods with no correction data and in the case of drifting. The proposed LbPM method achieves an accuracy closely resembling that of a system with RTK.

AB Over the past several decades, the automobile industry has denoted significant research efforts to developing in-wheel-motor-driven autonomous ground vehicles (IWM-AGVs) with active front-wheel steering. One of the most fundamental issues for IWM-AGVs is path following, which is important for automated driving to ensure that the vehicle can track a target-planned path during local navigation. However, the path-following task may fail if the system experiences a stuck fault in the active front-wheel steering. In this paper, a fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategy is presented for the path following of IWM-AGVs in the presence of a stuck fault in the active front-wheel steering. For this purpose, differential steering is used to generate differential torque between the left and right wheels in IWM-AGVs, and an adaptive triple-step control approach is applied to realize coordinated lateral and longitudinal path-following maneuvering. The parameter uncertainties for the cornering stiffness and external disturbances are considered to make the vehicles robust to different driving environments. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is evaluated with a high-fidelity and full-car model based on the veDYNA-Simulink joint platform.

AB A new adaptive robust control scheme combining the disturbance-observer-based control (DOBC) with fuzzy adapted S-Surface control is proposed for trajectory tracking control of autonomous underwater vehicle. The main contribution of the proposed method is that control configuration does not require the bounds of uncertainty of the vehicle to be known and disturbances effect can be estimated and rejected. The proposed control law is mainly composed of three parts: a feed forward control along with disturbance estimator, S-Surface control and single input adaptive fuzzy proportional-integral (PI) compensator. The nominal feed forward controller specifies desired closed loop dynamics with extravagance from known preferred acceleration vector. Meanwhile, the disturbance observer and adaptive fuzzy PI control term to compensate the unknown effects that are disturbances and unmodeled dynamics. An additional term as S-Surface control assures fast convergence due to a nonlinear expression in to surface and also enhance stability of the underwater vehicle in oceanic environment. Moreover, the disturbance observer enhances the robustness performance of the adaptive fuzzy system for disturbances that cannot be modeled by fuzzy logic. The stability of closed loop controlled system is proven to be guaranteed according to Lyapunov theory. Finally, numerical simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control method.

AB Variable speed limits (VSLs) have a potential to improve mobility and safety of motorway through harmonisation of traffic flow. However, the success of VSL is highly dependent on drivers' compliance to the displayed speed limits. Emerging technologies in the field of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is likely to revolutionise the way VSL will be operated in the near future. VSL can be integrated with CAVs where CAVs will automatically obey the displayed speed limits. However, 100% penetration rate of CAVs is a long-term goal. At the initial stage of deployment, CAVs will coexist with manually driven vehicles on motorways. This study explores ways to implement VSL under a mixed traffic condition where CAVs and manually driven vehicles coexist in the traffic stream. A hybrid approach combining particle swarm optimisation with proportional-integrated-derivative is proposed to improve VSL implementation under a range of mixed traffic conditions. The simulation results showed that the proposed method successfully achieved the desired speed limits and rapidly stabilised the system at the initial and transient points at penetration rates of 50 and 75%, whereas the method encountered serious overshoots at lower penetration rates.

AB The task of increasing the accuracy and stabilization of the flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in the alpine environment is a complex problem. It is related to the evaluation of UAV flight parameters and control conditions for the operator's place. The purpose of the UAV's autonomous flight control is to ensure stable control of the UAV's flight parameters. Flight control systems are affected by various disturbances caused by both internal and external conditions. In general, the number of autonomous control systems corresponds to the number of degrees of freedom, which determines the flight of an autonomous vehicle. An important factor in assessing the quality of such a UAV is its readiness for an autonomous flight together with the level of its safe guidance on the route. The presented article focuses on the analysis of UAV flight control and the quality of prediction and elimination of errors that exist during maneuvers toward the place of a successful UAV landing. The aim of the article is to point out the solvability of the complexities of such a flight procedure with the evaluation of the readiness for the descent phase of the autonomous UAV. The given problem is caused by the social demand for the creation of a way of providing health care in the mountain area of the High Tatras in Slovakia. The existing database of data obtained from the flying vehicles used in Slovakia was compared with the data obtained from the simulated flights, with their subsequent evaluation in the MATLAB software (Version R2021b) environment.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB A safe trajectory planning for on-road autonomous driving is a challenging problem owing to the variety and complexity of driving environments. The problem should involve the consideration of numerous aspects such as road geometry, lane-structured roads, traffic regulations, traffic participants, and vehicle physical limitations. Furthermore, dynamically changing movements of surrounding vehicles make the problem more challenging. It requires the planner's ability to react to the changes in the driving environments in real time. To solve this problem, sampling and numerical optimization-based trajectory planners were introduced. However, these methods have their own limitations in generating a safe trajectory in these dynamic scenarios. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a hybrid trajectory planning scheme to integrate the strength of the sampling and optimization methods. With the sampling method for a lateral movement, the planner can deal with various trajectories with multiple maneuvers. This helps the planner to generate a reactive trajectory in a dynamically changing environment. The numerical optimization of a longitudinal movement enables the planner to adapt to diverse situations without restriction of predefined patterns for specific driving purposes. The proposed method was implemented with an embedded optimization coder and C++ environment. Based on this, its performance was evaluated through simulation and real driving tests in various on-road dynamic scenarios.

AB New mobility technologies and services could address a series of transport-related problems such as pollution, congestion, unpleasant travel experiences, as well as first- and last-mile in-connectivity. Understanding the key factors influencing adoption and enablers is critical to the rollout of the new mobility technologies and services. The objective of this paper is to conduct a systematic review of the new mobility technologies and services, especially on autonomous vehicles, drones, micromobility and Mobility as a Service (MaaS). The ultimate goal is to gain a deeper insight into the factors that affect the adoption or preferences of these technologies and services and thus provide policy implications at the strategic level. The results of the review identified several (1) shared, (2) exclusive, (3) opposing and (4) mixed impacts factors that strongly influence the uptake of new mobilities. The synthesised finding will contribute to policy decisions, particularly regarding the sequencing of the launch and development priorities of new mobility technologies and services. To encourage the uptake of new mobility technologies and services, further promotion would benefit from (1) embedding a spatio-temporal perspective, (2) undertaking a careful market segmentation and (3) a careful segmentation of technology and services based on features, application contexts and purposes.

AB This article deals with the issue of trajectory optimization of autonomous terrestrial vehicles on a specific range handled by the human driver. The main contributions of this paper are a genetic algorithm-potential field combined method for optimized trajectory planning, the definition of the multi-criteria optimization problem by including a time variable, dynamical vehicle constraints, obstacle motion for collision avoidance, and improvements on the attractive and repulsive potential field definitions. The main interests of the proposed method are its efficiency even in only arc-connected spaces with holes, trajectory optimality thanks to the genetic algorithm that minimizes multi-criteria optimization, reactivity thanks to the potential field through the consideration for nature and motion of obstacles, its orientation toward situations a human driver would consider, and finally the inclusion of constraints to avoid danger and to take into account vehicle dynamics. The global trajectory, optimized through genetic algorithm, is used as a reference in a fractional potential field, which is a reactive local path planning method. The repulsive potential field is made safer by adding fractional orders to the obstacles, and the attractive potential field is improved by creating a dynamical optimal target seen from a robust control point of view. This target replaces the unique attractive potential field point and avoids its drawbacks such as local minima. Autonomous car simulation results are given for a crossroad and an overtaking scenarios.

AB Research and development in the field of autonomous vehicles has increased along with related work on automated driving (AD) software. Thorough testing of AD software using simulations must be conducted in advance of testing AD cars on the road. Parameters of the many objects around an AD car, such as other cars, traffic lanes and pedestrians are required as inputs of the simulation. Therefore, the number of parameter combinations becomes extremely large. A combination of parameters is called a test case; hence, the challenge is to search collision test cases from the extremely large number of combinations. A rule-based method is the main focus because an explicit method of searching test cases is required in certain industries in the real world. In this study, a method of rule-based searching for collision test cases of autonomous vehicles simulations is proposed. Simulation models that have rules between an AD car and other cars are defined. Algorithms were also developed to search collision test cases that generate test cases incrementally. Experiments on AD simulations involving the simulation models of a three-lane highway and a signalised intersection were conducted. The results indicate the efficiency of the method.

AB Recently, the intelligent in-vehicle voice agent (IVVA) using natural language processing (NLP) and capable of having a conversation have been introduced in autonomous vehicles (AVs). The IVVA is expanding its role not only to provide driving information and vehicle condition updates to ensure safety, but also to communicate and empathize with drivers like a friend in order to provide a more enjoyable driving experience. Accordingly, various anthropomorphic techniques have been applied to IVVAs and their effects evaluated. There is a tendency to focus on identifying whether anthropomorphic techniques are effective or not, but consideration of the autonomous driving contexts (ADCs) has been insufficient. Therefore, this study compares and evaluates the effects of the ADC (e.g., emergency stop, navigation, and casual conversations) on the interaction experience (specifically, intimacy, trust, and intention to use) from human-IVVA conversations by analyzing two IVVAs with different levels of anthropomorphism. As a result, the IVVA with the higher level of anthropomorphism encouraged greater intimacy. An interaction effect was confirmed based on the ADC and the level of anthropomorphism. In addition, regarding trust and intention to use, the IVVA with greater anthropomorphism was evaluated with a higher trust level and a stronger intention to use in an emergency stop situation. But the IVVAs did not always provide a positive experience in other driving contexts. The results of this study suggest that when designing an IVVA for AVs, it is necessary to use a conversation strategy appropriate to the situation by recognizing the ADC, rather than simply considering an increase in anthropomorphism.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) are commonly used in many underwater applications. Recently, the usage of multi-rotor unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAV) for marine applications is receiving more attention in the literature. Usually, both platforms employ an inertial navigation system (INS), and aiding sensors for an accurate navigation solution. In AUV navigation, Doppler velocity log (DVL) is mainly used to aid the INS, while for UAVs, it is common to use global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) receivers. The fusion between the aiding sensor and the INS requires a definition of step size parameter in the estimation process. It is responsible for the solution frequency update and, eventually, its accuracy. The choice of the step size poses a tradeoff between computational load and navigation performance. Generally, the aiding sensors update frequency is considered much slower compared to the INS operating frequency (hundreds Hertz). Such high rate is unnecessary for most platforms, specifically for low dynamics AUVs. In this work, a supervised learning based adaptive tuning scheme to select the proper INS step size is proposed. To that end, a velocity error bound is defined, allowing the INS/DVL or the INS/GNSS fusion filter to act in a sub-optimal working conditions, and yet minimize the computational load. Results from simulations and field experiment show the benefits of using the proposed approach. In addition, the proposed framework can be applied to any other fusion scenarios between any type of sensors or platforms.

AB An accurate model is important for the engineer to design a robust controller for the autonomous underwater vehicle. There are two factors that make the identification difficult to get accurate parameters of an AUV model in practice. Firstly, the autonomous underwater vehicle model is a coupled six-degrees-of-freedom model, and each state of the kinetic model influences the other five states. Secondly, there are more than 100 hydrodynamic coefficients which have different effects, and some parameters are too small to be identified. This article proposes a simplified six-degrees-of-freedom model that contains the essential parameters and employs the multi-innovation least squares algorithm based on the recursive least squares algorithm to obtain the parameters. The multi-innovation least squares algorithm leverages several past errors to identify the parameters, and the identification results are more accurate than those of the recursive least squares algorithm. It collects the practical data through an experiment and designs a numerical program to identify the model parameters. Meanwhile, it compares the performances of the multi-innovation least squares algorithm with those of the recursive least squares algorithm and the least square method, the results show that the multi-innovation least squares algorithm is the most effective way to identify parameters for the simplified six-degrees-of-freedom model.

AB The decision-making under complex urban environment become one of the key issues that restricts the rapid development of the autonomous vehicles. The difficulty in making timely and accurate decisions like human beings under highly dynamic traffic environment is a major challenge for autonomous driving. Car-following has been regarded as the simplest but essential driving behavior among driving tasks and has received extensive attention from researchers around the world. This work addresses this problem and proposes a novel method RSAN (rough-set artificial neural network) to learn the decisions from excellent human drivers. A virtual urban traffic environment was built by PreScan and driving simulation was conducted to obtain a broad set of relevant data such as experienced drivers' behavior data and surrounding vehicles' motion data. Then, rough set was used to preprocess these data to extract the key influential factors on decision and reduce the impact of uncertain data and noise data. And the car-following decision was learned by neural network in which key factor was the input and acceleration was the output. The result shows the better convergence speed and the better decision accuracy of RSAN than ANN. Findings of this work contributes to the empirical understanding of driver's decision-making process and it provides a theoretical basis for the study of car-following decision-making under complex and dynamic environment.

AB With the increasing popularity of the autonomous vehicles, heterogeneous traffic flow of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driving vehicles (HDVs) will exist for long time. Based on single-lane mean expected velocity field model (MEV model), an improved two-lane heterogeneous car-following model (MEVTC model) is proposed which consid-ers the mean expected velocity field of main lane and mean velocity field of adjacent lane in a connected environment. The strength factor of two fields are key parameters. Linear and nonlinear methods are used to reveal the basic characteristics of traffic flow under the new model. Theoretical results show that greater parameters mean larger stability regions. The MEVTC model is verified by numerical simulation, the results show that comparing with MEV model, MEVTC model can reduce the headway fluctuation by 11.2% and increase the traffic flow by 4.2%. With increased strength factor of two fields, the traffic flow becomes more stable However, the influence of the adjacent lane field on vehicle driving is dramatically smaller than main lane field. In addition, the higher penetration rate of the AVs is also good for the stability of traffic flow. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB One of the major challenges that autonomous vehicles (AVs) face in an urban setting is communicating with other road users such as pedestrians. In this work, we investigated with what expressive behaviors we can endow AVs such that pedestrians readily recognize the underlying intent of the vehicles' movements. The purpose of our study was to test the impact of expressive stopping behaviors on pedestrians' decision to cross a road. We utilized a virtual reality (VR) environment in which participants would have to cross a street in the presence of an oncoming vehicle that may or may not stop. Next, we crafted several expressive AV behaviors conveying its intention to stop for the pedestrian. Then, for each expressive design we recorded how quickly a pedestrian determined that it was safe to cross the street. We also administered repeated surveys of their subjective experiences. Our findings suggest that expressive behaviors such as easing into a full stop or stopping farther away can help pedestrians make quicker decisions to cross the road. Additionally, stopping farther away from the pedestrian also resulted in higher subjective experience for sense of safety, confidence, and intention understanding. We propose further investigation into expressive behaviors such as easing into a stop and stopping farther away to convey yielding intentions to pedestrians in future work.(1)

AB This paper investigates utilizing the front-wheel differential drive-assisted steering (DDAS) to achieve the path-following control for independently actuated (IA) electric autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs), in the case of the complete failure of the active front-wheel steering system. DDAS, which is generated by the differential torque between the left and right wheels of IA electric vehicles, can be utilized to actuate the front wheels as the sole steering power when the regular steering system fails, and thus avoids dangerous consequences for AGVs. As an inherent emergency measure and an active safety control method for the steering system of electric vehicles, DDAS strategy is a valuable fault-tolerant control approach against active steering system failure. To improve the transient performance of the fault-tolerant control with the DDAS, a novel multiple-disturbance observer-based composite nonlinear feedback (CNF) approach is proposed to realize the path-following control for IA AGVs considering the tire force saturations. The disturbance observer is designed to estimate the external multiple disturbances with unknown bounds. CarSim-Simulink joint simulation results indicate that the proposed controller can effectively achieve the fault-tolerant control and improve the transient performance for path following in the faulted-steering situation.

AB Four-wheel steering (4WS) is an effective technique to improve handling performance and lateral stability of road vehicles. Conventionally, controllers utilise the driver's actions and vehicle dynamics to coordinate front and rear-axle steering. This paper proposes a novel approach for 4WS controller design, based on the concept of Artificial Flow Guidance (AFG), which relies on a spatially distributed motion reference through a two-dimensional vector field. This field provides high-level guidance while lower-level steering controllers to control axle centres motions relative to the flow. These flow vectors, computed in real-time via simple geometric construction, can be pre-computed globally to evaluate the guidance algorithm's efficacy. When controlling only the front axle, this same approach can function as an autonomous driving system. Relying solely on a spatial reference field and control targets' velocities enables the controller to work in a simple and robust fashion, without using a reference vehicle dynamics model or lengthy parameter tuning. The proposed approach's effectiveness is validated through co-simulation with MATLAB/Simulink and the CarMaker simulation platform. AFG control performance is found to be at least comparable to that of more complex 4WS controllers using methods such as MPC; in the cases considered, AFG provides superior path-tracking performance.

AB This research investigates the planar path planning method, particularly where straight survey line in ocean exploration is required. The smooth transition path between multiple straight survey segments in origin-departing and corner-cutting transition modes is studied. First, different transition modes of autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs) in practical ocean survey navigation are realized and distinguished. Based on the definition of different transition modes, the waypoints can be pre-assigned, generated online, or compatible with online and offline assignments. Second, to avoid wiggles of vehicles, zigzags of the tracking trajectory, and to satisfy the requirements on second-order parametric and geometric continuities, the Fermat's Spiral (FS) having advantages of low computational load and engineering practicability is selected to design the transition path between multiple straight segments. The scaling of FS segments is optimized by considering the maneuverability of AMVs. Besides, the FS is parameterized in both transition modes to simplify the subsequent guidance and control scenarios. Thirdly, the closed-form analysis on geometric and parametric continuities of spliced transition path are derived. Finally, based on the parameterized smooth path and a slender underactuated AUV, numerical simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of the FS-based path planning method under integrated origin-departing and corner-cutting transition modes.

AB We present an approach to endow an autonomous underwater vehicle with the capabilities to move through unexplored environments. To do so, we propose a computational framework for planning feasible and safe paths. The framework allows the vehicle to incrementally build a map of the surroundings, while simultaneously (re)planning a feasible path to a specified goal. To accomplish this, the framework considers motion constraints to plan feasible 3D paths, that is, those that meet the vehicle's motion capabilities. It also incorporates a risk function to avoid navigating close to nearby obstacles. Furthermore, the framework makes use of two strategies to ensure meeting online computation limitations. The first one is to reuse the last best known solution to eliminate time-consuming pruning routines. The second one is to opportunistically check the states' risk of collision. To evaluate the proposed approach, we use the Sparus II performing autonomous missions in different real-world scenarios. These experiments consist of simulated and in-water trials for different tasks. The conducted tasks include the exploration of challenging scenarios such as artificial marine structures, natural marine structures, and confined natural environments. All these applications allow us to extensively prove the efficacy of the presented approach, not only for constant-depth missions (2D), but, more important, for situations in which the vehicle must vary its depth (3D).

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are being promoted as an emerging technology with the potential to improve traffic efficiency and safety. However, the scarcity of publicly available AV crash data contributes to a limited understanding of safety issues for deploying AVs. To gain a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to AV crashes, this study created a unique dataset by combining 445 intersection AV crashes from the California Department of Motor Vehicles with detailed roadway geometric and traffic characteristic data. To address the issue of imbalanced data, the Borderline synthetic minority oversampling technique (BL-SMOTE) was utilized in this study. A framework for analyzing AV crash types at intersections was also developed using the Categorical gradient boosting (Catboost) and Bayesian networks (BNs) models. The results show that inappropriate vehicle maneuvers, such as sudden lane changes or speed control, can increase the likelihood of an AV being involved in a sideswipe crash. Additionally, in scenarios where the AADT of the major road is lower, AVs are more prone to rear-end crashes when proceeding. These findings can provide valuable insights for creating safety management strategies in different situations and improve the development of innovative car warning technologies, such as rear-end collision warnings.

AB The methods of data collection, processing, and assessment of the quality of the results of a survey conducted at the Southern Ionian Sea off the Messinian Peninsula, Greece are presented. Data were collected by the GEBCO-Nippon Foundation Alumni Team, competing in the Shell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE, during the Final Round of the competition. Data acquisition was conducted by the means of unmanned vehicles only. The mapping system was composed of a single deep water AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle), equipped with a high-resolution synthetic aperture sonar HISAS 1032 and multibeam echosounder EM 2040, partnered with a USV (Unmanned Surface Vessel). The USV provided positioning data as well as mapping the seafloor from the surface, using a hull-mounted multibeam echosounder EM 304. Bathymetry and imagery data were collected for 24 h and then processed for 48 h, with the extensive use of cloud technology and automatic data processing. Finally, all datasets were combined to generate a 5-m resolution bathymetric surface, as an example of the deep-water mapping capabilities of the unmanned vehicles' cooperation and their sensors' integration.

AB This paper derives a new maximum correntropy divided difference filter (DDF) to address the heavy-tailed measurement noise induced by non-Gaussian measurements in cooperative localization of autonomous underwater vehicles. By integrating the advantages of both the DDF and the maximum correntropy criterion, the proposed filter exhibits localization accuracy and robustness to address the heavy-tailed impulsive noise. The proposed maximum correntropy DDF has been tested through a lake trial. Experimental results indicate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm.

AB As self-driving technology advances, there is enormous potential to optimize fully autonomous vehicles (FAVs) for use by people who are blind and visually impaired (BVI). Today, BVI users often rely on ridesharing services for daily travel, which present both challenges and opportunities for researchers interested in the accessible design of FAVs. The parallels between current BVI travel experiences in rideshares and predictions that FAV services will adopt rideshared models presents an enticing opportunity to use ridesharing as a proxy for understanding BVI needs in future FAV transportation. However, a key challenge is identifying the extent to which FAVs should be designed to provide the same assistance that human drivers currently provide for BVI travelers in rideshares. To address this issue, ridesharing users with visual impairment (n = 187) within the United States completed a survey instrument designed to assess and compare desires for interactions, information, and assistance between human operated and fully autonomous rideshare vehicles, as well as the modality of information delivery (auditory and/or haptic). Results indicate strong support for access to environmental information (e.g., spatial information about the destination) and contextual information (e.g., progress along the route) across the trip with automated vehicles via natural language interactions. Although results suggest significantly less desire for social interaction with the AI "at the wheel" of FAVs when compared to human drivers, findings indicate that participants desire some social collaboration and human-in-theloop control during autonomous driving. By empirically comparing human and autonomous ridesharing and exploring both the information needs and modality preferences across information category, the study provides much-needed guidance for future design of humanlike, anthropomorphized, FAV AIs with important implications for social autonomous agents more generally. This study also speaks to the ways in which inclusive and accessible user interfaces should best support user needs across the range of vision loss in future transportation networks.

ID STOCHASTIC PETRI-NET; MODEL
AB Deadlock is an extreme traffic flow operational state during rush hours. Many literatures have studied autonomous vehicle coordination under the umbrella of deadlock-free conditions. These researches either assume the trajectories are fixed or state spaces are discrete and limited on structured road spaces or don't consider the influence of human-driven vehicles (HDV), which are not controllable from the system's viewpoint. This manuscript relaxes the above limitations and proposes a method to detect, avoid, and recover from deadlock for mixed autonomous vehicles flow. Firstly, two types of deadlocks, weak and strong , are defined based on deadlock properties. Next, two detection algorithms based on evasion distance propagation are proposed. After that, we present a cooperative control method to avoid deadlock based on chain-spillover-free and loop-free strategies. If a deadlock has already happened, cooperative protocols based on re-routing and backward-forward strategies are designed. The proposed model is tested in Carla. The results show that the deadlocks can be detected 13 seconds earlier than their occurrence, and it takes about 6 seconds to unlock the existing deadlock. The results also show that with the proposed deadlock avoidance algorithm, the traffic throughput can be increased by 35.7%, and with the proposed deadlock recovery protocol, the traffic throughput can be increased by another 18%.

AB This paper studies congestion-aware route-planning policies for intermodal Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems, whereby a fleet of autonomous vehicles provides on-demand mobility jointly with public transit under mixed traffic conditions (consisting of AMoD and private vehicles). First, we devise a network flow model to jointly optimize the AMoD routing and rebalancing strategies in a congestion-aware fashion by accounting for the endogenous impact of AMoD flows on travel time. Second, we capture the effect of exogenous traffic stemming from private vehicles adapting to the AMoD flows in a user-centric fashion by leveraging a sequential approach. Since our results are in terms of link flows, we then provide algorithms to retrieve the explicit recommended routes to users. Finally, we showcase our framework with two case-studies considering the transportation sub-networks in Eastern Massachusetts and New York City, respectively. Our results suggest that for high levels of demand, pure AMoD travel can be detrimental due to the additional traffic stemming from its rebalancing flows. However, blending AMoD with public transit, walking and micromobility options can significantly improve the overall system performance by leveraging the high-throughput of public transit combined with the flexibility of walking and micromobility.

AB The increasing popularity of autonomous vehicles has heightened the need to deploy robust systems that guarantee the safety and comfort of vehicle occupants. Such systems are required to monitor the presence and posture of occupants in real-time. This paper proposes a novel system that combines capacitive sensing with machine learning to achieve real-time occupant detection and posture recognition. The main constituent of the system is a capacitance-sensing mat that spans both the seat base (SB) and the backrest (BR) of a typical vehicle seat. The mat is connected to a sensing circuitry that continuously monitors variations in capacitance inside the mat to generate grayscale capacitance-sensing images (CSIs). The CSIs are real-time pictorial representations of the variations in capacitance caused within the mat due to changes in the position and the posture of occupants. The real-time CSIs then serve as inputs to a k-nearest-neighbors-based (k-NN) classifier that is capable of identifying different posture classes. The classifier is pre-trained using a previously acquired database consisting of a collection of CSIs belonging to known posture classes. Subsequently, the performance of the classifier is validated, and the system is deployed for real-time occupant detection and posture recognition.

AB Toll plazas are one kind of highway node that pose a challenge to the flow of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Some toll roads have open road tolling (ORT), which makes it easier and more efficient for AVs, but most toll plazas do not have ORT. The authors developed a decision model to assist AVs in choosing the right lane that involves two main indicators, the rod speed (SRi) and the decision-making value (DSRi). The decision model was applied to a six-lane toll plaza with manual toll collection (MTC), electronic toll collection (ETC), and electronic toll collection for AVs toll types. The suitable lane configurations for the varying percentages of AVs in traffic were as follows: at 10% AV, the optimal lane configuration was 4 MTC and 2 ETC/AV (4M2EA), at 30% AV it was 3M3EA, at 40%-60% AV it was 3M2EA1A, and at 70% AV it was 2M2EA2A. Thus AVs should share toll lanes with ETC manned vehicles before the population of AVs reaches 30%; after that dedicated lanes may be introduced. It was also concluded that a 10% increase in AVs reduces delays by 9% if the populations of ETC and MTC vehicles are equal. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

ID GUIDANCE
AB SCUBA diving activities are classified as high-risk due to the dangerous environment, dependency on technical equipment that ensures life support, reduced underwater navigation and communication capabilities all of which compromise diver safety. While autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have become irreplaceable tools for seabed exploration, monitoring, and mapping in various applications, they still lack the higher cognitive capabilities offered by a human diver. The research presented in this paper was carried out under the EU FP7 "CADDY-Cognitive Autonomous Diving Buddy". It aims to take advantage of both human diver and AUV complementary traits by making their synergy a potential solution for mitigation of state of the art diving challenges. The AUV increases diver safety by constantly observing the diver, provides navigation aiding by directing the diver and offers assistance (e.g., lights, tool fetching, etc.). The control algorithms proposed in the paper provide a foundation for implementing these services. These algorithms use measurements from stereo-camera, sonar and ultra-short baseline acoustic localization to ensure the vehicle constantly follows and observes the diver. Additionally, the vehicle maintains a relative formation with the diver to allow observation from multiple viewpoints and to aid underwater navigation by pointing towards the next point of interest. Performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated using results from pool experiments.

AB Optimization of autonomous underwater vehicle's shape is usually a multi-objective optimization problem, which is essential for autonomousunderwater navigation and manipulation. To overcome the inefficiency of computational fluid dynamics software during the optimization process and thelimitations of traditional single-objective optimization, a novel strategy combining genetic expression programming and crowding distance basedmulti-objective particle swarm algorithm is presented. Its central idea is as follows, several underwater vehicle shapes are analysed to obtain their waterresistances and determine the best underwater robot shape. Shape factor of the bow and shape factor of the stern are employed as design variables, and sample points are selected by the optimal latin hypercube design. Then gene expression programming method is used to establish the surrogate model of resistance and surrounded volume. After that, the surrogate model based on the gene expression programming method is compared with that based on the surface respond method. The results show the superiority of the GEP method. Then the resistance and surrounded volume are set as two optimized variables and Pareto optimal solutions are obtained by using multi-objective particle swarm algorithm. Finally, the optimization results are compared with the hydrodynamic calculations, which shows the method proposed in the paper can greatly reduce the cost of computation and improve the efficiency of optimal shape design for underwater vehicle.

AB A risk-averse preview-based Q-learning planner is presented for navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). To this end, the multilane road ahead of a vehicle is represented by a finite-state nonstationary Markov decision process (MDP). A risk assessment unit module is then presented, which leverages the preview information provided by sensors along with a stochastic reachability module to assign reward values to the MDP states and update them as scenarios develop. A sampling-based risk averse preview-based Q-learning algorithm is finally developed, which generates samples using the preview information and reward function to learn risk-averse optimal planning strategies without actual interaction with the environment. The risk factor is imposed on the objective function to avoid fluctuation of the Q values, which can jeopardize the vehicle's safety and/or performance. The overall hybrid automaton model of the system is leveraged to develop a feasibility check unit module that detects unfeasible plans and enables the planner system to react proactively to the changes of the environment. Finally, to verify the efficiency of the presented algorithm, its implementation on two highway driving scenarios of an AV in a varying traffic density is considered.

AB Microscopic traffic models (MTMs) are widely used for assessing the impacts of (connected) autonomous vehicles ((C)AVs). These models utilize car-following (CF) and lane-changing models to replicate the (C)AVs driving behaviors. Numerous studies are being lately published regarding the approximation of the driving behaviors of (C)AVs (especially CF behavior) with many state-of-the-art modelling methods. Still, there is no established CF model to mimic the accurate behavior of (C)AVs. Researchers often utilize existing mathematical CF models as well as limited data-driven models for (C)AVs modelling. Meanwhile, several studies conduct simulation-based impact assessments with various key performance indicators (KPIs). Identification of these KPIs is a crucial step for future studies. Hence, this paper presents a comprehensive outlook on different CF models with their adopted parameters for (C)AVs modelling and investigates how and in which aspects might the CF behaviors of (C)AVs are different from human-driven vehicles. In addition, the recent publications in data-driven CF models including their methodologies are explicitly discussed. This work also reviews simulation-based studies with the reported impacts and used KPIs. Finally, in light of the findings of this paper, several future research needs are highlighted.

ID CYBER SECURITY; ADOPTION
AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and intelligent transport systems are transforming individual driving behavior and thus, the vehicle industry and transport sector. However, increasing vehicle connectivity makes CAVs more susceptible to cyber-attacks, which is a barrier to consumers' CAV adoption. This study analyzes the types of information security threats consumers consider to be the most dangerous and consumer preference for the information security solution that protects their CAVs from such information security threats. We use stated preference data from a discrete choice experiment and a mixed logit model to reflect consumers' heterogeneity on information security threats and solutions. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of experiencing privacy leakage on attitudes toward CAV information security threats by dividing respondents into two groups. The results show that consumers regard communication failure and the unauthorized collection of personal information as dangerous information security threats, which implies that confidentiality and availability are more essential to CAV security than other factors. Moreover, convenience of use, such as having automatic updates and a security dashboard, is also important when purchasing a CAV information security solution. We also find that respondents who have experienced privacy leakage have a higher preference for protecting CAVs from information security threats than those who have not.

AB Powered by artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous vehicles (AVs) are one of the most disruptive technologies to reduce road incidents, improve road efficiency and enhance mobility for underserved populations. However, existing literature of AV adoption is either based on descriptive analysis or simple applications of conventional behavioral frameworks. Drawing on behavioral reasoning theory (BRT), we examine the effect of reasoning process on consumers' attitudes and intentions toward adopting AVs, and how their psychological traits moderates the relationships. By conducting a nationwide survey in China (n = 849), we identify positive (negative) effects of individuals' reasons for (against) adopting AVs on their adoption intentions for AVs, and positive influence of face consciousness on the reasoning process. More importantly, we find that the psychological trait of need for uniqueness strengthens the association between consumers' reasoning for AVs and their adoption intention, while the risk aversion trait intensifies the negative relationships between consumers' reasoning against AVs and their attitude/adoption intention. We contribute to the literature of AI adoption by establishing the important roles of consumers' reasons for and against such innovations. We also extend the BRT framework by identifying the roles of psychological traits in moderating the relationships among reasoning, attitude, and adoption intention.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are assumed to be a promising model of automatic emergency tasks in dynamic marine ecosystems. But, the real-time communication efficacy betwixt UAVs and base platforms is developing a serious challenge. The compact-sized powerful flying robots can be wirelessly controlled and accomplish end tasks with and without human involvement. UAVs still face severe challenges that limit the dream of completely autonomous unmanned flying machines. The main difficulties contain path planning and hindrance avoidance of such unmanned flying robots, which are mandatory but carry out the application-specific functionality in either indoor or outdoor environments. This study introduces a new Dispersal Foraging Strategy with Cuckoo Search Optimization based Path Planning (DFSCSO-PP) technique for UAV networks. In the presented DFSCSO-PP technique, the identification of optimal paths for data transmission is performed in the UAV network. In addition, the presented DFSCSO-PP technique involves the optimal allocation of resources while finding the optimal paths in the network. Moreover, the DFSCSO technique can be designed by integrating the DFS concept into the CSO method to avoid local optima problems. A widespread simulation analysis is performed to exhibit the enhanced outcome of the DFSCSO-PP approach. A detailed set of comparative studies assured the improved performance of the DFSCSO-PP technique over other approaches.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), also known as self-driving cars, are a potentially transformative technology, but developing and demonstrating AV safety remains an open question. AVs offer some unique challenges that stretch the limits of traditional safety engineering practices. Most current safety standards and methodologies in the AV industry were not originally intended for application to autonomous vehicles, and they have significant limitations and shortcomings. In this article, we analyze the literature to first build an argument that a new safety framework is needed for AVs. We then use the identified limitations of current methodologies as a basis to formulate a set of fundamental requirements that must be met by any proposed AV safety framework. We propose a new AV safety framework based on the Hybrid Causal Logic (HCL) methodology, which combines Event Sequence Diagrams (ESDs), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), and Bayesian Networks (BNs). The HCL framework is developed at a conceptual level and then evaluated versus the identified fundamental requirements. To further illustrate how the framework may meet the requirements, a simple example of an AV perception system scenario is developed using the HCL framework and evaluated. The results demonstrate that the HCL framework provides an integrated approach that has the potential to satisfy more completely the fundamental requirements than the current methodologies.

AB Objective: We investigated passenger's trust and preferences using subjective, qualitative, and psychophysiological measures while being driven either by human or automation in a field study and a driving simulator experiment. Background: The passenger's perspective has largely been neglected in autonomous driving research, although the change of roles from an active driver to a passive passenger is incontrovertible. Investigations of passenger's appraisals on self-driving vehicles often seem convoluted with active manual driving experiences instead of comparisons with being driven by humans. Method: We conducted an exploratory field study using an autonomous research vehicle (N = 11) and a follow-up experimental driving simulation (N = 24). Participants were driven on the same course by a human and an autonomous agent sitting on a passenger seat. Skin conductance, trust, and qualitative characteristics of the perceived driving situation were assessed. In addition, the effect of driving style (defensive vs. sporty) was evaluated in the simulator. Results: Both investigations revealed a close relation between subjective trust ratings and skin conductance, with increased trust and by trend reduced arousal for human compared with automation in control. Even though driving behavior was equivalent in the simulator when being driven by human and automation, passengers most preferred and trusted the human-defensive driver. Conclusion: Individual preferences for driving style and human or autonomous vehicle control influence trust and subjective driving characterizations. Application: The findings are applicable in human-automation research, reminding to not neglect subjective attributions and psychophysiological reactions as a result of ascribed control duties in relation to specific execution characteristics.

AB This study aims to examine and design operational strategies for mixed flows of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs). We propose a stylized model wherein utilitarian individuals either drive HVs or take privately operated AVs that are collectively dispatched. In the baseline mixed policy where AVs and HVs share the same lanes, we find that AVs under-join the traffic (queue) while HVs over-join. We identify a "crowding-out effect" such that AVs will tend to mitigate the over-joining HVs and reduce overall congestion/throughput. To improve the traffic efficiency of the baseline mixed policy, we consider a fully dedicated policy in which both AVs and HVs are segregated to different lanes and a partially dedicated policy in which only AVs enjoy dedicated lanes. We find that dedicated policies outperform the mixed policy in both social welfare and the aggregate throughput when the platooning effect is moderate or strong. Exact conditions are derived for the selection of fully dedicated policy and partially dedicated policy. Furthermore, we find that a carefully designed subsidy is necessary for the dedicated policy to simultaneously improve the social welfare and the throughput when the platooning effect is very weak. These results shed interesting light on the policy regulation for the emerging mixed autonomous paradigm: a dedicated policy with proper lane design and subsidy (if necessary) will improve both social welfare and aggregate throughput.

AB Through a survey of residents of Queensland's (Australia) capital Brisbane, living within 20 km of its central business district (CBD), this study measures their willingness to tradeoff ownership of conventional internal combustion engine cars (ICVs) for the impending advent of new forms of automotive transport. These forms embrace electric powertrains, on demand ride sharing and an autonomous (driverless) mode of operation.
   The choice experiment's outcome highlighted the willingness of participants to change their transportation habits. Only 16% adopted the neither (status quo option of retaining their privately owned car with 40% choosing the 80%/20% shared electric autonomous vehicles (SEAVs)/conventional option and 44% the 50%/20% option. Cost was revealed as the most important driver of choice although congestion induced extra travel time and number of serious accidents were also highly significant. Only increased urban space was not significant. Following viewing a video on the advantages of SEAVs only 11% of recipients chose the status quo option. Wealthier participants, commuters and married couples were now more likely to adopt SEAVs. But those with children and those who loved driving became less likely to do so. Younger people and those who lived closer to the CBD were shown to be less likely to reject SEAVs. (C) 2019 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With the increase of labor cost and the development of agricultural mechanization, standardized orchards suitable for autonomous operations of agricultural machinery will be a future development trend of the fruit-planting industry. For field-planting processes of standardized orchards, autonomous navigation of orchard vehicles in complex environments is the foundation of mechanized and intelligent field operations. In order to realize autonomous driving and path-tracking of vehicles in complex standardized orchards that involve much noise and interference between rows of fruit trees, an automatic navigation system was designed for orchard vehicles, based on 2D lasers. First, considering the agronomic requirements for orchard planting such as plant spacing, row spacing and trunk diameter, different filtering thresholds were established to eliminate discrete points of 2D laser point cloud data effectively. Euclidean clustering algorithm and the important geometric theorems of three points collinearity was used to extract the central feature points of the trunk, as the same time, navigation path was fitted based on the least square method. Secondly, an automatic navigation control algorithm was designed, and the fuzzy control was used to realize the dynamic adjustment of the apparent distance of the pure pursuit model. Finally, the reliability of the proposed approach was verified by simulation using MATLAB/Simulink, and field tests were carried out based on electric agricultural vehicle. Experimental results show that the method proposed in this study can effectively improve the precision of automatic navigation in complex orchard environment and realize the autonomous operation of orchard vehicles.

AB As the motion of pedestrians is largely unpredictable, situational awareness presents a challenge for safe autonomous driving in urban areas. In particular, conventional sensor information about the dynamic states involved in determining and predicting pedestrian motion, including the walking speed, is significantly affected by latency when pedestrians suddenly increase their pace. In this paper, we propose a framework for predicting the steady-state walking speed of sudden pedestrian movement at the early stage of walking after heel-off. Based on the analysis that some motion cues during gait initiation are related to the steady-state walking speed, a fuzzy inference framework for predicting the steady-state walking speed, where the related motion cues are input to the inference model, is developed. The proposed framework can accurately predict the steady-state walking speed, even at the end of the first gait cycle. Moreover, the future trajectory of the pedestrian can be predicted using the piecewise linear speed model. Using the proposed framework, installed on the edge server of the cooperative-intelligent transportation system (C-ITS), this study aims to ensure the safety of autonomous vehicles by enabling them to successfully navigate the danger caused by sudden pedestrian movement. Experimental results obtained from testing the system at a real urban intersection verify the value offered by the proposed framework.

AB Input saturations and uncertain dynamics are among the practical challenges in control of autonomous vehicles. Adaptive control is known as a proper method to deal with the uncertain dynamics of these systems. Therefore, incorporating the ability to confront with input saturation in adaptive controllers can be valuable. In this paper, an adaptive autopilot is presented for the pitch and yaw channels of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the presence of input saturations. This will be performed by combination of a model reference adaptive control (MRAC) with integral state feedback with a modern anti-windup (AW) compensator. MRAC with integral state feedback is commonly used in autonomous vehicles. However, some proper modifications need to be taken into account in order to cope with the saturation problem. To this end, a Riccati-based anti-windup (AW) compensator is employed. The presented technique is applied to the non-linear six degrees of freedom (DM model of an AUV and the obtained results are compared with that of its baseline method. Several simulation scenarios are executed in the pitch and yaw channels to evaluate the controller performance. Moreover, effectiveness of proposed adaptive controller is comprehensively investigated by implementing Monte Carlo simulations. The obtained results verify the performance of proposed method.

AB Changing lanes is a commonly-used technique for drivers to either overtake slow-moving cars or enter/exit highway ramps. Optional lane changes may save drivers travel time but increase the risk of collision with others. Drivers make such decisions based on experience and emotion rather than analysis, and thus may fail to select the best solution while in a dynamic state of flux. Unlike human drivers, autonomous vehicles can systematically analyze their surroundings and make real-time decisions accordingly. This paper develops a game theory-based lane-changing model by comparing two types of optimization methods. To realize our expectations, we need to first investigate the payoff function of drivers in discretionary lane-changing maneuvers and then quantify it in an equation of costs that trades-off safety and time-saving. After the evaluation for each alternative strategy combination, the results show that there exists a social gap in the discretionary lane-changing game. To deal with that problem, we provide some suggestions for future policy as well as autonomous vehicle controller designs, offering solutions to reduce the impact of disturbances and crashes caused by inappropriate lane changes, and also, inspire further research about more complex cases.

AB This study aims at modelling unassisted drivers' speed at the yellow onset to enhance Connected and Autonomous Vehicles applications at signalised intersections and maximise drivers' comfort. For this purpose, a total of 2442 real-life vehicle trajectories were analysed to extract driver behavioural measures (i.e. speed, acceleration, and distance to intersection) at different times before the yellow onset. These behavioural measures were used to integrate drivers' perceptual ability into modelling drivers' speed at the yellow onset. To develop these models, three machine learning techniques; namely, linear regression, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Networks have been adopted. The best model was a neural network model and was selected based on the goodness-of-fit of the test dataset which has an R-squared value of 0.97. The results indicate that the speed at the yellow onset can be estimated based on behavioural measures while accounting for drivers' perceptual ability. Also, the model can contribute to a V2I application by assisting the driver in a partially autonomous vehicle to avoid trapping in the dilemma zone and stop safely at signalised intersections. Also, the model can be used to recommend a comfortable riding speed, from a rider's perspective to a fully autonomous vehicle.

AB Electric vehicles require sufficient public charging infrastructure. This in turn necessitates detailed information on charging demand. In this paper we present a four-step approach to estimating public charging demand of electric vehicles. Previous methods are limited in their ability to provide differentiated results and adapt to future developments. Therefore, we account for user groups (private, carsharing, commercial), technical developments (vehicles, infrastructure), infrastructure availability, and carsharing development (operational area, business models, autonomous vehicles). Our approach also considers the interactions between these factors and allows for scenario analysis yielding the quantity and spatial distribution of public charging demand. We demonstrate our approach for Berlin, Germany. We find that the majority of public charging demand results from carsharing. This demand is concentrated in the city center, even when carsharing is available citywide. Public charging demand for commercial users is relatively low and located outside the city center. For private users, public charging demand shifts to the city center with an increasing market penetration of electric vehicles and technological advancements (increased range, charging speed). Public demand from private users increases dramatically when private infrastructure is absent. Finally, public charging demand shifts to the city center when private users do not have private infrastructure.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have a large potential to improve traffic safety but also pose some critical challenges. While AVs may help reduce crashes caused by human error, they still may experience failures of technologies and sensing, as well as decision-making errors in a mixed traffic environment. A disengagement refers to an AV transitioning control from autonomous systems to the trained test driver. The safety critical nature of disengagements makes it imperative to analyze disengagements and crashes together. This study analyzes both crashes and disengagements from real-world AV driving in California to fill the knowledge gap regarding the relationship between disengagements and crashes in a mixed traffic environment. A nested logit model was calibrated using three different outcomes: (1) disengagement with a crash, (2) disengagement with no crash, and (3) no disengagement with a crash. Furthermore, endogenous switching regime models were also calibrated to draw distinctions between the relation of disengagements and crashes while accounting for endogeneity effects. The results show that factors related to AV systems (such as software failures) and other roadway participants increase the propensity of a disengagement without a crash. Furthermore, AVs were observed to disengage less often as the technology matured over time. Marginal effects revealed an 8% decrease. The results thus suggest that disengagements are a part of AVs' safe performance and disengagement alerts may need to be triggered in order to avoid certain failures with current technology.

AB It is vital that autonomous vehicles acquire accurate and real-time information about objects in their vicinity, which fully guarantees the safety of the passengers and vehicle in various environments. Three-dimensional light detection and ranging (3D LIDAR) sensors can directly obtain the position and geometric structure of an object within its detection range, whereas the use of vision cameras is most suitable for object recognition. Accordingly, in this paper, we present a novel object detection and identification method that fuses the complementary information obtained by two types of sensors. First, we utilise 3D LIDAR data to generate accurate object-region proposals. Then, these candidates are mapped onto the image space from which regions of interest (ROI) of the proposals are selected and input to a convolutional neural network (CNN) for further object recognition. To precisely identify the sizes of all the objects, we combine the features of the last three layers of the CNN to extract multi-scale features from the ROIs. The evaluation results obtained on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that: (1) unlike sliding windows that produce thousands of candidate object-region proposals, 3D LIDAR provides an average of 86 real candidates per frame and the minimal recall rate is better than 95%, which greatly decreases the extraction time; (2) The average processing time for each frame of the proposed method is only 66.79 ms, which meets the real-time demand of autonomous vehicles; (3) The average identification accuracies of our method for cars and pedestrians at a moderate level of difficulty are 89.04% and 78.18%, respectively, which is better than those of most previous methods.

However, most of the UAV solutions have limitations related to their power supplies and the field of operation. Some of these restrictions can be overcome by implementing the cooperation between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). The purpose of this paper is to explore the problem of sensor fusion for autonomous landing of a UAV on the UGV by comparing the performance of precision landing algorithms using different sensor fusions to have precise and reliable information about the position and velocity.
   Design/methodology/approach - The difficulties in this scenario, among others, are different coordination systems and necessity for sensor data from air and ground. The most suitable solution seems to be the use of widely available Global Navigational Satellite System (GNSS) receivers. Unfortunately, the position measurements obtained from cheap receivers are encumbered with errors when desiring precision. The different approaches are based on the usage of sensor fusion of Inertial Navigation System and image processing. However most of these systems are very vulnerable to lightning.
   Findings - In this paper, methods based on an exchange of telemetry data and sensor fusion of GNSS, infrared markers detection and others are used. Different methods are compared.
   Originality/value - The subject of sensor fusion and high-precision measurements in reference to the autonomous vehicle cooperation is very important because of the increasing popularity of these vehicles. The proposed solution is efficient to perform autonomous landing of UAV on the UGV.

AB In this study, an autonomous vehicle that can avoid obstacles has been developed by using stereo imaging systems and artificial intelligence applications together. An integrated stereo camera module and NVIDIA Jetson Nano developer kit were used as computer vision system. Checkerboard calibration was performed to prevent camera distortions. The images of the cameras were rectified and the difference costs between the left and right image pairs on the same epipolar plane were calculated. These difference costs were passed through the weighted least squares (WLS) filter, thus a depth map of the left camera image was created. The rectified left camera view was also processed by artificial intelligence-based semantic segmentation. Segmentation was carried out using a previously trained artificial intelligence network (SegNet). These semantic segmentation outputs were passed through the HSV color mask and a mask image was hereby obtained. Using the mask image; movable ground, obstacle, and background information was extracted. Useful data analysis was performed on the depth map and semantic segmentation outputs of the same frame. This information is transmitted to the 2-wheeled vehicle which is designed based on ROS that provides the movement, and decisions are made within the scope of the avoidance algorithm. This study's novel contribution involves the integration of a passive depth sensing system and artificial intelligence based semantic segmentation, in tandem with a real-time obstacle avoidance algorithm that utilizes these combined technologies. Consequently, the autonomous vehicle is capable of making semantic inferences about its environment while effectively avoiding obstacles.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are equipped with several sensors which produce various forms of data, such as geo-location, distance, and camera data. The volume and utility of these data, especially camera data, have contributed to the advancement of high-performance self-driving applications. However, these vehicles and their collected data are prone to security and privacy attacks. One of the main attacks against AV-generated camera data is location inference, in which camera data is used to extract knowledge for tracking the users. A few research studies have proposed privacy-preserving approaches for analysing AV-generated camera data using powerful generative models, such as Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). However, the related work considers a weak geo-localisation attack model, which leads to weak privacy protection against stronger attack models. This paper proposes DeepClean, a robust deep-learning model that combines VAE and a private clustering technique. DeepClean learns distinct labelled object structures of the image data as clusters and generates a more visual representation of the non-private object clusters, e.g., roads. It then distorts the private object areas using a private Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to learn distinct cluster structures of the labelled object areas. The synthetic images generated from our model guarantee privacy and resist a robust location inference attack by less than 4% localisation accuracy. This result implies that using DeepClean for synthetic data generation makes it less likely for a subject to be localised by an attacker, even when using a robust geo-localisation attack. The overall image utility level of the generated synthetic images by DeepClean is comparable to the benchmark studies.

ID MODULATION SCHEMES
AB Autonomous vehicle platoon is an enhancement of autonomous behavior, where vehicles are organized into groups of close proximity through wireless communication. Platoon members mostly communicate with each other via the current dominant vehicular radio frequency (RF) technology, IEEE 802.11p. However, this technology leads security vulnerabilities under various attacks from adversaries. Visible light communication (VLC) has the potential to alleviate these vulnerabilities by exploiting the directivity and impermeability of light. Utilizing only VLC in vehicle platoon, on the other hand, may degrade platoon stability since VLC is sensitive to environmental effects. In this paper, we propose an IEEE 802.11p and VLC-based hybrid security protocol for platoon communication, namely SP-VLC, with the goal of ensuring platoon stability and securing platoon maneuvers under data packet injection, channel overhearing, jamming, and platoon maneuver attacks. We define platoon maneuver attack based on the identification of various scenarios where a fakemaneuver packet is transmitted by amalicious actor. SP-VLC includesmechanisms for the secret key establishment, message authentication, data transmission over both IEEE 802.11p and VLC, jamming detection and reaction to switch to VLC only communication and secure platoon maneuvering based on the joint usage of IEEE 802.11p and VLC. We develop a simulation platform combining realistic vehicle mobility model, realistic VLC and IEEE 802.11p channel models, and vehicle platoon management. We show the functionality of the SP-VLC protocol under all possible security attacks by performing extensive simulations. Ourfindings demonstrate that SP-VLC protocol generates less than 0.1% difference in the speed of and distance between platoon members during security attacks in comparison to 25% and 10% in that of previously proposed IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 802.11p-VLC hybrid protocols, respectively.

AB Today's research on Quality of Experience (QoE) mainly addresses multimedia services. With the introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT), there is a need for new ways of evaluating the QoE. Emerging IoT services, such as autonomous vehicles (AVs), are more complex and involve additional quality requirements, such as those related to machine-to-machine communication that enables self-driving. In fully autonomous cases, it is the intelligent machines operating the vehicles. Thus, it is not clear how intelligent machines will impact end-user QoE, but also how end users can alter and affect a self-driving vehicle. This article argues for a paradigm shift in the QoE area to cover the relationship between humans and intelligent machines. We introduce the term Quality of IoT-experience (QoIoT) within the context of AV, where the quality evaluation, besides end users, considers quantifying the perspectives of intelligent machines with objective metrics. Hence, we propose a novel architecture that considers Quality of Data (QoD), Quality of Network (QoN), and Quality of Context (QoC) to determine the overall QoIoT in the context of AVs. Finally, we present a case study to illustrate the use of QoIoT.

AB This paper presents an integrated control approach for autonomous driving comprising a corridor path planner that determines constraints on vehicle position, and a linear time-varying model predictive controller combining path planning and tracking in a road-aligned coordinate frame. The capabilities of the approach are illustrated in obstacle-free curved road-profile tracking, in an application coupling adaptive cruise control (ACC) with obstacle avoidance (OA), and in a typical driving maneuver on highways. The vehicle is modeled as a nonlinear dynamic bicycle model with throttle, brake pedal position, and steering angle as control inputs. Proximity measurements are assumed to be available within a given range field surrounding the vehicle. The proposed general feedback control architecture includes an estimator design for fusion of database information (maps), exteroceptive as well as proprioceptive measurements, a geometric corridor planner based on graph theory for the avoidance of multiple, potentially dynamically moving objects, and a spatial-based predictive controller. Switching rules for transitioning between four different driving modes, i.e., ACC, OA, obstacle-free road tracking (RT), and controlled braking (Brake), are discussed. The proposed method is evaluated on test cases, including curved and highway two-lane road tracks with static as well as moving obstacles.

AB As a result of unmanned aerial vehicles being widely used in different areas, studies about increasing the autonomous capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles are gaining momentum. Today, unmanned aerial vehicle platforms are especially used in reconnaissance, surveillance and communications areas. In this study, in order to achieve continuous long-range communication relay infrastructure, artificial potential field based path planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is discussed. A novel dynamic approach to relay-chain concept is proposed to maintain the communication between vehicles. Besides dynamically keeping vehicles in range and appropriate position to maintain communication relay, artificial potential field based path planning also provides collision avoidance system. The performance of the proposed system is measured by applying a simulation under the Matlab Simulink and Network Simulator environment. Artificial potential field based flight patterns are generated in Matlab, and performance of the communication between vehicles is measured in Network Simulation environment. Finally the simulation results show that an airborne communication relay can be established autonomously by using artificial potential filed based autonomous path planning approach. Continues state communication is provided by obtaining a resistant communication relay which depends on artificial potential field based positioning algorithm.

AB Autonomous vehicles have become important with the emergence of Logistics 4.0. Moreover, truck-based transport has become the critical means of transport in the logistics market. Thus, to deal with the pending issues of the logistics market, it is not enough to merely expand the workforce. Adopting autonomous trucks will also help change the truck allocation structure. This may enable horizontal and vertical integration based on the new logistics model and help address various problems faced by shipping companies. Thus, adopting autonomous trucks can provide various benefits for the logistics business, society, and consumers. However, adopting autonomous trucks does not only have benefits. Here, this study suggests truck platooning as a method of adopting autonomous trucks more efficiently. Furthermore, we approach the potential issues regarding autonomous truck adoption from various perspectives by demonstrating the efficiency of autonomous trucks as well as their problems.

AB A new controller design is presented on the basis of the dynamic surface control (DSC) method for the constrained platoon formation control of the underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the presence of model uncertainties with limited field-of-view (FOV) constraints. An asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is applied to prevent both the line-of-sight (LOS) range and orientation angles from violating limited FOV constraints. Lyapunov method is adopted to reveal that all signals of the closed-loop control system are bounded and the constrained platoon formation tracking errors are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). An adaptive neural network technique is employed to compensate uncertain parameters and unmodeled dynamics of the vehicles. Compared with existing works in the literature, the proposed control scheme not only forces both the range and orientation angles between AUVs to their desired values in the presence of FOV constraints in the fixed-time, but also decrease the safety hazard by avoiding any possible collision between the vehicles, increase the tracking error convergence rate and improve the transient performance of the tracking controller for all AUVs. The computer simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of this newly proposed constrained platoon formation controller for the AUVs.

AB Recently released research about deep learning applications related to perception for autonomous driving focuses heavily on the usage of LiDAR point cloud data as input for the neural networks, highlighting the importance of LiDAR technology in the field of Autonomous Driving (AD). In this sense, a great percentage of the vehicle platforms used to create the datasets released for the development of these neural networks, as well as some AD commercial solutions available on the market, heavily invest in an array of sensors, including a large number of sensors as well as several sensor modalities. However, these costs create a barrier to entry for low-cost solutions for the performance of critical perception tasks such as Object Detection and SLAM. This paper explores current vehicle platforms and proposes a low-cost, LiDAR-based test vehicle platform capable of running critical perception tasks (Object Detection and SLAM) in real time. Additionally, we propose the creation of a deep learning-based inference model for Object Detection deployed in a resource-constrained device, as well as a graph-based SLAM implementation, providing important considerations, explored while taking into account the real-time processing requirement and presenting relevant results demonstrating the usability of the developed work in the context of the proposed low-cost platform.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential of reshaping the human mobility in a wide variety of aspects. This paper focuses on a new possibility that the AV owners have the option of "renting" their AVs to a company, which can use these collected AVs to provide on-demand ride services without any drivers. We call such a mobility market with AV renting options the "AV crowdsourcing market". This paper establishes an aggregate equilibrium model with multiple transport modes to analyze the AV crowdsourcing market. The modeling framework can capture the customers' mode choices and AV owners' rental decisions with the presence of traffic congestion. Then, we explore different scenarios that either maximize the crowdsourcing platform's profit or maximize social welfare. Gradient-based optimization algorithms are designed for solving the problems. The results obtained by numerical examples reveal the welfare enhancement and the strong profitability of the AV crowdsourcing service. However, when the crowdsourcing scale is small, the crowdsourcing platform might not be profitable. A second-best pricing scheme is able to avoid such undesirable cases. The insights generated from the analyses provide guidance for regulators, service providers and citizens to make future decisions regarding the utilization of the AV crowdsourcing markets for serving the good of the society.

AB This paper reviews current developments and discusses some critical issues with obstacle detection systems for automated vehicles. The concept of autonomous driving is the driver towards future mobility. Obstacle detection systems play a crucial role in implementing and deploying autonomous driving on our roads and city streets. The current review looks at technology and existing systems for obstacle detection. Specifically, we look at the performance of LIDAR, RADAR, vision cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and IR and review their capabilities and behaviour in a number of different situations: during daytime, at night, in extreme weather conditions, in urban areas, in the presence of smooths surfaces, in situations where emergency service vehicles need to be detected and recognised, and in situations where potholes need to be observed and measured. It is suggested that combining different technologies for obstacle detection gives a more accurate representation of the driving environment. In particular, when looking at technological solutions for obstacle detection in extreme weather conditions (rain, snow, fog), and in some specific situations in urban areas (shadows, reflections, potholes, insufficient illumination), although already quite advanced, the current developments appear to be not sophisticated enough to guarantee 100% precision and accuracy, hence further valiant effort is needed.

AB This paper presents a hybrid strategy-based coordinate controller with a novel nonlinear disturbance observer for autonomous underwater vehicle manipulator systems (UVMSs). This method can reduce the influence from external unknown disturbances, inner coupling effects and model uncertainties by using a modified disturbance observer. Considering the natural redundancy property of the UVMS, the redundancy resolution algorithm is often utilized to give desired trajectories in the vehicle-joint space. However, because of the calibration errors, assembling errors and numerical errors, these desired trajectories may not lead the end-effector to the goal point accurately. To realize accurate motion control even when small errors exist in the planning phase, a hybrid strategy is introduced to transform the controller in the joint-vehicle space to the controller in the task space. Numerical simulations based on a UVMS have been carried out to testify the effectiveness of the proposed coordinate controller and the hybrid strategy. During the simulations, unknown disturbances are exerted upon the system. The trajectory tracking and error fixing performances are discussed in comparative analyses. The controller also maintains robust characteristics in comparison with the passivity-based controller and the proposed controller but without the disturbance observer. Experiments are also carried out to test its performance.

AB In the recent past, intervention-class autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have gained the ocean/marine research community's attention due to their multidisciplinary operational capabilities. This article discusses a detailed comparative-performance study of an underwater vehicle (UV) with two different actuator configurations based on fixed-thrusters and vectored thrusters. The fixed-thruster configuration consists of eight thrusters. Four thrusters generate thrust in the horizontal plane and the remaining thrusters produce thrust in heave direction. The vectored thruster configuration has four thrusters placed at diagonal corners of a rectangular vehicle, and four independent internal servomotors rotate these thrusters. The classification terminology in this article identifies the underwater vehicle without vectoring capability as Fixed-Thruster Underwater Vehicle (FTUV) and the one with vectoring capability as Vectored-Thruster Underwater Vehicle (VTUV). Furthermore, a nonlinear controller is designed, based on a backstepping scheme for tracking a given spatial profile in a three-dimensional space. An underwater robot's control for a trajectory tracking problem is useful for any real-time multidisciplinary autonomous applications. The comparative simulation results are summarized to validate both the vehicle variants' performance differences.

AB The control problem for the multivariable and nonlinear dynamics of robotic manipulators and autonomous vehicles is solved with the use of a flatness-based control approach which is implemented in successive loops. The state-space model of these robotic systems is separated into two subsystems, which are connected between them in cascading loops. Each one of these subsystems can be viewed independently as a differentially flat system and control about it can be performed with inversion of its dynamics as in the case of input-output linearised flat systems. The state variables of the second subsystem become virtual control inputs for the first subsystem. In turn, exogenous control inputs are applied to the first subsystem. The whole control method is implemented in two successive loops and its global stability properties are also proven through Lyapunov stability analysis. The validity of the control method is confirmed in two case studies: (a) control of a 3-DOF industrial rigid-link robotic manipulator and (b) control of a 3-DOF autonomous underwater vessel. The novel control method can simplify significantly the solution of the nonlinear control problem for robotic manipulators and vehicles. Unlike global linearisation-based control schemes, the proposed flatness-based method in successive loops does not need any changes in state variables of complicated state-space model transformations.

AB China is the world's largest automotive market and is ambitious for autonomous vehicles (AVs) development. As one of the key goals of AVs, pedestrian safety is an important issue in China. Despite the rapid development of driverless technologies in recent years, there is a lack of researches on the adaptability of AVs to pedestrians. To fill the gap, this study would discuss the adaptability of current driverless technologies to China urban pedestrians by reviewing the latest researches. The paper firstly analyzed typical Chinese pedestrian behaviors and summarized the safety demands of pedestrians for AVs through articles and open database data, which are worked as the evaluation criteria. Then, corresponding driverless technologies are carefully reviewed. Finally, the adaptability would be given combining the above analyses. Our review found that autonomous vehicles have trouble in the occluded pedestrian environment and Chinese pedestrians do not accept AVs well. And more explorations should be conducted on standard human-machine interaction, interaction information overload avoidance, occluded pedestrians detection and nation-based receptivity research. The conclusions are very useful for motor corporations and driverless car researchers to place more attention on the complexity of the Chinese pedestrian environment, for transportation experts to protect pedestrian safety in the context of AVs, and for governors to think about making new pedestrians policies to welcome the upcoming driverless cars.

AB Increasingly, experts are forecasting the future of transportation to be shared, autonomous and electric. As shared autonomous electric vehicle (SAEV) fleets roll out to the market, the electricity consumed by the fleet will have significant impacts on energy demand and, in turn, drive variation in energy cost and reliability, especially if the charging is unmanaged. This research proposes a smart charging (SC) framework to identify benefits of active SAEV charging management that strategically shifts electricity demand away from high-priced peak hours or towards renewable generation periods. Time of use (TOU), real time pricing (RTP), and solar generation electricity scenarios are tested using an agent-based simulation to study (1) the impact of battery capacity and charging infrastructure type on SAEV fleet performance and operational costs under SC management; (2) the cost reduction potential of SC considering energy price fluctuation, uncertainty, and seasonal variation; (3) the charging infrastructure requirements; and (4) the system efficiency of powering SAEVs with solar generation. A case study from the Puget Sound region demonstrates the proposed SC algorithm using trip patterns from the regional travel demand model and local energy prices. Results suggest that in the absence of electricity price signals, SAEV charging demand is likely to peak the evening, when regional electricity use patterns already indicate high demand. Under SC management, EVs with larger battery sizes are more responsive to low-electricity cost charging opportunities, and have greater potential to reduce total energy related costs (electricity plus charging infrastructure) for a SAEV fleet, especially under RTP structure.

AB Realistic uncertainties and disturbances cannot be ignored when striving towards high-performance autonomous driving. Meanwhile, advanced vehicular sensing technology enables more and more self-driving techniques to come out. Against this backdrop, this paper aims to holistically address the system uncertainties and disturbances in the path tracking control of autonomous vehicles (AVs) by the preview control theory to achieve superior control performance. First, unmeasureable multi-uncertainties and the external disturbance are considered simultaneously into the robust gain-scheduling framework with variable longitudinal velocity. Then, by the equivalent delay approach, ineluctable time-varying system delays are effectively handled. Next, the physical constraints of the steering system and direct yaw moment control (DYC) system are considered for practical implementation through robust set invariance theory. The parallel distributed compensation (PDC) technique and auxiliary feedback matrices approach are introduced for reducing design conservatism. After that, by incorporating the road curvature into the augmented system state, the path tracking preview control problem can be solved without online optimization. Thereafter, the closed-loop system stability and guaranteed performance have been proved through the Lyapunov- Krasovski approach. The proposed controller design is finally reformulated as the optimization problem based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) via specific convexification techniques. Finally, to verify the validity of the proposed controller, Software in Loop (SIL) tests with Carsim full-vehicle model under different dynamic conditions have been implemented.

AB Truck platooning with autonomous and connected vehicles has several advantages compared with traditional trucking. Platooning improves overall road safety and reduces fuel consumption by up to 15%. This is a result of the advanced control systems and high steering accuracy of autonomous vehicles. These advanced control systems present an opportunity to pavement design engineers, as the lateral positions of the vehicles could be altered to create less damaging loading scenarios. This study introduces an expected response framework to quantify the impact of lateral position on pavement performance. Using the expected response framework, any mixture of human-driven and autonomous vehicles can be analyzed by characterizing lane position as a mixture probability distribution instead of point loads. Pavement damage can subsequently be computed by using the expectation of the responses. This approach requires little computational effort and is easily incorporated in any mechanistic-empirical design or optimization framework. The approach is illustrated by analyzing four flexible pavement sections using the expected response framework. Compared with human-driven trucks, optimized lateral position could decrease pavement damage by 40%. Channelized traffic on the other hand could increase pavement damage by 60%. A simplified approach is introduced alongside a reliability analysis and fragility curves for various pavement structures. Distributed traffic was found to have the lowest probability of failure among all traffic scenarios.

AB The localization of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in anchor-free environments has always been a difficult problem due to the lack of global positioning systems and absolute references. In general, AUVs localize themselves by dead reckoning (DR), whereas the localization error grows without bound. To alleviate the growth of the localization errors, we propose intermittent belief propagation based dead reckoning (IBPDR) as a cooperative localization (CL) framework. In IBPDR, AUVs use DR to localize themselves and periodically correct DR 's deviation with CL methods. The intermittent feature of IBPDR reduces communication costs among AUVs by decreasing the frequency of CL. In the IBPDR framework, we design a particle-based underwater-adaptive belief propagation (UABP) algorithm for CL. The UABP algorithm is naturally distributed and viable in nonlinear and non-Gaussian situations. Thus, it is suitable for CL issues. Furthermore, the UABP algorithm is robust to the accumulated inertial measurement errors and reduces communication costs among AUVs. Moreover, we propose a particle-based current-aided filter to further improve the localization accuracy by comparing AUVs' ambient current observations with the available current maps. Simulation results validate the proposed algorithms by comparisons with alternative approaches in localization accuracy, communication costs, and robustness to abnormal cases, such as packet loss, ranging bias, and outliers.

AB In order to improve the real-time performance of the trajectory tracking of autonomous vehicles, this paper applies the alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM) to the receding optimization of model predictive control (MPC), which improves the computational speed of the algorithm. Based on the vehicle dynamics model, the output equation of the autonomous vehicle trajectory tracking control system is constructed, and the auxiliary variable and the dual variable are introduced. The quadratic programming problem transformed from the MPC and the vehicle dynamics constraints are rewritten into the solution of the ADMM form, and a decreasing penalty factor is used during the solution process. The simulation verification is carried out through the joint simulation platform of Simulink and Carsim. The results show that, compared with the active set method (ASM) and the interior point method (IPM), the algorithm proposed in this paper can not only improve the accuracy of trajectory tracking, but also exhibits good real-time performance in different prediction time domains and control time domains. When the prediction time domain increases, the calculation time shows no significant difference. This verifies the effectiveness of the ADMM in improving the real-time performance of MPC.

TI Fixed-Dimensional and Permutation Invariant State Representation of

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Permutation-invariance; state representation; autonomous driving
AB In this paper, we propose a new state representation method, called encoding sum and concatenation (ESC), to describe the environment observation for decision-making in autonomous driving. Unlike existing state representation methods, ESC is applicable to the situation where the number of surrounding vehicles is variable and eliminates the need for manually pre-designed sorting rules, leading to higher representation ability and generality. The proposed ESC method introduces a feature neural network (NN) to encode the real-valued feature of each surrounding vehicle into an encoding vector, and then adds these vectors up to obtain the representation vector of the set of surrounding vehicles. Then, a fixed-dimensional and permutation-invariance state representation can be obtained by concatenating the set representation with other variables, such as indicators of the ego vehicle and road. By introducing the sum-of-power mapping, this paper has further proved that the injectivity of the ESC state representation can be guaranteed if the output dimension of the feature NN is greater than the number of variables of all surrounding vehicles. This means that the ESC representation can be used to describe the environment and taken as the inputs of learning-based policy functions. Experiments demonstrate that compared with the fixed-permutation representation method, the policy learning accuracy based on ESC representation is improved by 62.2%.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are undergoing rapid worldwide development. They will only become a success if they are accepted by their users. Therefore, there is a need for user acceptance for these vehicles. Previous studies on acceptance of AV have identified several predictors. Inspired by these studies, the authors' investigation is aimed at sociodemographic characteristics, including broader individual and societal acceptance, beyond technical issues to get a clear view of user acceptance. In this study, they surveyed 229 respondents, using a 46-item online questionnaire. Overall, the authors' analysis revealed that the respondents are most concerned about crashing/malfunctioning, purchase price, liability for incidents, interaction with non-AV, performance in unexpected situations, hacking and safety. The results also revealed that the AV is perceived as 'somewhat low risk' to drive. Gender, age, education level and employment status had varied relationships with the perceived concerns and general attitude towards the AV. For instance, respondents with a university degree (Bachelor/Master/PhD) are less concerned about the liability of accidents and AV system failure than those without it. Similarly, respondents between 36 and 65 years of age are more concerned and even refused to drive AV in comparison to the age ranges of 18-35 years and 65 + years.

Its weight in air is about 260 kg, and its dimensions are 3 m in length, 1.3 in in width and 0.9 m in height. It can swim freely up to 500 m in depth for 24 It continuously. Although the vehicle can communicate with a mother vessel with an acoustic link, only high-level commands are sent to the vehicle and most of the control is done by a built-in computer. When tracking underwater cables, low-frequency current is supplied to the underwater cables. The vehicle can locate and track cables by detecting the magnetic field generated by the current. Since it was first launched in 1997, AE2 has carried out three sea trials and five cable-inspection missions. The total length of inspected cable exceeds 400 km. In 1999, in a real inspection of an underwater telecommunication cable crossing the Taiwan Straight, it was proved that AE2 was robust against current and sand-waves. This paper presents the basic design concept, cable-tracking performance, acoustic links, sea trials and operating results.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB When adopting the conventional grey model (GM(1,1)) to predict weak thruster fault for autonomous underwater vehicles, the prediction error is not always satisfactory. In order to solve the problem, this article develops a new weak thruster fault prediction method based on an improved GM(1,1). In the developed GM(1,1) based fault prediction method, this article mainly makes improvement in the following aspects: construction of grey background value, solution of whiting differential equation and construction of predicted sequence. Specifically, the integral operation is used in range of the two adjacent steps to obtain the grey background value at first. Second, in the solving of whiting differential equation, the point corresponding to the least difference between the accumulated generation sequence and its predicted sequence is determined, and then this special point's value in the original sequence is considered as the initial condition of the whiting differential equation. Third, in the construction of predicted sequence, another predicted value is obtained based on the error sequence between the accumulated generating operation sequence and its predicted sequence, and then the new predicted result is used to re-adjust the accumulated generating operation sequence, so as to guarantee the re-adjustability of the fault prediction result. Finally, experiments are performed on Beaver 2 autonomous underwater vehicle to evaluate the prediction performance of the developed method.

AB Millimeter-wave (MMW) radar sensors are considered key components of autonomous vehicles. Because of the performance degeneration of cameras and lidars under inclement weather conditions, robust autonomy must rely on radar sensors to perform target detection and classification. Unlike basic target classifier methods in literature that make use of target velocity, the proposed approach is far more comprehensive and can be applied to targets with zero-Doppler. Depending on the radar type and target range, this paper presents four target classification models based on four different types of radar data: statistical RCS, distributed (time-domain) RCS, range-azimuth angle radar images and 3D radar images. The classification models are implemented by machine learning approaches artificial neural network (ANN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) with a comprehensive simulated dataset. Good classification accuracies are demonstrated, and the proposed model is validated with measured data. Different radar target classification approaches are compared, which clearly reveals the trade-off between classification performance and system complexity. The proposed radar target classification methods can be applied effectively to both static and dynamic targets, at near or far ranges, using traditional or imaging radars, resulting in improved safety for autonomous vehicles in a wide variety of complex environments.

AB Autonomous systems such as Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), assistive robots are set improve the way we live. Autonomous systems need to be equipped with capabilities to Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting with its environment through trial and error, which has gained significant interest from research community for its promise to efficiently learn decision making through abstraction of experiences. However, most of the control algorithms used today in current autonomous systems such as driverless vehicle prototypes or mobile robots are controlled through supervised learning methods or manually designed rule-based policies. Additionally, many emerging autonomous systems such as driverless cars, are set in a multi-agent environment, often with partial observability. Learning decision making policies in multi-agent environments is a challenging problem, because the environment is not stationary from the perspective of a learning agent, and hence the Markov properties assumed in single agent RL does not hold. This paper focuses on learning decision-making policies in multi-agent environments, both in cooperative settings with full observability and dynamic environments with partial observability. We present experiments in simple, yet effective, new multi-agent environments to simulate policy learning in scenarios that could be encountered by an autonomous navigating agent such as a CAV. The results illustrate how agents learn to cooperate in order to achieve their objectives successfully. Also, it was shown that in a partially observable setting, an agent was capable of learning to roam around its environment without colliding in the presence of obstacles and other moving agents. Finally, the paper discusses how data-driven multi-agent policy learning can be extended to real-world environments by augmenting the intelligence of autonomous vehicles.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) offer several benefits, such as improving road safety, mitigating traffic congestion, and reducing fuel consumption and gas emissions. Despite these benefits, their adoption rate remains limited due to various factors influencing users' decisions. While previous studies have identified numerous factors influencing AV adoption using various adoption frameworks, the factors have not been comprehensively analyzed and synthesized. Thus, this systematic review aims to bridge this gap by identifying and classifying the factors influencing the adoption of AVs. Out of 3,532 collected research papers, 71 empirical studies were analyzed thoroughly. The findings demonstrated that the technology acceptance model (TAM) was the most widely used model for investigating AV adoption. The identified factors in the analyzed studies were classified into distinct categories: psychological and behavioral factors, technological factors, social factors, environmental factors, security and privacy factors, AV-related factors, risky and negative factors, conditional factors, and monetary factors. We have proposed an AV adoption framework grounded in this taxonomy to direct subsequent empirical research. We have also highlighted numerous agendas to serve as a blueprint for future AV adoption studies. This review offers various theoretical insights and actionable recommendations for multiple AV research, development, and implementation stakeholders.

ID OCEAN
AB The recent Arctic GAkkel Vents Expedition (AGAVE) to the Arctic Ocean's Gakkel Ridge (July/August 2007) aboard the Swedish icebreaker 1/B Oden employed autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for water-column and ocean bottom surveys. These surveys were unique among AUV operations to date in requiring georeferenced navigation ill proximity to the seafloor beneath permanent and moving ice cover. We report results for long-baseline (LBL) acoustic navigation during autonomous under-ice surveys near the seafloor and adaptation of the LBL concept for several typical operational situations including navigation in proximity to the ship during vehicle recoveries. Fixed seafloor transponders were free-fall deployed from the ship for deep positioning. The ship's helicopter collected acoustic travel times from several locations to georeference the transponders' locations, subject to the availability of openings in the ice. Two shallow beacons suspended from the ship provided near-surface spherical navigation in ship-relative coordinates. During routine recoveries, we used this system to navigate the vehicles into open water near the ship before commanding them to surface. In cases in which a vehicle was impaired, its position was still determined acoustically through some combination of its acoustic modern, the fixed seafloor transponders, the ship-deployed transponders, and all onboard backup relay transponder. The techniques employed included ranging adapted for a moving origin and hyperbolic navigation. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Firstly, aiming at the dynamic coupling of rear anti-collision factors for safe driving, a driving decision network based on an actor-critic framework was proposed for sensor data processing. Then, inspired by the idea of multi-objective optimization, a refined reward function is developed. It comprehensively considers the impact of backward target types, safety clearance, and vehicle roll stability on the rear collision. Finally, the RAD-DRL was trained (with different values of random seeds), tested, and verified in a simulation environment where road network and traffic situations were built-in SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility). After 30,000 training episodes, effective and reliable rear anti-collision driving decisions were achieved by our proposed RAD-DRL. The simulated results indicated that the RAD-DRL has remarkable superiority in generalization and effectiveness in expressway scenarios with different driving cases. Especially, it maintained good decision performance in the corner case in which the backward vehicle suddenly accelerates.

AB Water pollution generated by accidental spill of hazardous materials is a growing problem worldwide. There is an urgent need for a tool that would help environmental response teams perform rapid understanding of the location and the extent of the spill to effectively establish an appropriate response. This paper presents a cooperative robotic system for environmental monitoring consisting of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and an autonomous unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The main contributions of the paper are a systematic description of the design and implementation of the proposed cooperative robotic system, a novel human-on-the-loop (HOTL) approach applied on the system for environmental monitoring, and demonstration of the results of the open-sea experiments on pollution deliberately caused by harmless Rhodamine water tracing (WT), carried out in Cartagena, Spain, in June 2015. The proposed HOTL system provides near real-time pollution measurement data, while not consuming a significant amount of human time and effort. It supports decision-making and allows the operator to initiate the most adequate mission in a current situation, i.e., ensures mission change on-the-fly. While the AUV samples the ocean, the USV maintains the localization and communication data transfer to the control center and corrects the AUV's dead reckoning error.

TI Research on trajectory tracking and body attitude control of autonomous
   ground vehicle based on differential steering
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB The differential steering can be used not only as the backup system of steer-by-wire, but also as the only steering system. Because the differential steering is realized through the differential moment between the coaxial left and right driving wheels, the sharp reduction of the load on the inner driving wheel will directly lead to the failure of the differential steering when the four-wheel independent drive electric vehicle approaches the rollover. Therefore, this paper not only realizes the trajectory tracking of autonomous ground vehicle through the differential steering, but also puts forward the body attitude control to improve the handling stability. Firstly, the dynamic and kinematic models of differential steering autonomous ground vehicle (DSAGV) and its roll model are established, and the linear three-degree of freedom vehicle model is selected as the reference model to generate the ideal body roll angle. Secondly, a model predictive controller (MPC) is designed to control the DSAGV to track the given reference trajectory, and obtain the required differential moment and the resulting front-wheel steering angle. Then, a sliding mode controller (SMC) is adopted to control the DSAGV to track the ideal body roll angle, and obtain the required roll moment. The simulation results show that the proposed MPC and SMC can not only make the DSAGV realize the trajectory tracking, but also achieve the body attitude control.

AB The longitudinal trajectory planning of connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) has been widely studied in the literature to reduce travel time or fuel consumptions. The safety impact of CAV trajectory planning to the mixed traffic flow with both CAV and human-driven vehicle (HDV), however, is not well understood yet. This study presents a reinforcement learning modeling approach, named Monte Carlo tree search-based autonomous vehicle safety algorithm, or MCTS-AVS, to optimize the safety of mixed traffic flow, on a one-lane roadway with signalized intersection control. Crash potential index (CPI) is defined to quantitively measure the safety performance of the mixed traffic flow. The CAV trajectory planning problem is firstly formulated as an optimization model; then, the solution procedure based on reinforcement learning is proposed. The tree-expansion determination module and rollout termination module are developed to identify and reduce the unnecessary tree expansion, so as to train the model more efficiently towards the desired direction. The case study results showed that the proposed algorithm was able to reduce the CPI by 76.56%, when compared with a benchmark model without any intelligence, and 12.08%, when compared with another benchmark model that the team developed earlier. These results demonstrated the satisfactory performance of the proposed algorithm in enhancing the safety of the mixed traffic flow.

AB This paper presents an intelligent speed adaption system for vehicles on conventional roads. The fuzzy logic based expert system outputs a recommended speed to ensure both safety and passenger comfort. This intelligent system includes geometrical features of the road, as well as subjective perceptions of the drivers. It has been developed and checked with real data that were measured with an instrumental system incorporated in a vehicle, on several two-lane roads located in the Madrid Region, Spain. Along with the road geometrical characteristics, other input variables to the system are external factors, such as weather conditions, distance to the preceding vehicle, tire pressure, and other subjective criteria, such as the desired comfort level, selected by the driver. The expert system output is the most suitable speed for the specific road type, considering real factors that may modify the category of the road and thus, the appropriate speed. This information could be added to the adaptive cruise control of the vehicle. The recommended speed can be a very useful input for both, drivers and the autonomous vehicles, to improve safety on the road system.

AB The civil operation in narrow waters puts forward the requirements of small volume, light weight, flexible movement and low cost for vehicles. A new small autonomous surface/underwater vehicle (S-ASUV) with six thrusters is investigated in this study. To realize the reliable navigation of S-ASUV under the limitation of size and cost, a set of model-aided surface/underwater integrated navigation system is presented. For surface navigation, a measurement adaptive Kalman filter combining the output of GPS and the vehicle's dynamic model is proposed to address the problem that the GPS receiver may lose signal or produce large positioning deviation due to terrain or other interference factors. While GPS cannot be used in underwater environment and the single inertial navigation system (INS) leads to a growing navigation error with time, a new dynamic model-aided underwater integrated navigation is studied. In particular, the coefficients of the thrust model are corrected on line by S-ASUV surfacing. The field experiments were carried out to testify the dynamic model-aided integrated navigation by using the S-ASUV prototype. Especially, the adaptive Kalman navigation for GPS outliers was tested by using the track data collected from the field experiment. The results verified the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method.

TI Intention-Aware Autonomous Driving Decision-Making in an Uncontrolled
   Intersection
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB Autonomous vehicles need to perform social accepted behaviors in complex urban scenarios including human-driven vehicles with uncertain intentions. This leads to many difficult decision-making problems, such as deciding a lane change maneuver and generating policies to pass through intersections. In this paper, we propose an intention-aware decision-making algorithm to solve this challenging problem in an uncontrolled intersection scenario. In order to consider uncertain intentions, we first develop a continuous hidden Markov model to predict both the high-level motion intention (e.g., turn right, turn left, and go straight) and the low level interaction intentions (e.g., yield status for related vehicles). Then a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is built to model the general decision-making framework. Due to the difficulty in solving POMDP, we use proper assumptions and approximations to simplify this problem. A human-like policy generation mechanism is used to generate the possible candidates. Human-driven vehicles' future motion model is proposed to be applied in state transition process and the intention is updated during each prediction time step. The reward function, which considers the driving safety, traffic laws, time efficiency, and so forth, is designed to calculate the optimal policy. Finally, our method is evaluated in simulation with PreScan software and a driving simulator. The experiments show that our method could lead autonomous vehicle to pass through uncontrolled intersections safely and efficiently.

AB Last mile delivery is a significant component in the growth of e-commerce, especially in urban areas. The deliveries in dense cities cause several serious issues such as air/noise pollution and congestion. In this study, we compare the financial costs and CO2 emissions from different last mile delivery strategies of grocery bins in a scenario in Paris with four types of delivery vehicles (diesel/electric vans, cargo bikes, and autonomous delivery vehicles). We use costs associated with each vehicle type, location data with constraints for establishments in Paris, and delivery scenarios obtained by solving the vehicle routing problem for an overall cost comparison. We consider an economic analysis of the daily delivery to optimise the costs and estimate the CO2 emissions. The results highlight the competitiveness among last mile delivery and reflect the transition knowing the transport expenses since 2018: electric van costs become competitive with diesel ones, it concluded by some perspectives with cargo bikes and autonomous vehicles with their current limits. The strategies show a great impact on overall cost and emissions, which are vital in the development of sustainable urban last-mile delivery.

AB Methodologies for managing traffic in real-time are evolved in a different direction with the development of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Most of the research uses a specific penetration rate of CAVs. The contribution of this study is to fill that gap by testing a new real-time traffic management method, named SWSCAV (utilization of shockwave-speed information and connected autonomous vehicles for traffic management in case of congestion or incident) in case of a traffic incident in an uninterrupted traffic flow environment with a very limited number of CAVs to improve conditions of the traffic flow conditions. By changing the lane and duration of the simulated incident and adjusting the arrival frequency of the CAVs and the position where the CAVs reduce their speeds, 189 different scenarios are tested. Mean flow, density, and speed values are selected as measures of effectiveness. These metrics are inspected both network-wide and locally using a Simulation of the Urban Mobility (SUMO) environment. A maximum of 12 CAVs are used. The results show that introducing SWSCAV with a limited number of CAVs means speed and flow values can increase up to 20.35% and 2.45%, respectively. Additionally, a decrease in mean density up to 32.54% can also be observed with this management approach. Density heat maps are used to inspect the influence of the incident.

AB Haze-level discriminators are crucial for autonomous vehicles to handle segmentation tasks successfully in hazy and foggy outdoor environments. Deep learning (DL) networks trained to segment clear images exhibit more false positives and fail to recognize the pixel patterns for the class categories when faced with hazy images. To address this issue, we propose a novel dehazing scheme called Adaptive Dehazing (AD) that separates the unacceptable hazy images and applies the dehazing technique only to those images before passing them to the DL for segmentation. We define various thresholds to classify hazy images into four categories: heavy, moderate, slight, and clear. Additionally, we implement a hazy image generator to create hazy synthetic images that replicate actual hazy road scene conditions for testing the proposed algorithm. Moreover, we use the Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method to understand the feature selected by different layers in the network before and after applying the AD and their contribution to obtaining a final segmented output. Extensive experiments demonstrate both quantitatively and qualitatively the performance improvement in the segmentation task by achieving an optimal balance between Intersection over Union (IoU) and pixel accuracy (PA) metrics of the segmented categories. The improvement in IoU metrics shows that the AD scheme significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art dehazing methods.

AB Guaranteed safety and performance under various circumstances remain technically critical and practically challenging for the wide deployment of autonomous vehicles. Safety-critical systems in general, require safe performance even during the reinforcement learning (RL) period. To address this issue, a Barrier Lyapunov Function-based safe RL (BLF-SRL) algorithm is proposed here for the formulated nonlinear system in strict-feedback form. This approach appropriately arranges and incorporates the BLF items into the optimized backstepping control method to constrain the state-variables in the designed safety region during learning. Wherein, thus, the optimal virtual/actual control in every backstepping subsystem is decomposed with BLF items and also with an adaptive uncertain item to be learned, which achieves safe exploration during the learning process. Then, the principle of Bellman optimality of continuous-time Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in every backstepping subsystem is satisfied with independently approximated actor and critic under the framework of actor-critic through the designed iterative updating. Eventually, the overall system control is optimized with the proposed BLF-SRL method. It is furthermore noteworthy that the variance of the attained control performance under uncertainty is also reduced with the proposed method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified with two motion control problems for autonomous vehicles through appropriate comparison simulations.

AB Multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are popular for challenging submarine missions. In this article, we focus on the multi-AUV path planning for a common class of missions that need to traverse lots of mission targets in large and complex environments. Given that AUVs are often launched from a movable surface vehicle, e.g., a ship, a multi-AUV target traveling problem is formulated with a requirement of surface point location. Thereafter, a hybrid metaheuristic approach is developed by sequentially performing a cube-based environment modeling, cost map building, voyage planning, and detailed trajectory planning. Specifically, the shortest path faster algorithm (SPFA) is adopted to build a cost map among targets and candidate surface points, and the A* search is utilized for trajectory planning. The optimality of both SPFA and A* can indeed be guaranteed. Thus, voyage planning becomes critical and an algorithm namely DE-C-ACO is proposed by combining the ant colony optimization (ACO) and the differential evolution (DE) with a cluster-based adjustment strategy, i.e., DE-C. DE-C and ACO evolve in parallel for surface point location and voyage generation, respectively. Experiments based on realistic bathymetries are conducted and the results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed DE-C-ACO.

AB Attitudes of a sample of 211 UK people who are blind concerning autonomous vehicles (AVs), and the determinants of the willingness of people who are blind to travel in AVs, were examined. Participants answered an open-ended question regarding their attitudes towards level 5 AVs and the results were analysed using a semi-automated structural topic modelling procedure. (Level 5 AVs are fully autonomous anywhere, and do not require controlled areas in which to operate.) Four "topics" emerged from the exercise: (i) "hope" for future independence and freedom to travel offered by AVs to people who are blind, (ii) scepticism that AVs will ever be configured to meet the needs of people who are blind, (iii) concerns over safety, and (iv) the affordability of AVs. The four topics were employed as mediating variables in a structural equation model designed to explain the respondents' willingness to travel in an AV. A number of covariates were presumed to influence the four mediating topics, including a participant's desire for independence, comorbidity, locus of control, and level of generalised anxiety. Three of the mediating variables exerted significant influences on willingness to travel in an AV, i.e., hope for future independence, misgivings about safety, and affordability. Scepticism about AVs did not have a significant effect. Several implications for AV design and for the creation of public information messages promoting AVs are suggested. In particular, public information campaigns should emphasise the freedom to travel that AVs will provide for people who are blind; reassurances concerning safety; and the inevitability of AVs appearing on the roads of economically developed countries.

AB The work zone with lane closure will be an active bottleneck due to vehicles' mandatory lane-changing conflicts. The emerging Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) technology provides opportunities for vehicle motion planning to improve traffic performance. However, the literature using CAV technology mainly focuses on single-lane lane-changing control in the merging area. The algorithm dealing with multi-lane lane-changing control is absent. In this paper, a simulation system with a lane-changing optimal strategy embedded for the multi-lane work zone is presented under the heterogeneous traffic flow. First, the road upstream of the work zone is divided into several segments, and an optimal multi-lane lane-changing algorithm is designed. It is recommended that CAVs, on the closure lane and the merged lane, change lanes on each segment to balance traffic distribution and minimize traffic delay. Second, to validate the algorithm proposed, a typical three-lane freeway with one-lane closed for the work zone is researched, and the simulation platform based on cellular automata is developed. Third, the advantages of multi-lane control strategies are studied and discussed in traffic efficiency improvement and collision risk reduction by comparing previous lane-changing control algorithms.

AB Accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding road users is critical to autonomous driving systems. In mixed traffic flows, road users with different kinds of behaviors and styles bring complexity to the environment, which requires considering interactions among road users when anticipating their future trajectories. This paper presents a long-term interactive trajectory prediction method for surrounding vehicles using a hierarchical multi-sequence learning network. In contrast to non-interactive method which assumes that road users are independent of each other, this method can automatically learn high-level dependencies among multiple interacting vehicles through the proposed structural-LSTM (long short-term memory) network. Specifically, structural-LSTM first assigns one LSTM for each interacting vehicle. Then these LSTMs share their cell states and hidden states with their spatial-neighboring LSTMs by a radial connection, and recurrently analyze the output state of itself as well as the other LSTMs in a deeper layer. Finally based on all output states, the network predicts trajectories for surrounding vehicles. The proposed method is evaluated on the NGSIM dataset, and its results show that satisfyingly accurate prediction performance of long-term trajectories of surrounding vehicles is accessible, e.g., longitudinal and lateral RMS error can be reduced to less than 1.93m and 0.31m over 5s time horizon, respectively.

AB With the progressive technological advancement of autonomous vehicles, taxi service providers are expected to offer driverless taxi systems that alleviate traffic congestion and pollution. However, it is challenging to maintain the efficiency and reliability of a taxi service system due to the complexity of the traffic network and fluctuating traffic demand. In this paper, we present a robust variant of the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (TD3), namely, adaptive TD3 integrated with robust optimization (ATD3-RO), to implement a fleet of autonomous vehicles for a taxi service under uncertain passenger demand. Our proposed method incorporates an adaptive module for integer-valued action generation, which also enhances the model's resilience to a larger action space. Considering the uncertain demand of passengers, we design a perturbation sampling-based method to generate adversarial examples for robust training. Additionally, we propose a robust optimization-based strategy to generate a lower bound and guide the convergence of the critic network during the model training process. In our case study, we validate the efficacy of ATD3-RO by constructing a reinforcement learning simulator of the driverless taxi transportation system using real taxi data. The simulation results demonstrate that ATD3-RO outperforms the general TD3 algorithm and other state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning-based approaches while improving learning efficiency. We assess the algorithm's robustness against sudden changes in requests, e.g., a surge in demand at some traffic nodes caused by an emergent event. The results suggest that ATD3-RO performs adaptive actions that are aligned with the variations in passenger demand. Finally, we prove that our model can provide a reliable dispatching strategy even at various ratios between driverless taxis and passenger demand.

AB Creating safe paths in unknown and uncertain environments is a challenging aspect of leader-follower formation control. In this architecture, the leader moves toward the target by taking optimal actions, and followers should also avoid obstacles while maintaining their desired formation shape. Most of the studies in this field have inspected formation control and obstacle avoidance separately. This article proposes a new approach based on deep reinforcement learning for end-to-end motion planning and control of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The aim is to design optimal adaptive distributed controllers based on actor-critic structure for AUVs formation motion planning. This is accomplished by controlling the speed and heading of AUVs. In obstacle avoidance, two approaches are developed. In the first approach, the goal is to design control policies for the leader and followers such that each learns its own collision-free path. Moreover, the followers adhere to an overall formation maintenance policy. In the second approach, the leader solely learns the control policy and safely leads the whole group toward the target. Here, the control policy of the followers is to maintain the predetermined distance and angle. In the presence of ocean currents, communication delays, and sensing errors, the robustness of the proposed method under realistically perturbed circumstances is shown. The efficiency of the algorithms has been evaluated and approved using a number of computer-based simulations.

AB This paper presents an open-loop control system for a new experimental vehicle, named the biorobotic autonomous underwater vehicle (BAUV). The rigid cylindrical hull of the vehicle is attached with six strategically located fins to produce forces and moments in all orthogonal directions and axes with minimal redundancy. The fins are penguin-wing inspired and they implement the unsteady high-lift principle found widely in swimming and flying animals. The goal has been to design an underwater vehicle that is highly maneuverable by taking the inspiration from nature where unsteady hydrodynamic principles of lift generation and the phase synchronization of fins are common. We use cycle-averaged experimental data to analyze the hydrodynamic forces and moments produced by a single foil as a function of its kinematic motion parameters. Given this analysis, we describe a method for synthesizing and coordinating the sinusoidal motion of all six foils to produce any desired resultant mean force and moment vectors on the vehicle. The mathematics behind the resulting algorithm is elegant and effective, yielding compact and efficient implementation code. The solution method also considers and accommodates the inherent physical constraints of the foil actuators. We present laboratory experimental results that demonstrate the solution method and the vehicle's resulting high maneuverability.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to have a tremendous impact on travel behavior of people with dis-abilities because driving skills will be unnecessary. However, there has been little empirical research on their travel behavior, perceptions, and needs regarding AVs. This study explores their potential mode choice when assuming the autonomous vehicle transportation services (AVTS) are available in the future. The main objective is to understand what factors affect their mode-choice decision when considering AVTS compared to conven-tional modes of transportation, including bus, paratransit, and personal vehicles. To explain not only the impacts of the observed variables such as individual characteristics and mode attributes but also the impacts of their attitudes and perceptions of current mobility issues and AV technology on their mode choice, this study employs a hybrid choice model. This study focuses on individuals with physical disabilities and individuals with visual impairments. The model results show that individuals with disabilities who have a negative attitude toward the current public transit services and neighborhood built environments were more likely to choose AVTS. Furthermore, the presence of an onboard human attendant increased the probability of AVTS being chosen. The findings corroborate that more targeted strategies should be prepared to make AVTS a viable mode of trans-portation among people with disabilities. For example, it is worth noting that human attendants might be needed to relieve the anxiety of people with disabilities over traveling without anyone who can help them use AVTS. Based on the findings, this paper suggests some policy recommendations for providing viable AVTS for people with disabilities.

AB This paper proposes an optimized trajectory planner and motion planner framework, which aim to deal with obstacle avoidance along a reference road for autonomous driving in unstructured environments. The trajectory planning problem is decomposed into lateral and longitudinal planning sub-tasks along the reference road. First, a vehicle kinematic model with road coordinates is established to describe the lateral movement of the vehicle. Then, nonlinear optimization based on a vehicle kinematic model in the space domain is employed to smooth the reference road. Second, a multilayered search algorithm is applied in the lateral-space domain to deal with obstacles and find a suitable path boundary. Then, the optimized path planner calculates the optimal path by considering the distance to the reference road and the curvature constraints. Furthermore, the optimized speed planner takes into account the speed boundary in the space domain and the constraints on vehicle acceleration. The optimal speed profile is obtained by using a numerical optimization method. Furthermore, a motion controller based on a kinematic error model is proposed to follow the desired trajectory. Finally, the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory planner and motion controller framework in handling typical scenarios and avoiding obstacles safely and smoothly on the reference road and in unstructured environments.

AB Prediction of the dynamic behavior of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is the basis for developing the control system and optimizing the hydrodynamic shape of AUVs. A fast and efficient prediction method of dynamic behavior of AUVs was developed with the secondary programming of a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code of FLUENT. In the proposed CFD method, mass properties of the AUV and thrust of the propeller were coupled to the 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) dynamic equations of AUV in the form of user defined functions. A subregional unstructured mixed meshing strategy combining static meshes and dynamic meshes was proposed to improve the computational efficiency and to realize the 6-DOF movement of AUV. The proposed CFD prediction method can predict not only the dynamic behavior of the AUV, but also its surrounding flow field. Dynamic behavior of a seafloor mapping AUV in straight running and turn running were predicted using the developed CFD strategy. Comparison between the prediction results from the CFD method and those from the sea trials proved the proposed method to be accurate and effective. Some measures were put forward to improve motion performance of the vehicle according to the prediction results.

ID VEHICLE DETECTION
AB Deep learning field has progressed the vision-based surround perception and has become the most trending area in the field of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Many deep learning-based algorithms using two-dimensional images have become an essential tool for autonomous vehicles with object detection, tracking, and segmentation for road target detection, primarily including pedestrians, vehicles, traffic lights, and traffic signs. Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on visual data to classify and generalize target objects which can satisfy pedestrians' and other vehicles' safety requirements in their environment. In real-time, outstanding results are obtained by deep learning-based algorithms for object detection. While several studies have thoroughly examined different types of deep learning-based object detection methods, there are a few comparable studies that either test the detection speed or accuracy of the object detection algorithms. In addition to speed and accuracy, autonomous driving also depends on model size and energy efficiency. However, there is a lack of comparison on various such metrics among existing deep learning-based methods. This article aims to provide a detailed and systematic comparative analysis of five independent mainstream deep learning-based algorithms for road object detection, namely the R-FCN, Mask R-CNN, SSD, RetinaNet, and YOLOv4 on a large-scale Berkeley DeepDrive (BDD100K) dataset. The experimental results are analyzed using the mean Average Precision (mAP) value and inference time. Additionally, various practical metrics, such as model size, computational complexity, and energy efficiency of deep learning-based models are precisely computed. Furthermore, the performance of each algorithm is evaluated under different road environmental conditions at various times of day and night. The comparison presented in this article helps to gain insight into the strengths and limitations of the popular deep learning-based algorithms under practical constraints with their real-time deployment feasibility.

AB Level 4 autonomous vehicles (AVs) are smart vehicles that can move between two different points without any human interference. In 2018, the Saudi Arabian ban on female drivers was finally lifted, resulting in a large number of novice women drivers of different ages. The Kingdom might therefore be considered a risky place to drive, but AVs would help novices to reduce their fear of driving and reduce accidents. Previous studies focused narrowly on those who already had sufficient driving experience and held a valid driving license, but there were no studies on the adoption of smart cars by novice drivers. Based on a literature search, no studies had used a net valence model (NVM) for the adoption of AVs to understand their benefits/risks. Therefore, this study proposed an adoption model for AVs using an NVM to identify the benefit and risk factors that have an impact on beginner drivers' adoption of autonomous vehicles. A survey method was applied using the purposive sampling technique. Data were collected from 1400 female Saudi novice drivers who had experience with driving AVs. Data analysis was performed using Smart PLS Version 3. The results showed that individuals tended to ignore potential risks and focus instead on the potential benefits of using AVs. Performance expectancy, enjoyment, and effort expectancy were found to be positively related to the perceived advantages. On the other hand, the perceived risk as a construct did not have an impact on beginner drivers' adoption of autonomous vehicles. Therefore, the major theoretical contribution of this study was the formation of a new NVM model by incorporating three more constructs, which were social influence, personal innovativeness, and alternatives. Finally, the enhanced NVM model could assist AV developers in identifying the expected benefits and drawbacks of AV adoption.

AB Autonomous navigation requires scene understanding of the action-space to move or anticipate events. For planner agents moving on the ground plane, such as autonomous vehicles, this translates to scene understanding in the bird's-eye view (BEV). How ever, the onboard cameras of autonomous cars are customarily mounted horizontally for a better view of the surrounding. In this work, we study scene understanding in the form of online estimation of semantic BEV maps using the video input from a single onboard camera. We study three key aspects of this task, image-level understanding, BEV level understanding, and the aggregation of temporal information. Based on these three pillars we propose a novel architecture that combines these three aspects. In our extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the considered aspects are complementary to each other for BEV understanding. Furthermore, the proposed architecture significantly surpasses the current state-of-the-art. Code: https://github.com/ybarancan/BEV_feat_stitch.

AB An autonomous control system designed for a non-holonomic wheeled mobile robot that is programmed to emulate a fixed-wing unmanned air vehicle (UAV) flying at constant altitude is experimentally validated. The overall system is capable of waypoint navigation, threat avoidance, real-time trajectory generation and trajectory tracking. Both the wheeled mobile robot experimental platform and the hierarchical autonomous control software architecture are introduced. Programmed to emulate a fixed-wing UAV flying at constant altitude, a non-holonomic mobile robot is assigned to follow a desired time-parameterised trajectory generated by a real-time trajectory generator to transition through a sequence of targets in the presence of static and popup threats. Hardware results of the autonomous control system where the trajectory tracker applies two velocity controllers accounting for fixed-wing UAV-Iike input constraints, are compared to simulation results of dynamic controllers that are based on non-smooth backstepping to demonstrate the effectiveness of the overall system.

AB This paper presents a novel local motion planning framework in a hierarchical manner for autonomous vehicles to follow a trajectory and agilely avoid obstacles. In the upper layer, a new path-planning method based on the resistance network is applied to plan behaviors (e.g. lane keeping or changing), where the human-like factors can be included to simulate different driver styles, such as the aggressive, moderate, and conservative. The planned results (i.e. the lane-change command and the local planned path) will guide the lower-layer planner to decide the local motion. In the lower layer, for the sake of simplicity and alleviation of the computational burden, two separate model predictive controllers (MPC) based on a point-mass kinematic model are utilized for both longitudinal and lateral motion planning. Finally, a super-twisting sliding mode controller (STSMC) based motion tracker is designed to show the feasibility of the proposed decoupled planning method and decide the desired control actions of autonomous vehicles. Several scenarios are defined to comprehensively test and demonstrate the effectiveness and the real-time applicability of the new motion-planning framework. The results show that the proposed method performs very well in the planning and tracking process and takes less than 25 ms for the whole planning process, which can be easily implemented in real-world applications.

AB Transferring data between the ocean surface and an operating Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is a difficult and slow process. Current methods of un-tethered submersible communication have either a very limited data transfer rate or a prohibitively short range. In this paper, students of the University of Florida propose a new data transfer method that will supply the high data rates of a tethered system yet still maintain the advantages of a fully autonomous submersible. This paper reports the process of designing, testing, and proving this new approach. This method will improve communication between AUVs and the operator and enhance AUV operational efficiency and safety.
   This approach uses an AUV paired with an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) that carries a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). During operation, the ROV is launched from the ASV. The ROV dives to the approximate operating depth of the AUV. The AUV is acoustically summoned on an as-needed basis or based on a predefined schedule. When the transducer from the ROV begins transmitting, the AUV acquires the acoustic signal. Once in visual range, visual indicators on the ROV guide the AUV toward the docking mechanism on the ROV. When docked, the AUV transfers data through the ROV and to the ASV through the tether. Data on the ASV is stored onboard or transmitted to the user through wireless or satellite communications. Once the ASV data transfer is complete, the AUV is released from the ROV to continue its normal operation.

AB Automated vehicles (AVs) could completely change mobility in the coming years and decades. As AVs are still under development and gathering empirical data for further analysis is not yet possible, existing studies mainly applied models and simulations to assess their impact. This paper provides a comprehensive review of modelling studies investigating the impacts of AVs on travel behaviour and land use. It shows that AVs are mostly found to increase vehicle miles travelled and reduce public transport and slow modes share. This particularly applies to private AVs, which are also leading to a more dispersed urban growth pattern. Shared automated vehicle fleets, conversely, could have positive impacts, including reducing the overall number of vehicles and parking spaces. Moreover, if it is assumed that automation would make the public transport system more efficient, AVs could lead to a favouring of urbanisation processes. However, results are very sensitive to model assumptions which are still very uncertain (e.g. the perception of time in AVs) and more research to gain further insight should have priority in future research as well as the development of the models and their further adaptation to AVs.

ID STABILIZATION
AB This paper presents a finite-time visual servoing control strategy for the autonomous landing of a quadrotor onto a tilting and moving landing vehicle. The proposed method, called Finite-Time Dynamic Visual Servo (FTDVS) control, utilizes a computer vision technique called Virtual Reticle Image Plane (VRIP) to track four observable features on the landing plane called landmarks. To represent the sea state, target-plane tilting motion is modelled using monochromatic sinusoidal waves. VRIP exploits the sinusoidal tilting pose of the landing plane and calculates the time period of the tilting motion. Based on this time period, the proposed FTDVS control strategy enables the quadrotor to search for suitable landing windows on a tilting target plane. The proposed finite-time controller converges the tracking errors to zero in finite-time during a landing maneuver. First, a rigorous stability analysis of the FTDVS control law is presented, followed by simulations demonstrating acceptable performance in terms of tracking accuracy when compared to existing controllers for autonomous landing on moving targets. The proposed method has been experimentally validated in an indoor environment.

AB This paper introduces an integrated path tracking control strategy for autonomous vehicles. The proposed control strategy is based on a multi-input multi-output linear model predictive control (LMPC) with a fuzzy logic switching system. The designed MPC is based on Laguerre networks. The main target of the designed MPC is to produce the optimal control signals of the steering angle and the angular velocity while considering the physical constraints of the control signals and the measurements noise. Since the vehicle model is highly nonlinear and is operated over a wide range of operating points, different linearized models are obtained. The controller parameters for each linear model are designed and tuned. The gab metric analysis is used to select a number of these models to simplify the design of the proposed controller. Then, these models are combined using a fuzzy logic controller to switch between them. To test the proposed controller performance, different paths are generated using path planning algorithms. These paths simulate different vehicle maneuvers scenarios. The simulation results show that the designed tracking controller has a tracking performance on different designed paths better than that of a Linear quadratic gaussian (LQG) tracking controller, discussed in this paper.(c) 2021 ISA.

AB Advancement in the field of autonomous motion planning has enabled the realisation of fully autonomous unmanned vehicles. Sampling based motion planning algorithms have shown promising prospects in generating fast, effective and practical solutions to different motion planning problems in unmanned vehicles for both civilian and military applications. But the goal bias introduced by heuristic probability shaping to generate faster solution may result in local collisions. A simple, real-time method is proposed for goal direction by preferential selection of a state from a sampled pair of random state, based on the distance to goal. This limits the graph motions resulting in smaller data structure, making the algorithm optimised for time and solution length. This would enable unmanned vehicles to take shorter paths and avoid collisions in obstacle rich environment. The approach is analysed on a sampling based algorithm, rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) which computes motion plans under constrain of time. This paper proposes an algorithm called 'goal directed RRT (GRRT)' building on the basic RRT algorithm, providing an alternative to probabilistic goal biasing, thereby avoiding local collision. The approach is evaluated by benchmarking it with RRT algorithm for kinematic car, dynamic car and a quadrotor and the results show improvements in length of the motion plans and the time of computing.

AB Numerous traffic crashes occur every year on zebra crossings in China. Pedestrians are vulnerable road users who are usually injured severely or fatally during human-vehicle collisions. The development of an effective pedestrian street-crossing decision-making model is essential to improving pedestrian street-crossing safety. For this purpose, this paper carried out a naturalistic field experiment to collect a large number of vehicle and pedestrian motion data. Through interviewed with many pedestrians, it is found that they pay more attention to whether the driver can safely brake the vehicle before reaching the zebra crossing. Therefore, this work established a novel decision-making model based on the vehicle deceleration-safety gap (VD-SGM). The deceleration threshold of VD-SGM was determined based on signal detection theory (SDT). To verify the performance of VD-SGM proposed in this work, the model was compared with the Raff model. The results show that the VD-SGM performs better and the false alarm rate is lower. The VD-SGM proposed in this work is of great significance to improve pedestrians' safety. Meanwhile, the model can also increase the efficiency of autonomous vehicles.

AB This paper presents an emergency pullover algorithm for fail-safe systems designed for level-4 autonomous vehicles. The proposed algorithm utilizes feedback gain adaptation, based on sensitivity estimation, and cost-based learning. Vehicle failure within this paper does not encompass every type of failure and refers only to any situation where the upper controller or communications from the upper controller shuts down. When this type of failure occurs, the algorithm performs an emergency pullover maneuver. This maneuver does not require any form of independent control from the driver to be performed successfully. However, the highest control priority is still given to the driver if the driver intervenes during the maneuver. The feedback gain adaptation is comprised of two sections: Sensitivity Estimation and Gradient Descent (GD) based Adaptation. For Sensitivity Estimation, a relationship function has been designed with feedback gain, from the feedback gain adaptation, and changes in state error. The sensitivity of state error with respect to feedback gain can then be estimated. This estimation is done through the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) method with multiple forgetting factors through the directional forgetting method. For GD based Adaptation, state errors are applied with parameters for the cost-based learning to give Adaptation Gains. These Adaptation Gains are used in tandem with the estimated sensitivity to update the feedback gain. To reduce the number of tuning parameters required in the GD method, an additional distance condition has been proposed. This condition utilizes feedback change rates and state errors, obtained from the multi-dimensional plane of the feedback gain's change rates. A proportional coefficient is also required as a tuning parameter for this condition. This parameter is tuned by a cost-based learning algorithm, also designed in this study. Resultantly, these methods allow the adaptive feedback controller to forgo any system information such as mathematical models and system parameters. This indicates that the vehicle model is not expected to hinder performance. Hence, controllers that do not require system information are indeed a preferable algorithm for fail-safe modules. Performance evaluations for the controller has also been conducted with actual vehicle tests, under longitudinal and lateral autonomous driving scenarios.

AB This research study keenly employs the ground-breaking theory of ELECTRE method in order to advance the literature with a more competent technique for the frequently implemented and incredibly practical model of spherical fuzzy sets. The eminent characteristics, broader approach and adaptable model of spherical fuzzy set empowers the proposed strategy to captivate each type of the imprecise human judgement (whether in favor, against, neutral or hesitant) using a dependent and three independent membership grades. The remarkable novelty of the proposed approach is its successful application even with no criteria weights knowledge. Furthermore, the proposed technique processes the spherical fuzzy data and examines different types of preferences among alternatives using three threshold values. These preferences contribute to classify the outranking relations among the alternatives within five different levels of dominance. Later on, the iterative approach of distillation is deployed to figure out the final ranking. The proposed strategy is applied to meet the challenges in the implementation of autonomous vehicles in Turkey. After a through evaluation of five corridors via proposed technique in reference to fifteen criteria, metrobus corridor appears as the most appropriate for the autonomous vehicle operation. In the last, the consistency of the proposed approach is delineated via comparative analysis with existing spherical fuzzy CODAS and spherical fuzzy PROMETHEE approaches and other convincing evidences.

AB Maneuvering a truck-trailer system while docking is extremely challenging. This article aims to alleviate this problem by presenting an enhanced path-following control framework for autonomous semi-trailer docking. In the proposed system, adaptive controllers that utilize gain scheduling are introduced for forward and reverse path-following tasks in docking maneuvers to increase the robustness and path-following performance. The system includes an improved pure pursuit controller with adaptive look-ahead distance for forward path following; a cascade controller of reverse pure pursuit and a gain-scheduled LQ control for reverse path-following. In the evaluation of the path-following performance of forward and reverse controllers, the closed-loop system of path-following controllers with the truck-trailer kinematic model is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink for various test cases, and the results are compared with those of other studies. Furthermore, different docking scenarios are generated via the cascade path planning algorithm for autonomous semitrailer docking. These are tested with a high degree semi-trailer model within the IPG TruckMaker simulation environment, and with a full truck-trailer vehicle in the test field. The results of both simulations and physical testing clearly demonstrate improvements in terms of the control problem formulation, i.e., the stabilized path-following is obtained with acceptable path-following errors.

AB Appropriate deployment of autonomous-vehicle-dedicated lanes (AVDLs) is crucial for optimizing transportation system with mixed human-driven and autonomous vehicles. Existing studies mainly focus on matching the capacity and traffic flow volume to maximize throughput under different AV penetration rate, while lane changing scenarios and network geometry impacts were ignored. Therefore, the lateral locations in optimal deployment on expressway cannot be determined. This study developed an analysis framework to jointly optimize the longitudinal and lateral locations of AVDLs on expressways. The problem is formulated as a bi-level optimization model. In the lower level, a lane-level multiclass equilibrium assignment model is built to predict traffic flow distribution among lanes on both longitudinal and lateral locations regarding AVDL deployment plan. In the upper level, a 0-1 integer programming model is established to obtain the optimal deployment plan of the AVDL with minimal total travel time (TTT). Additionally, a problem-specific heuristic-based adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm is developed to solve the problem. The advantages of the proposed model are validated in North-South Elevated Expressway, Shanghai, China. Results indicate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in terms of TTT reduction. Finally, sensitivity analysis demonstrates the robustness of the developed method in reducing the TTT under different headways, demand levels, and OD distributions. The proposed framework enables the optimal deployment of AVDLs regarding both longitudinal and lateral locations in urban expressways containing multiple on-and off-ramps, which supports decision-making for managing expressway with mixed HV and AV traffic flow.

TI Low-cost solid-state LiDAR/inertial-based localization with prior map
   for autonomous systems in urban scenarios
SO IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS

DT Article
ID POINT; ICP; VEHICLES; ROBUST
AB A low-cost and accurate positioning solution is significant for the massive deployment of fully autonomous driving vehicles (ADV). Conventional mechanical LiDAR has proven its performance, but its high cost hinders the massive production of autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes a low-cost LiDAR/inertial-based localization solution for autonomous systems with prior maps in urban areas. Instead of relying on the costly mechanical LiDAR, this paper proposes to utilize the solid-state LiDAR (SSL) with the prior map to estimate the position of the vehicle by matching the real-time point clouds from the SSL and the prior map using the normal distribution transformation (NDT) algorithm. However, the field of view (FOV) of the SSL is signifcantly smaller than the conventional mechanical LiDAR, which can easily lead to failure during the NDT map matching. To fill this gap, this paper proposes to exploit the complementariness of the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and the SSL, where the IMU pre-integration provides a coarse but high-frequency initial guess to the map matching. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in this paper, the authors collect the dataset in two typical urban scenarios through a pedestrian hand-hold and a vehicle driving condition. The results reveal that the SSL-only-based localization is significantly challenged in dynamic scenarios. With the help of the IMU, the robustness of the proposed method is significantly improved, achieving an accuracy of within 0.5 m. To show the sensitivity of the SSL-based map matching against the initial guess of the state, this paper also presents the convergence results of the map matching under different levels of accuracy in terms of the initial guess.

AB Autonomous vehicles need to have sufficient perception of the surrounding environment to produce appropriate driving behavior. The Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication technology can exchange the speed, position, direction, and other information between autonomous vehicles to improve the sensing ability of the traditional on-board sensors. For example, V2V communication technology does not have a blind spot like a conventional on-board sensor, and V2V communication is not easily affected by weather conditions. However, it is almost impossible to make every vehicle a V2V-equipped vehicle in the real environment due to reasons such as policy and user choice. Low penetration of V2V-equipped vehicles greatly reduces the performance of the traditional V2V system. In this paper, however, we propose a novel method that can extend the awareness ability of the traditional V2V system without adding much extra investment. In the traditional V2V system, only a V2V-equipped vehicle can broadcast its own location information. However, the situation is somewhat different in our V2V system. Although non-V2V-equipped vehicles cannot broadcast their own location information, we can let V2V-equipped vehicle with radar and other sensors detect the location information of the surrounding non-V2V-equipped vehicles and then broadcast it out. Therefore, we think that a non-V2V-equipped vehicle can also broadcast its own location information. In this way, we greatly extend the awareness ability of the traditional V2V system. The proposed method is validated by real experiments and simulation experiments.

AB Vehicle dynamics control systems have a fundamental role in smart and autonomous mobility, where one of the most crucial aspects is the vehicle body velocity estimation. In this paper, the problem of a correct evaluation of the vehicle longitudinal velocity for dynamic control applications is approached using a neural networks technique employing a set of measured samples referring to signals usually available on-board, such as longitudinal and lateral acceleration, steering angle, yaw rate and linear wheel speed. Experiments were run on four professional driving circuits with very different characteristics, and the vehicle longitudinal velocity was estimated with different neural network training policies and validated through comparison with the measurements of the one acquired at the vehicle's center of gravity, provided by an optical Correvit sensor, which serves as the reference (and, therefore, exact) velocity values. The results obtained with the proposed methodology are in good agreement with the reference values in almost all tested conditions, covering both the linear and the nonlinear behavior of the car, proving that artificial neural networks can be efficiently employed onboard, thereby enriching the standard set of control and safety-related electronics.

AB Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), especially Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are vulnerable to security and safety issues that threaten the lives of the people. Unlike manual vehicles, the security of communications and computing components of AVs can be compromised using advanced hacking techniques, thus barring AVs from the effective use in our routine lives. Once manual vehicles are connected to the Internet, called the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), it would be exploited by cyber-attacks, like denial of service, sniffing, distributed denial of service, spoofing and replay attacks. In this article, we present a deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for ITS, in particular, to discover suspicious network activity of In-Vehicles Networks (IVN), vehicles to vehicles (V2V) communications and vehicles to infrastructure (V2I) networks. A Deep Learning architecture-based Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder algorithm is designed to recognize intrusive events from the central network gateways of AVs. The proposed IDS is evaluated using two benchmark datasets, i.e., the car hacking dataset for in-vehicle communications and the UNSW-NB15 dataset for external network communications. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed system achieved over a 99% accuracy for detecting all types of attacks on the car hacking dataset and a 98% accuracy on the UNSW-NB15 dataset, outperforming other eight intrusion detection techniques.

AB The aim of trajectory planning is to generate a feasible, collision-free trajectory to guide an autonomous vehicle from the initial state to the goal state safely. However, it is difficult to guarantee that the trajectory is feasible for the vehicle and the real path of the vehicle is collision-free when the vehicle follows the trajectory. In this paper, a state-increment statistical model (SISM) is proposed to describe the kinodynamic constraints of a vehicle by modeling the controller, the actuator, and the vehicle model jointly. The SISM consists of Gaussian distributions of lateral error increments in all state subspaces which are composed of the curvature radius, the velocity, and the lateral error. It is a data-driven modeling approach that can improve the SISM via increasing the number of samples of the increment-state, which is composed of the state and its corresponding increment of the lateral error. According to the SISM, the experience cast functions are designed to evaluate the trajectories for searching the hest one with the lowest cost, and the real path can be predicted directly according to the planned trajectory and the vehicle state. The predicted path can be utilized effectually to evaluate the safety of the vehicle motion.

AB Skid-steered vehicles, by design, must skid in order to maneuver. The skidding causes the vehicle to behave discontinuously during a maneuver as well as introduces complications to the observation of the vehicle's state, both of which affect a controller's performance. This paper addresses estimation of contact state by applying switched system optimization to estimate skidding properties of the skid-steered vehicle.
   In order to treat the skid-steered vehicle as a switched system, the vehicle's ground interaction is modeled using Coulomb friction, thereby partitioning the system dynamics into four distinct modes, one for each combination of the forward and back wheel pairs sticking or skidding. Thus, as the vehicle maneuvers, the system propagates over some mode sequence, transitioning between modes over some set of switching times. This paper presents second-order optimization algorithms for estimating these switching times. We emphasize the importance of the second-order algorithm because it exhibits quadratic convergence and because even for relatively simple examples, first-order methods fail to converge on time scales compatible with real-time operation. Furthermore, the paper presents a technique for estimating the mode sequence by optimizing a relaxation of the switched system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article investigates a robust path-following control problem of multiple autonomous vehicles along an implicit elliptical curve. At the kinematic level, by formulating a novel coordinated error in terms of projective arc length instead of relative distance, a new distributed guidance law is developed for multiple vehicles evolving along a geometric path, achieving an equal arc separation and a uniform forward speed. Based on simple filtering operations upon available states and invariant manifold, unknown system dynamics estimators (USDEs)-based robust kinetic controllers with a concise structure are derived to enable a satisfied nominal tracking of velocity and angular rate subject to uncertainties while eliminating the computational complexity encountered in the available function approximators. The remarkable merit of the explored solution lies in that robust cooperative behaviors over an implicit elliptical curve can be attained by specifying successive projective arc length for nonholonomic vehicles, avoiding the time-consuming path variable synchronization calculation inherent in parameterized reference-guided paradigms, eliminating temporal limitations of time-related function in trajectory tracking strategies. It is proven that all signals of a closed-loop system are convergent by using the input-to-state stable (ISS) principle. Simulation and experimental outcomes are both delivered to substantiate the efficacy and superiority of the presented method.

TI Structural Transformer Improves Speed-Accuracy Trade-Off in Interactive

AB Fast and accurate long-term trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles (SVs) is critical to autonomous driving systems. In high-density traffic flows, strongly correlated vehicle behaviors require considering the interactions among multiple SVs when predicting their future trajectories. However, existing interactive prediction methods, most based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are suffering from slow prediction because they analyze SVs one by one and analyze trajectory sequence node by node. This paper presents a fast interactive trajectory prediction method called Structural Transformer which learns both spatial and temporal dependencies among multiple SVs in parallel. Specifically, our model first removes the internal states and loops of LSTM and replaces with a weighted self-reference mapping to realize parallel computation. Then, it embeds the relative spatial information of multiple SVs into trajectory states and reorganizes the self-reference mapping with neighbor-only interaction masks to achieve interactive prediction. Results on the NGSIM dataset show satisfyingly speed and accuracy performance on long-term trajectory prediction of multiple SVs. The longitudinal and lateral errors are reduced to 2.67m and 0.25m over 5s time horizon. The computational time of each step is only 12ms on a 2080ti GPU, which is over 4 times faster than the Structural LSTM.

ID PREDICTION
AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are required to operate safely and efficiently in dynamic environments. For this, the AVs equipped with Joint Radar-Communications (JRC) functions can enhance the driving safety by utilizing both radar detection and data communication functions. However, optimizing the performance of the AV system with two different functions under uncertainty and dynamic of surrounding environments is very challenging. In this work, we first propose an intelligent optimization framework based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) to help the AV make optimal decisions in selecting JRC operation functions under the dynamic and uncertainty of the surrounding environment. We then develop an effective learning algorithm leveraging recent advances of deep reinforcement learning techniques to find the optimal policy for the AV without requiring any prior information about surrounding environment. Furthermore, to make our proposed framework more scalable, we develop a Transfer Learning (TL) mechanism that enables the AV to leverage valuable experiences for accelerating the training process when it moves to a new environment. Extensive simulations show that the proposed transferable deep reinforcement learning framework reduces the obstacle miss detection probability by the AV up to 67% compared to other conventional deep reinforcement learning approaches. With the deep reinforcement learning and transfer learning approaches, our proposed solution can find its applications in a wide range of autonomous driving scenarios from driver assistance to full automation transportation.

AB Academic research in the field of autonomous vehicles has reached high popularity in recent years related to several topics as sensor technologies, V2X communications, safety, security, decision making, control, and even legal and standardization rules. Besides classic control design approaches, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning methods are present in almost all of these fields. Another part of research focuses on different layers of Motion Planning, such as strategic decisions, trajectory planning, and control. A wide range of techniques in Machine Learning itself have been developed, and this article describes one of these fields, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The paper provides insight into the hierarchical motion planning problem and describes the basics of DRL. The main elements of designing such a system are the modeling of the environment, the modeling abstractions, the description of the state and the perception models, the appropriate rewarding, and the realization of the underlying neural network. The paper describes vehicle models, simulation possibilities and computational requirements. Strategic decisions on different layers and the observation models, e.g., continuous and discrete state representations, grid-based, and camera-based solutions are presented. The paper surveys the state-of-art solutions systematized by the different tasks and levels of autonomous driving, such as car-following, lane-keeping, trajectory following, merging, or driving in dense traffic. Finally, open questions and future challenges are discussed.

AB The localization system is one of the key components of autonomous vehicles. Widely-used GNSS (low-cost) alone can not meet the centimeter accuracy and is unstable in urban environment. Typically LiDAR-based localization system is very computationally demanding due to the usage of the dense point cloud map. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight LiDAR-based localization system for autonomous vehicle in this paper. The proposed system only relies on lightweight poles and curbs landmark map, which is highly robust and efficient compared to other localization systems. Poles and curbs are selected as landmarks because of their commonality and stability. We novelly propose a Branch-and-Bound (BnB)-based global optimization method to tackle the data association problem of poles. Motion decoupling is adopted to decouple translation and rotation to improve the efficiency of the BnB-based algorithm. Besides, we propose a new local grid map-based representation for curbs to make better use of curb information. Cost functions for pole and curb are defined respectively and then fused for the subsequent non-linear optimization method to obtain the vehicle location. Experiments on KITTI dataset and our self-collected dataset demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our system.

AB We propose an integral sliding mode controller (ISMC) to stabilse an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) which is subject to modelling errors and often suffers from unknown environmental disturbances. The ISMC is effective in compensating for the uncertainties in the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic parameters of the vehicle and rejecting the unpredictable disturbance effects due to ocean waves, tides and currents. The ISMC is comprised of an equivalent controller and a switching controller to suppress the parameter uncertainties and external disturbances, and its closed-loop system is exponentially stable. Numerical simulations were performed to validate the proposed control approach, and experimental tests using Cyclops AUV were carried out to demonstrate its practical feasibility.

AB Fleet operators rely on forecasts of future user requests to reposition empty vehicles and efficiently operate their vehicle fleets. In the context of an on-demand shared-use autonomous vehicle (AV) mobility service (SAMS), this study analyzes the trade-off that arises when selecting a spatio-temporal demand forecast aggregation level to support the operation of a SAMS fleet. In general, when short-term forecasts of user requests are intended for a finer space-time discretization, they tend to become less reliable. However, holding reliability constant, more disaggregate forecasts provide more valuable information to fleet operators. To explore this trade-off, this study presents a flexible methodological framework to evaluate and quantify the impact of spatio-temporal demand forecast aggregation on the operational efficiency of a SAMS fleet. At the core of the methodological framework is an agent-based simulation that requires a demand forecasting method and a SAMS fleet operational strategy. This study employs an offline demand forecasting method, and an online joint AV-user assignment and empty AV repositioning strategy. Using this forecasting method and fleet operational strategy, as well as Manhattan, NY taxi data, this study simulates the operations of a SAMS fleet across various spatio-temporal aggregation levels. Results indicate that as demand forecasts (and subregions) become more spatially disaggregate, fleet performance improves, in terms of user wait time and empty fleet miles. This finding comes despite demand forecast quality decreasing as subregions become more spatially disaggregate. Additionally, results indicate the SAMS fleet significantly benefits from higher quality demand forecasts, especially at more disaggregate levels.

AB The vast range of possible fully autonomous multiunmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV) operations is creating a new and expanding market where technological advances are happening at a breakneck pace. The integration of UAVs in airspaces (not just for military purposes but also for civil, commercial, and leisure use) is essential in realizing the potential of this growing industry. Furthermore, with the advent of 6G, such integration will be cost-effective and more flexible. However, to reach widespread adoption, new models focusing on the safety, efficiency, reliability, and privacy of fully autonomous multi-UAV operations, ensuring that the operation history is trustworthy and can be audited by the relevant stakeholders, need to be developed. Accordingly, this work presents a research guideline for fully autonomous trustworthy UAV teamwork through layer 2 blockchains that provide efficient, privacy-preserving, reliable, and secure multi-UAV service delivery. We show the implications of this approach for an aerial surveillance use case.

AB Collision avoidance is a key issue for high-speed vehicles in emergency situations, particularly as it pertains to surrounding vehicles. Accordingly, a hierarchical framework for human-driven or autonomous vehicles is proposed that ensures the safe operation of vehicles in emergency driving scenarios while considering surrounding vehicles. The developed emergency collision-avoidance system consists of an estimator module, a prediction module, a manoeuvre decision-making module, and a manoeuvre control module. The core module for manoeuvre decision making uses finite state machine (FSM) technology to determine the appropriate manoeuvre for avoiding collisions. In particular, a collision risk model is developed in this module, taking into account risk related to surrounding vehicles in the overlapping region, road adhesion, and stabilization performance of vehicle. In the manoeuvre control module, accounting for safe gaps to surrounding vehicles in an adjacent lane, the longitudinal manoeuvre is generated by a model predictive-control algorithm. A yaw stability controller is designed using lateral tire force estimate-based sliding mode control, accounting for both the collision and vehicle stabilization. To mediate the demands of yaw stabilization and collision risk, particularly for reducing the loss of velocity, an integrated controller with propulsion is developed. Modeling vehicles driving under different road conditions with various road adhesion and surrounding-vehicle settings, the results of experiments in a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) system have successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed collision avoidance system.

AB Detecting vehicle turn signals at night is critical for both assistant driving systems and autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method that consists of detection and tracking modules to achieve a high level of robustness. For nighttime vehicle detection, a Nakagami-image-based method is used to locate the regions containing vehicle lights. At the same time, a set of vehicle object proposals is generated using a region proposal network based on convolutional neural network (CNN) feature maps. Then, the light regions and proposals are combined to generate the regions of interest (ROIs) for the further detection. Vehicle candidates are extracted from the ROIs using a softmax classifier with CNN-based features. For the tracking module, we propose a perceptional hashing algorithm to track these vehicle candidates. During the tracking, turn signals are detected by analyzing the continuous intensity variation of the vehicle box sequences. Experimental results for typical sequences show that the proposed method can robustly detect and track a vehicle in front with over 95% accuracy and recognize the turning signals in night scenes with a detection rate of over 90%. The vehicle detection method improves the miss rate of state-of-the-art systems by more than 20%. In addition, the proposed vehicle tracking method outperforms other state-of-the-art systems.

AB Compared with conventional vehicles, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are featured by increased energy efficiency and road safety, yet hardly meet with much success without enough human trust. Designing appropriate interactions between AV and human, such as communication with pedestrians, could help enhance trust and public acceptance. In this work, we examine design characteristics of AV interface, including communication style, explicit display of vehicle speed, and adaptive strategy, and study their effects on pedestrians' trust behaviors. It is found that any communication style could improve pedestrians' trust in AV and decision alignment with AV expectations. Among the three communication styles, commanding and advisory are significantly better than informative, in terms of trust improvement (commanding versus informative: t = 3.61 and p < 0.001; advisory versus informative: t = 2.78, p = 0.005) and decision alignment ((a) in expected cross scenarios, commanding versus informative: t = 0.35 and p < 0.001; advisory versus informative: t = 11.71, p < 0.001; (b) in expected not cross scenarios, commanding versus informative: t = -7.61, p < 0.001; advisory versus informative: t = -6.40, p < 0.001). Adding speed information on top of explicit message communication does not change the relative effectiveness of individual styles, even though the display of speed-only information has significantly improved both measures (trust: F = 9.39 and p = 0.002; decision: F = 6.04 and p = 0.015). In addition, applying an adaptive communication strategy when yielding would significantly improve pedestrians' trust (t = 9.33 and p < 0.001) and decision alignment (t = 14.78 and p < 0.001). This study demonstrates the influence of design characteristics on the formation of trust relationships between pedestrians and autonomous vehicles and paves the ways for developing more advanced AV communication mechanisms.

DE Internet of Vehicles; distributed optimization; multicast data
   dissemination; submodular optimization
AB The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a promising paradigm for autonomous driving, where the sensing data from the onboard sensors can be disseminated and processed cooperatively via vehicle-to-vehicle links. Autonomous vehicles can share their local views for cooperative, reliable, and robust driving decisions. However, the limited wireless resources may become the bottleneck with the increasing number of vehicles. The technical challenges also arise from the decentralized control, the spatial couplings of decisions, and the complexity of combinatorial optimization. This paper proposes a novel fully distributed graph-based approach to jointly optimize multicast link establishment with data dissemination and processing decisions by only exchanging partial information among neighboring vehicles. The mixed-integer programming problem aims to maximize system energy efficiency while achieving maximum data throughput. We prove that maximizing data processing throughput is submodular optimization to find the local optimum efficiently. The optimization of data dissemination and processing is reformulated to a minimum-cost maximum-flow problem in a three-layer graph, and efficiently solved by exploiting the graphical interdependence. Both simulation-generated and trace-based datasets are evaluated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of data throughput and energy efficiency.

AB Motion planning algorithms, an essential part of the autonomous driving system, have been extensively studied. However, in large-scale complex scenarios, how to develop an optimal path to comply with the requirements of smoothness and safety remains a vital issue. In this study, a hierarchical search spacial scales-based hybrid A* (termed as HHA*) motion planning method is proposed, capable of efficiently generating smooth and safe paths. The proposed HHA* method covers two stages. First, the search space is divided on a coarse scale to generate local goals. Subsequently, the novel heuristic function and exploration strategies are adopted in the fine-scale search space to generate paths like that with a human driver guided by the local goals. Moreover, with the usage of the clothoid, the smoothness of the generated path is improved to be G(2)-continuous (i.e., curvature continuous), which fits the vehicle's kinematic constraints without the need for later smoothing. Numerous experimental results from the simulation and on-road tests indicate that the proposed method can effectively perform motion planning that meets smoothness and safety in large-scale complex scenarios.

AB In an autonomous vehicle, the lane following algorithm is an important component, which is a basic function of autonomous driving. However, the existing lane following system has a few shortcomings: first, the control method it adopts requires an accurate system model, and different vehicles have different parameters, which needs a lot of parameter calibration work. The second is that it may fail on road sections where the lateral acceleration requirements of vehicles are large, such as large curves. Third, its decision-making system is defined based on rules, which has disadvantages: it is difficult to formulate; human subjective factors cannot guarantee objectivity; coverage is difficult to guarantee. In recent years, the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm has been widely used in the field of autonomous driving due to its strong nonlinear fitting ability and generalization performance. However, the DDPG algorithm has overestimated state action values and large cumulative errors, low training efficiency and other issues. Therefore, this paper improves the DDPG algorithm based on the double critic networks and priority experience replay mechanism. Then this paper proposes a lane following method based on this algorithm. Experiment shows that the algorithm can achieve excellent following results under various road conditions.

AB The aim of this study was to design a navigation system composed of a human-controlled leader vehicle and a follower vehicle. The follower vehicle automatically tracks the leader vehicle. With such a system, a human driver can control two vehicles efficiently in agricultural operations. The tracking system was developed for the leader and the follower vehicle, and control of the follower was performed using a camera vision system. A stable and accurate monocular vision-based sensing system was designed, consisting of a camera and rectangular markers. Noise in the data acquisition was reduced by using the least-squares method. A feedback control algorithm was used to allow the follower vehicle to track the trajectory of the leader vehicle. A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller was introduced to maintain the required distance between the leader and the follower vehicle. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the sensing and tracking performances of the leader-follower system while the leader vehicle was driven at an average speed of 0.3 m/s. In the case of linear trajectory tracking, the RMS errors were 6.5 cm, 8.9 cm and 16.4 cm for straight, turning and zigzag paths, respectively. Again, for parallel trajectory tracking, the root mean square (RMS) errors were found to be 7.1 cm, 14.6 cm and 14.0 cm for straight, turning and zigzag paths, respectively. The navigation performances indicated that the autonomous follower vehicle was able to follow the leader vehicle, and the tracking accuracy was found to be satisfactory. Therefore, the developed leader-follower system can be implemented for the harvesting of grains, using a combine as the leader and an unloader as the autonomous follower vehicle.

AB This paper aims to evaluate the traffic and environmental performance when implementing scenarios with shared vehicles (SVs), electric vehicles (EVs) and automated vehicles (AVs) using a macro simulation modeling platform. Several scenarios were performed with different penetrations of shared, electric and automated vehicles to study the impact of CO2 and NOx emissions in terms of individual and system emissions in an intercity corridor in Portugal. A simplified model to estimate CO2 and NOx emissions for a representative vehicle based on average speed as input variable was used. The results suggest that for a group of realistic combinations of alternative mobility penetration scenarios, system CO2 emissions range from -22% to +6%, and system NOx emissions range from -35% to +5%. Emissions per vehicle show a range from -13% to +1% and from -18% to +8% for CO2 and NOx levels, respectively. Also, critical sectors were analyzed on both routes for the baseline scenario, which proved to be similar. Although increased shared mobility and electrification are generally positive, it is necessary to be aware that new mobility forms can lead to potentially adverse emission effects in some network sections. For instance, increased capacity on the highways caused by CAVs and consequent increase in average speed can be disadvantageous in the context of high penetration of electric vehicles that are more efficient at lower speeds.

AB Autonomous driving has the potential to make transportation systems safer, greener and more efficient. To realize autonomous driving, a great deal of in-car cutting-edge applications such as augmented reality, dynamic path planning and cognitive driving systems are required, which need significant computational resources and near realtime response. To cope with this new paradigm, vehicular fog computing (VFC) has emerged recently, which migrates the computing from congested base stations (or cloud servers) to nearby vehicles with under-utilized computational resources. in VFC, the designs of server recruitment and task offloading strategies under information asymmetry and uncertainty pose new technical challenges. in this article, we propose a two-stage VFC framework to address these challenges. The framework consists of a contract theory based vehicular computational resource management mechanism, and a matching-learning based task offloading mechanism. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework can boost the performance of VFC in terms of resource utilization efficiency and task offloading delay.

SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

ID TRACKING; ROAD; LADAR
AB An important off-road driving rule is to keep the vehicle wheels in existing ruts when possible. Rut following has the following benefits: (1) it prevents the ruts from serving as obstacles that can lead to undesirable vehicle vibrations and even vehicle instability at high speeds; (2) it improves vehicle safety on turns by utilizing the extra lateral force provided by the ruts to reduce lateral slippage and guide the vehicle through its path; (3) it improves the vehicle energy efficiency by reducing the energy wasted on compacting the ground; and (4) it increases vehicle traction when traversing soft terrains such as mud, sand, and snow. This paper first presents a set of field experiments that illustrate the improved energy efficiency and traction obtained by rut following. Then, a laser-based rut detection and following system is proposed so that autonomous ground vehicles can benefit from the application of this off-road driving rule. The proposed system utilizes a path planning algorithm to aid in the rut detection process and an extended Kalman filter to recursively estimate the parameters of a local model of the rut being followed. Experimental evaluation on a Pioneer 3-AT robot shows that the proposed system is capable of detecting and following ruts in a variety of scenarios. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This paper proposes a mission management system (MMS) to manage target recognition and path planning for the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) ocean survey. The system is autonomous and can trigger the corresponding mechanism according to the real-time ocean environment. The purpose is to survey only interest areas after online targets recognition, reducing wasted time optimizing mission-independent paths. The recognition part uses an improved end-to-end lightweight neural network algorithm, wide perception based on ShuffleNet (W-ShuffleNet), which enhances the image of the carried sensor information and performs online recognition, the accuracy of the simulation test is above 98%. The path planning part uses a real-time path planning (RTPP) method to explore the best strategy by evaluating the recognition results over a while to achieve the purpose of real-time adjustment of the AUV path, which effectively saves time and energy costs. This system is essential for improving overall mission performance and conducting effective ocean surveys under realistic conditions. We conducted sea trials with an AUV equipped with side-scan sonar, and the sea trial results proved the effectiveness of our proposed MMS.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) has been discussed as a promising solution to substantially improve transit system performance. However, the feasibility of AVs at a system level remains unclear. This paper offers an early glimpse of the efficiency performance of an AV-based transit system in Singapore, namely Dynamic Autonomous Road Transit (DART). Compared to the existing bus system, the improved operational strategy of DART service can garner higher efficiency with respective reductions of 44%, 66% and 47% in total cost of ownership (TCO), TCO/km/h and TCO/passenger. A stated-preference survey was conducted, and the data analysed via a mixed logit model. Travel time and travel cost remain critical for determining an individual's travelling preferences. In addition, the current paper presents empirical evidence that travellers are more sensitive to travel time reduction, compared to travel cost reduction. It is also found that a traveller's preferences towards walking, waiting and in-vehicle activities play an influential role of behavioural adjustment. Value of time (VOT) was calibrated with a value of S$ 31 and a reduction of 49% was observed for individuals who performed work-related activities while travelling.

AB The intelligence of connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) is insufficient to deal with the complex road conditions. However, the application of exclusive lanes bypasses the long wait for the technology to mature. Prior to the maturity of intelligent transport systems (ITSs), it's a feasible solution in terms of technology and cost to set up exclusive lanes. In this way, CAVs will form an efficient and energy-saving autonomous fleet. An improved cellular automata model is used to study the effect of setting up exclusive lanes for CAVs on traffic flow throughput and stability on the freeway. A multi-lane freeway, equipped with intelligent sensors and road signs, is set up and three stages are designed according to the development degree of CAVs. This paper introduces two kinds of significant data by simulation: heterogeneous traffic flow and the degradation rate of CAV. They verify that setting up exclusive lanes for CAV will greatly improve the traffic condition of the freeway on the different penetration rates of CAV. Although the establishment of exclusive lanes can only slightly improve the traffic capacity, it can effectively inhibit the degradation of CAV within the range of CAV's penetration rates from 10% to 80%.

AB High performance light detection and ranging (lidars) are essential in autonomous robots such as self-driving cars, automated ground vehicles and intelligent machines. Traditional mechanical scanning lidars offer superior performance in autonomous vehicles, but the potential mass application is limited by the inherent manufacturing difficulty. In this article, we propose a robotic lidar sensor based on incommensurable scanning that allows straightforward mass production and adoption in autonomous robots. Some unique features are additionally permitted by this incommensurable scanning. Similar to the fovea in human retina, this lidar features a peaked central angular density, enabling in applications that prefers eye-like attention. The incommensurable scanning method of this lidar could also provide a much higher resolution than conventional lidars which is beneficial in robotic applications such as sensor calibration. Examples making use of these advantageous features are demonstrated.

TI Implicit Interaction with an Autonomous Personal Mobility Vehicle:

DT Article
ID INTENTION
AB Interactions between pedestrians and autonomous personal mobility vehicle (APMV) will increase with the popularity of autonomous driving systems. However, when the APMVs are applied in a mixed traffic environment after manual driving PMV (MPMV) have been popular, pedestrians may feel unsafe in the interactions when they are uncertain about the driving intention of the APMV. This study seeks to find a surrogate measure for pedestrians' understanding of driving intention and perceived safety during the interaction with an APMV. We conducted an experiment to measure the gaze duration and subjective evaluations of the participants when they interacted with a PMV in manual and autonomous driving modes. Pedestrians fixed their gaze at the APMV longer when they did not accurately understand the driving intention than when they understood it. Furthermore, the pedestrians perceived danger when they did not clearly understand the driving intention of the APMV. Besides, these factors were different when pedestrians interact with an MPMV and an APMV.

ID TRACKING CONTROL
AB In this paper, relative motion model and control strategy for autonomous fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) carrier landing are addressed. First, a coupled six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) non-linear relative motion model is established from 6-DOF UAV and carrier models. Second, because of the under-actuated characteristic of two vehicles, the 6-DOF relative motion model is simplified to a four-degree-of-freedom (4-DOF) model to facilitate the control design. Third, an adaptive sliding mode control law is proposed to track desired landing trajectory and maintain constant relative pitch and roll angles. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

AB Despite all the promising benefits, the adoption of fully autonomous vehicles (FAVs) is expected to require a long transitional process. While innovators and early adopters tend to adopt the technology fast, most will gradually adopt the technology after varying periods. Meanwhile, today's social networking technologies have strengthened the influence of peer effects and caused noticeable changes to decision-making behavior. To date, there is relatively little study on how peer effects influence autonomous vehicles (AVs) adoption. The current paper explores how AV adoption is influenced by various factors, especially by different levels of individual susceptibility and prior-AV knowledge. Susceptibility is a latent variable measuring to what extent individuals will follow the influence of their peers in AV adoption. Prior-AV knowledge is another latent variable that measures people's knowledge about AVs, which will further impact their price sensitivity. A stated preference (SP) survey was carried out in five cities in China. 1132 new car buyers were surveyed, resulting in 3855 valid records for vehicle preference. The Integrated Choice and Latent Variable (ICLV) Model is used to measure the susceptibility and prior-AV knowledge attributes, and identify their contribution to the heterogeneity of AV adoption intentions. The results show that many demographic factors influence the adoption of AVs. Younger individuals, those with higher education levels, higher income, and more driving experience are more readily influenced by their peers. High market penetration has a significant influence on FAV adoption, but to a varying degree depending on the individual susceptibility level. People with prior-AV knowledge, who are more likely to be older drivers, have no children under 18, have higher incomes and higher education levels, are found to be less sensitive to vehicle price.

AB The purpose of this article is aimed to solve the problem associated with autonomous driving on the natural paths of planets. The contribution of this work is to propose an improved deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) framework for the autonomous driving on natural roads requires handling uneven surface of different throttle and braking reaction speeds. Our new finding is to design an adapted DDPG algorithm by double critic and excellent experience replay as DCEER-DDPG to reduce the overestimation of state action values. In addition, we created a virtual reality environment with TORCS simulator for fair evaluation. In the experiments, the proposed DCEER-DDPG has a better performance than previous algorithms, which can improve the utilization of driving experience on a natural path and increase the learning efficiency of the strategy. For the future applications, the proposed DCEER-DDPG is used not only on Earth, but also in lunar exploration.

AB The aim of this study was to understand passengers' continuance use intention with respect to autonomous buses (ABs) based on actual riding experience. Therefore, an extended technology acceptance model taking characteristics of both autonomous driving and buses into account was proposed, and 576 passengers with ABs riding experience in China responded to the survey. Several findings were revealed. First, characteristics of buses (including perceived in-vehicle safety, service quality and general attitudes toward buses) had positive effects on continuance use intention. Second, perceived road safety was not directly associated with continuance intention but had positive effects on perceived usefulness. Third, two significant moderating variables were revealed, namely, past bus riding habits and driver reliance (i.e., the degree to which passengers considered it important for ABs to have a driver). These observations suggest practical implications for policymakers and automakers.

AB Sensitivity to light conditions poses a challenge when utilizing visual odometry (VO) for autonomous navigation of small aerial vehicles in various applications. We present an illumination-robust direct visual odometry for a stable autonomous flight of an aerial robot under unpredictable light condition. The proposed stereo VO achieves robustness with respect to the light-changing environment by employing the patch-based affine illumination model to compensate abrupt, irregular illumination changes during direct motion estimation. We furthermore incorporate a motion prior from feature-based stereo visual odometry in the optimization, resulting in higher accuracy and more stable motion estimate. Thorough analyses of convergence rate and linearity index for the feature-based and direct VO methods support the effectiveness of the usage of the motion prior knowledge. We extensively evaluate the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real micro aerial vehicle datasets with ground-truth. Autonomous flight experiments with an aerial robot show that the proposed method successfully estimates 6-DoF pose under significant illumination changes.

AB The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm has drawn much attention for its wide range of potential applications. However, most UAV swarms rely on manual remote control or preprogramming, leaving autonomous cooperation as a challenging issue. Control and communication are two important pillars intra-autonomous-swarm, and the competition for limited resources between control and communication needs to be coordinated effectively in a swarm. In this article, the challenges and potentials of autonomous UAV swarm control and communication are discussed first. Then a new perspective on joint optimization of the two issues is presented, aiming at the swarm's task handling capability. Furthermore, a task-oriented integration of communication and control (ToICC) framework is proposed, including a route of mathematization for the task handling capability and a game-based distributed multi-agent cooperative learning approach. Finally, some potential applications and an illustrative case are provided to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed ToICC framework.

ID ASSISTANCE
AB A nested PID steering control for autonomous vehicles equipped with artificial vision systems is designed so that the driver can override the automatic lane-keeping action and obtain a complete control of the vehicle lateral dynamics without any switching strategy. The control input is the steering wheel angle: it is designed on the basis of the yaw rate, which is measured by a gyroscope, and the lateral offset, which is measured by the vision system as the distance between the road centerline and a virtual point at a fixed distance ahead from the vehicle. No lateral acceleration and no lateral speed measurements are required. A PI active front steering control on the basis of the yaw rate tracking error is designed to compensate for constant disturbances while improving vehicle steering dynamics and reducing the influence of parameter variations. The yaw rate reference is viewed as the control input in an external control loop: it is designed using a PID control based on the lateral offset measurements to reject the disturbances on the curvature during autonomous control, i.e., when the driver is not exerting any torque on the steering wheel. A third control block is designed to allow the driver to control the vehicle (for example, lane change for passing purposes or obstacle avoidance) overriding the automatic lane-keeping action while maintaining the advantages of the yaw rate feedback.
   Several simulations are carried out on a standard big sedan CarSim vehicle model to explore the robustness with respect to unmodelled effects such as combined lateral and longitudinal tire forces, pitch and roll and parameters variations. The simulations show reduced path following errors and new stable manoeuvres in comparison with the model predictive steering controller implemented by CarSim in both cases of autonomous and non autonomous control.

AB This paper develops an integrated model to characterize the market penetration of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in urban transportation networks. The model explicitly accounts for the interplay among the AV manufacturer, travelers with heterogeneous values of travel time (VOTT), and road infrastructure capacity. By making in-vehicle time use more leisurely or productive, AVs reduce travelers' von. In addition, AVs can move closer together than human-driven vehicles because of shorter safe reaction time, which leads to increased road capacity. On the other hand, the use of AV technologies means added manufacturing cost and higher price. Thus, traveler adoption of AVs will trade VOTT savings with additional out-of-pocket cost. The model is structured as a leader (AV manufacturer)-follower (traveler) game. Given the cost of producing AVs, the AV manufacturer sets AV price to maximize profit while anticipating AV market penetration. Given an AV price, the vehicle and routing choice of heterogeneous travelers are modeled by combining a multinomial logit model with multi-modal multi-class user equilibrium (UE). The overall problem is formulated as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC), which is challenging to solve. We propose a solution approach based on piecewise linearization of the MPCC as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and solving the MILP to global optimality. Non-uniform distribution of breakpoints that delimit piecewise intervals and feasibility-based domain reduction are further employed to reduce the approximation error brought by linearization. The model is implemented in a simplified Singapore network with extensive sensitivity analyses and the Sioux Falls network. Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the solution approach and yield valuable insights about transportation system performance in a mixed autonomous/human driving environment.

AB Trajectory planning is a critical component in autonomous vehicles directly responsible for driving safety and efficiency during deployment. The ability to find the optimal trajectory in real-time is critical for autonomous driving. This paper presents a novel general framework using the Fast Iterative Search and Sampling (FISS) strategy for sampling-based trajectory planning, which can find the optimal trajectory from an enormous number of candidates with high efficiency in real-time. Specifically, before generating any trajectories, the proposed method utilizes historical planning results as prior information in heuristics to estimate the cost distribution over the sampling space. On this basis, the Fast Iterative Search and Sampling strategy is employed to explore the sampling space for possible candidates and generate trajectories for verification during the search process. Experimental results show that our method can significantly outperform existing frameworks by order of magnitude in planning efficiency while ensuring safety and maintaining high accuracy.

AB In this work, we present a data-driven simulation and training engine capable of learning end-to-end autonomous vehicle control policies using only sparse rewards. By leveraging real, human-collected trajectories through an environment, we render novel training data that allows virtual agents to drive along a continuum of new local trajectories consistent with the road appearance and semantics, each with a different view of the scene. We demonstrate the ability of policies learned within our simulator to generalize to and navigate in previously unseen real-world roads, without access to any human control labels during training. Our results validate the learned policy onboard a full-scale autonomous vehicle, including in previously un-encountered scenarios, such as new roads and novel, complex, near-crash situations. Our methods are scalable, leverage reinforcement learning, and apply broadly to situations requiring effective perception and robust operation in the physical world.

AB Motion planning is a crucial, basic issue in robotics, which aims at driving vehicles or robots towards to a given destination with various constraints, such as obstacles and limited resource. This paper presents a new version of rapidly exploring random trees (RRT), that is, liveness-based RRT (Li-RRT), to address autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) motion problem. Different from typical RRT, we define an index of each node in the random searching tree, called "liveness" in this paper, to describe the potential effectiveness during the expanding process. We show that Li-RRT is provably probabilistic completeness as original RRT. In addition, the expected time of returning a valid path with Li-RRT is obviously reduced. To verify the efficiency of our algorithm, numerical experiments are carried out in this paper.

DE Software architecture for robotic and automation; autonomous vehicle

AB While low-level auto pilot stacks for aerial vehicles focus on robust control, sensing, and estimation, the continuous advancement of higher-level autonomy for aerial vehicles requires much more complex higher-level flight stacks in order to enable safe, fully autonomous long-duration missions. Rather than focusing on the low-level control, high-level flight stacks are required to monitor the system's integrity continuously, initiate contingency plans, execute mission plans and adapt them in non-nominal situations, allow for proper data logging, and provide standardized interfaces and integrity verification for external mission planners and localization modules. To that end, we present our freely available, high-level flight stack dubbed CNS Flight Stack that meets the above requirements and at the same time a) is platform-agnostic through a generalized (embedded) hardware abstraction layer, b) uses low compute complexity for online use on embedded hardware, and c) can he extended with other sensor modalities, integrity checks, and mission modules. These additional properties make it reproducible on a variety of different platforms for safe and fully autonomous applications. We tested the proposed flight stack in over 450 real-world flights and report the failure modes our framework detected and also mitigated to avoid crashes of the aerial system.

This paper presents the concept and design process of a moving platform structure-electric vehicle. The objective is to use artificial intelligence methods to control the model's operation in a resource scarce computation environment. Neural approaches are used for data analysis, path planning, speed control and implementation of the vision system for road sign recognition. For this purpose, multilayer perceptron neural networks and deep learning models are used. In addition to the neural algorithms and several applications, the hardware implementation is described. Simulation results of systems are gathered, data gathered from real platform tests are analyzed. Experimental results show that low-cost hardware may be used to develop an effective working platform capable of autonomous operation in defined conditions.

The paper focuses on the issue of achieving the integrity required of the navigation loop for use in autonomous systems. The paper highlights the detection of possible faults both before and during the fusion process in order to enhance the integrity of the navigation loop. The implementation of this fault detection methodology considers both low frequency faults in the IMU caused by bias in the sensor readings and the misalignment of the unit, and high frequency faults from the GPS receiver caused by multipath errors. The implementation. based on a low-cost, strapdown IMU, aided by either standard or carrier phase GPS technologies, is described. Results of the fusion process are presented.

To our knowledge, we are the first to provide consistent results of our driving policy on all towns available in CARLA. Our approach divides the reinforcement learning phase into multiple stages of increasing difficulty, such that our agent is guided towards learning an increasingly better driving policy. The agent architecture comprises various neural networks that complements the main convolutional backbone, represented by a ShuffleNet V2. Further contributions are given by (i) the proposal of a novel value decomposition scheme for learning the value function in a stable way and (ii) an ad-hoc function for normalizing the growth in size of the gradients. We show both quantitative and qualitative results of the learned driving policy.

TI Assessing the Complexity of Potential Bicycle Interference on Vehicles

SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION

AB Interacting with bicycles on urban road segments is complex for vehicles, due to the diverse and flexible cycling behavior that can cause interferences. Studies show that driving mixed with bicycles is also a great challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs), and it is necessary to consider the interference of bicycles when selecting public roads for testing. However, existing road evaluation methods mostly focus on autonomous driving functions and accident analysis, although bicycles have been considered, often with insufficient consideration of their interference. This study analyzes two types of cycling behavior that could interfere with vehicles, including lateral (turning handlebars) and longitudinal (braking or accelerating) behavior, with each occurrence of such behavior considered as one potential lateral or longitudinal interference. From the perspective of cycling behavior, a framework is proposed to assess the complexity of potential bicycle interference on vehicles on road segments. A higher frequency of both potential lateral and longitudinal interference represents a higher complexity of potential interference. A naturalistic field experiment was conducted to collect the potential lateral and longitudinal interference frequency and the environmental parameters of road segments. The quantile regression model was applied to analyze the environmental factors influencing different interference frequencies separately and further establish the assessing model of the potential bicycle interference complexity, and the usability of the model has been demonstrated with a case study. Results show that the potential interference complexity varies across road segments, with some factors leading to more frequent potential lateral and longitudinal interference but with varying degrees of impact (such as the separation between bicycles and vehicles), while some only affect the lateral interference frequency (such as the on-street parking condition). The proposed framework can help autonomous driving companies or evaluation agencies to select appropriate testing roads, thus promoting the development of autonomous driving.

AB Inter-vehicle docking is the problem of coordinating multiple robots to actively form and maintain physical contact. It is an important capability for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) and is an essential part of a wide class of missions. This article considers one such mission: the emergency response and environmental protection problem of containing a floating pollutant. We propose a solution in which multiple robots autonomously navigate so as to surround the surface matter. Before doing so, the robots dock with one another to secure specialized attachments designed to ensnare the contaminant. We describe the prototypical physical robot system developed to perform this task, and we detail the system architecture, sensing and computational hardware, control system, and visual processing pipeline. While employing multiple ASVs maximizes spatial reconfigurability, it depends on the inter-robot docking capabilities being particularly reliable. But achieving robust docking is a significant technical challenge because the water continually induces external disturbances on the control system. These disturbances are non-stationary and almost impossible to predict for unknown environments. Our system relies primarily on visual servoing within a control framework in which a variety of sensors are fused. Accurate disturbance measurements are obtained through traditional sensor modeling and filtering techniques. As the environment is a priori unknown, varies from trial to trial, and has proven difficult to model, we apply a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm, SARSA(lambda), along with specialized initial conditions which ensure stable operation, and an exploration guidance approach that increases the speed of convergence. We adopt a two-loop control scheme for visual servoing to successfully make use of feature descriptors with various (and variable) computational times. We demonstrate this approach to the docking problem with autonomous ground vehicles and ASVs. The results from several situations are compared, showing that disturbance rejection coupled with SARSA(lambda) is an effective approach.

AB This contribution reports on the unmanned and entirely autonomous land vehicle ION that traversed 47 km through the Mojave desert in the final race of the Grand Challenge 2005. After outlining the overall system architecture the article focusses on video-based path planning. A probabilistic model is introduced incorporating prior expectations on the path to be traveled. The observation model exploits the diversity of image features, namely disparity, texture, and local orientation. A Bayesian estimator spans an active search tree, that serves to continuously compute an optimal path, whose length increases with computation time. Results from real imagery of the Mojave desert indicate a high level of robustness of the proposed system.

AB This paper deals with the control of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). AUVs are needed in many applications such as the exploration of oceans, scientific and military missions, etc. There are many challenges in the control of AUVs due to the complexity of the AUV model, the unmodelled dynamics, the uncertainties and the environmental disturbances. A trajectory tracking control scheme is proposed in this paper; this control scheme is designed using the sliding mode control technique in order to be robust against bounded disturbances. The control performance of an example AUV, using the proposed method, is evaluated through computer simulations. These simulation studies, which consider different reference trajectories, show that the proposed control scheme is robust under bounded disturbances.

AB Control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is difficult due to its nonlinear and coupled characteristics, parameter uncertainties, and unknown disturbances. This paper presents a motion control system based on an adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control (FSMC) method for trajectory tracking of an AUV. The proposed FSMC method is primarily based on a combination of sliding mode control (SMC) strategy with an adaptive fuzzy algorithm to estimate external disturbances and weaken the chattering effect. A waypoint guidance law based on a line-of-sight (LOS) algorithm is applied to the guidance system. Simulation studies confirm a good performance of the proposed controller. The results are compared with those obtained with a sliding mode controller in terms of robustness and accuracy.

AB To improve the safety and driving stability of the autonomous heavy truck, it is necessary to consider the differences of driving behavior and drivable trajectories between the heavy trucks and passenger cars. This study proposes a probabilistic decision-making and trajectory planning framework for the autonomous heavy trucks. Firstly, the driving decision process is divided into intention generation and feasibility evaluations, which are realized using the utility theory and risk assessment, respectively. Subsequently the driving decision is made and sent to the trajectory planning module. In order to reflect the greater risks of the truck to other surrounding vehicles, the aggressiveness index (AI) is proposed and quantified to infer the asymmetrical risk level of lane-change maneuver. In the planning stage, the lateral and roll dynamics stability domains are developed as the constraints to exclude the candidate trajectories that would cause vehicle instability. Finally, the simulation results are compared between the proposed model and the artificial potential filed model in the scenarios extracted from the naturalistic driving data. It is shown that the proposed framework can provide the human-like lane-change decisions and truck-friendly trajectories, and performs well in dynamic driving environments.

AB Autonomous surface vehicles need to be at least as safe as conventional vessels, if not safer, when navigating on waters. With a great deal of navigation algorithms for surface vessels out there, the safety of their produced paths is questionable, and, in most cases, complicated to assess and compare. Hence, this paper proposes a method for extended collision risk assessment for paths generated by autonomous navigation algorithms as follows: (1) static, dynamic, and historic risk factors are calculated; (2) individual risk value is determined using a fuzzy inference system; (3) the extended collision risk assessment (ECRA) score is acquired using a root-mean-square method. Finally, a comparison of the ECRA score of each path determines the path with the lowest risk. The validation results show that the proposed method is able to detect lower/higher risk scenarios and assign an adequate risk value in most cases. Risk reduction for cautious paths varies up to 8.43%, while risk increases for incautious paths-up to 57.98%. The results indicate that the method could be used for navigation algorithm evaluation and comparison with some improvements. This research also reveals several promising future directions and applications of the method.

AB Dilemma situations involving the choice of which human life to save in the case of unavoidable accidents are expected to arise only rarely in the context of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Nonetheless, the scientific community has devoted significant attention to finding appropriate and (socially) acceptable automated decisions in the event that AVs or drivers of AVs were indeed to face such situations. Awad and colleagues, in their now famous paper "The Moral Machine Experiment", used a "multilingual online 'serious game' for collecting large-scale data on how citizens would want AVs to solve moral dilemmas in the context of unavoidable accidents." Awad and colleagues undoubtedly collected an impressive and philosophically useful data set of armchair intuitions. However, we argue that applying their findings to the development of "global, socially acceptable principles for machine learning" would violate basic tenets of human rights law and fundamental principles of human dignity. To make its arguments, our paper cites principles of tort law, relevant case law, provisions from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and rules from the German Ethics Code for Autonomous and Connected Driving.

TI Shared Autonomous Taxi System and Utilization of Collected Travel-Time

SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article

AB Shared autonomous taxi systems (SATS) are being regarded as a promising means of improving travel flexibility. Each shared autonomous taxi (SAT) requires very precise traffic information to independently and accurately select its route. In this study, taxis were replaced with ride-sharing autonomous vehicles, and the potential benefits of utilizing collected travel-time information for path finding in the new taxi system examined. Specifically, four categories of available SATs for every taxi request were considered: currently empty, expected-empty, currently sharable, and expected-sharable. Two simulation scenarios-one based on historical traffic information and the other based on real-time traffic information-were developed to examine the performance of information use in a SATS. Interestingly, in the historical traffic information-based scenario, the mean travel time for taxi requests and private vehicle users decreased significantly in the first several simulation days and then remained stable as the number of simulation days increased. Conversely, in the real-time information-based scenario, the mean travel time was constant. As the SAT fleet size increased, the total travel time for taxi requests significantly decreased, and convergence occurred earlier in the historical information-based scenario. The results demonstrate that historical traffic information is better than real-time traffic information for path finding in SATS.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AV) are a promising contemporary engineering innovation. Since they have no human drivers, their vehicle controllers must be fully informed of the activities of their occupants in vehicle seats so that occupant safety and comfort can be guaranteed. This paper introduces a system that employs capacitive sensing and machine learning to inform the controller of occupant activities, like actions and posture changes. The system facilitates capacitive sensing by deploying a capacitance-sensing mat on the vehicle seat. A sensing circuitry connected to the mat measures all its capacitances continuously. Since an occupant's body induces variations in these capacitances, temporal sequences of capacitance measurements represent various occupant activities in the vehicle seat. Subsequently, the system converts capacitance measurements corresponding to every time step to two grayscale capacitance-sensing images (CSIs). The CSIs, in turn, yield a feature vector corresponding to every time step, thereby building a dataset of temporal sequences of features. The system's machine-learning unit tracks and recognizes occupant actions and posture changes using an action-recognition block, which is essentially a long short-term memory (LSTM) network trained on a dataset of temporal sequences of either features or capacitance measurements corresponding to various occupant actions. If the occupant remains stationary, a switching block in the unit disables the action-recognition block and enables a posture-recognition block. The latter is a k -nearest-neighbor ( k NN) classifier trained on a dataset of features to recognize stationary occupant postures. This paper validates the system's performance and investigates its deployment for real-time tracking of occupant activities in AVs.

AB The introduction of autonomous buses (ABs) in many countries addresses traditional bus operation challenges, but overlooks critical perceived risks, like functional, safety, and security issues, affecting autonomous driving technology acceptance. This research uses the mental accounting theory to investigate both the positive and negative effects of the intention to use ABs. A hybrid discrete choice model captures latent and observed factors and considers COVID-19's impact on travel mode preferences. Results show that both latent and observed factors significantly affect AB adoption intention, including compatibility, relative advantage, safety/security risks, perceived risks, in/out-of-vehicle time, and travel cost. Trial rides positively impact adoption intention. Familiarity with unmanned tech also affects choice of shared bicycles and ABs, allowing for tailored promotional programs. The conclusions herein offer insights for bus operators, manufacturers, and city governments to integrate ABs into public transport systems effectively.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAVs) technology can provide a critical and multifaceted support in Search and Rescue (SAR) operations. They can be of invaluable use in preserving victims' lives, as well as backing-up rescue workers. Their main advantage is the shrinkage of intervention time, which constitutes a fundamental parameter being seriously accounted when designing such procedures and missions. Bearing this in mind, the paper in hand describes the design and implementation of a robotic Autonomous Unmanned Aerial System (AUAS), namely the ROLFER (Robotic Lifeguard for Emergency Rescue) system, which aims to immediately provide rescue and life-saving services. The proposed platform is suitable for life-saving services that require fast reaction in the context of an emergency. ROLFER's architecture and its elements are detailed concerning both hardware and software. We study the performance of the system both in terms of accuracy and intervention time. Experimental results in real conditions flights demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.

AB This paper proposes a reliable framework to map multilevel road structures in the 2D image domain called layered sub-image maps (LSM). The road is divided into a set of sub-areas providing IDs in the XY plane. Each sub-area is decomposed into several layered images using LIDAR intensity and elevation data to form a 2.5D map image. The layered elevation images are given IDs in the Z plane to represent the height of the contained road features in meter-order whereas the elevation pixels indicate the cm-order of the road slope in the range of 200 cm. The layered intensity images are then created to describe the road surface in conjunction with the number of the layered elevation images and the corresponding pixel distributions. A significant map retrieval strategy during autonomous driving has been designed based on the LSM implementation tactic and the IDs in the XYZ plane. The system's reliability has been proved by a unique localization module to localize an autonomous vehicle in a challenging multilevel environment consisting of four stacked loops with an average accuracy of 5 cm in lateral, longitudinal and altitudinal directions.

AB Cooperative perception is an important domain of autonomous driving that helps to improve road safety and traffic efficiency. Nevertheless, the large amount of sensed data and complicated algorithms make storage and computation for autonomous vehicles (AVs) challenging. Furthermore, not every AV needs to individually process all sensed data from other AVs because the environmental information is the same in a small region. Inspired by vehicular edge computing (VEC), where AVs are interconnected with the help of roadside units (RSUs) for better storage and computation capabilities, we propose a VEC-based architecture for cooperative perception and design a key task scheduling algorithm for the above challenges. Specifically, a time slot-based VEC architecture with the help of an RSU is designed, and the task scheduling problem in the proposed architecture is formulated as a multitask multitarget scheduling problem with assignment restrictions. A two-stage heuristic scheme (TSHS) is designed for the problem. Finally, extensive simulations indicate that the proposed architecture with the TSHS can enable cooperative perception, with a fast running speed and advanced performance, that is superior to that of the benchmarks, especially when most AVs face limitations in terms of storage and computation.

The modeling framework presented in this work can be used in a high-fidelity traffic simulator consisting of multiple human decision-makers. This simulator can reduce the time and effort spent for testing autonomous vehicles by allowing safe and quick assessment of self-driving control algorithms. To demonstrate the fidelity of the proposed modeling framework, game-theoretical driver models are compared with real human driver behavior patterns extracted from two different sets of traffic data.

AB Featured Application The proposed RL via data-informed Domain Randomization (DDR) is designed to stabilize autonomous underwater vehicles and the platforms of underwater vehicle-manipulator systems, which are further subject to unknown dynamics and varying payloads. The approach captures the differences in dynamics between the simulated AUVs and real AUVs, trains the controller in simulations that are suitable for real AUVs, and avoids the tedious procedures of parameter-tuning. The proposed RL-DDR requires only a few training samples, making the controller adaptation efficient for real-time applications. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) or underwater vehicle-manipulator systems often have large model uncertainties from degenerated or damaged thrusters, varying payloads, disturbances from currents, etc. Other constraints, such as input dead zones and saturations, make the feedback controllers difficult to tune online. Model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been applied to control AUVs, but most results were validated through numerical simulations. The trained controllers often perform unsatisfactorily on real AUVs; this is because the distributions of the AUV dynamics in numerical simulations and those of real AUVs are mismatched. This paper presents a model-free RL via Data-informed Domain Randomization (DDR) for controlling AUVs, where the mismatches between the trajectory data from numerical simulations and the real AUV were minimized by adjusting the parameters in the simulated AUVs. The DDR strategy extends the existing adaptive domain randomization technique by aggregating an input network to learn mappings between control signals across domains, enabling the controller to adapt to sudden changes in dynamics. The proposed RL via DDR was tested on the problems of AUV pose regulation through extensive numerical simulations and experiments in a lab tank with an underwater positioning system. These results have demonstrated the effectiveness of RL-DDR for transferring trained controllers to AUVs with different dynamics.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE; IMPLEMENTATION; PERCEPTION
AB For automated vehicles to be allowed to join the modern car fleet, and, in the future, replace human drivers, they must be able to handle adverse weather, including snowy conditions. This literature review focuses on how automated vehicles utilize the road and how this use is suitable for winter maintenance strategies. Where global navigation satellite system (GNSS) service is unavailable, automated vehicles need bare roads to perform relative navigation based on real-time data about lane markings, obstacles, and road infrastructure. Snow-covered tracks hinder vehicle navigation and lane marking detection, which might generate wheel slippage that in turn causes emergency stop and challenging friction estimates. Although the entry of automated vehicles into the car fleet does not demand change in the strategies of winter maintenance, it does demand higher level of service than today. Maintaining an entire road network on which autonomous vehicles always can operate is tremendously expensive and likely not feasible. One solution could be to add another maintenance class in a bare road strategy, that is, an automated vehicle maintenance class with a high level of service and a set of operational criteria allowing automated vehicles to operate. The maintenance class should be used for certain main routes where there is a high frequency of automated vehicles. A model that recommends preferable routes to the destination based on current road conditions within the operational envelope should be provided to the automated vehicle system.

AB Vehicle longitudinal control systems such as (commercially available) autonomous Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and its more sophisticated variant Cooperative ACC (CACC) could potentially have significant impacts on traffic flow. Accurate models of the dynamic responses of both of these systems are needed to produce realistic predictions of their effects on highway capacity and traffic flow dynamics. This paper describes the development of models of both ACC and CACC control systems that are based on real experimental data. To this end, four production vehicles were equipped with a commercial ACC system and a newly developed CACC controller. The Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) that has been widely used for ACC car-following modeling was also implemented on the production vehicles. These controllers were tested in different traffic situations in order to measure the actual responses of the vehicles. Test results indicate that: (1) the IDM controller when implemented in our experimental test vehicles does not perceptibly follow the speed changes of the preceding vehicle; (2) strings of consecutive ACC vehicles are unstable, amplifying the speed variations of preceding vehicles; and (3) strings of consecutive CACC vehicles overcome these limitations, providing smooth and stable car following responses. Simple but accurate models of the ACC and CACC vehicle following dynamics were derived from the actual measured responses of the vehicles and applied to simulations of some simple multi-vehicle car following scenarios.

The constrained variables are predicted by an error states system and utilized to adjust the control law once the established dynamic constraints are violated. The simulated annealing optimization algorithm for preview length is conducted to improve the adaptability of the controller to varying velocities and road adhesion coefficients. The theoretical stability of a closed-loop system is guaranteed using Lyapunov theory, and further analysis of the system response in time domain and frequency domain is discussed. The results of simulations implemented on Carsim-Simulink demonstrate the favorable performance of the proposed control in tracking accuracy and system stability under extreme conditions.

AB This paper presents a comparative study of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and analytical and semiempirical (ASE) methods applied to the prediction of the normal force and moment coefficients of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Both methods are applied to the. bare hull of the vehicle and to the body-hydroplane combination. The results are validated through experiments in a towing tank. It is shown that the CFD approach allows for a good prediction of the coefficients over the range of angles of attack considered. In contrast with the traditional ASE formulations used in naval and aircraft fields, an improved methodology is introduced that takes advantage of the qualitative information obtained from CFD flow visualizations.

AB This paper presents a conceptual design of a novel multimodal underwater vehicle that integrates the merits of the Argo profiling float, the buoyancy-driven underwater glider and the propeller/rudder-driven underwater vehicle, which serves as a long-endurance and highly maneuverable platform for multiple-water-column ocean sampling with high spatiotemporal resolution. Key design principles of this multimodal underwater vehicle are firstly formulated to enable mode switching. The mathematical model of this proposed vehicle is derived based on unit quaternions for the three modes of locomotion, namely, Argo mode, zigzag gliding mode and propeller/rudder-driven mode (PR mode). Heading deviation arises during transition between Argo mode and zigzag gliding mode is fully revealed. To tackle this key challenge, a multi-level motion controller is developed for this hybrid vehicle, which not only guarantees rapid mode switching, but also allows the vehicle to be capable of traveling between adjacent columns in zigzag gliding mode, vertical sampling in Argo mode as well as heading correction and position compensation in PR mode. The feasibility of the mode transition, the property of the heading deviation and the performance of the devised control scheme are validated and analyzed via a series of numerical simulations and experiments.

AB The exclusive bus lane (XBL) is one of the most popular bus transit systems in the U.S. The Lincoln Tunnel utilizes an XBL through the tunnel in the AM peak period. This paper proposes a novel data-driven cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) algorithm that aims to minimize a cost function for connected and autonomous buses along the XBL. Different from existing model-based CACC algorithms, the proposed approach employs the idea of reinforcement learning, which does not rely on accurate knowledge of bus dynamics. Considering a time-varying topology, where each autonomous vehicle can only receive information from preceding vehicles that are within its communication range, a distributed controller is learned real-time by online headway, velocity, and acceleration data collected from the system trajectories. The convergence of the proposed algorithm and the stability of the closed-loop system are rigorously analyzed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a well-calibrated Paramics microscopic traffic simulation model of the XBL corridor. The simulation results show that the travel time in the autonomous version of the XBL are close to the present day travel time even when the bus volume is increased by 30%.

AB Various driving assistance systems have been developed to reduce the number of automobile accidents. However, the control laws of these assistance systems differ based on each situation, and the discontinuous control command value may be input instantaneously. Therefore, a seamless and unified control law for driving assistance systems that can be used in multiple situations is necessary to realize more versatile autonomous driving. Although studies have been conducted on four-wheel steering that steers the rear wheels, these studies considered the role of the rear wheels only to improve vehicle dynamics and not to contribute to autonomous driving. Therefore, in this study, we define the risk potential field as a uniform control law and propose a rear-wheel steering control system that actively steers the rear wheels to contribute to autonomous driving, depending on the level of the perceived risk in the driving situation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a double lane change test, which is performed assuming emergency avoidance in simulations, and subject experiments using a driving simulator. The results indicate that actively steering the rear wheels ensures a safer and smoother drive while simultaneously improving the emergency avoidance performance.

AB Aiming at the problems of model uncertainty, external interference of road conditions, and inherent nonlinearity of lateral movement of autonomous driving vehicles, this paper proposes an effective control technology for an automatic steering system, namely, the receding horizon H-infinity control, which has good path tracking performance and can overcome external interference. First, a two-degree-of-freedom vehicle model and a road model are established. Then, the Hamilton equation is established using Pontriagin's minimum principle, and the optimal control solution and the most serious disturbance are solved based on the minimax principle. Finally, in order to evaluate the receding horizon H-infinity autonomous steering control method, lane change simulation and hardware in the loop simulation are developed to describe the effect of receding horizon H-infinity. The simulation results show that the model predictive control (MPC) and linear matrix inequality (LMI) controller will exhibit oscillation and instability under the condition of external interference. To improve the stability, the H-infinity controller reduces part of the performance, while the rolling horizon H-infinity strategy can ensure the robustness of automatic steering and has a certain anti-interference performance.

AB This paper presents a real-time dispatching model for electric autonomous vehicle (EAV) taxis that combines mathematical programming and machine learning. The EAV taxi dispatching problem is formulated and solved as an integer linear program that maximizes the total reward for serving customers. The optimal dispatch solutions are generated by simulating electric autonomous taxis that are dispatched by the optimization model. The artificial-neural-network-(ANN)-based model was trained using the optimization model's dispatch solutions to learn the optimal dispatch strategies. Although the dispatch decisions made by the ANN-based model are not optimal, the system's performance is very close to the optimization dispatch model in terms of customer service and taxis' operational efficiency. In addition, the ANN-based dispatch model runs much faster. By comparing with current taxis, it was found that the EAV taxis dispatched by our ANN-based model can improve operational efficiency by reducing empty travel distance. EAV taxis can also reduce fleet size by 15% while maintaining a comparable level of service with the current taxi fleet.

AB This paper is concerned with the disturbance estimation and velocity recovery of autonomous surface ve hicles subject to unknown input gains, in addition to lumped uncertainties composed of unknown internal dynamics and external disturbances. Existing extended state observer design methods are not applicable due to the fact that some prior knowledge on model parameters such as the control input gains are assumed to be known in advance. By incorporating a concurrent learning approach into the extended state observer design, a three-order data-driven adaptive extended state observer based on position and acceleration information is proposed to estimate the unknown input gains, lumped disturbance, and unmeasured velocities. An advantage of the proposed data-driven adaptive extended state observer is that the unknown input gains, lumped disturbance, and unknown velocities can be simultaneously estimated with guaranteed convergence thanks to concurrent learning. The result is extended to a data-driven adaptive extended state observer with finite-time convergence. The efficacy of the proposed two data-driven adaptive extended state observers for autonomous surface vehicles is substantiated via simulations. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Research on autonomous driving technology is actively underway to solve the facing problems in the agricultural field. Combine harvesters used in East Asian countries, including Korea, are tracked-type vehicles. The steering control system of the tracked vehicle has different characteristics from the wheeled vehicle used in the agricultural tractor. In this paper, a dual GPS antenna-based autonomous driving system and path tracking algorithm were developed for a robot combine harvester. An a-turn-type work path generation algorithm and a path tracking algorithm were developed. The developed system and algorithm were verified through experiments using actual combine harvesters. The experiment consisted of an experiment with harvesting work and an experiment without harvesting work. In the experiment without harvesting work, an error of 0.052 m occurred during working driving and 0.207 m during turning driving. In the experiment where the harvesting work was carried out, an error of 0.038 m occurred during work driving and 0.195 m during turning driving. As a result of comparing the non-work area and driving time to the results of manual driving, the self-driving experiment with harvesting work showed an efficiency of 76.7%.

AB Tire mileage and wear provide important information for vehicle applications. There are more and more studies discussing intelligent tires, but few focus on the role of tire mileage and wear. The conventional tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) is one of the intelligent tire applications, but there has been no significant advancement in recent years in this regard. In order to increase the additional functions of intelligent tire applications, we propose a method that estimates the mileage and wear information of tires. The proposed method uses a three-axis sensor and a Hall sensor to implement the function. The proposed method also has a low power design to reduce the power consumption of the Hall sensor. The experimental results show the trend of tire wear status, rendering this method effective. This method also requires more accurate mileage information to support tire wear estimation. This experiment found that the correct rate of the proposed mileage estimation method is 99.4% and provides sufficient and correct mileage information for tire wear methods. If this method is used in autonomous vehicle applications, the autonomous control strategy algorithm has more conditions to plan the control strategy. The strategy system processes more meticulous control that increases the safety of autonomous vehicles.</p>

AB This paper addresses the problem of steering a group of vehicles along given spatial paths while holding a desired time-varying geometrical formation pattern. The solution to this problem, henceforth referred to as the coordinated path-following (CPF) problem, unfolds in two basic steps. First, a path-following (PF) control law is designed to drive each vehicle to its assigned path, with a nominal speed profile that may be path dependent. This is done by making each vehicle approach a virtual target that moves along the path according to a conveniently defined dynamic law. In the second step, the speeds of the virtual targets (also called coordination states) are adjusted about their nominal values so as to synchronize their positions and achieve, indirectly, vehicle coordination. In the problem formulation, it is explicitly considered that each vehicle transmits its coordination state to a subset of the other vehicles only, as determined by the communications topology adopted. It is shown that the system that is obtained by putting together the PF and coordination subsystems can be naturally viewed as either the feedback or the cascade connection of the latter two. Using this fact and recent results from nonlinear systems and graph theory, conditions are derived under which the PF and the coordination errors are driven to a neighborhood of zero in the presence of communication losses and time delays. Two different situations are considered. The first captures the case where the communication graph is alternately connected and disconnected (brief connectivity losses). The second reflects an operational scenario where the union of the communication graphs over uniform intervals of time remains connected (uniformly connected in mean). To better root the paper in a nontrivial design example, a CPF algorithm is derived for multiple underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Simulation results are presented and discussed.

AB Local meteorological conditions including wind speed and turbulence significantly influence the dispersion of pollutant plumes, introducing severe difficulties in predicting its trajectory, potential evacuation sites, and ultimately containment efforts. Ongoing developments in estimating rapid contaminant dispersion include the combined use of local meteorological data along with plume-source localization and identification via autonomous data-driven mobile-sensing robotic/vehicular platforms. With a vast number of available environmental sensing mobile platforms, contaminant dispersion scenarios, and source-finding algorithms, selection of the ideal configuration for autonomous source localization involves a great deal of opportunity alongside uncertainty. This paper aims to review the significant developments of unmanned ground-based mobile sensing network configurations and autonomous data acquisition strategies commonly used for the task of gaseous plume source localization.

AB In this paper is presented an adaptive observer based on gain-scheduled principle as a core in the navigation system of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) moving in the horizontal plane. The estimated wave-frequency motions are removed from the measurements and the resulting smoothed signals are sent as feedback to the heading controller for horizontal motions control. As an important improvement, the adaptive capabilities are obtained setting the observer gains as function of the wave frequency, which represents the sea states. The wave encounter frequency is estimated using an algebraic approach with good results. Simulation results show an excellent performance of the observer and the resulting horizontal motion control system of the vehicle.

AB Vision is useful for the autonomous navigation of vehicles. In this paper the case of a vehicle equipped with multiple cameras with non-overlapping views is considered. The geometry and algebra of such a moving platform of cameras axe considered. In particular we formulate and solve structure and motion problems for a few novel cases. There are two interesting minimal cases; three points in two platform positions and two points in three platform positions. We also investigate initial solutions for the case when image lines are used as features. In the paper is also discussed how classical algorithms such as intersection, resection and bundle adjustment can be extended to this new situation. The theory has been tested on synthetic and real data with promising results.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a novel approach to the design of an autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to aid with the internal inspection and classification of tall or large structures. Focusing mainly on the challenge of robustly determining the position and velocity of the UAV, in three dimensional space, using on-board Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM). Although capable of autonomous flight, the UAV is primarily intended for semi-autonomous operation, where the operator instructs the UAV where to go. However, if communications with the ground station are lost, it can backtrack along its path until communications are re-established.
   Design/methodology/approach - A UAV has been designed and built using primarily commercial-off-the-shelf components. Software has been developed to allow the UAV to operate autonomously, using solely the on-board computer and sensors. It is currently undergoing extensive flight tests to determine the performance and limitations of the system as a whole.
   Findings - Initial test flights have proven the presented approach and resulting real-time SLAM algorithms to function robustly in a range of large internals. The paper also briefly discusses the approach used by similar projects and the challenges faced.
   Originality/value - The proposed novel algorithms allow for on-board, real-time, three-dimensional SLAM in unknown and unstructured environments on a computationally constrained UAV.

AB In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology for fusing sensors and improving robustness to sensor failures in end-to-end learning based autonomous navigation of ground vehicles in unknown environments. We propose the first learning based camera-LiDAR fusion methodology for autonomous in-door navigation. Specifically, we develop a multimodal end-to-end learning system, which maps raw depths and pixels from LiDAR and camera, respectively, to the steering commands. A novel gating based dropout regularization technique is introduced which effectively performs multimodal sensor fusion and reliably predicts steering commands even in the presence of various sensor failures. The robustness of our network architecture is demonstrated by experimentally evaluating its ability to autonomously navigate in the indoor corridor environment. Specifically, we show through various empirical results that our framework is robust to sensor failures, partial image occlusions, modifications of the camera image intensity, and the presence of noise in the camera or LiDAR range images. Furthermore, we show that some aspects of obstacle avoidance are implicitly learned (while not being specifically trained for it); these learned navigation capabilities are shown in ground vehicle navigation around static and dynamic obstacles.

AB According to the economic theory assumption, travelers tend to monetize travel time based on factors related to their individual and trip characteristics. In the literature, a limited number of studies evaluating onboard activities on traveler's utility in the presence of the autonomous vehicle (AV) are found. In the current research, traveler preferences on board of three transport modes: individual-ride autonomous vehicle (IR-AV), shared-ride autonomous vehicle (SAV), and public transport (PT) are studied. The focus of this paper is the examination of travelers in urban areas, where traveling is relatively short, and the study of the travelers' main trip purposes. The impact of travel time, travel cost, and main onboard activity is estimated based on a discrete choice experiment (DCE). The in-vehicle onboard activities are divided into six onboard activities, where active and passive activities are considered. An experimental design and a stated preference (SP) survey are carried out. The result of the SP survey is analyzed, where a Mixed Logit (ML) model, which includes various explanatory variables, is applied. The developed model contains such variables as trip time, trip cost, main onboard activity, frequent transport mode, job, age, and car ownership. These variables show various effects on the probability of choosing a transport mode. The impact of change in travel time, travel cost, and each of the six onboard activities on traveler preferences is highlighted. As a result, variations on the impact of time, cost, and onboard activities are demonstrated. Furthermore, it is presented that people prefer using IR-AV over SAV and PT, while the probability of choosing SAV is the lowest. Besides, reading and using social media affect the utility of travelers positively (i.e., higher probability) to a greater extent than other activities, while writing alone demonstrates negative utility.

AB This paper proposes a new algorithm for controlling a formation of multiple autonomous aerial vehicles based on multiple control objectives. The strategy includes using the null space of a Jacobian matrix to achieve the different control objectives in a non-conflicting way. The mission is split into two elementary tasks, with suitable command references generated for each robot. The commands for each task are combined through a hierarchical method by using the projection of commands onto the null space. The incorporation of ground vehicles in the control scheme is also considered, thus extending the proposed scheme for controlling heterogeneous formations. The stability analysis of the control system shows that such a system is asymptotically stable, and experimental results validate the proposed control system.

AB Autonomous airdrop is a useful basic operation for a fixed-wing unmanned aerial system. Being able to deliver an object to a known target position extends operational range without risking human lives, but is still limited to known delivery locations. If the fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle delivering the object could also recognize its target, the system would take one step further in the direction of autonomy. This paper presents a closed-loop autonomous delivery system that uses machine vision to identify a target marked with a distinct colour, calculates the geographical coordinates of the target location and plans a path to a release point, where it delivers the object. Experimental results present a visual target estimator with a mean error distance of 3.4 m and objects delivered with a mean error distance of 5.5 m.

AB We present a solution to the problem of multiple vehicle cooperative path following (CPF) that takes explicitly into account vehicle input constraints, the topology of the intervehicle communication network, and time-varying communication delays. The objective is to steer a group of vehicles along given spatial paths, at speeds that may be path dependent, while holding a feasible geometric formation. The solution involves decoupling the original CPF problem into two subproblems: (i) single path following of input-constrained vehicles and (ii) coordination of an input-constrained multiagent system. The first is solved by adopting a sampled-data model predictive control scheme, whereas the latter is tackled using a novel distributed control law with an event-triggered communication (ETC) mechanism. The proposed strategy yields a closed-loop CPF system that is input-to-state-stable with respect to the system's state (consisting of the path following error of all vehicles and their coordination errors) and the system's input, which includes triggering thresholds for ETC communications and communication delays. Furthermore, with the proposed ETC mechanism, the number of communications among the vehicles are significantly reduced. Simulation examples of multiple autonomous vehicles executing CPF maneuvers in 2D under different communication scenarios illustrate the efficacy of the CPF strategy proposed.

AB In recent years, the advancement of deep-learning technologies has greatly promoted the research progress of autonomous driving. However, deep neural network is like a black box. Given a specific input, it is difficult to explain the output of the network. Without explainable results, it would be unsafe to deploy deep networks in unseen environments or environments with potential unexpected situations. Especially for decision-making networks, inappropriate outputs could lead to severe traffic accidents. To provide a solution to this problem, we propose a deep neural network that jointly predicts the decision-making actions and corresponding natural-language explanations based on semantic scene understanding. Two types of explanations, the reasons of driving actions and the surrounding environment descriptions of the ego-vehicle, are designed. Both the reasons and descriptions are in the form of natural language. The decision-making actions could be explained by the corresponding reasons or the environment descriptions. We also release a large-scale dataset with hand-labelled ground truth including driving actions and environment descriptions. The superiority of our network over other methods is demonstrated on both our dataset and a public dataset.

AB In this article, I take up a highly visible theme in discourses, experimentation, and manufacture of connected cars and autonomous vehicles: disability. I analyze the leading ways in which this new kind of technology is imagined for particular users with disability, as in the highly publicized case of Google's pilot driverless vehicle promoted as a boon for blind people and those with vision impairments. Then, I try to stand this kind of framing of connected-cars-as-good-for-disability on its head, and discuss the implications for questions of emerging social technology, equality, diversity, and design. Reflecting on this analysis, I look at what disability tells us about connected cars, and, indeed, how we might rethink communication and technology.

TI Automated Ballast Tank Control System for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Adaptive control; autonomous; variable ballast system
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are frequently used for deep-water ocean applications such as surveying and cable laying, where accurate control of vehicle depth and attitude is needed. The water level in the onboard ballast tanks is typically manually set for neutral buoyancy before each mission, while the vehicle is on the surface. The ballast tank contents are not normally adjusted to control vehicle depth and orientation while the AUV is in operation. As a result, vehicle trajectory and orientation is exclusively controlled using the vehicle's control surfaces during a mission. The challenges with controlling the depth and trim of an underwater vehicle include nonlinear hydrodynamic forces, as well as inherent time delays (latencies) associated with water tank level changes and valve adjustments. Furthermore, small changes in the location of the vehicle's center of gravity (i.e., due to the deployment of the AUV's payload equipment) can reduce the control authority of the AUV's control surfaces. To meet these challenges, this paper proposes two unique variable ballast system (VBS) control approaches. The first proposed VBS controller changes the weight of the AUV to help control vehicle depth and vertical (inertial) velocity. The second proposed VBS controller attempts to shift the center of gravity along the body-fixed -(longitudinal)-axis to reduce depth and pitch angle error while restoring control authority to the bowplane and sternplane deflection fins. The ballasting system consists of two water tanks positioned aft and forward of amidships. The ballast tanks are then automatically filled or emptied of ocean water as desired. Numerical simulations have been carried out on a 2-D underwater vehicle simulator to test and compare the performance of the proposed ballast and fin deflection control systems. The simulation results show that, for the assumptions and conditions tested, the proposed controllers are capable of achieving a setpoint depth and pitch angle with minimal error by effectively utilizing the ballast tanks and deflection fins. As a result, the work presented in this paper helps increase the autonomy of large AUVs on long-duration missions.

AB The advent of mobile and ubiquitous systems has enabled the development of autonomous systems such as wireless-sensors for environmental data collection and teams of collaborating Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles (UAVs) used in missions unsuitable for humans. However, with these range of new application-domains comes a new challenge-enabling self-management in mobile autonomous systems. Autonomous systems have to be able to manage themselves individually as well as form self-managing teams which are able to adapt to failures, protect themselves from attacks and optimise performance. This paper proposes a novel distributed policy-based framework that enables autonomous systems of varying scale to perform self-management individually and as a team. The framework allows missions to be specified in terms of roles in an adaptable and reusable way, enables dynamic and secure team formation with a utility-based approach for optimal role assignment, caters for communication link maintenance amongst team-members and recovery from failure. Adaptive management is achieved by employing a policy-based architecture to enable dynamic modification of the management strategy relating to resources, role behaviour, communications and team management, without interrupting the basic software within the system. Evaluation of the framework shows that it is scalable with respect to the number of roles, and consequently the number of autonomous systems involved in the mission. It is also optimal with respect to role assignments, and robust to intermittent communication link and permanent team-member failures.

AB The latest 6G improvements secured autonomous driving's realism in Intelligent Autonomous Transport Systems (IATS). Despite the IATS's benefits, security remains a significant challenge. Blockchain technology has grown in popularity as a means of implementing safe, dependable, and decentralised independent IATS systems, allowing for more utilisation of legacy IATS infrastructures and resources, which is especially advantageous for crowdsourcing technologies. Blockchain technology can be used to address security concerns in the IATS and to aid in logistics development. In light of the inadequacy of reliance and inattention to rights created by centralised and conventional logistics systems, this paper discusses the creation of a blockchain-based IATS powered by deep learning for secure cargo and vehicle matching (BDL-IATS). The BDL-IATS approach utilises Ethereum as the primary blockchain for storing private data such as order and shipment details. Additionally, the deep belief network (DBN) model is used to select suitable vehicles and goods for transportation. Additionally, the chaotic krill herd technique is used to tune the DBN model's hyperparameters. The performance of the BDL-IATS technique is validated, and the findings are inspected under a variety of conditions. The simulation findings indicated that the BDL-IATS strategy outperformed recent state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Advanced active safety systems play a crucial role in ensuring the safe driving of vehicles in critical conditions such as an obstacle avoidance manoeuvre. However, conventional techniques relying mainly on braking interventions may not result in the desired vehicle response in such situations. Over-actuation through the control of individual motion actuators could potentially improve the safety performance of vehicles. This study evaluates various configurations of motion actuators for path following and yaw stability control of vehicles in critical driving scenarios. The configurations include active front steering (S), active front steering + torque vectoring (ST), active front steering + active camber (SC) and active front steering + torque vectoring + active camber (STC). The evaluation is achieved based on a nonlinear model predictive control formulation, which considers yaw stability and the physical limits of motion actuators. This problem formulation uses a double-track vehicle model, combined with the Dugoff tyre model and its variant with the camber effect, to model the vehicle dynamics. The actuator configurations are evaluated regarding the passing velocity, tracking accuracy, safety distance and robustness to reference trajectory variation. The results indicate that the integrated control of STC performs the best among all the four configurations while S performs the worst. Furthermore, SC is generally superior to ST.

AB Car-following is an important driving behaviour for intelligent vehicles and has a significant impact on traffic efficiency and traffic safety. Car-following models are widely developed to characterize the human-drivers' car-following manoeuvre actions and adopted in traffic simulation and automated vehicle control system development. Car-following models need to be able to represent the drivers' behaviour while following preceding vehicles. On the other hand, car-following controllers are an important component of intelligent vehicle systems, both for autonomous vehicles and connected vehicles. However, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) as well as Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) do not include human behaviour, which makes their car-following behaviour not human-like or natural for the on-board driver or passenger. To address this problem, in this study, the human-like Wiedemann car-following model is calibrated and verified with our driving simulator data. A human-like car-following nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) controller is developed based on the calibrated car-following model. Three different scenarios are tested to evaluate the performance of the proposed controller, with which the autonomous vehicle is able to have human-like and smooth trajectories at different phases and within different transition zones.

AB Battery Electric Vehicles have a high potential in modern transportation, however, they are facing limited cruising range. The driving style, the road geometries including slopes, curves, the static and dynamic traffic conditions such as speed limits and preceding vehicles have their share of energy consumption in the host electric vehicle. Optimal energy management based on a semi-autonomous ecological advanced driver assistance system can improve the longitudinal velocity regulation in a safe and energy-efficient driving strategy. The main contribution of this paper is the design of a realtime risk-sensitive nonlinear model predictive controller to plan the online cost-effective cruising velocity in a stochastic traffic environment. The basic idea is to measure the relevant states of the electric vehicle at runtime, and account for the road slopes, the upcoming curves, and the speed limit zones, as well as uncertainty in the preceding vehicle behaviour to determine the energy-efficient velocity profile. Closed-loop Entropic Value-at-Risk as a coherent risk measure is introduced to quantify the risk involved in the system constraints violation. The obtained simulation and field experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for a semi-autonomous electric vehicle in terms of safe and energy-efficient states regulation and constraints satisfaction.

AB Significant advances in various relevant science and engineering disciplines have propelled the development of more advanced, yet reliable and practical underwater vehicles. A great array of vehicle types and applications has been produced along with a wide range of innovative approaches for enhancing the performance of unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV). These recent advances enable the extension of UUVs' flight envelope comparable to that of manned vehicles. For undertaking longer missions, therefore more advanced control and navigation will be required to maintain an accurate position over larger operational envelope particularly when a close proximity to obstacles (such as manned vehicles, pipelines, underwater structures) is involved. In this case, a sufficiently good model is prerequisite of control system design. System evaluation and testing of unmanned underwater vehicles in certain environment can be tedious, time consuming and expensive. This paper, focused on developing dynamic model of UUV for the purpose of guidance and control. Along with this a HILS (Hardware-In-the-Loop Simulation) based novel framework for rapid construction of testing scenarios with embedded systems has been investigated. The modeling approach is implemented for the AUV Squid, an autonomous underwater vehicle that was designed, developed and tested by research team at Center for Unmanned System Studies at InstitutTeknologi Bandung.

AB In this work, a hydrophone has been integrated in a moving autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in order to have an autonomous controlled system capable of recording underwater audio. The performance of the system, in terms of best recording of the audio, has been analyzed by placing the hydrophone in two different positions: the front of the AUV and its lower part. From this analysis, it has been determined that the best position for the hydrophone (i.e., the one that receives the lowest engine noise) is the former. In addition, a signal processing based on an order analysis has been performed for the purpose of filtering the noise introduced by the engine of the AUV. This technique achieves the filtering of most of this noise without removing contributions from other sources of interest whose frequency spectrum overlaps with the noise of the engine. This is a fundamental characteristic of the new system because it allows for cleaner underwater recordings. The aim is to increase the capabilities for detection of sources emitting in the range of the AUV acoustic contribution by reducing the same and not so much by completely removing it.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are practical tools for ocean observation. However, they tend to operate in an automatic rather than autonomous way. This reflects the attitudes and behaviors that individuals and organizations share when adopting new technology in this industry. This paper clarifies the factors that are preventing one important aspect of autonomy-adaptive mission planning (AMP)-from transitioning from research to commercial and bespoke AUVs. A total of 25 experts comprising AUV developers and users, with combined 237 years of experience, provided their views in a structured survey covering several different hypotheses. There is insufficient evidence to determine clearly a single reason for failure to adopt AMPs, but a primary cause is the paucity of demonstration trials. This view is irrespective of participants' years of experience. Managers, engineers, and technologists agree on the two most likely causes for failure to adopt AMPs. However, the differences between the assessments provided by researchers and these three professional groups are statistically significant, with p value <0.005. For researchers, complexity is one of the two most important inhibitory factors. We present recommendations to support the integration of AMP into AUVs substantiated by recent examples where government, industry, and researchers have developed and tested AMPs.

AB Object detection is an essential and impactful technology in various fields due to its ability to automatically locate and identify objects in images or videos. In addition, object-distance estimation is a fundamental problem in 3D vision and scene perception. In this paper, we propose a simultaneous object-detection and distance-estimation algorithm based on YOLOv5 for obstacle detection in indoor autonomous vehicles. This method estimates the distances to the desired obstacles using a single monocular camera that does not require calibration. On the one hand, we train the algorithm with the KITTI dataset, which is an autonomous driving vision dataset that provides labels for object detection and distance prediction. On the other hand, we collect and label 100 images from a custom environment. Then, we apply data augmentation and transfer learning to generate a fast, accurate, and cost-effective model for the custom environment. The results show a performance of mAP0.5:0.95 of more than 75% for object detection and 0.71 m of mean absolute error in distance prediction, which are easily scalable with the labeling of a larger amount of data. Finally, we compare our method with other similar state-of-the-art approaches.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Accurate trajectory prediction for multiple vehicles in complex social interaction environments is essential for ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles and improving the quality of their planning and control. The social interactions between vehicles significantly influence their future trajectories. However, traditional trajectory prediction models based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) often overlook or simplify these interactions. Although these models may exhibit high performance in short-term predictions, they fail to achieve high prediction accuracy in scenarios with long-term dynamic interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a Social-Attention Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model which predicts the future trajectories of neighboring vehicles and achieves increased accuracy. Our proposed model employs a Social-Pooling layer to effectively capture cooperative behaviors and mutual influences between vehicles. Additionally, we incorporate a self-attention mechanism to weight the inputs and outputs of the Social-Pooling layer, which is significant for assessing the influence between vehicles in different positions. This combination allows our model to take into consideration both the dependencies within the sequence and the social relationships between vehicles, providing a more comprehensive scene understanding. The efficacy of our model is tested on two real-world freeway trajectory datasets, namely NGSIM and HighD. Our model surpasses various baseline methods, exhibiting exceptional accuracy in both prediction and tracking.

AB For autonomous vehicles driving on roads, future trajectories of surrounding traffic agents (e.g., vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians) are essential information. The prediction of future trajectories is challenging as the motion of traffic agents is constantly affected by spatial-temporal interactions from agents and road infrastructure. To take those interactions into account, this study proposes a Graph Attention Transformer (Gatformer) in which a traffic scene is represented by a sparse graph. To maintain the spatial and temporal information of traffic agents in a traffic scene, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are utilized to extract spatial features and a position encoder is proposed to encode the spatial features and the corresponding temporal features. Based on the encoded features, a Graph Attention Network (GAT) block is employed to model the agent-agent and agent-infrastructure interactions with the help of attention mechanisms. Finally, a Transformer network is introduced to predict trajectories for multiple agents simultaneously. Experiments are conducted over the Lyft dataset and state-of-the-art methods are introduced for comparison. The results show that the proposed Gatformer could make more accurate predictions while requiring less inference time than its counterparts.

AB Robot navigation is an indispensable component of any mobile service robot. Many path planning algorithms generate a path which has many sharp or angular turns. Such paths are not fit for mobile robot as it has to slow down at these sharp turns. These robots could be carrying delicate, dangerous, or precious items and executing these sharp turns may not be feasible kinematically. On the contrary, smooth trajectories are often desired for robot motion and must be generated while considering the static and dynamic obstacles and other constraints like feasible curvature, robot and lane dimensions, and speed. The aim of this paper is to succinctly summarize and review the path smoothing techniques in robot navigation and discuss the challenges and future trends. Both autonomous mobile robots and autonomous vehicles (outdoor robots or self-driving cars) are discussed. The state-of-the-art algorithms are broadly classified into different categories and each approach is introduced briefly with necessary background, merits, and drawbacks. Finally, the paper discusses the current and future challenges in optimal trajectory generation and smoothing research.

AB This work considers the problem of position and position-uncertainty estimation for atonomous vehicles during power black-out, where it cannot be assumed that any position data is accessible. To tackle this problem, the position estimation will instead be performed using power separated and independent measurement devices, including one inertial 6 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) measurement unit, four angular wheel speed sensors and one pinion angle sensor. The measurement unit's sensors are initially characterized in order to understand conceptual limitations of the inertial navigation and also to be used in a filtering process. Measurement models are then fused together with vehicle dynamics process models using the architecture of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Two different EKF filter concepts are developed to estimate the vehicle position during a safe stop; one simpler filter for smooth manoeuvres and a complex filter for aggressive manoeuvres. Both filter designs are tested and evaluated with data gathered from an experimental vehicle for selected manoeuvres of developed safe-stop scenarios. The experimental results from a set of use-case manoeuvres show a trend where the size of the position estimation errors significantly grows above an initial vehicle speed of 70 km/h. This paper contributes to develop vehicle dynamics models for the purpose of a blind safe stop.

TI A guidance-based motion-planning methodology for the docking of

SO JOURNAL OF ROBOTIC SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
ID PROXIMITY SENSOR
AB In this paper, a generic line-of-sight-sensing (LOS)-based guidance methodology is proposed for the docking of autonomous vehicles/ robotic end-effectors: A multi-LOS task-space sensing system is used in conjunction with a guidance algorithm in a closed-loop feedback environment. The novelty of the overall system is its applicability to cases that do not allow for the direct proximity measurement of the vehicle's pose (position and orientation). In such instances, a guidance-based technique must be employed to move the vehicle to its desired pose using corrective actions at the final stages of its motion. Namely, after the vehicle/ end-effector has failed to move to its desired docking pose within acceptable tolerances, LOS sensors initiate short-range corrective motion commands. The objective of the proposed guidance method is, thus, to successfully minimize the systematic errors of the vehicle, accumulated after a long-range motion, while allowing it to converge within the random noise limits. An additional advantage of the proposed system is its applicability to varying vehicle mobility requirements for high-precision docking. The proposed system was successfully tested via simulation on a 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) vehicle. Numerous simulation tests of the behavior of the vehicle under the command of the guidance algorithm were conducted, one of which is presented herein. (C) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) combined with Deep Learning (DL) have demonstrated impressive performance in complex tasks, including autonomous driving. The use of RL agents in autonomous driving leads to a smooth human-like driving experience, but the limited interpretability of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) creates a verification and certification bottleneck. Instead of relying on RL agents to learn complex tasks, we propose HPRL - Hierarchical Program-triggered Reinforcement Learning, which uses a hierarchy consisting of a structured program along with multiple RL agents, each trained to perform a relatively simple task. The focus of verification shifts to the master program under simple guarantees from the RL agents, leading to a significantly more interpretable and verifiable implementation as compared to a complex RL agent. The evaluation of the framework is demonstrated on different driving tasks, and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) pre-crash scenarios using CARLA, an open-source dynamic urban simulation environment.

AB Railway transportation, as a pillar of modern civilization, unavoidably suffers from external risk factors such as natural disasters, track breakages, and train collisions, which lead to substantial loss of life and property. Therefore, there is an urgent need to design a mechanism for warning and preventing railway accidents in order to diminish costs. We propose an add-on solution to the current system, which equips a train with a multifunctional pilot vehicle in the front: the vehicle pilots its mother train, warning it of impending danger, and stopping it if required. Specifically, the pilot vehicle is equipped with a wireless communication device to converse with the mother train, a ranging device for measuring the real-time distance from the mother train, a camera to capture the railway conditions ahead and recognize anomaly situations, and other sensors (e.g., collision detector and tiltmeter) to monitor its own conditions. Based on the above equipment, an efficient autonomous driving method is designed for the pilot vehicle to adjust the distance from the train. The autonomous driving problem can be formulated into a multi-objective functional optimization, where the objective is to minimize the total energy consumption and the experienced jerk of the pilot vehicle, and the decision is a continuous-time function that represents the traction or braking force imposed on the pilot vehicle. Additionally, a vision-based deep learning method is devised to automatically detect the mentioned railway anomalies using the ego-view camera of the pilot vehicle. To control the operational and maintenance costs, we propose to deploy pilot vehicles only for trains running in potentially dangerous environments, e.g., mountainous areas during rainy days. By implementing the proposed scheme, we anticipate a reduction in accident rates within railway systems.

TI Sitting posture influence in autonomous vehicles for the evaluation of
   occupant safety in side impact
SO SAFETY SCIENCE

DT Article
DE Autonomous vehicles; Occupant safety; Finite element models; Side
   impact; WorldSID; Sitting posture
AB Introduction: Autonomous vehicles will give vehicle drivers greater freedom to engage in other activities while the vehicle is in operation that will lead to changes in the seating configurations as well as driver posture. Although it is expected that these vehicles will prevent crashes, collisions will still happen. Ensuring the adequate protection of occupants in these new unconventional positions is the main challenge. The objective of this study was to evaluate and analyse occupant responses in non-standard seating positions that may be expected to occur in automated vehicles occupants under side impact conditions.
   Methods: Finite Elements Method simulations were performed using the WorldSID 50th male dummy positioned in the driver position. A validated simplified vehicle model with fully deformable driver-side components was used. To explore the sensitivity to side impact across various occupant activities, five scenarios were defined: normal driving (S0), fall-back ready (S1), work (S2), leisure (S3) and relax/sleep (S4). All scenarios were subjected to the Euro NCAP Side Tests Protocols (deformable barrier and oblique pole impact).
   Results: As the distance from the pole impact point to the B-pillar decreased, the structure deformation increased due to the B-Pillar deformation. In cases S2 and S3 predicted thorax injury values were the highest, whereas scenarios S3 and S4 were the worst situation in deformable barrier impact test. Good pelvis protection was provided in all pole impact scenarios, but pelvis injury values were the highest in all scenarios in deformable barrier impact test.
   Conclusions: Attending to the new scenarios due to the new available driver activities, current safety standards are not enough to guarantee the highest level of protection. Reclined seating scenarios required a wide range of impact positions to be covered since injury responses were influenced by the initial impact alignment of the dummy relative to the vehicle and the pole. Large rotations of the seatback lead to high chest compressions.

AB A biologically inspired neurodynamics-based tracking controller of underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) is proposed in this paper. The proposed control strategy includes a velocity controller with biological neurons and an adaptive sliding mode controller. The biological neurons are embedded into the backstepping velocity controller to eliminate the sharp speed jumps commonly existing in vehicles due to tracking errors changing suddenly. The outputs of the velocity controller are used as the command inputs of the sliding mode controller, and the thruster control constraints problems that are commonly seen in the backstepping control of AUV are solved by the proposed controller. Simulation results show that the control strategy achieved success in smoothly tracking AUV position and velocity.

AB Augmented vehicular reality (AVR) is one of the key technologies to realize intelligent transportation in the future, which can significantly improve traffic safety and transportation efficiency of autonomous driving. However, available computation and spectrum resources of vehicles are not well utilized to meet the requirements of cooperative perception of autonomous vehicles. In order to meet the needs of sharing sensing data to cooperatively perceive the surrounding environment, executing delay-sensitive and computationally intensive tasks of autonomous driving applications, we propose computation offloading and resource allocation optimization for AVR (CoroAVR) algorithm with hybrid sensing data fusion of cooperative perception to process the real-time data in fog-edge computing for maximizing system throughput and spectrum utilization on the premise of ensuring the quality of task completion. First, the minimum signal to interference plus noise ratio needed to complete the task is obtained with the given maximum computing resources. Second, the optimal power allocation is carried out by using convex optimization theory, and the throughput gain is calculated, and the offloading decision is made by comparing the throughput gain. Finally, the channel allocation problem is solved by using the maximum matching algorithm of the bipartite graph, and the computation resource allocation is studied. The simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is better than that of the contrast algorithm.

AB Predicting the state of dynamic objects in a real traffic environment is a key issue in autonomous driving vehicles. Various approaches have been proposed to learn the dynamics from visual observations with static background. However, minimal research has been conducted in a real traffic environment due to the complicated and changeable scenes. This paper proposes an adaptive multi-target future state prediction (position/velocity) method under autonomous driving conditions. In particular, an adaptive visual interaction method and control mechanism are introduced to overcome the change in the number of objects in continuous driving frames. In addition, a two-stream architecture with stage-wise learning is utilized for accurate object state prediction by simultaneously complementing spatial and temporal information. Experiments on two public challenging datasets, namely Udacity (CrowdAI) and Udacity (Autti), demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on multi-target dynamic state prediction in a real traffic environment.

AB Due to dynamic changes and instability of oceanic eddies, continuous tracking and sampling using mobile platforms is a challenging field. Aiming at the requirements of accurate observation of mesoscale eddies, this paper studies the problem of searching and tracking the eddy center in a mapless environment with an underactuated autonomous surface underwater vehicle (ASUV) and proposes a path planning method based on the deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Firstly, the existing observation methods are summarized, and the dynamic tracking framework of mesoscale eddies is established. Then, the DRL and long short-term memory (LSTM) are combined to train end-to-end and real-time planning strategies in an eddy environment. Finally, a high-fidelity simulation platform in the eddy environment is built, and actual data from the Kuroshio Extension region is used to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the strategies. The experimental results show that the ASUV with the proposed strategies can realize the autonomous search and tracking of the eddy center, have good stability and real-time performance, and the tracking error is always within an acceptable range.

AB The hydrodynamic performance of a novel hovering autonomous underwater vehicle, the autonomous underwater helicopter (AUH), with an original disk-shaped hull (HG1) and an improved fore-aft asymmetric hull (HG3), is investigated by means of computational fluid dynamics with the adoption of overlapping mesh method. The hydrodynamic performance of the two hull shapes in surge motion with variation of the angle of attack is compared. The results show that HG3 has less resistance and higher motion stability compared to HG1. With the angle of attack reaching 10 degrees, both HG1 and HG3 achieve the maximum lift-to-drag ratio, which is higher for HG3 compared to HG1. Furthermore, based on the numerical simulation of the plane motion mechanism test (PMM) and according to Routh's stability criterion, the horizontal movement and vertical movement stability indexes of HG1 and HG3 (G(H)(HG1)=1.0, G(V)(HG1)=49.7, G(H)(HG2)=1.0, G(V)(HG3)=2.1) are obtained, which further show that the AUH has better vertical movement stability than the torpedo-shaped AUV. Furthermore, the scale model tail velocity experiment indirectly shows that HG3 has better hydrodynamic performance than HG1.

AB Currently, integrated navigation systems with the inertial navigation system (INS)/geomagnetic navigation system (GNS) have been widely used in underwater navigation of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Restricting AUV to navigate in the geomagnetic suitability areas (GSA) as far as possible can effectively improve the accuracy of integrated navigation systems. In order to improve the classification accuracy of GSA, a new optimal classification method based on principal component analysis (PCA) and improved back propagation (BP) neural network is proposed. PCA is used to extract the independent characteristic parameters containing the main components. Then, considering similarity coefficient, the initial weights and thresholds of BP neural network is optimized by improved adaptive genetic algorithm (IAGA). Finally, the correspondence between the geomagnetic characteristic parameters and matching performance is established based on PCA and improved adaptive genetic algorithm and back propagation (IAGA-BP) neural network for the automatic recognition of GSA. Simulated experiments based on PCA and IAGA-BP neural network shows high classification accuracy and reliability in the GSA selection. The method could provide important support for AUV path planning, which is an effective guarantee for AUV high precision and long voyage autonomous navigation.

ID PATH-TRACKING
AB The challenge of trajectory tracking of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is a critical aspect that must be effectively addressed. Recent studies are concerned with maintaining the yaw stability to guarantee the customers' comfort throughout the journey. Most of the geometrical controllers solve this task by dividing it into consecutive point stabilization problems, limiting the controllers' ability to handle sudden trajectory changes. One research presented a predictive Stanley lateral controller that uses a discrete prediction model to mimic human behavior by anticipating the vehicle's future states. That controller is limited in its use, as the parameters must be manually tuned for every change in the maneuver or vehicle velocity. This article presents a novel approach for trajectory tracking in autonomous vehicles, by introducing a fuzzy supervisory controller that automatically adapts to changes in the vehicle's velocity and maneuver by estimating the prediction horizon's length and providing different weights for each controller. The proposed method overcomes the limitations of traditional controllers that require manual tuning of parameters, making it ready for real-world experiments. This is the main contribution of the research in this paper. The suggested technique demonstrated an advantage over the Basic Stanley controller and the manually tuned predictive Stanley controller in terms of the total lateral error and the model predictive control (MPC) in terms of computational time. The performance is determined by performing various simulations on V-Rep and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments on an E-CAR golf bus. A broad selection of velocities is used to validate the behavior of the vehicle while working on different maneuvers (double lane change, hook road, S road, and curved road).

ID LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; AUTOMATED VEHICLES; ENERGY IMPACTS; LEVEL
AB The transportation industry has led efforts to fight climate change and reduce air pollution. Autonomous electric vehicles (A-EVs) that use artificial intelligence, next-generation batteries, etc., are predicted to replace conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) in the coming years. In this study, we performed a life cycle assessment to analyze A-EVs and compare their impacts with those from EV and ICEV systems. The scope of the analysis consists of the manufacturing and use phases, and a functional unit of 150,000 miles & BULL;passenger was chosen for the assessment. Our results on the impacts from the manufacturing phase of the analyzed systems show that the A-EV systems have higher impacts than other transportation systems in the majority of the impacts categories analyzed (e.g., global warming potential, ozone depletion, human toxicity-cancer) and, on average, EV systems were found to be the slightly more environmentally friendly than ICEV systems. The high impacts in A-EV are due to additional components such as cameras, sonar, and radar. In comparing the impacts from the use phase, we also analyzed the impact of automation and found that the use phase impacts of A-EVs outperform EV and ICEV in many aspects, including global warming potential, acidification, and smog formation. To interpret the results better, we also investigated the impacts of electricity grids on the use phase impact of alternative transportation options for three representative countries with different combinations of renewable and conventional primary energy resources such as hydroelectric, nuclear, and coal. The results revealed that A-EVs used in regions that have hydropower-based electric mix become the most environmentally friendly transportation option than others.

AB Autonomous robotic vehicles need accurate positioning to navigate. For outdoor autonomous vehicles, the localization problem has been solved using GNSS systems. However, many places suffer from problems in the signal of those systems, known as GNSS-denied environments. To face such a problem, several approaches first map the environment to thereafter localize the vehicle within it. The solutions for mapping in GNSS-denied places, mostly, are tested indoors, and the revisited areas are generally close from the starting position. In this work, we develop a single sensor system for mapping in large-scale GNSS-denied sites, based exclusively on a 3D LiDAR system. The proposed work consists of a 3D-LiDAR with a LiDAR Odometry approach (LO) estimating movements between frames thus providing of dead-reckoning estimates of the vehicle. The LiDAR Odometry is the input to a virtual GNSS system based on a Particle Filter Localization which matches the estimated dead-reckoning with a road map, with the assumption that the vehicle usually navigates on roads. The global position produced by the virtual GNSS is used to detect and correct loop closures in case of revisited areas. A GraphSLAM implementation fuses the outcomes from LiDAR Odometry, virtual GNSS and loop closure, and yield a feasible pose of the vehicle. Finally, a mapping procedure places every 3D frame and builds 2D occupancy grid maps. The system developed here is evaluated empirically using two datasets collected in a dynamic environment with paths of 3.7 and 6.5 km long, respectively. For both datasets, the system presents an RMS of 6.5 m according to GNSS sensor readings used for comparison purposes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Subsea cables are widely used for power and information transmission in offshore infrastructure such as global communication networks and offshore wind farms. The precise positioning of subsea cables is an important prerequisite for maintenance and repair. However, the small diameter and burial depth of 3-5 m below the seabed make locating and detecting the subsea cable technically challenging. This paper investigates the localization and intelligent tracking detection of subsea cables based on autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. First, an autonomous electromagnetic localization and tracking topology of subsea cable is designed based on AUV architecture and PSO algorithm. The basic principle of locating the horizontal position and depth of a subsea cable based on horizontal survey line measurement is illustrated. Second, the PSO algorithm is retrofitted with electromagnetic localization. Specifically, the subsea cable localization flow diagram, region of interest (ROI) and fitness function are constructed, respectively. Third, an online swath path planning method for subsea cable detection is designed based on the PSO localization results. Finally, the effectiveness of the PSO submarine cable location algorithm and the online planning method for detection paths is verified through multiple controlled simulation tests.

AB In recent years, there has been a remarkable development in the technology and legislation related to electric and autonomous vehicles (i.e., EVs/AVs). This technological advancement requires the deployment of the most up-to-date supporting infrastructure to achieve safe operation. Further infrastructure is needed for Level 5 vehicles, namely the introduction of super-fast wireless 5G technology. To achieve harmony between the rapid technological advancement of EVs/AVs and environmental preservation, enacting legislation related to their sustainable use is vital. Thus, this manuscript provides a review of the technological development of EVs/AVs, with a special focus on carbon footprints and the implementation of additive manufacturing using recycled materials. While EVs have a 12.13% increased carbon footprint compared to conventional vehicles, AVs with basic and advanced intelligence features have an increased carbon footprint of 41.43% and 99.65%, respectively. This article emphasizes that the integration of 3D-printed components has the potential to offset this impact with a substantial 60% reduction. As a result, custom-made solutions involving 3D printing are explored, leading to greater speed, customization, and cost-effectiveness for EVs/AVs. This article also lists the advantages and disadvantages of the existing legislation in Spain, the United Kingdom, and the western Balkans, demonstrating various approaches to promoting electric mobility and the development of autonomous vehicles. In Spain, initiatives like the MOVES program incentivize EV adoption, while the UK focuses on expanding the EV market and addressing concerns about EVs' quiet operation. In the western Balkans, the adoption of legislation lags behind, with limited incentives and infrastructure for EVs. To boost sales, legal mechanisms are necessary to reduce costs and improve accessibility, in addition to offering subsidies for the purchase of EVs. To this end, an analysis of the incentive measures proposed for the development and use of renewable power sources for the supply of energy for EVs/AVs is presented.

AB With ongoing massive investment in the field of autonomous vehicles, fully autonomous self-driving vehicles are set to become a reality soon. Despite the benefits in traffic safety and economy, the potential effects of autonomous vehicles, especially autonomous trucks, on transportation infrastructure remain to be determined. In this study, a finite element model was developed based on a typical flexible pavement structure. The effects of autonomous trucks' lateral distribution within the lane with respect to rutting depth and fatigue damage were estimated by finite element analysis under certain environmental condition. Characteristics of the pavement structure and environmental condition have been collected and presented in this paper. Four possible lateral control modes on managing autonomous trucks' lateral distribution were proposed, listed as zero-wander mode, uniform mode, double peak Gaussian mode, two-section uniform mode. Considering the difference between autonomous trucks and human-driven trucks, the ratio of autonomous trucks was also evaluated. Based on the simulation results, it has been confirmed that, if controlled appropriately, autonomous trucks could be highly beneficial to asphalt pavements for wider using of pavement. Conversely, if without appropriate lateral control, the effect of autonomous trucks on the typical flexible pavement life could be negative, owing to repeated single point load caused by lane centering and keeping. For example, the uniform mode, double peak Gaussian mode and two-section uniform mode all throw positive effect on the pavement. On the contrary, under the zero wander mode, the time when the rutting depth of the proposed pavement reaches 15 mm (defined as maintenance year) may advance by 1.56 years and fatigue damage at the bottom of asphalt layer increases by 146%. Compared with the normal situation nowadays, the two-section uniform distribution of autonomous trucks, the best performing control mode, delays the maintenance year by 2.3 years. From the aspect of fatigue, a much uniform distribution curve of fatigue within the lane can also be found under this mode. When all trucks' lateral positions were in control, the two-section uniform mode could reduce the fatigue damage by up to 35% under repeated standard axle load on the flexible pavement. Finally, a framework of dealing with the lateral control was proposed as a reference for different conditions, such as asphalt pavement structures and materials.

AB Accurate prediction of acoustic communication performance is an important capability for marine robots. In this paper, we propose a model-based learning methodology for the prediction of underwater acoustic communication performance. The learning algorithm consists of two steps: (i) estimation of the covariance matrix by evaluating candidate functions with estimated parameters using detrended measurements;and (ii) prediction of communication performance. Covariance estimation is addressed with a multi-stage iterative training method that produces unbiased and robust results with nested models. The efficiency of the framework is validated with simulations and experimental data from field trials. The field trials involved a manned surface vehicle and an autonomous underwater vehicle.

AB This article is the first to provide a thorough system design overview along with the fusion methods selection criteria of a real-world cooperative autonomous driving system enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), named infrastructure-augmented autonomous driving (IAAD). We present an in-depth introduction to the IAAD hardware and software on both road side and vehicle side. We extensively characterize the IAAD system and observe that the network condition fluctuation along the road is the main roadblock for cooperative autonomous driving. To address this challenge, we propose new fusion methods, dubbed "interframe fusion" and "planning fusion" to complement the state-of-the-art "intraframe fusion." We demonstrate that each fusion method has its own benefit and constraint. In order to select the best fusion method under varying network conditions, we propose "fusion criteria" to instruct the IAAD system to intelligently make the selection and implement a system framework named adaptive spatial-temporal (S-T) choice to realize the adaptive fusion guided by the "fusion criteria." Our real-world field data verifies that S-T choice has significantly improved autonomous driving's safety and reliability by decreasing the fusion miss ratio from 30% to 7% and remain the planning displacement error within the 1.7 m instead of 4 m when the network condition exacerbates.

AB Deep learning networks have demonstrated outstanding performance in 2D and 3D vision tasks. However, recent research demonstrated that these networks result in failures when imperceptible perturbations are added to the input known as adversarial attacks. This phenomenon has recently received increased interest in the field of autonomous vehicles and has been extensively researched on 2D image-based perception tasks and 3D object detection. However, the adversarial robustness of 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation in autonomous vehicles is a relatively unexplored topic. This study expands the adversarial examples to LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation. We developed and analyzed three LiDAR point-based adversarial attack methods on different networks developed on the SemanticKITTI dataset. The findings illustrate that the Cylinder3D network has the highest adversarial susceptibility to the analyzed attacks. We investigated how the class-wise point distribution influences the adversarial robustness of each class in the SemanticKITTI dataset and discovered that ground-level points are extremely vulnerable to point perturbation attacks. Further, the transferability of each attack strategy was assessed, and we found that networks relying on point data representation demonstrate a notable level of resistance. Our findings will enable future research in developing more complex and specific adversarial attacks against LiDAR segmentation and countermeasures against adversarial attacks.

ID MANIPULATION
AB Autonomous vision-based aerial grasping is an essential and challenging task for aerial manipulation missions. In this paper, we propose a vision-based aerial grasping system for a Rotorcraft Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to grasp a target object. The UAV system is equipped with a monocular camera, a 3-DOF robotic arm with a gripper and a Jetson TK1 computer. Efficient and reliable visual detectors and control laws are crucial for autonomous aerial grasping using limited onboard sensing and computational capabilities. To detect and track the target object in real time, an efficient proposal algorithm is presented to reliably estimate the region of interest (ROI), then a correlation filter-based classifier is developed to track the detected object. Moreover, a support vector regression (SVR)-based grasping position detector is proposed to improve the grasp success rate with high computational efficiency. Using the estimated grasping position and the UAV?Aos states, novel control laws of the UAV and the robotic arm are proposed to perform aerial grasping. Extensive simulations and outdoor flight experiments have been implemented. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed vision-based aerial grasping system can autonomously and reliably grasp the target object while working entirely onboard.

AB The accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) models is crucial for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). However, in reality, model training under less frequent weather faces the problem of insufficient sampling. Also, in the real world, weather, sunlight, etc., can only change with the speed of the real-time clock, so the traditional sampling process is very slow. Moreover, currently, collective learning, which can make up the limited experience and computing power of a single vehicle, is always introduced to cases where the data from participants have the same structure, wasting massive heterogeneous data from vehicles of different brands. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a quantum collective learning and many-to-many matching game-based scheme in the metaverse for CAVs. The environment is simulated in the metaverse, which has its own time clock system, thereby expanding sample size and speeding up the sampling process. And we quantify the quality of intelligence in collective learning from the perspective of feature diversity. It is the cornerstone of collective learning between heterogeneous vehicles, facilitating maximum utilization of data with different structures. Then, we formulate the distributed vehicles selection problem as a many-to-many matching game and use Gale-Shapely algorithm to solve it. Also, we formulate the spectrum resource allocation problem as a discrete Markov decision process (MDP) and adopt a quantum-inspired reinforcement learning (QRL) algorithm to find the optimal policy to achieve the high revenue of the system. In simulations, the performance of the proposed scheme is compared with existing methods.

AB Y We investigate the effects of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on highway congestion. AVs have the potential to significantly reduce highway congestion because they can maintain smaller intervehicle gaps and travel together in larger platoons than human-driven vehicles (HVs). Various policies have been proposed to regulate AV travel on highways, yet no in-depth comparison of these policies exists. To address this shortcoming, we develop a queueing model for a multilane highway and analyze two policies: the designated-lane policy ("D policy"), under which one lane is designated to AVs, and the integrated policy ("I policy"), under which AVs travel together with HVs in all lanes. We connect the service rate to intervehicle gaps (governed by a Markovian arrival process) and congestion, and measure the performance using mean travel time and throughput. Our analysis shows that although the I policy performs at least as well as a benchmark case with no AVs, the D policy outperforms the benchmark only when the highway is heavily congested and AVs constitute the majority of vehicles; in such a case, this policy may outperform the I policy only in terms of throughput. These findings caution against recent industry and government proposals that the D policy should be employed at the beginning of the mass appearance of AVs. Finally, we calibrate our model to data and show that for highly congested highways, a moderate number of AVs can make a substantial improvement (e.g., 22% AVs can improve throughput by 30%), and when all vehicles are AVs, throughput can be increased by over 400%.

AB Autonomous vehicles and truck platooning have become the future in the transportation field. This new strategy has many benefits because it lowers fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, improves safety, optimizes transport by using roads more effectively, and reduces traffic congestion. In this research, the effect of the controlled positioning of autonomous and non-autonomous truck loadings on the long-term performance of pavement was estimated using different variables such as climate, uniform wandering values of distance between trucks, and percentage of autonomous trucks by using MEPDG/AASHTOWare Pavement ME Design software. This was achieved by first computing the strain and stress of the different loading combinations, resulting in the computation of the failures in the pavement infrastructure and the pavement thickness needed to support each combination. The second part of the research consisted of designing a platoon strategy that was developed for a series of autonomous and connected trucks such that the lateral position of the trucks and the spacing between them could be explicitly optimized to minimize flexible pavement damage. The findings revealed that a small percentage of autonomous trucks can be beneficial to pavement life and that truck platooning following a well-studied skeleton can open a whole new world of pavement design. This can be revolutionary in changing roads around the world to improve traffic and infrastructure.

AB This paper describes the design, implementation, and field-testing of a low-cost autonomous control system on the Platform for Expanding Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) exploRation to Longer ranges (PEARL). PEARL is a floating, solar-powered platform designed as a servicing station for AUVs. This paper describes the field testing of a prototype system currently without the ability to dock and recharge AUVs. In this prototype, autonomous operations are realized through the open-source MOOS-IvP marine robotics software running on an embedded architecture including a Raspberry Pi microcomputer, Arduino microcontroller, and onboard inertial measurement unit and GPS sensors. A solar charge controller monitors energy system statistics in real-time. Field tests included station-keeping and waypoint missions in a freshwater pond in Orleans, MA. An RMS tracking error of 0.9-2.2 m was achieved during waypoint pattern executions, with an average battery usage of 13% per hour. Net power consumption rate will change due to variations in currents and winds, as well as variations in solar irradiance. The implementation of an autonomous sun-tracking mode to maximize solar panel flux while station-keeping is also evaluated. The field testing results will inform the design of a full-scale PEARL capable of docking with AUVs. This research helps pave the way for autonomous solar-powered service stations in the ocean that can connect the underwater world with space.

AB This paper is among the first to address the problem of pedestrians' crossing at an autonomous intersection without traffic lights. To guarantee pedestrians' safety, all the pedestrians who intend to cross the street should firstly board into a fully enclosed automated transport unit, which is referred to as an "automated pedestrian shuttle " (APS) in this paper, then the APS carries the pedestrians across the street. Because APSs can shuttle back and forth through the intersection, the routing problem for APSs is modeled first. Then a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) based AIM model is proposed to simultaneously optimize for the time of APSs and upcoming vehicles to enter the intersection. A numerical analysis is conducted to examine the performance and effectiveness of the proposed methods.

AB In this field note, we detail the operations and discuss the results of an experiment conducted in the unstructured environment of an underwater cave complex using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). For this experiment, the AUV was equipped with two acoustic sonar sensors to simultaneously map the caves' horizontal and vertical surfaces. Although the caves' spatial complexity required AUV guidance by a diver, this field deployment successfully demonstrates a scan-matching algorithm in a simultaneous localization and mapping framework that significantly reduces and bounds the localization error for fully autonomous navigation. These methods are generalizable for AUV exploration in confined underwater environments where surfacing or predeployment of localization equipment is not feasible, and they may provide a useful step toward AUV utilization as a response tool in confined underwater disaster areas.

AB As an amphibious system, aerial-terrestrial vehicles have demonstrated remarkable environmental adaptability. In order to expand their synergistic advantages, in this letter, an Aerial-Terrestrial vehicle consisting of a pair of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) is proposed, which is capable of performing UAV-UGV autonomous docking and detaching. Under the docking modality, the proposed vehicle can perform amphibious locomotion to adapt to rugged terrains. Under the detaching mode, the distributed UAV and UGV subsystems gain enhanced accessibility to the confined space and can share both air and land information, which is promising to accomplish collaborative missions. In order to achieve the docking and detaching of the two subsystems, a screw-like binding mechanism is proposed. To implement the binding mechanism, it is separated into two pieces, i.e., 'screw' and 'nut,' which are duel-functioned as the landing gear of the UAV or the UGV roof, respectively. To improve the success rate of docking, a mathematical model of the binding mechanism is established to calculate the ideal curve of the guiding surface, which provides important cues for the mechanism fabrication. With such a binding mechanism, UAV or UGV can execute docking or detachment via screwing-like self-spinning motion. The spinning torque of the UAV and UGV are calibrated by torque measurement tests. As a result, each independent vehicle can generate sufficient power to lock or detach via its original actuators, thus omitting the extra actuators. The full stage control, including air-ground docking-detaching and amphibious locomotion, are validated experimentally.

AB The autonomous driving era is coming with tremendous potential to revolutionize transportation systems with improved safety, comfort, and intelligence on the road. Integrating connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and rising social networking, autonomous vehicular social networks (AVSNs) can facilitate the data dissemination in safety-critical and entertainment-related applications for autonomous driving. However, with time-varying, delay-constrained, and location-dependent characteristics in autonomous driving, it faces great challenges to incentivize CAVs to disseminate massive content in AVSNs. Meanwhile, attackers may not only disseminate fake information to confuse the network, but also pose security vulnerabilities and privacy issues for CAVs. In this article, we investigate secure and incentive content delivery in AVSNs based on the advanced blockchain. Specifically, we first present a blockchain-enabled AVSN framework to safeguard content delivery. Then, we investigate the task-based and credit-based reputation models to evaluate the trustworthiness of CAVs and RSUs, respectively. The reputation increase and task reward are explored as incentives for CAVs delivering reliable content. In addition, a novel proof of reputation consensus protocol is devised to efficiently reach consensus in blockchain-enabled AVSNs while motivating RSUs to behave honestly. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework outperforms the existing approaches, delivering vehicular content more reliably and securely. Finally, future research directions in this emerging area are discussed.

AB CAVs have the potential to improve traffic safety and efficiency in a fully connected environment, but they face additional challenges when they interact with human-driven vehicles in mixed-traffic scenarios due to the uncertainty in humans' driving behaviour. Another challenge is the unreliability of communication networks. Delays and packet losses in communication links due to dense traffic, communication interference, channel fading, etc. may jeopardize CAVs driving behaviour and negatively affect traffic safety and efficiency. While the impact of CAVs on traffic safety and efficiency at different market penetration rates (MPRs) has been studied extensively, CAVs have been assumed to operate in either realistic traffic scenarios with perfect communication or with only a very small number of vehicles with imperfect communication. In contrast, this paper investigates the impact of CAVs on both traffic safety and efficiency in realistic scenarios in terms of imperfect communication, large-reaction time, vehicle modelling, and traffic scenario, with a focus on quantifying the detrimental effects of unreliable V2V communication and large-reaction time. Results show that CAVs can significantly improve mixed traffic safety in the presence of unreliable V2V communication and large-reaction times by adopting a very cautious car-following strategy (i.e., larger time headways), but this is at the expense of a slight reduction in traffic efficiency. Specifically, safety conflicts can be reduced by up to 66.67% at 70% penetration rate in the presence of packet drop of 70% and reaction time of 0.5s, but only at the cost of a travel time increase of 2.6%.

AB Adults' access to transportation may improve after the deployment of highly automated vehicles (HAVs). However, the public is hesitant to accept HAVs. This study investigated the influence of adults' (n = 210) age-younger (18-29 years), middle-aged (30-64 years), young-old (65-74 years), and older (>75 years)-and readiness to use technology on their intention to use, perceived barriers, well-being, and acceptance of HAVs before and after riding in an autonomous shuttle and a driving simulator operating in autonomous mode. Two-way mixed analysis of variances (ANOVAs) were deployed to assess changes between groups in Automated Vehicle User Perception Survey (AVUPS) domain scores after exposure to the HAVs. When controlling for baseline differences, well-being increased after exposure to HAVs for young-old adults compared with both middle-aged and younger adults. Both young-old and older adults reported greater intention to use compared with middle-aged adults. Regardless of age or technology readiness, adults' intention to use HAVs increased after experiencing the HAVs. Explorers displayed favorable perceptions (i.e., AVUPS domain scores) of HAVs whereas hesitators reported lower intention to use and acceptance of HAVs and more perceived barriers to adopting HAVs. The three other technology readiness classifications, skeptics, pioneers, and avoiders held relatively similar views of HAVs before and after exposure to both modes of HAVs. General beliefs about technology may inform automakers, autonomous mobility companies, human factors engineers, and driving rehabilitation scientists of adults' willingness to embrace emerging technology, especially when widespread exposure to the technology is not yet a reality.

AB Humans assimilate information from the traffic environment mainly through visual perception. Obviously, the dominant information required to conduct a vehicle can be acquired with visual sensors. However, in contrast to most other sensor principles, video signals contain relevant information in a highly indirect manner and hence visual sensing requires sophisticated machine vision and image understanding techniques. This paper provides an overview on the state of research in the field of machine vision for intelligent vehicles. The functional spectrum addressed covers the range from advanced driver assistance systems to autonomous driving. The organization of the article adopts the typical order in image processing pipelines that successively condense the rich information and vast amount of data in video sequences. Dataintensive low-level "early vision" techniques first extract features that are later grouped and further processed to obtain information of direct relevance for vehicle guidance. Recognition and classification schemes allow to identify specific objects in a traffic scene. Recently, semantic labeling techniques using convolutional neural networks have achieved impressive results in this field. High-level decisions of intelligent vehicles are often influenced by map data. The emerging role of machine vision in the mapping and localization process is illustrated at the example of autonomous driving. Scene representation methods are discussed that organize the information from all sensors and data sources and thus build the interface between perception and planning. Recently, vision benchmarks have been tailored to various tasks in traffic scene perception that provide a metric for the rich diversity of machine vision methods. Finally, the paper addresses computing architectures suited to real-time implementation. Throughout the paper, numerous specific examples and real world experiments with prototype vehicles are presented.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to flood urban roads in the next future. Despite the optimism of the automotive industry and technology enthusiasts, AVs may have undesired impacts on urban liveability, especially if their diffusion is let to the market and not governed by public administrations. The door-to-door service they could provide and wider access to individual car trips can lead to an increase of short intra-urban car trips, to the detriment of public transport and active mobility. With few exceptions, the attitude of local authorities is dominated by a laissez-faire approach. The difficulty of dealing with high degrees of uncertainty and the absence of clear ideas on desirable visions are among the main reasons for this policy inaction. As a result of a collaborative backcasting process, this paper presents a vision to 2050, grounded on the extensive application of the superblock model, and the policy pathway to steer the transition to autonomous driving towards liveability and sustainability of the city. Governing the transition to AVs towards a desired vision is a complex process, that requires immediate action, farsighted planning and the cooperation of various sectors.

AB Autonomous vehicles, though having enormous potential, face a number of challenges. As a computer system interacting with society on a large scale and human beings in particular, they will encounter situations, which require moral assessment. What will count as right behavior in such situations depends on which factors are considered to be both morally justified and socially acceptable. In an empirical study we investigated what factors people recognize as relevant in driving situations. The study put subjects in several "dilemma" situations, which were designed to isolate different and potentially relevant factors. Subjects showed a surprisingly high willingness to sacrifice themselves to save others, took the age of potential victims in a crash into consideration and were willing to swerve onto a sidewalk if this saved more lives. The empirical insights are intended to provide a starting point for a discussion, ultimately yielding societal agreement whereby the empirical insights should be balanced with philosophical considerations.

AB This paper proposes a leader-follower formation tracking controller for underactuated autonomous marine surface vehicles with limited torque under environmental disturbances. A second-order formation dynamic model is developed in the actuated degrees of freedom of the followers to simplify the design procedure. Then, a formation tracking controller is designed by utilizing generalized saturation functions to reduce the risk of actuator saturation. Radial basis function neural network and adaptive robust control techniques are also adopted to preserve the controller robustness against unmodeled dynamics and environmental disturbances induced by waves and ocean currents. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis shows that all signals of the closed-loop system are bounded and tracking errors are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, simulation results are provided for a group of surface vessels to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller as a qualified candidate for real implementations in offshore applications.

AB In this study, performance evaluation of an autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval system (AVS/RS) is completed under various pre-defined design scenarios. Design scenarios are considered based on the rack configuration of the warehouse, namely the number of aisles, bays, and tiers, number of autonomous vehicles (AVs), and number of lifts. The system is simulated using ARENA 12-a commercial software. Seven performance measures are observed from the simulation results. These are: the average cycle time, average utilization of the AVs, average utilization of the lifts, average waiting time in the AVs' queue, average waiting time in the lifts' queue, average number of transactions waiting in the AVs' queue, and average number of transactions waiting in the lifts' queue. Total cost of the system is also integrated into the analysis. The results are analyzed via graphs. Various design options and their costs facilitate the evaluation of the best design for the warehouse manager. The case study is completed for a company that utilizes AVS/RS in France.

ID SYSTEM
AB In this paper, we describe the design, the development, and the sea trials of a novel small-sized autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) designed for monitoring the coastal water quality. The vehicle is characterized by the capability of measuring hydrocarbon and heavy metal concentrations directly onboard by means of custom-made miniaturized sensors. This capability, novel for an ASV, is combined with a winch-based sampling system specifically designed for small-sized vehicles. The sampling system can collect water samples up to 50 m in depth and measure the physical/water quality parameters of the water column. With these two features, the HydroNet ASV provides an autonomous, practical, real-time monitoring system, conceived to complement the current water monitoring practices in which samples are collected by a dedicated boat and analyzed in specialized laboratories at a later stage. The design process had the aim of realizing a vehicle capable of hosting the sampling system and the custom-made sensors that represent a unique payload in the world of small-sized ASVs. A twofold objective was pursued: realizing an ASV suited for monitoring missions in realistic scenarios (e.g., attention was paid to avoid water sample contamination), at the same time limiting the size for the ease of transportability and deployment. Severe constraints rose from these considerations and were addressed during the realization of the robot such as reduced length/weight (that limit the available space for the sensor payload) and low draft and protected propellers to allow the ASV to navigate in shallow waters with likely floating obstacles such as plastic bags. We report the design process aiming at a tradeoff between ease of transportability (small vehicle), available payload, and navigation performance in terms of achievable speed, endurance, and resistance to environmental disturbances (favored by larger ASV dimensions). We present sea trials of the realized vehicle validating the design choices. In particular, a long-range mission is discussed in which the robot executed a monitoring survey covering autonomously 12.5 km in front of Livorno, Italy, coast.

AB Modern cars are increasingly being equipped with automated driving functions. For governments it is important to gain insight in the mobility impacts of automated vehicles. This is important as the introduction of automated vehicles affects current investment decisions about infrastructure projects and other policy measures like road pricing. Quantitative literature with respect to the impact of automated vehicles focuses mostly on capacity implications. Literature about large scale mobility impacts is mainly qualitative. This paper introduces a System Dynamics model (SD-model) to quantitatively explore the impacts of early forms of automated vehicles (level 1, 2 and 3) on mobility. The model is explorative and can be used to evaluate different scenarios in a short time. This model is applied in a case study for the Netherlands to assess the impact of automated vehicles on mode choice, time of day choice and travel times on characteristic relations in the Netherlands. In contrast to other studies the SD-model is able to simulate the effects of AVs over time, can simulate mixed automated vehicle types and has a constant feedback between the assignment and the demand side of the model A scenario for autonomous driving and a scenario for cooperative driving is considered. The simulations show that car traffic will increase and the level of congestion does not necessarily decrease and might even increase on some relations, especially in the autonomous scenario. Furthermore, in the cooperative scenario the increase in number of trips by car is larger, the average speeds are higher and there is less congestion compared to the autonomous scenario.

ID MOBILE ROBOTS
AB The simultaneous localization and map building (SLAM) problem asks if it is possible for an autonomous vehicle to start in an unknown location in an unknown environment and then to incrementally build a map of this environment while simultaneously using this map to compute absolute vehicle location. Starting from the estimation-theoretic foundations of this problem developed in [1]-[3], this paper proves that a solution to the SLAM problem is indeed possible. The underlying structure of the SLAM problem is first elucidated. A proof that the estimated map converges monotonically to a relative map with zero uncertainty is then developed. It is then shown that the absolute accuracy of the map and the vehicle location reach a lower bound defined only by the initial vehicle uncertainty. Together, these results show that it is possible for an autonomous vehicle to start in an unknown location in an unknown environment and, using relative observations only, incrementally build a perfect map of the world and to compute simultaneously a bounded estimate of vehicle location. This paper also describes a substantial implementation of the SLAM algorithm on a vehicle operating in an outdoor environment using millimeter-wave (MMW) radar to provide relative map observations. This implementation is used to demonstrate how some key issues such as map management and data association can be handled in a practical environment. The results obtained are cross-compared with absolute locations of the map landmarks obtained by surveying. In conclusion, this paper discusses a number of key issues raised by the solution to the SLAM problem including suboptimal map-building algorithms and map management.

AB In typical traffic scenarios such as non-signalized roads or shared spaces where vehicles and pedestrians interact without clear separations. The interaction distance between objects is usually shorter due to the simultaneous motion of road users. Pedestrian-crossing scenarios in these areas make the scenario complex due to the unpredictability of the pedestrians intention and the need to balance between safety, comfort, and time consumption. To address this collision avoidance(CA) problem, a novel strategy using Social Force Model (SFM)-based adaptive parameters was proposed. The interaction system between the ego vehicle and the pedestrian was simplified as a Markov process to adopt the SFM-based dynamic model, and the validity of this simplification was demonstrated using real-world driving data. Based on the current state of the interaction system that consists of vehicle and pedestrian, this research adopted the optimal parameters that were generated by particle swarm optimization (PSO) to generate optimal parameters for the SFM-based vehicle dynamic model, which helps the vehicle avoid pedestrians with random motion. The proposed method was validated through bench testing, and the results showed that the proposed method balanced the safety, comfort, and time consumption requirements during the CA process in the studied scenario.

AB For a decade, researchers have focused on the development and deployment of road automated mobility. In the development of autonomous driving embedded systems, several stages are required. The first one deals with the perception layers. The second one is dedicated to the risk assessment, the decision and strategy layers and the optimal trajectory planning. The last stage addresses the vehicle control/command. This paper proposes an efficient solution to the second stage and improves a virtual Cooperative Pilot (Co-Pilot) already proposed in 2012. This paper thus introduces a trajectory planning algorithm for automated vehicles (AV), specifically designed for emergency situations and based on the Autonomous Decision-Support Framework (ADSF) of the EU project Trustonomy. This algorithm is an extended version of Elastic Band (EB) with no fixed final position. A set of trajectory nodes is iteratively deduced from obstacles and constraints, thus providing flexibility, fast computation, and physical realism. After introducing the project framework for risk management and the general concept of ADSF, the emergency algorithm is presented and tested under Matlab software. Finally, the Decision-Support framework is implemented under RTMaps software and demonstrated within Pro-SiVIC, a realistic 3D simulation environment. Both the previous virtual Co-Pilot and the new emergency algorithm are combined and used in a near-accident situation and shown in different risky scenarios.

AB The automobile revolution and growth in the number of cars produced several issues, and vehicle accidents remain one of the most serious road-related issues. Human mistakes and a failure to brake quickly are the main causes of accidents. There may be serious outcomes to driving when distracted. To address the aforementioned issues, an autonomous emergency braking system (AEBS) was developed. To support such an AEBS, scalable, reliable, secure, fault-tolerant, and interoperable technologies are required. An advanced emergency braking system (EBS) with sensor fusion is proposed in this paper that can autonomously identify a probable forward collision and activate the vehicle braking system to brake the vehicle to avoid or mitigate a collision. Additionally, it provides a non-linear speed controller that facilitates the AEBS to apply the brakes in an emergency. Sensor fusion using lidar, radar, and vision sensors makes the AEBS more efficient and more reliable to detect vehicles or obstacles and decreases the chance of collision to a minimum level. A MATLAB/Simulink environment was used for simulation experiments and the results demonstrated the stable operation of the AEBS to avoid forward collisions in the event of an error in the measurement of any one sensor while any vehicle is detected. The presented work establishes that the EBS sensor fusion unit is a highly reliable solution for detecting the leading vehicle at the proper time and the AEBS controller can apply the brake in the situation of forwarding obstacle detection.

AB With the development of autonomous driving and communication technology, the heterogeneous traffic flow by combining connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and manually driven vehicles (MVs) will appear on the freeway in the near future. It is expected that CAVs can improve the freeway capacity and reduce vehicle exhaust emissions, but sharing the same road by CAVs and MVs will cause certain interference to CAVs. In order to reduce the negative influence of the heterogeneous traffic flow, setting up CAV dedicated lanes to separate CAVs from MVs to a certain extent is regarded as a reasonable solution. Based on the characteristics that MVs should be decelerated by a realistic amplitude and that the connected and autonomous vehicle can accurately predict the speed of its preceding and rear CAVs at the next time step, a heterogeneous traffic flow model was established. Based on this model, we studied the overall influence of different lane strategies on the operating efficiency of freeway traffic flow and vehicle exhaust emissions under different densities with different CAV penetration rates.,e results show that setting up CAV dedicated lanes with low CAV penetration rates will have a negative impact on the freeway traffic flow. When the CAV penetration rate is 40%-60% and the density is not less than 30 veh/km/lane, setting up one CAV dedicated lane is the best choice. When the CAV penetration rate exceeds 60% and the density is not less than 40 veh/km/lane, setting up two CAV dedicated lanes is the best choice.,e research finding will assist in understanding the overall influence of CAV dedicated lanes on freeway traffic flow and help determine the optimal number of CAV dedicated lanes under different traffic conditions.

AB In the past decade, autonomous vehicle systems (AVS) have advanced at an exponential rate, particularly due to improvements in artificial intelligence, which have had a significant impact on social as well as road safety and the future of transportation systems. However, the AVS is still far away from mass production because of the high cost of sensor fusion and a lack of combination of top-tier solutions to tackle uncertainty on roads. To reduce sensor dependency and to increase manufacturing along with enhancing research, deep learning-based approaches could be the best alternative for developing practical AVS. With this vision, in this systematic review paper, we broadly discussed the literature of deep learning for AVS from the past decade for real-life implementation in core fields. The systematic review on AVS implementing deep learning is categorized into several modules that cover activities including perception analysis (vehicle detection, traffic signs and light identification, pedestrian detection, lane and curve detection, road object localization, traffic scene analysis), decision making, end-to-end controlling and prediction, path and motion planning and augmented reality-based HUD, analyzing research works from 2011 to 2021 that focus on RGB camera vision. The literature is also analyzed for final representative outcomes as visualization in augmented reality-based head-up display (AR-HUD) with categories such as early warning, road markings for improved navigation and enhanced safety with overlapping on vehicles and pedestrians in extreme visual conditions to reduce collisions. The contribution of the literature review includes detailed analysis of current state-of-the-art deep learning methods that only rely on RGB camera vision rather than complex sensor fusion. It is expected to offer a pathway for the rapid development of cost-efficient and more secure practical autonomous vehicle systems.

AB This paper serves as an introduction and overview of the potentially useful models and methodologies from artificial intelligence (AI) into the field of transportation engineering for autonomous vehicle (AV) control in the era of mixed autonomy when AVs drive alongside human-driven vehicles (HV). It is the first-of-its-kind survey paper to comprehensively review literature in both transportation engineering and AI for mixed traffic modeling. We will discuss state-of-the-art applications of AI-guided methods, identify opportunities and obstacles, and raise open questions. We divide the stage of AV deployment into four phases: the pure HVs, the HV-dominated, the AVdominated, and the pure AVs. This paper is primarily focused on the latter three phases. Models used for each phase are summarized, encompassing game theory, deep (reinforcement) learning, and imitation learning. While reviewing the methodologies, we primarily focus on the following research questions: (1) What scalable driving policies are to control a large number of AVs in mixed traffic comprised of human drivers and uncontrollable AVs? (2) How do we estimate human driver behaviors? (3) How should the driving behavior of uncontrollable AVs be modeled in the environment? (4) How are the interactions between human drivers and autonomous vehicles characterized? We also provide a list of public datasets and simulation software related to AVs. Hopefully this paper will not only inspire our transportation community to rethink the conventional models that are developed in the data-shortage era, but also start conversations with other disciplines, in particular robotics and machine learning, to join forces towards creating a safe and efficient mixed traffic ecosystem.

AB At present, with the development of waterborne transport vehicles, research on ship faces a new round of challenges in terms of intelligence and autonomy. The concept of maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS) has been put forward by the International Maritime Organization in 2017, in which MASS become the new focus of the waterborne transportation industry. This paper elaborates on the state-of-the-art research on motion control of MASS. Firstly, the characteristics and current research status of unmanned surface vessels in MASS and conventional ships are summarized, and the system composition of MASS is analyzed. In order to better realize the self-adaptability of the MASS motion control, the theory and algorithm of ship motion control-related systems are emphatically analyzed under the condition of classifying ship motion control. Especially, the application of intelligent algorithms in the ship control field is summarized and analyzed. Finally, this paper summarizes the challenges faced by MASS in the model establishment, motion control algorithms, and real ship experiments, and proposes the composition of MASS motion control system based on variable autonomous control strategy. Future researches on the accuracy and diversity of developments and applications to MASS motion control are suggested.

AB Providing autonomous systems with an effective quantity and quality of information from a desired task is challenging. In particular, autonomous vehicles, must have a reliable vision of their workspace to robustly accomplish driving functions. Speaking of machine vision, deep learning techniques, and specifically convolutional neural networks, have been proven to be the state of the art technology in the field. As these networks typically involve millions of parameters and elements, designing an optimal architecture for deep learning structures is a difficult task which is globally under investigation by researchers. This study experimentally evaluates the impact of three major architectural properties of convolutional networks, including the number of layers, filters, and filter size on their performance. In this study, several models with different properties are developed, equally trained, and then applied to an autonomous car in a realistic simulation environment. A new ensemble approach is also proposed to calculate and update weights for the models regarding their mean squared error values. Based on design properties, performance results are reported and compared for further investigations. Surprisingly, the number of filters itself does not largely affect the performance efficiency. As a result, proper allocation of filters with different kernel sizes through the layers introduces a considerable improvement in the performance. Achievements of this study will provide the researchers with a clear clue and direction in designing optimal network architectures for deep learning purposes.

AB Autonomous moving objects (AMOs), such as automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and autonomous robots, have been widely used in industry for decades. In an intelligent transport system with a great number of AMOs involved, it is desirable to maintain a smooth traffic flow of AMOs without congestion or deadlocks. Continuing our previous study, in this paper we propose a new algorithm for concurrent scheduling and routing of a great number (i.e., 4n(2)) of AMOs on an n x n mesh topology of path network. As a significant improvement compared with the previous algorithm, this new algorithm achieves 3n concurrent rectilinear steps of routing for all 4n(2) AMOs, while no congestion or deadlocks arise from them when all AMOs are moving around on the mesh topology. The theoretical analysis and calculations of the algorithm are verified by randomly generated data in our experiments.

AB Despite numerous studies demonstrating the effectiveness of restricted crossing U-turn (RCUT) intersection design, its implementation remains close to zero in some large states (e.g., California). The study included four locations on high-speed rural expressways (highways with partial access control) in California. The operational evaluation relies on microscopic simulation models of existing two-way stop-controlled (TWSC) intersections and alternate RCUT designs used to estimate network-wide performance measures. Two series of simulation scenarios were tested: (1) scenarios with no connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and (2) scenarios with different SAE International Level 4 CAV market penetration rates (MPRs) to help policymakers and practitioners in future planning strategies. The microsimulation models were also used to generate trajectory data to create a surrogate measure-based approach. Based on the results, the RCUT designs reduced or eliminated the more severe crossing conflicts. Similar vehicle travel times were identified in various CAV MPRs except for one of the locations with challenging geometric features, where travel time increased at higher CAV MPRs.

AB After reports of self-driving car accidents, public acceptance of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has shown a downward trend. To explore factors influencing this decline of acceptance and to bring acceptance back to the normal range, this study proposed a new factor, human-manipulated risk perception (HMRP), in the context of human-machine collaborative driving. On this basis, we explored the relationship between HMRP and acceptance of AVs and the mechanism of influence. Furthermore, we proposed a behavioral intervention approach to mediate and moderate the relationship between the two. First, an improved acceptance model was developed based on HMRP. Subsequently, a survey was executed, and 300 valid questionnaires were returned. Test results for the improved model showed that HMRP had a significant negative effect on acceptance of AVs. A hybrid model of mediation and moderation was designed, and user experience was introduced as a moderating variable. The results showed that the proposed behavioral intervention strategy was effective in attenuating the negative effect of HMRP on acceptance of AVs. This study provides theoretical support and methodological guidance for developing behavioral interventions to improve user acceptance.

Despite some contentions over specifics, the overall tenor of these commentaries is one of general agreement. One particular challenge, as noted, is how to disseminate our discipline's knowledge beyond the pages of our journals to effect the impact and change in the world to which we aspire. This is a challenge that transcends efforts solely associated with automated vehicles, but it may be in this specific realm that our science can offer its most widespread impact in the immediate, coming future.

AB Urban autonomous driving is a difficult task because of its complex road scenarios and the interaction between multiple vehicles. Autonomous vehicles need to balance multiple objectives in these complex scenarios, e.g., safety and speed. Traditional reinforcement learning methods deal with the multi-objective problem by optimizing agents with a single objective reward. However, these methods are sensitive to the reward scale and require huge experiments to design reward weights. In this paper, we propose the Lexicographical Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (LPPO), which can express people's preference relationship through the lexicographical ordering between objectives. The proposed method has two main advantages. On the one hand, LPPO has a smaller parameter adjustment space, which makes it easy to find the optimal solution that satisfies the actual problem preference. On the other hand, the proposed method is less affected by the reward scale and easy to deploy in various driving scenarios. We evaluate our algorithm in two driving simulation environments, and the results show that the proposed method has better performance in urban driving tasks than previous reinforcement learning algorithms. In addition, we illustrate that the proposed method has better stability even if the reward scale changes.

ID SCHEME
AB With ever-increasing penetration of autonomous driving vehicles (ADVs), security becomes of significant essence to autonomous vehicular networks (AVNs). On one hand, although cryptographic systems help deal with various attacks, they cannot resolve inside attacks from compromised or malfunctioning ADVs. On the other hand, ADVs with higher automated levels are easier to attack because the automated components onboard are vulnerable to inside attacks. These issues can be mitigated well by trust-based intrusion detection. Therefore,this article presents an efficient trust-based intrusion detection framework for AVNs. First, we propose a novel trust evaluation model for ADVs, in which all the trust evaluation information of a given ADV is utilized to compute its trust value. Then, based on the trust evaluation model, a two-level intrusion detection framework is presented. In the framework, the trustworthiness of an accident or attack warning is established not only based on trust evaluation with the coverage of a roadside unit (RSU), but also the information exchanged between RSUs through the cloud server. Afterward, we propose a reinforcement-learning-based incentive mechanism to stimulate ADVs to report warnings. Through the case study, the proposed framework outperforms the conventional mechanism and can reach a higher warning detection ratio than the conventional methods.

AB Integrating a fleet of electric vehicles (EVs) in the distribution system without a communication infrastructure exhibits several issues that need to be handled by electric utilities. Robust autonomous controllers are crucial in this case to manage the charging operation without violating the grid standard limits. This paper proposes a communication-free autonomous charging controller for EVs in distribution systems. The controller is based on fuzzy logic considering both the system voltage profile and the EV's battery state of charge (SOC). The fuzzy inference system is designed to avoid under voltage issues in the grid, flatten the system loading profile and accomplish fair charging among different EVs connected to the system. An 18-bus distribution system driven by the proposed controller was implemented in a simulation environment. The proposed controller performance was investigated under different distribution system operating conditions such as different loading, different levels of EV penetration, system reconfiguration as well as with distributed generation. In all cases, the controller demonstrated faster and better charging performance without violating the standard voltage limits compared to other research reported in the literature.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) applications have increased in popularity in recent years because of their ability to incorporate a wide variety of sensors while retaining cheap operating costs, easy deployment, and excellent mobility. However, controlling UAVs remotely in complex environments limits the capability of the UAVs and decreases the efficiency of the whole system. Therefore, many researchers are working on autonomous UAV navigation where UAVs can move and perform the assigned tasks based on their surroundings. With recent technological advancements, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) has proliferated. Autonomous UAV navigation is an example of an application in which AI plays a critical role in providing fundamental human control characteristics. Thus, many researchers have adopted different AI approaches to make autonomous UAV navigation more efficient. This paper comprehensively surveys and categorizes several AI approaches for autonomous UAV navigation implicated by several researchers. Different AI approaches comprise mathematical-based optimization and model-based learning approaches. The fundamentals, working principles, and main features of the different optimization-based and learning-based approaches are discussed in this paper. In addition, the characteristics, types, navigation models, and applications of UAVs are highlighted to make AI implementation understandable. Finally, the open research directions are discussed to provide researchers with clear and direct insights for further research.

AB Autonomous vehicles require in-depth knowledge of their surroundings, making path segmentation and object detection crucial for determining the feasible region for path planning. Uniform characteristics of a road portion can be denoted by segmentations. Currently, road segmentation techniques mostly depend on the quality of camera images under different lighting conditions. However, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors can provide extremely precise 3D geometry information about the surroundings, leading to increased accuracy with increased memory consumption and computational overhead. This paper introduces a novel methodology which combines LiDAR and camera data for road detection, bridging the gap between 3D LiDAR Point Clouds (PCs). The assignment of semantic labels to 3D points is essential in various fields, including remote sensing, autonomous vehicles, and computer vision. This research discusses how to select the most relevant geometric features for path planning and improve autonomous navigation. An automatic framework for Semantic Segmentation (SS) is introduced, consisting of four processes: selecting neighborhoods, extracting classification features, and selecting features. The aim is to make the various components usable for end users without specialized knowledge by considering simplicity, effectiveness, and reproducibility. Through an extensive evaluation of different neighborhoods, geometric features, feature selection methods, classifiers, and benchmark datasets, the outcomes show that selecting the appropriate neighborhoods significantly develops 3D path segmentation. Additionally, selecting the right feature subsets can reduce computation time, memory usage, and enhance the quality of the results.

AB With the increasing demands for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based autonomous inspections in the oil and gas industry, one of the challenging issues for 3-D UAV positioning has emerged due to the satellite signal blocking. Considering the existing characteristics of the ultrasonic-based technique, such as the low cost, extremely lightweight, and high positioning accuracy, it can be promising as the potential solution. Nevertheless, the low position update rate and vulnerable positioning performance to the changing environment still limit its applications on UAV. Therefore, in this article, an ultrasonic- and inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based localization algorithm and low-cost UAV autonomous inspection system are presented. With the incorporation of the IMU, the position update rate, accuracy, and stability of the algorithm can all be significantly improved. This is done by the adaptively estimated noise covariance matrices through the proposed adaptive extended Kalman filter algorithm and the added weighting factors. Followed by, an additional virtual observation process is presented to overcome the unavailability of the observation information for further performance improvement. Finally, extensive numerical results and field tests demonstrate that the proposed algorithm and system can achieve the high update rate, reliable, accurate, and precision UAV positioning in oil and gas pressure vessels and are feasible for the UAV autonomous inspection in these environments.

AB Provision of some autonomous functions to an agricultural vehicle would lighten the job of the operator but in doing so, the accuracy should not be lost to still obtain an optimal yield. Autonomous navigation of an agricultural vehicle involves the control of different dynamic subsystems, such as the yaw angle dynamics and the longitudinal speed dynamics. In this study, a proportional-integral-derivative controller is used to control the longitudinal velocity of the tractor. For the control of the yaw angle dynamics, a proportional-derivative controller works in parallel with a type-2 fuzzy neural network. In such an arrangement, the former ensures the stability of the related subsystem, while the latter learns the system dynamics and becomes the leading controller. In this way, instead of modeling the interactions between the subsystems prior to the design of a model-based control, we develop a control algorithm which learns the interactions online from the measured feedback error. In addition to the control of the stated subsystems, a kinematic controller is needed to correct the errors in both the x-and the y-axis for the trajectory tracking problem of the tractor. To demonstrate the real-time abilities of the proposed control scheme, an autonomous tractor is equipped with the use of reasonably priced sensors and actuators. Experimental results show the efficacy and the efficiency of the proposed learning algorithm.

AB Objective: It is of critical importance to develop socially sensitive vehicles that will enhance pedestrians' sense of comfort and safety. The current study is the first to extend these effects to vehicles, by investigating individual comfort distance in virtual reality with regard to vehicles that vary in terms of size, viewing angle and anthropomorphized emotional expression. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of individual differences in terms of height, anxiety and aggression.
   Method: Forty-four individuals were presented with three-dimensional stimuli of vehicle models differing in size and viewing angle in virtual reality and positioned them at the distance they felt the most comfortable with.
   Results: Our results show that individuals are more comfortable standing further from larger vehicles and when presented with the front versus the rear view of a vehicle. Moreover, the distance from vehicles was negatively associated with the height of the individuals.
   Conclusion: This paper suggests that it is important for designing self-driving and autonomous vehicles to consider that vehicle size and direction as well as pedestrian's height may impact the comfort distance felt by pedestrians. These data have clear implications for vehicle design, including self-driving and autonomous vehicles.
   What is already known:
   Individuals maintain larger distances when in front of individuals/agents than beside or behind them.
   Individuals provide greater physical space to larger agents (animals and/or humans).
   No previous study investigated the effect of vehicle size, view angle, and fascia on the comfort distance preferred by individuals as pedestrians.
   What it adds:
   Individuals are more comfortable standing further from larger vehicles.
   Individuals prefer to place more distance between themselves and a vehicle when seeing it from the front versus the rear.
   Shorter individuals adopt a larger distance from vehicles irrespective of vehicle size and viewing side.

AB The automation of typically intelligent and decision-making processes in the maritime industry leads to fewer accidents and more cost-effective operations. However, there are still lots of challenges to solve until fully autonomous systems can be employed. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has played a major role in this paradigm shift and shows great potential for solving some of these challenges, such as the docking process of an autonomous vessel. This work proposes a lightweight volumetric Convolutional Neural Network (vCNN) capable of recognizing different docking-based structures using 3D data in real-time. A synthetic-to-real domain adaptation approach is also proposed to accelerate the training process of the vCNN. This approach makes it possible to greatly decrease the cost of data acquisition and the need for advanced computational resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate an accuracy of over 90% in the recognition of different docking structures, using low resolution sensors. The inference time of the system was about 120ms on average. Results obtained using a real Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) demonstrated that the vCNN trained with the synthetic-to-real domain adaptation approach is suitable for maritime mobile robots. This novel AI recognition method, combined with the utilization of 3D data, contributes to an increased robustness of the docking process regarding environmental constraints, such as rain and fog, as well as insufficient lighting in nighttime operations.

AB The ability of an autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in an unknown environment is a prerequisite for its execution of complex tasks and is the main research direction in related fields. The autonomous navigation of UAVs in unknown environments requires solving the problem of autonomous exploration of the surrounding environment and path planning, which determines whether the drones can complete mission-based flights safely and efficiently. Existing UAV autonomous flight systems hardly perform well in terms of efficient exploration and flight trajectory quality. This paper establishes an integrated solution for autonomous exploration and path planning. In terms of autonomous exploration, frontier-based and sampling-based exploration strategies are integrated to achieve fast and effective exploration performance. In the study of path planning in complex environments, an advanced Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm combining the adaptive weights and dynamic step size is proposed, which effectively solves the problem of balancing flight time and trajectory quality. Then, this paper uses the Hermite difference polynomial to optimization the trajectory generated by the RRT algorithm. We named proposed UAV autonomous flight system as Frontier and Sampling-based Exploration and Advanced RRT Planner system (FSEPlanner). Simulation performs in both apartment and maze environment, and results show that the proposed FSEPlanner algorithm achieves greatly improved time consumption and path distances, and the smoothed path is more in line with the actual flight needs of a UAV.

ID SAFETY ASSESSMENT
AB This study aims to generate test cases for scenario-based assessment of automated driving systems (ADS) when encounter a cut-out maneuver where the lead vehicle having changed lanes, revealing a new lead vehicle that, in some cases, is slower than the original lead (the cutting-out) vehicle. We extracted the cut-out scenarios from an established real-world traffic dataset recorded by instrumented vehicles on Japanese highways and then defined them using vehicle kinematic parameters (velocities and distances). The extracted scenarios were analyzed based on the direct correlation between every two consecutive vehicles: a rear part that describes the correlation between the following vehicle and the cutting-out vehicle; and a frontal part that describes the correlation between the cutting-out vehicle and the preceding vehicle. Parameter ranges were quantified with a regression model and determined based on the risk acceptance threshold applied in the field of Japanese high-speed trains and annual exposure by professional highway drivers to produce a scenario space with a reasonably foreseeable range in which ADS may not produce crashes lest it performs worse than human drivers. A multi-dimensional distribution analytical approach was used to derive a correlation between the following and preceding vehicles considering the initial longitudinal velocities. Results suggest that when the time headway between the following vehicle and the cutting-out vehicle is equal to or more than 2 s, there should not have collision risks between the following vehicle and the preceding vehicle. These findings can help to understand normative driver behavior during cut-out scenarios and to generate accident-free scenario space for which ADS must perform flawlessly.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are utilized to improve the performance of wireless communication networks (WCNs), notably, in the context of Internet of Things (IoT). However, the application of UAVs, as active aerial base stations (BSs)/relays, is questionable in the fifth-generation (5G) WCNs with quasi-optic millimeter wave (mmWave) and beyond in 6G (visible light) WCNs. Because path loss is high in 5G/6G networks that attenuate, even, the Line-of-Sight (LoS) communicating signals propagated by UAVs. Besides, the limited energy/size/weight of UAVs makes it cost-deficient to design aerial multi-input/output BSs for active beamforming to strengthen the signals. Equipping UAVs with the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), a passive component, can help to address the problems with UAV-assisted communication in 5G and optical 6G networks. We propose adopting the RIS-equipped UAV (RISeUAV) to provide aerial LoS service and facilitate communication for mobile Internet-of-Vehicles (IoVs) in an obstructed dense urban area covered by 5G/6G. RISeUAV-aided wireless communication facilitates vehicle-to-vehicle/everything communication for IoVs for updating IoT information required for sensor fusion and autonomous driving. However, autonomous navigation of RISeUAV for this purpose is a multilateral problem and is computationally challenging for being optimally implemented in real time. We intelligently automated RISeUAV navigation using deep reinforcement learning to address the optimality and time complexity issues. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the method.

AB This article investigates the path-following control problem for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) subject to external disturbances and unknown model parameters. An event-triggered model-free adaptive control (ETMFAC) method is designed with a practical experimental platform. Firstly, a line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law is employed to obtain the desired heading angle for the AUV. Secondly, an improved model-free adaptive control method is used, in which an adaptive law is introduced to compensate for the effects caused by external disturbances. Subsequently, an event-triggering mechanism that can reduce the communication and calculation burden of the control system is proposed. As for the state mutation caused by variable disturbances, an adaptive triggering threshold is designed based on the state vector of the AUV to maintain satisfactory following performance. The stability of the control system is proved by theoretical analysis. Finally, both numerical simulations and practical experiments are conducted to evaluate the efficacy and prove the superiority of the proposed method.

AB In this paper, we consider trajectory tracking control for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) with unknown boundary model uncertainties and external disturbances. The neural networks (NNs) and the sliding mode control (SMC) with a switched adaptive law are combined for the first time. The NNs are used to approximate model uncertainties and external disturbances of ASVs. The parameters of the robust SMC term first increase until the sliding variable reaches a quasi sliding mode which bound is associated with the parameter of the barrier function (BF). Then the BF is selected as the parameter of the robust term for the SMC strategy to estimate the NN approximation error and to constrain the sliding variable inside the predefined quasi sliding mode. One salient feature of our approach is that the robust control parameter is no more than approximation error of NNs in sliding and steady phases of SMC. Simulation studies are performed to illustrate the advantage of the proposed control method.

AB Three dimensional object detection plays an important role in autonomous driving because it provides the 3-D locations of objects for subsequent use in decision-making modules. A novel method is proposed using a monocular image and cascade geometric constraints to achieve robust 3-D vehicle detection. The framework is divided into two stages. In the first stage, the monocular image input is processed using a heatmap-based detection network with five branches to regress the orientation, dimension, center projection of the bottom face, viewpoint classification, and 2-D bounding box. In the second stage, the intersection-over-union threshold is increased to filter out imprecise 2-D bounding boxes. Thereafter, cascade geometric constraints are used to obtain the final 3-D box output, which improves the detection performance under truncation and occlusion conditions. The proposed method is tested on the KITTI-3-D benchmark and is shown to be effective and efficient. The proposed framework does not depend on external sources or subnetworks and can be trained in an end-to-end manner.

AB Attaining the information of the hydrodynamic flow rate and direction is essential to the maneuvering of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). This work presents a pillar-based flow sensor that measures hydrodynamic flow rate and direction. We propose a design that mimic the working principle of the neuromast, a ubiquitous organ in fishes that sense the water flow. By utilizing advances in piezo-resistive pressure sensors and 3D printing technology, sensor fabrication becomes fast and cost-effective, owing to reductions in labor and material cost for small batches. Measured results showed that the sensor sensitivity was 9.24 mV/m/s in the single mode and 20.3 mV/m/s in the differential mode. The resolution of the flow sensor was measured to be 4.93 mm/s in the water tunnel testing. The angular resolution of the flow sensor was 2.25 degrees.

AB This paper focuses on vertical-plane trajectory tracking of an under-actuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) subject to actuator saturation and external disturbances. A successive guidance and control frame is designed to avoid the cascade analysis between the kinematics guidance and the dynamics control, and the complete Lyapunov function is chosen to analyze the asymptotic stability of trajectory tracking system. In the guidance loop, the line-of-sight guidance law is applied to trajectory tracking of AUVs, which transforms the depth tracking error into the elevation angle tracking error and solves the problem of the under-actuated configuration in heave. In the control loop, direct adaptive fuzzy control is adopted to compensate for the effect of actuator saturation, which guarantees the system stability of trajectory tracking in the presence of actuator saturation. Finally, comparative numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the robust and bounded performance of the designed trajectory tracking control system.

AB ObjectivesWith the growing market penetration of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), the interaction between conventional human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs will be inevitable. However, the effects of CAVs in mixed traffic streams have not been extensively studied in China. This study aims to quantify the changes in driving characteristics of an HDV while following a CAV compared to following another HDV and investigate the corresponding impact on traffic safety and the environment caused by these changes.MethodsFirstly, two scenarios were built on a driving simulation platform. In scenario 1, the driver follows a vehicle programmed to execute the speed profile of the HDV obtained from the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study (SH-NDS) project. In scenario 2, the driver follows a vehicle whose speed profile is calibrated according to the Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) follow-along theory. Secondly, the speed, acceleration, and headway of 30 individuals in each following scenario were analyzed. Speed and acceleration volatility (standard deviation, deviation rate) and time-to-collision (TTC) were selected as indexes to assess the safety impact. The emission and fuel consumption models were used to determine the environmental impact after being localized by the parameters.ResultsHDVs following CAVs exhibit less driving volatility in speed and acceleration, show remarkable improvements in TTC, consume less fuel, and produce fewer emissions on average.ConclusionsBy introducing CAVs into the road traffic system, traffic operation safety and environmental quality will be improved, with a more stable flow status, lower collision risk, and less air pollution.

AB A new class of Intelligent and Autonomous Vehicles (IAVs) has been designed in the framework of Intelligent Transportation for Dynamic Environment (InTraDE) project funded by European Union. This type of vehicles is technologically superior to the existing Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs), in many respects. They offer more flexibility and intelligence in maneuvering within confined spaces where the logistic operations take place. This includes the ability of pairing/unpairing enabling a pair of 1-TEU (20-foot Equivalent Unit) lAVs dynamically to join, transport containers of any size between 1-TEU and 1-FFE (40-foot Equivalent) and disjoin again. Deploying IAVs helps port operators to remain efficient in coping with the ever increasing volume of container traffic at ports and eliminate the need for deploying more 40-ft transporters in the very confined area of ports. In order to accommodate this new feature of IAVs, we review and extend one of the existing mixed integer programming models of AGV scheduling in order to minimize the makespan of operations for transporting a set of containers of different sizes between quay cranes and yard cranes. In particular, we study the case of Dublin Ferryport Terminal. In order to deal with the complexity of the scheduling model, we develop a Lagrangian relaxation-based decomposition approach equipped with a variable fixing procedure and a primal heuristics to obtain high-quality solution of instances of the problem.

AB Load-haul-dump (LHD) is the main equipment for mining and transportation in underground metal mines. Autonomous driving represents an essential role in the daily operation of LHD. Nowadays, LHD autonomous driving is based on the human driver's artificial teaching. However, it is not easy to obtain high quality teaching information for all the underground roadways in a mine, which not only affects the commissioning and deployment time of autonomous driving systems for LHD vehicles, but also not conducive to the full play of automation equipment performance, and finally impacts the production efficiency. Planning a high-quality target reference trajectory for LHD in the underground roadway is an effective way to overcome the above issues. This paper proposes an optimal trajectory planning method for LHD in turning maneuvers. This planning method is based on longitudinal and lateral decomposing, integrated sampling method, and optimization method. The contribution of this work lies in the 3D key factors search strategy design, the key parameters value range exploration and the reasonable key factor initial values design, which can improve the online execution ability of the algorithm and reduce the driving time of the LHD. The 3D key factors refer to the terminal state of the trajectory, which are longitudinal driving distance, the lateral driving distance, and travel time. The proposed method is simple and easy to implement. The initial values of the key factors are given, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is proved. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by the comparative analysis of a series of examples.

AB Autonomous racing is a high-performance, safety-critical task that inherently involves a high degree of uncertainty (especially in off-road unstructured environments), as driving conditions can vary and tire-terrain interactions are difficult to model accurately. On the one hand, the vehicle needs to drive fast while, on the other hand, it must avoid crashing, thus requiring a tradeoff between performance and safety. This work develops a stochastic model predictive controller (SMPC) for uncertain systems with additive Gaussian noise subject to state and control constraints and applies it to off-road autonomous racing. The proposed approach is based on the recently developed finite-horizon optimal covariance steering (CS) control theory, which steers the system state's mean and covariance to prescribed target values at a given terminal time. We show that the proposed CS-SMPC algorithm can deal with unbounded Gaussian additive noise while ensuring stability. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated via both numerical and experimental tests using a scaled autonomous racing platform, as well as on an actual full-size vehicle during a global positioning system (GPS)-denied autonomous driving task.

AB Achieving full autonomy in navigation is a complicated problem. The most widely used solution takes up the modular framework for sensing and information processing such as perception, mapping, control, planning and decision making. However, this approach misses the capability of environmental understanding. Hence, to achieve full autonomy in navigation a computing model with self-learning capability inspired by biological intelligence such as memorizing, inferring and experience update is essential for dynamic and noisy environments. Recent advanced sensing, communication and hardware miniaturization technologies achieved few autonomous operations in commercial systems but the full autonomy has not been attained yet. In this paper, the effect of precise and accurate localization for autonomous navigation technologies is extensively studied and the problems and limitations of the related algorithms are analyzed. The major limitations for precise localization are computational complexity, sensor noise and communication delays. These limitations further reduce perception and planning capabilities of autonomous navigation systems. From this study, the future prospects are outlined to achieve a higher level of autonomy by precise localization.

AB An autonomous underwater helicopter (AUH) is a type of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that is capable of fixed-point hovering, precise and free take-off, and landing. It is effective for underwater ultra-mobile tasks, including mobile observation networks, resource exploration, and data connection. This paper aims to investi-gate an AUH trajectory tracking controller based on the prescribed performance method, considering the in-fluence factors such as current disturbance, modeling uncertainty and thruster faults. A novel preset time performance function is designed in which the stable terminal time of the system can be specified explicitly, and the convergence rate of the system's dynamic process may be altered by adjusting the parameters, making it more intuitive for the designer. A speed observer was introduced to address this problem of measuring the required state information from the AUH's sensors in practice, which was enhanced using a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) to approximate external perturbations and uncertainties. The stability of the closed -loop AUH system is proved by using Lyapunov theory. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algo-rithm proposed approach were eventually verified by two sets of simulations for different thruster fault forms.

AB Autonomous vehicles empowered by emerging automation technologies are highly anticipated to be introduced into public transit service operations in the future mobility system. Considering the low acceptance rate of the new service with autonomous buses when it is initially put into practice, it is not ideal to make a "one-off"deployment to replace all the service lines with autonomous bus services. Rather, the service operator is to determine an optimal plan for the deployment of autonomous buses onto different service lines in multiple stages. This paper proposes a multi-stage mathematical modeling framework to optimize the deployment strategy in which conventional buses are sequentially replaced by autonomous buses. More specifically, the model decides when (at which planning stage) and where (on which service line in the network) the deployment of autonomous buses should be conducted. Passengers' acceptance attitudes towards autonomous buses are explicitly considered in their transit routing choices. To forecast the evolution of the passengers' adoption rate of the autonomous bus service, a diffusion model is applied. The proposed multi-stage planning model framework, which is indeed a mixed-integer nonlinear program, is to determine the optimal deployment strategy that minimizes the total travel cost during the planning horizon. A two-phase solution method that combines a searching algorithm and a double projection method is proposed to solve the model. Finally, numerical studies are conducted to test the validity of the modeling framework and solution method. The impacts of passengers' adoption rate and other parameters on the deployment strategy are illustrated.

We first experimentally study traffic patterns using two connected human-driven vehicles, which are equipped with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, and a connected automated vehicle, which is able to respond to V2V information and control its longitudinal motion. Our experimental results indicate the long-range feedback may benefit traffic flow and that car-following models with delay are able to replicate the experimental results. The data fitted models are used in simulations for a 100-car network to study traffic dynamics with partial penetration of connected automated vehicles.

AB Detection and tracking surrounding moving obstacles such as vehicles and pedestrians are crucial for the safety of mobile robotics and autonomous vehicles. This is especially the case in urban driving scenarios. This paper presents a novel framework for surrounding moving obstacles detection using binocular stereo vision. The contributions of our work are threefold. Firstly, a multiview feature matching scheme is presented for simultaneous stereo correspondence and motion correspondence searching. Secondly, the multiview geometry constraint derived from the relative camera positions in pairs of consecutive stereo views is exploited for surrounding moving obstacles detection. Thirdly, an adaptive particle filter is proposed for tracking of multiple moving obstacles in surrounding areas. Experimental results from real-world driving sequences demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to improve safety by reducing and mitigating traffic accidents. They can also provide opportunities to reduce transportation energy consumption and emissions by improving traffic flow. Vehicle communication with traffic structures and traffic lights can allow individual vehicles to optimize their operation and account for unpredictable changes. This paper summarizes the developments and the research trends in coordination with the CAVs that have been reported in the literature to date. Remaining challenges and potential future research directions are also discussed.

AB This paper introduces the definition of an autonomous valet parking system, standardization trends, processes designed to implement the system. Autonomous valet parking is a system in which a vehicle can be parked in a parking space without a user, and can also be moved to a specific location when the user wants to. The autonomous valet parking system is being developed by dividing it into search driving process, autonomous parking process, and return driving process. Currently, the autonomous valet parking system can demonstrate the entire parking process in a specific scenario. However, there are limitations, i.e., the system requires high costs, and some technologies do not show stable results. In this paper, we have highlighted the problems that should be solved to complete the autonomous valet parking system and the technologies for solving these problems. From this paper, researchers will be able to learn about the technical aspects and the developmental direction of the autonomous valet parking system.

AB The provision of frequency containment reserves (FCR) by electric vehicles in an autonomous port transportation system is a way to stabilize power grid frequency. However, the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) service's additional charging processes lead to faster degradation of vehicles' batteries. How much the FCR provision affects battery life (BLD) and what degradation costs are incurred depends on specific application conditions. Therefore, this study demonstrates the application of a V2G system for a port container terminal. In the analysis, vehicles' charging processes with and without FCR provision are simulated within the degradation model developed for this case, and relevant degradation factors are determined by applying the Rain-Flow Counting (RFC) method. Overall, three degradation models are discussed concerning their fit for the case at hand. Results indicate that Cycle-Count Models best represent battery degradation, showing an increase in battery degradation of 1.36% through the use for FCR. This supports improved business case simulations to enable two-sided sustainability models by stabilizing the electric grid and enabling electric transportation in ports simultaneously.

SO IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS

DT Article
ID GENERATION; PREDICTION; VEHICLE
AB Driving in interactive dynamic traffic is a huge challenge for autonomous vehicles, especially for motion planning. The autonomous vehicle not only needs to predict the future states of the social vehicles to avoid a collision but also realizes the comfort and continuous plan. To deal with the problem, a spatio-temporal decision-making and motion planning framework with flexible constraints based on previous work is proposed. Improvements can be highlighted in three aspects. First, a neural network for trajectory prediction is trained and it is integrated into the framework, which can learn the social vehicles' reactions in the negotiation better and give more accurate predictions. Second, instead of setting the fixed local targets, the flexible-constraint mechanism is introduced to increase the success rate of continuous planning, specifically, the local planning target is determined conditioned on the situation with an elastic factor. Third, two popular simulators with randomly disposed traffic participants are exploited, where vehicles are mutually influenced, more similar to real-world traffic. The closed-loop tests with zero crashes and the comparative experiments with traditional models demonstrate the superior performance and practical significance of the proposed framework.

DE autonomous underwater vehicle; underwater human-robot interaction;
   gesture recognition; visual-textual association
AB The marine environment presents a unique set of challenges for human-robot interaction. Communicating with gestures is a common way for interacting between the diver and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). However, underwater gesture recognition is a challenging visual task for AUVs due to light refraction and wavelength color attenuation issues. Current gesture recognition methods classify the whole image directly or locate the hand position first and then classify the hand features. Among these purely visual approaches, textual information is largely ignored. This paper proposes a visual-textual model for underwater hand gesture recognition (VT-UHGR). The VT-UHGR model encodes the underwater diver's image as visual features, the category text as textual features, and generates visual-textual features through multimodal interactions. We guide AUVs to use image-text matching for learning and inference. The proposed method achieves better performance than most existing purely visual methods on the dataset CADDY, demonstrating the effectiveness of using textual patterns for underwater gesture recognition.

AB This paper addresses the crucial issues of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs), that is, smooth and accurate path following, especially when input constraints and external disturbances exist. A nonlinear H & INFIN; control scheme is proposed based on the neural network (NN) and policy iteration (PI) algorithm. Firstly, a nonlinear system model for path following of AGVs is constructed, which takes vehicular nonlinear cornering behavior into account. Then, a nonlinear H infinity controller is designed based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation. Wherein, the established NN is leveraged to approximate the HJI equation's performance function, and the PI algorithm is developed to learn the solution to the HJI equation. Finally, the convergence and closed-loop stability of the proposed strategy are demonstrated. Simulation results show that the proposed controller can significantly improve the response speed, driving smoothness and accuracy of path following in high-speed driving condition with strong robustness against external disturbances.

AB This study investigated a less explored autonomous vehicle (AV) related topic (non-motorists and AVs) through the following two research questions: (1) Does the perception towards AVs differ in non-motorists based on stakeholder nature? and (2) Does prior interaction with AVs alter perception on AVs? The present study examined survey data collected by BikePGH in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This study used multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) to identify the response patterns of participants and sort the responses into several clusters. The results show that perception measures vary among participants based on the nature of the stakeholder. The reception of AVs among the participants was mixed. The results also show that participants with real AV interactions have higher expectations and interest in AVs than the participants with no experience. Additionally, the findings show that participants who see no safety potentials for AVs are also against using Pittsburgh as an AV proving ground. It is anticipated that the results will help in improving the strategic management of AVs to make non-motorist mobility safer.

AB One novel nonlinear guidance law for guiding autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to track desired waypoints in three-dimensional (3D) space with a nonlinear proportional derivative (PD) control structure is developed in this investigation. This approach can be applied to generate optimal control commands for AUVs operating in ocean environment. The design objective of this investigation is to develop a nonlinear guidance law, which guarantees the stability and convergence of tracking errors in positions and attitudes with respect to the highly coupled AUV's dynamics and kinematics. In general, it is really a difficult mission to treat this nonlinear waypoint-tracking problem of AUVs due to the high nonlinearity and the time-varying property of the controlled AUV's dynamics. Fortunately, because of the coordinate transformation and selection of the control gain, the mentioned nonlinear waypoint-tracking problem of AUVs can be effectively solved, and a promising waypoint tracking capability can be obtained for AUVs.

AB This study introduces a vision guidance system for the terminal underwater docking of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) using one camera and one light. The configuration of this docking system, including an overview of the AUV and the docking station, is proposed. A detailed description of the vision guidance system is then provided. Four stages, namely, image acquisition, binarization of the captured images, elimination of noisy luminaries, and estimation of the relative position, constitute the image processing procedure. A tracking control algorithm based on the position of the dock center in the image coordinate obtained through image processing has been proposed. This algorithm can guide the AUV to the docking station without requiring distance information. A pool trial has been conducted at night to validate the proposed algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the vision guidance system despite the initial lateral deviation of up to 8 m. This paper ends with an analysis of the advantages and defects of this vision guidance system and proposes future works.

AB Building initial trust is critical for the acceptance of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). Initial trust determines whether this emerging mobility solution will be accepted when it is available in the market. This study examines the initial trust formation process in the context of SAVs using the elaboration likelihood model and trust transfer theory. It investigates the effects of different personality-based, transfer-based, and performance-based factors on initial trust and adoption intention. A structural equation modelling is conducted in Singapore based on valid survey design principles, sampling protocols, and data analysis procedures. Results show that among three trustbuilding paths, the performance-based factors which include SAV capability and interaction quality are the most important. The transfer-based (i.e., trust in shared mobility) and personalitybased factor (i.e., trust propensity) rank second and third, respectively. Six moderators such as covid history and shared mobility experience are also tested to investigate significant differences in the results. Based on these findings, this study offers theoretical and policy implications for scholars and practitioners.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) offer the opportunity to achieve safe, efficient, accessible, affordable and productive transportation, while also enhancing the mobility of vulnerable groups. Nevertheless, the benefits associated with AVs can only be realized when the mass public have the intention to make use of this technology. This study aims to examine the impacts of several factors on general acceptance of AVs including perceived AV motion sickness, willingness to use time more efficiently in an AV, perceived value of time and perceived risk using private SAE Level-5 AVs, as well as the interrelationships between these factors. Using a sample of 1,418 respondents, partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to test the proposed structural model. Results revealed that perceived value of time, perceived risk and willingness to use time more efficiently in an AV significantly affected the behavioral intention. Results from multi-group analysis showed that participant age also played a role in behavioral intention via the perceived value of time. It is hoped that the findings of this study can help AV policymakers and developers better understand the role that the studied factors play in shaping public intentions to use AVs.

AB Intersections have been identified as the most complex and accident-prone traffic scenarios on road. Making appropriate decisions at intersections for driving safety, efficiency, and comfort become a challenging task for autonomous vehicles (AVs). The existing research on AV decision-making at intersections either considers a single scenario only with discrete behaviour outputs or ignores the requirements for driving efficiency and comfort. To address these problems, this study proposed a deep reinforcement learning based continuous decision-making method to make AVs drive through intersections. The proposed method establishes an end-to-end decision-making framework by using a convolutional neural network to map the relationship between traffic images and vehicle operations. The interaction between the AV and other vehicles was modelled as a Markov decision process (MDP), and a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm was employed to solve the MDP problem and obtain the optimal driving policy. The top three accident-prone crossing path crash scenarios at intersections were realized in CARLA to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrated that the developed method could provide effective policies to ensure driving safety and efficiency while considering driving comfort for autonomous driving at intersections in all the examined scenarios.

AB This study presents a linear parameter varying (LPV) approach for the lateral control of autonomous vehicles, in order to take into account the whole operating domain of longitudinal speeds, as well as the variation of the look-ahead distance. Combining a dynamical vehicle model with look-ahead dynamics, together with an identified actuator model including an input delay, the closed-loop performances can be achieved and the tracking capabilities can be improved for every speed. This is obtained in particular through ad hoc representation of the look-ahead time as a parameter-dependent function. An H-infinity LPV control problem is formulated considering parameter-dependent weighting functions, allowing the control adaptation for all speeds. The synthesis is performed using the gridding approach, in order to account for varying parameter rate. The proposed steering control system has been implemented on a real electric Renault Zoe car. The performances are therefore assessed experimentally on a real test track with a varying longitudinal speed profile, and compared with a classical LPV polytopic controller, which proves the advanced lane-tracking capabilities of the proposed methodology.

ID UNCERTAIN NONLINEAR-SYSTEMS
AB In this article, an adaptive asymptotic tracking control approach is first proposed for the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) on the horizontal plane by using the Bernstein polynomial approximation. Bernstein polynomials aim to compensate for the synthetical uncertainties including unknown model dynamics and envi-ronmental disturbances. However, they cannot be directly used due to the unknown polynomial coefficients. To avoid this trouble, the adaptive backstepping technique is applied to estimation. Considering that the adaptive backstepping can only procure the bounded steady tracking errors and suffer from the redundancy of adaptive parameters, we further integrate the sigma-modification and the minimum learning parameter (MLP) technique with the Bernstein polynomial approximation, so as to guarantee the high-precision tracking performance of AUVs with the asymptotic convergent tracking errors and less computation burden. The direct Lyapunov's method and the Barbalat's lemma are introduced for proving the stability of the control system. Finally, simulation reveals the advantage of the proposed scheme.

AB The hydrodynamic characteristics of a disk-shaped Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) cruising near the free water surface were investigated using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. Factors such as the cruising velocity, cursing depth, wave height, and wavelength were considered. The free surface changed the hydrodynamic force applied on the disk-shaped AUV mainly by altering the flowing velocity near the hull. A small cruising depth led to the disturbance of the free surface, which in turn generated additional resistance on the AUH hull. Therefore, the mean resistance and its fluctuation increased. Considering waves occurring at the surface, the evolution of the wave could affect the local flowing velocity around the hull, and therefore, alter the hydrodynamic characteristics of the AUV. Both the wave height and wave length affected the fluctuation amplitude of the hydrodynamic properties of the AUV as well as the time-averaged properties.

AB An optimization-based approach for collision avoidance of fully dimensional autonomous vehicles in confined environments is considered. We discuss the dual re-formulations of indicator, distance, and signed distance functions which yield an exact re-formulation of the usually nonlinear, noncontinuously differentiable respective original formulations. Embedding the resulting dual collision avoidance constraints to a model predictive control (MPC) problem induces additional decision variables, which greatly increases problem complexity. Therefore, a culling procedure is combined with the dual approach to reduce the problem size by identifying and eliminating decision variables associated with faces of the polyhedral obstacles and the controlled vehicle, respectively. Three culling conditions are proposed, namely, frustum, occlusion, and backface culling. The proposed method is illustrated using a simulative study where a path-following task is performed for a ship autopilot model, and near-field obstacle information is extracted based on a set of automatic identification system (AIS) data from the Kiel canal.

AB In this paper, we explore the potential for a partial integration of private and public transportation as provided by taxi and bus services on the level of individual trips. While these modes are typically separated for economic reasons, in the future with shared Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) providing cheap and efficient transportation services, such distinctions will blur. Consequently, optimization based on real-time data will allow exploiting parallels in demand in a dynamic way, such as the proposed approach in the current work. New operational and pricing strategies will then need to be considered, along with regulatory tools to limit congestion, encourage sharing and provide services in a more sustainable way by utilizing a dynamic landscape of urban transportation. In the current work, we evaluate existing parallels between individual bus and taxi trips in two Asian cities and show how exploiting these synergies could form the basis of achieving some of the above goals in the future.

AB In this paper, a finite-time extended state observer-based nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control (NFTSMC) is proposed for the trajectory tracking of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with various hydrodynamic uncertainties and external disturbances. First, a proportional-integral velocity variable based third-order fast finite-time extended state observer is designed to estimate the lumped uncertainties and their first derivatives. The concepts of finite-time stability and a new proposition are utilized to prove the finite-time uniformly ultimately boundness of the proposed observer. Then, based on the disturbance estimation, an NFTSMC is developed for AUVs. The inverse tangent function and linear control term are used to provide robustness against estimation error and avoid chattering in the thrusters. The position and attitude trajectories are proved to be fast finite-time stable via the Lyapunov theorem. To verify the theoretical analysis, comparative numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

TI Navigation Method for Underwater Vehicles Based on Mutual Acoustical
   Positioning With a Single Seafloor Station
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE Acoustical mutual measurements; autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV);
   vehicle navigation; particle filter
ID LOCALIZATION; SYSTEM
AB In this paper, we propose a novel navigation method for underwater vehicles based on a single seafloor station (SS), with which the vehicles can estimate their positions and orientations with respect to the SS without the need of expensive inertial navigation system or time-consuming calibration. This method is suitable for near-seafloor applications requiring real-time and accurate positioning, such as seafloor imaging and sampling. The method is also suitable for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) since no other external aid is necessary other than SS. The key idea is to utilize mutual acoustical measurements between the vehicle and the SS. Simply explained: 1) the vehicle starts by interrogating the SS acoustically and measures the range between the two units as well as the bearing of the SS with respect to the vehicle in the vehicle reference frame; and then, 2) the SS computes the bearing of the vehicle with respect to the SS and transmits this information back to the vehicle using a similar acoustical device. By combining this information and inputting it into a nonlinear filter structure that includes measurements of the vehicle's ground velocity and yaw angular velocity, the vehicle computes its position and heading estimates. A pair of acoustical devices named acoustical localization and communication (ALOC) devices that can communicate and calculate their relative positions have been built. Sea trials were carried out in October 2011 using the AUV Tri-Dog1 (TD) and a trial SS at Kagoshima Bay in Japan. The AUV successfully navigated around the SS based on the measurements of the ALOC device mounted on both the AUV and the SS. The performance of the method was verified through simulations based on the experimental results.

TI Joint optimization of scheduling and capacity for mixed traffic with
   autonomous and human-driven buses: A dynamic programming approach

AB It is a common practice for transit lines with fluctuating passenger demands to use demand-driven bus scheduling to reduce passenger waiting time and avoid bus overcrowding. However, current literature on the demand-driven bus scheduling generally assumes fixed bus capacity and exclusively optimizes bus dispatch headways. With the advent of connected and autonomous vehicle technology and the introduction of autonomous minibus/shuttle, the joint design of bus capacity and dispatch headway holds promises to further improving the system efficiency while reducing operating and passenger costs. This paper formulates this problem as an integer nonlinear programming model for transit systems operating with mixed human-driven and autonomous buses. In such mixed operating environment, the model simultaneously considers: (1) dynamic capacity design of autonomous bus, i.e., autonomous buses with varying capacity can be obtained by assembling and/or dissembling multiple autonomous minibuses; (2) trajectory control of autonomous bus, i.e., autonomous bus can dynamically adjust its running time as a function of its forward and backward headways; and (3) stop-level passenger boarding and alighting behavior. The objective of the model is designed to balance the trade-off between the operating costs of dispatching different types of bus and the costs of increased passenger waiting time due to inadequate bus dispatching. The model is solved using a dynamic programming approach. We show that the proposed model is effective in reducing passenger waiting time and total operating cost. Sensitivity analysis is further conducted to explore the impact of miscellaneous factors on optimal dispatching decisions, such as penetration rate of autonomous bus, bus running time variation, and passenger demand level.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are an emerging technology predicted to become available to the public over the next several decades. CAVs offer a range of potential benefits to the driver and broader society including reducing road trauma, decreasing traffic congestion, and offering new mobility choices. However, there is uncertainty regarding uptake of this new technology. If users do not see the value in the technology, it is unlikely to be fully adopted and the potential benefits of CAVs will not be realised. One commonly used instrument to investigate user acceptance of new technology is the Technology Readiness Index (TRI). The TRI has been used to investigate intentions to use CAVs in various countries, however no such study has been undertaken in Finland. As such the aim of this research was to investigate technology readiness and intentions to use conditionally automated vehicles amongst Finnish residents.
   A total of 384 participants (M = 46.9yrs; SD = 14.9yrs, 24.5 % female) completed a survey consisting of the TRI 2.0, demographics, car ownership, driving information and intentions to use conditionally automated vehicles. A multilinear regression was conducted to examine the factors that influence self-reported intentions to use a conditionally automated vehicle. When controlling for the other variables, Optimism and Insecurity were significantly associated with intentions to use a conditionally automated vehicle. Optimism had a positive correlation, with stronger intentions to use a conditionally automated vehicle among those who were more optimistic towards technology. Participants with lower levels of insecurity, that is, those who felt more secure with technology, also had stronger intentions to use a conditionally automated vehicle. The other significant variable in the model was previous experience with a CAV which had a significant positive relationship.
   The study adds to the existing literature regarding CAV adoption and provides added insight within a Finnish context of how exposure to technology and the factors of the TRI can influence intentions to use conditionally automated vehicles.

AB The risky lane-changing manoeuvre of vehicles often occurs at expressway entrances, which would result in a high crash risk in the freeway system and significantly impact its safety. The highly anticipated environment of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is expected to reduce the associated crash risk of lane changing by offering various types of driving support, which utilise surrounding traffic information. The modelling crash risk under the environment of CAV driving during mandatory lane changing in merging areas faces new challenges due to the novelty of CAVs and subsequent shortage of data. To explore such risk situation of multi-vehicle interaction at expressway entrances, this study proposed a supervised learning algorithm and a Bayesian hier-archical model to assess risk levels and predict the probability of risk occurrence at different risk levels of interactive vehicles in real time of mandatory driving behaviour during the merging process. The learning al-gorithm, based on XGBoost, was exploited to classify risk levels. The Bayesian hierarchical model was used to analyse the probability of real-time risk comprising vehicle physical state layer, multi-vehicle interaction layer and risk probability layer. The probabilistic model parameters were calibrated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Gibbs sampling method. The K-fold cross validation method was used to validate the proposed model of risk level. The probabilistic model validity was tested through posterior prediction of P-value. The quantitative risk estimation of CAVs through a few merging cases was conducted. Results show that the identification ac-curacy of slight, low, moderate and high risk is 94.24%, 85.82%, 84.16% and 79.69%, respectively. The P-value of Durbin-Watson's posterior, normal hypothesis, test distribution symmetry and kurtosis are all close to 0.5. Therefore, the method of real-time risk assessment is convergent and has good fitting. This research can promote cautious driving behaviours and provide reference for driver's decision making in the long term under the environment of CAVs.

   multicopter flock; self-propelled flocking; swarm flight
AB In this study, we propose a decentralized mathematical model for predictive control of a system of multi-autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones. Being decentralized and autonomous implies that all members make their own decisions and fly depending on the dynamic information received from other unmanned aircraft in the area. We consider a variety of realistic characteristics, including time delay and communication locality. For this flocking flight, we do not possess control for central data processing or control over each UAV, as each UAV runs its collision avoidance algorithm by itself. The main contribution of this work is a mathematical model for stable group flight even in adverse weather conditions (e.g., heavy wind, rain, etc.) by adding Gaussian noise. Two of our proposed variance control algorithms are presented in this work. One is based on a simple biological imitation from statistical physical modeling, which mimics animal group behavior; the other is an algorithm for cooperatively tracking an object, which aligns the velocities of neighboring agents corresponding to each other. We demonstrate the stability of the control algorithm and its applicability in autonomous multi-drone systems using numerical simulations.

AB Rear-wheel steering has seen new popularity in recent years. Many explanations of rear-wheel steering systems use the concept of a 'virtual wheel base' to explain in-phase or out-of-phase steering. This paper introduces a novel reference model that realises this metaphor. A reference model is created where its wheelbase can be changed arbitrarily, making the resulting system intuitive and simpler to design and tune. This augments the properties of the reference model whose signals are used for a feedback control system. The real vehicle tracks these signals using active front and rear-wheel steering. This system can be implemented in a vehicle using steer-by-wire or an autonomous vehicle for control. A MIMO controller is derived and results show that the system operates as intended. Finally, a control law is proposed to change the virtual wheelbase using the road curvature. It is shown that it has advantages over conventional rear-wheel steering control.

AB With the advent of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), we observe a growing need for new resource allocation solutions in mobile networks. Currently, most of the resource allocation solutions for CAVs communication do not consider the driving routes of the cars. In this paper, we introduce joint vehicular route selection and radio and computing resource allocation for CAVs. The proposed approach is based on the graph search-based lexicographic A* algorithm that minimizes the ratio of failed tasks along the entire vehicular route considering the availability of both radio and computing resources. To manage the allocation of resources among multiple CAVs for each vehicular route, we develop a blockchain-based framework allowing resource reservation by means of nonfungible tokens (NFTs). Each NFT represents an exclusive right to the required amount of radio and computing resources for the given road segment and defined time interval. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by simulations showing that the proposed vehicular route selection algorithm reduces the ratio of tasks not completed before the deadline by up to 69% compared to the existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB This article addresses the problem of distributed path following of multiple under-actuated autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) with completely unknown kinetic models. An integrated distributed guidance and learning control architecture is proposed for achieving a time-varying formation. Specifically, a robust distributed guidance law at the kinematic level is developed based on a consensus approach, a path-following mechanism, and an extended state observer. At the kinetic level, a model-free kinetic control law based on data-driven neural predictors via integral concurrent learning is designed such that the kinetic model can be learned by using recorded data. The advantage of the proposed method is two-folds. First, the proposed formation controllers are able to achieve various time-varying formations without using the velocities of neighboring vehicles. Second, the proposed control law is model-free without any parameter information on kinetic models. Simulation results substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed robust distributed guidance and model-free control laws for multiple under-actuated ASVs with fully unknown kinetic models.

AB Trajectory Following Control (TFC) and lateral stability control are always significant for Autonomous Ground Vehicles (AGVs). However, sometimes it is quite a challenge to achieve excellent tracking performance with less stability loss. In this paper, a novel two-agent non-cooperative game framework is built to explore the coordination approach of the integrated TFC and Direct Yaw Control (DYC) issue. Then the game theory-based control strategies are proposed and two information patterns are investigated. In the open-loop case, the Nash equilibrium of each control cycle is determined by solving discrete-time Riccati equations. When it comes to the closed-loop pattern, the game complexity increases because each player can revise his own game strategy according to the other players' strategy evolution, and thus the dynamic programming method based on the Bellman's principle is applied to derive the control strategies. Besides, a Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) method is adopted to facilitate the process of discretizing the state-space model in every control cycle. Finally, simulation tests based on Carsim-Simulink joint platform and experimental tests are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

ID UNDERACTUATED AUVS; NAVIGATION; TRACKING
AB Reliable navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) depends on the quality of their state estimation. Providing robust velocity estimation thus plays an important role. While water currents are main contributors to the navigational uncertainty of AUVs, they are also an important variable for oceanographic research. For both reasons, water current estimation is desirable during AUV operations. State of the art velocity estimation relies on expensive acoustic sensors with considerable energy requirements and a large form factor such as Doppler Velocity Logs (DVL) and Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP), while water currents are either estimated with the same sensors, or with algorithms that require accurate position feedback. In this letter, we introduce a low-cost, lightweight and energy efficient sensor (DPSSv2) to estimate fluid relative velocity in 2D based on differential pressure. The sensor is validated in field trials on-board an AUV in the presence of tidal currents. We further show that, while moving against the currents, our device is capable of estimating tidal currents in situ with comparable accuracy to a DVL, given a source for absolute vehicle velocity. Additionally, we establish the limitations of the current design of DPSSv2 while moving with the currents.

AB A monitoring mission to study the shape and estimate initial dilution of the S. Jacinto outfall plume using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) was performed on July 30, 2002. In order to reduce the uncertainty about plume location and to concentrate the vehicle mission only in the hydrodynamic mixing zone, outputs of a near-field prediction model, based on effective real-time in situ measurements of current speed and direction and density stratification, were opportunistically used to specify in real time the mission transects. The surface characteristics of the outfall plume were found to be influenced strongly by the relatively weak stratification and low current velocities. Dilution was estimated using a tempera tu re-salinity (TS-) diagram with initial mixing lines between wastewater and ambient waters. Effluent dilutions were at least 30:1 in this study. In order to efficiently map the plume dispersion we applied the least-squares collocation method technique. Our results demonstrate that AUVs can provide high-quality measurements of physical properties of effluent plumes in a quite effective manner and valuable considerations about the initial mixing processes under real oceanic conditions can be further investigated.

AB Decentralized control of an autonomous automated guided vehicle system (AGVS) used for material handling is expected to lead to high system flexibility and robustness. A complete control methodology for decentralized autonomous AGVS control was developed and implemented in a computer-integrated manufacturing environment. The methodology addresses all aspects of AGVS functionality: system management, navigation and load transfer. Hierarchical fuzzy behaviour-based control, a reactive navigation scheme, was expanded to multirobot control in semistructured environments by incorporating a priori path optimization and right-of-the-way determination.

AB This paper investigates the surge speed tracking control of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) subject to fully unknown internal dynamic, external disturbance, and unknown control input gain. An adaptive anti-disturbance sampling control method is proposed for an ASV without using any model parameters. Specifically, by utilizing real-time and historical data, discrete-time reduced-order and full-order concurrent learning extended state observers (CLESOs) are designed to estimate the unknown ASV model parameters and ensure estimation convergence without requiring persistent excitation. Then, a surge speed tracking control law is designed based on the discrete-time full-order CLESO. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, the closed-loop system is proven to be stable, and the estimation and tracking errors are bounded. Simulation and hardware-in-loop experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed discrete-time CLESOs for the surge speed tracking of an ASV with fully unknown dynamic model.

AB This study proposes an approach for real-time road network safety analysis using autonomous vehicles (AVs) generated data. The approach utilises a Bayesian hierarchical spatial random parameter extreme value model (BHSRP). The model simultaneously addresses the scarcity and non-stationarity of conflict extremes and unobserved spatial heterogeneity. Two real-time safety metrics are estimated: the risk of crash (RC) and return level (RL). The RC and RL were applied to three months AVs data for evaluating the real-time safety level of an urban corridor in Palo Alto, California. The indicator time to collision (TTC) was used to characterise traffic conflicts. The conflict extreme was defined as the maxima of negated TTC in a 20-min interval (block). The results show that RC can differentiate the block-level risk level, while RL can reflect safety levels among blocks. For the RC, the hot (crash risk prone) segments and intersections are associated with more severe conflict frequency.

AB This paper investigates fault-tolerant tracking control problem for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with rudders faults and ocean current disturbance. The adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) method is adopted to transform the fault-tolerant tracking control problem into an optimal control problem. Two neural-network estimators (NNEs) are designed to estimate rudders faults and ocean current disturbance respectively. The estimated rudders faults and the estimated ocean current disturbance are utilized to construct the performance index function. By using policy iteration (PI), critic neural network and action neural network are constructed to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. The error tracking system of AUV is guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) based on the Lyapunov stability theorem. Simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness of the control scheme proposed in this paper. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This letter is on cooperative localization and sea currents estimation using multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). Due to sea currents, dead reckoning localization based on inertial navigation sensors results in accumulation of localization error. To reduce the error accumulation, this letter proposes navigation algorithm to allow multiple AUVs to simultaneously estimate their navigation states and unknown sea currents. This letter introduces the fusion of Unscented Kalman filter and linear Kalman filter for joint estimation of the navigation states and unknown sea currents. Suppose that only one AUV, called the leader, is equipped with Doppler Velocity Logs (DVL) and Ultra Short Base Line (USBL) sensors. To improve the localization of multiple AUVs, the leader measures both the bearing and the range of its nearby AUV periodically. As far as we know, this manuscript is unique in considering cooperative localization of multiple AUVs in unknown currents. The effectiveness of this cooperative localization is verified using MATLAB simulations.

AB This narrative is a personal account of my evolution as a student of phytoplankton and the ocean. Initially I focused on phytoplankton nutrient physiology and uptake, later switching to photosynthetic physiology Better models of photosynthesis naturally require a better understanding of spectral underwater light fields and absorption coefficients, which precipitated my involvement in the nascent field of bio-optical oceanography. Establishment of the now 34-year-old summer graduate course in ocean optics, which continues to attract students from around the globe, is a legacy of my jumping into optics. The importance of social interactions in advancing science cannot be underestimated; a prime example is how a TGIF gathering led to my immersion in the world of autonomous underwater vehicles for the past two decades of my career. Working with people who you like and respect is also critical; I believe collegial friendship played a major role in the great success of the 2008 North Atlantic Bloom Experiment.

AB An integrated biologically inspired self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm is proposed for task assignment and path planning of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) system in 3-D underwater environments with obstacle avoidance. The algorithm embeds the biologically inspired neural network (BINN) into the SOM neural networks. The task assignment and path planning aim to arrange a team of AUVs to visit all appointed target locations, while assuring obstacle avoidance without speed jump. The SOM neuron network is developed to assign a team of AUVs to achieve multiple target locations in underwater environments. Then, in order to avoid obstacles and speed jump for each AUV that visits the corresponding target location, the BINN is utilized to update weights of the winner of SOM, and achieve AUVs path planning and effective navigation. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid model is validated by simulation studies.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are powerful instruments that enable the exploration of the ocean. In recent years, AUVs have been developed considerably. Trajectory tracking control, which has been a major research focus for many decades due to its variety of applications, is one of the key advancements in the AUV technology. This paper presents six trajectory tracking control methods: PID (proportion integration differentiation) control, fuzzy control, adaptive control, sliding mode control, backstepping control, and neural network control. A few novel methods for trajectory tracking control are also introduced. First, the concept of trajectory tracking control for an AUV and the related basic theories are explained. Then, several methods that are currently used for tracking control are presented. The advantages and limitations of these methods are identified by evaluating the characteristics of the methods. Finally, on the basis of a summary of several main methods, the future development of the trajectory tracking control of AUVs is discussed.

AB At present, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) mine countermeasure (MCM) surveys are normally preplanned by operators using ladder or zig-zag paths. Such surveys are conducted with side-looking sonar sensors whose performance is dependent on environmental, target, sensor, and AUV platform parameters. It is difficult to obtain precise knowledge of all of these parameters to be able to design optimal mission plans offline. This research represents the first known sensor driven online approach to seabed coverage for MCM. A method is presented where paths are planned using a multiobjective optimization. Information theory is combined with a new concept coined branch entropy based on a hexagonal cell decomposition. The result is a planning algorithm that not only produces shorter paths than conventional means, but is also capable of accounting for environmental factors detected in situ. Hardware-in-the-loop simulations and in water trials conducted on the IVER2 AUV show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB During the 1990s, numerous worldwide research and development activities have occurred in underwater robotics, especially in the area of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). As the ocean attracts great attention on environmental issues and resources as well as scientific and military tasks, the need for and use of underwater robotic systems has become more apparent. Great efforts have been made in developing AUVs to overcome challenging scientific and engineering problems caused by the unstructured and hazardous ocean environment. In the 1990s, about 30 new AUVs have been built worldwide. With the development of new materials, advanced computing and sensory technology, as well as theoretical advancements, R&D activities in the AUV community have increased. However, this is just the beginning for more advanced, yet practical and reliable AUVs. This paper surveys some key areas in current state-of-the-art underwater robotic technologies. It is by no means a complete survey but provides key references for future development. The new millennium will bring advancements in technology that will enable the development of more practical, reliable AUVs.

AB The Advanced Marine Systems Lab at Florida Atlantic University has developed a new ultramodular plastic mini autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), called the Morpheus, for littoral military and coastal oceanographic sampling, survey, and mapping applications. The name Morpheus was chosen because the Greek god Morpheus could change shape or "morph." In the same spirit, the higher degree of modularity of the Morpheus AUV allows it to "morph" or change its size and components for different applications. This vehicle is composed of modular injection-molded plastic pressure vessels and a cabling system that allow the modules to be rearranged without rewiring bulkheads. The plastic pressure vessels are inexpensive, inherently mass-producible, extremely corrosion-resistant, and have low magnetic signatures. The pressure vessels are small but are sized to fit most standard electronic board standards. The mini AUV can be anywhere from 4 to 10 ft in length, depending on its mission. The vehicle architecture is an adaptation of the Ocean Explorer AUV system and uses an ANSI 709.1 (LonTalk) distributed control network for connecting all sensors and actuator subsystems as smart nodes. The modularity in containers, control, and power makes this vehicle rapidly reconfigurable and easy to repair or upgrade. This paper will present details of the motivation, design, and construction of the new mini AUV. The Morpheus was deployed during the summer of 2000 in field exercises for very shallow and shallow water mine counter measures. Some results from these tests will be presented.

AB In this paper, the dynamic experimental identification of an inductive energy harvester for the conversion of vibration energy into electric power is presented. Recent advances and requirements in structural monitoring and vehicle diagnostic allow defining Autonomous Internet of Things (AIoT) systems that combine wireless sensor nodes with energy harvester devices properly designed considering the specific duty cycle. The proposed generator was based on an asymmetrical magnetic suspension and was addressed to structural monitoring applications on vehicles. The design of the interfaces of the electric, magnetic, and structural coupled systems forming the harvester are described including dynamic modeling and simulation. Finally, the results of laboratory tests were compared with the harvester dynamic response calculated through numerical simulations, and a good correspondence was obtained.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have now drawn significant attentions in academic and industrial research because of various advantages such as safety improvement, lower energy and fuel consumption, exploitation of road network, reduced traffic congestion and greater mobility. In critical decision making process during motion of an AV, intelligent motion planning takes an important and challenging role for obstacle avoidance, searching for the safest path to follow, generation of suitable behavior and comfortable trajectory generation by optimization while keeping road boundaries and traffic rules as important concerns. An AV should also be able to decide the safest behavior (such as overtaking in case of highway driving) at each moment during driving. The behavior planning techniques anticipate the behaviors of all traffic participants; then it reasonably decides the best and safest behavior for AV. For this highly challenging task, many different motion and behavior planning techniques for AVs have been developed over past few decades. The purpose of this paper is to present an exhaustive and critical review of these existing approaches on motion and behavior planning for AVs in terms of their feasibility, capability in handling dynamic constraints and obstacles, and optimality of motion for comfort. A critical evaluation of the existing behavior planning techniques highlighting their advantages, ability in handling of static and dynamic obstacles, vehicle constraints and limitations in operational environments has also been presented.

AB In this paper, the traffic equilibriums for mixed traffic flows of human-driven vehicles (HDV) and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) under a tradable credit scheme (TCS) are established and formulated as two variational inequality (VI) problems with exogenous and endogenous CAV penetration rate, respectively. A modified Lagrangian dual (MLD) method embedded with a revised Smith's route-swapping (RSRS) algorithm is proposed to solve the problems. Based on the numerical analysis, the impacts of CAV penetration and the extra expense of using a CAV on network performance are investigated. A novel driveway management, autonomous vehicle/credit charge (AVCC) link, is put forward to improve the efficiency of TCS. Under the TCS with exogenous CAV penetration rate, a logit-based model is applied to describe the stochastic user equilibrium for mixed traffic flow. It is found that the penetration of CAV gives rise to a better network performance and it can be further improved by the deployment of AVCC link. Under the TCS with endogenous penetration rate, a nested-logit model is applied to describe travelers' choices of vehicle types and routes. It is found that the deployment of AVCC links can slow down the decline rate of CAV penetration with increasing expense and thus ensure a lower average travel time for CAVs. In both cases, the deployment of AVCC links can stimulate credit trading and drop down its unit price.

AB Lane-changing is an important operation of an autonomous vehicle driving on the road. Safety and comfort are fully considered by excellent drivers in lane-changing operation. However, only the kinematic and dynamic constraints are taken into account in the traditional path planning methods, and the path generated by the traditional methods is very different from the actual trajectory of the vehicle driven by the excellent driver. In this paper, a path planning method for imitating the lane-changing operation of excellent drivers is proposed. Five experienced drivers are invited to do the lane-changing test, and the lane-changing trajectories data under different conditions are recorded. The excellent driver lane-changing model is established based on the genetic algorithm (GA) and back propagation (BP) neural network trained by the data of the lane-changing tests. The proposed approach can plan out an optimized lane change path according to the vehicle condition by learning the excellent drivers' driving routes. The results of simulations verify that the path generated by the proposed algorithm is basically same as the track selected by the excellent drivers under same conditions, which can reflect the characteristics of the operations of the excellent driver. While applying safe lane-changing to autonomous vehicle, it can improve the ride comfort of the vehicle and therefore reduce the probability of motion sickness of the passengers caused by improper operation during lane change.

AB In this study, a car-following model is put forth to explain the car-following behavior of HDVs (human-driven vehicles), AVs (autonomous vehicles) and CAVs (connected and automated vehicles) in mixed traffic. Based on the IDM (intelligent-driver model) and molecular dynamic theory, the model includes the velocity of surrounding vehicles along with the difference of velocity and the headway between each pair of vehicles. The drivers' sensitivity to the deceleration of the nearest front vehicle was considered in HDV car-following modeling and the influences of various kinds of nearest front and rear vehicles were distinguished in the CAV model. Based on the information obtained from the real road test mixed with HDVs, AVs and CAVs, the optimum value of the model parameters was obtained and the accuracy of model was verified with simulation. The results show that the simulation for HDVs', AVs' and CAVs' car-following behavior under the proposed model is more accurate than that for the IDM, ACC (adaptive cruise control) model and CACC (cooperative adaptive cruise control) model. The model can be applied to car-following simulations of HDVs, AVs and CAVs in mixed traffic, in the model the tools and concepts of nonlinear dynamics especially molecular dynamic theory is applied which can benefit road traffic vehicle interaction analysis. In addition, this study provides valuable suggestions and guidance for effectively guiding AVs and CAVs to follow vehicles and improving the stability of car-following behavior.

By virtue of ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) localisation system, the relative position between each follower and the neighbouring agents can be obtained. A formation control condition for unmanned autonomous systems is derived by appropriately constructing a Lyapunov function. Further, a formation controller is designed to form the formation of all autonomous agents and reach the consensus of velocities. Some parameters are designed to ensure the feasibility of formation controller. The effectiveness of the formation control protocol is verified by numerical simulations.

SO ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION
LA English
DT Article
ID AVOIDANCE; SAFETY; MODELS
AB Real-time risk assessment of autonomous driving at tactical and operational levels is extremely challenging since both contextual and circumferential factors should concurrently be considered. Recent methods have started to simultaneously treat the context of the traffic environment along with vehicle dynamics. In particular, interaction-aware motion models that take inter-vehicle dependencies into account by utilizing the Bayesian interference are employed to mutually control multiple factors. However, communications between vehicles are often assumed and the developed models are required many parameters to be tuned. Consequently, they are computationally very demanding. Even in the cases where these desiderata are fulfilled, current approaches cannot cope with a large volume of sequential data from organically changing traffic scenarios, especially in highly complex operational environments such as dense urban areas with heterogeneous road users. To overcome these limitations, this paper develops a new risk assessment methodology that integrates a network-level collision estimate with a vehicle-based risk estimate in real-time under the joint framework of interaction-aware motion models and Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN). Following the formulation and explanation of the required functions, machine learning classifiers were utilized for the real-time network-level collision prediction and the results were then incorporated into the integrated DBN model for predicting collision probabilities in real-time. Results indicated an enhancement of the interaction-aware model by up to 10%, when traffic conditions are deemed as collision-prone. Hence, it was concluded that a well-calibrated collision prediction classifier provides a crucial hint for better risk perception by autonomous vehicles.

AB Self-driving cars, believed to be on track to become a seven trillion-dollar industry by 2050, are likely to be a popular mode of transportation in the near future, as the technology promises safety and efficiency. Significant advances have been made to achieve these objectives. However, the idea of a self-driving car completing its goals without human intervention in the presence of uncertainties is still posed with challenges. These challenges mostly relate to decision-making under uncertainties that could arise from transient faults or deliberate attempts to disrupt the system in favor of adversarial motives. Traditional schemes of hardening the system against known compromises will not suffice primarily because of the sophistication adversarial attempts have come to achieve and the rate at which new attacks are being devised. The problem demands a solution that is resilient to attacks and that would allow a self-driving vehicle to complete its designated task in the presence of attacks or faults. Several attempts have been made towards achieving resilience in autonomous vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to give a thorough review on the resilient approaches adopted in the context and presents a taxonomy of such approaches.

AB Potential increases or decreases in energy consumption for various traffic operation modes is a research focus in light-duty autonomous vehicle (AV) studies. However, AVs have unclear energy consumption patterns compared with human-driving vehicles (HV), especially under diverse real-world traffic conditions. Considering nine open-source AV activity datasets from six nations, three nontrivial characteristics of light-duty AVs under real traffic conditions were found. 1) The energy consumption of AVs was similar to that of HVs in the low-speed range and was lower than HVs in the high-speed range. 2) The turning point between low-speed and high-speed was a variable parameter for different data sources. 3) The energy consumption of AVs may be higher than that of HVs under complex traffic conditions in the high-speed range. Based on a vehicle-specific power distribution model, this study developed an AV energy consumption model under real traffic conditions at average speeds of 10 to 100 km/h. Potential energy consumption savings and losses were determined using two parameters: the turning point between low-speed and high-speed and the rate of change in vehicle-specific power standard deviation in the high-speed range. Under real traffic conditions, the results implied that light-duty AVs had the potential to reduce energy consumption by 3.78% to 26.47% under stable conditions but could also increase energy consumption by 3.25% to 48.93% compared with light-duty HVs under unstable conditions.

AB Innovative technologies such as autonomous and connected vehicles can create a better transit mall, a street where only public transit vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians are allowed. However, successful introduction of such technologies depends on user acceptance. To assess the potential acceptance of these technologies in the context of a new transit mall environment, it is crucial to provide an opportunity to experience them before they roll out. This study explores how real and video-based experiences of new technologies can affect public acceptance of new transit mall options in Hiroshima City, Japan, where trams and buses are significant modes of public transportation. We conducted a survey on the stated acceptance of new transit mall options with three groups of respondents: real experience, video-based experience, and no experience groups. The real-experience group self-selected themselves for the experiment, which potentially caused bias. Thus, we used a hybrid choice model with attitudinal variables (ethical, legal, and social concerns regarding emerging technologies, as well as risk-related factors) introduced to control for this bias. We found that both real and video-based experiences improved overall acceptance of new transit mall options, but there were differences in preferences between those who had only videobased experiences and those who had real experiences. We also found that prior knowledge of new transport services and infrastructure had a considerable influence on stated acceptance.

AB Autonomous vehicles in a platoon determine the control inputs based on the system state information collected and shared by the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is regarded as a potential method for car-following control and has been mostly studied to support a single following vehicle. However, it is more challenging to learn an efficient car-following policy with convergence stability when there are multiple following vehicles in a platoon, especially with unpredictable leading vehicle behavior. In this context, we adopt an integrated DRL and dynamic programming (DP) approach to learn autonomous platoon control policies, which embeds the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm into a finite-horizon value iteration framework. Although the DP framework can improve the stability and performance of DDPG, it has the limitations of lower sampling and training efficiency. In this article, we propose an algorithm, namely, finite-horizon-DDPG with sweeping through reduced state space using stationary approximation (FH-DDPG-SS), which uses three key ideas to overcome the above limitations, i.e., transferring network weights backward in time, stationary policy approximation for earlier time steps, and sweeping through reduced state space. In order to verify the effectiveness of FH-DDPG-SS, simulation using real driving data is performed, where the performance of FH-DDPG-SS is compared with those of the benchmark algorithms. Finally, platoon safety and string stability for FH-DDPG-SS are demonstrated.

AB The aim of this paper is to obtain a heading model for the purpose of control of an in-scale fast-ferry TF-120 physical model, including the dynamics and kinematics, using a remote experimentation platform for marine vehicles. The physical model is developed to be autonomous and is controlled remotely from a PC using WiFi communications. The identification and validation of the model dynamics is obtained with turning circle maneuverings. The tests with the autonomous in-scale physical model of the high-speed ship were carried out on the coastline of the Bay of Santander. The parametric model identified is used to design different classical control structures for a heading autopilot, and a simulation of this system is performed in Simulink.

AB In this paper, two commonly utilized control methods for active disturbance rejection are designed and evaluated in a column formation (i.e., convoy) application of ground vehicles. Specifically, a variable structure controller and a robust sign of the error controller are utilized to achieve inter-vehicle distance tracking despite 1) not measuring the preceding vehicle's velocity and 2) being subjected to environmental influences. Both controllers utilize headway (i.e., variable inter-vehicle distance based on vehicle velocity) to: 1) promote overall convoy stability and 2) utilize only the preceding vehicle's position measurement. The performance of the controllers are evaluated and analyzed on experimental scale vehicles in both on-and off-road settings.

AB This paper describes a fully autonomous real-time in-motion alignment algorithm for Strapdown Inertial Navigation Systems (SINS) in land vehicle applications. Once the initial position is available, the vehicle can start a mission immediately with accurate attitude, position and velocity information determined within ten minutes. This is achieved by two tightly coupled stages, that is, real-time Double-vector Attitude Determination Coarse Alignment (DADCA) and Backtracking Fine Alignment (BFA). In the DADCA process, the vehicle motion is omitted to roughly estimate the attitude at the very start of the alignment. Meanwhile, attitude quaternions and velocity increments are extracted and recorded. The BFA process utilises the stored data and exploits the Non-Holonomic Constraints (NHC) of a vehicle to obtain virtual velocity measurements. A linear SINS/NHC Kalman filter with mounting angles as extended states is constructed to improve the fine alignment accuracy. The method is verified by three vehicle tests, which shows that the accuracy of alignment azimuth is 0.0358 degrees (Root Mean Square, RMS) and the positioning accuracy is about 15 m (RMS) at the end of the alignment.

AB To sustain and expand the agricultural economy even as its workforce shrinks, the efficiency of farm operations must be improved. One key to efficiency improvement is completely unmanned driving of farm machines, which requires stable monitoring and control of machines from remote sites, a safety system to ensure safe autonomous driving even without manual operations, and precise positioning in not only small farm fields but also wider areas. As possible solutions for those issues, we have developed technologies of wireless network quality prediction, an end-to-end overlay network, machine vision for safety and positioning, network cooperated vehicle control and autonomous tractor control and conducted experiments in actual field environments. Experimental results show that: 1) remote monitoring and control can be seamlessly continued even when connection between the tractor and the remote site needs to be switched across different wireless networks during autonomous driving; 2) the safety of the autonomous driving can automatically be ensured by detecting both the existence of people in front of the unmanned tractor and disturbance of network quality affecting remote monitoring operation; and 3) the unmanned tractor can continue precise autonomous driving even when precise positioning by satellite systems cannot be performed.

AB Autonomous vehicles are gaining popularity throughout the world among researchers and consumers. However, their popularity has not yet reached the level where it is widely accepted as a fully developed technology as a large portion of the consumer base feels skeptical about it. Proving the correctness of this technology will help in establishing faith in it. That is easier said than done because of the fact that the formal verification techniques has not attained the level of development and application that it is ought to. In this work, we present Statistical Model Checking (SMC) as a possible solution for verifying the safety of autonomous systems and algorithms. We apply it on Heuristic Autonomous Intersection Management (HAIM) algorithm. The presented verification routine can be adopted for other conflict point based autonomous intersection management algorithms as well. Along with verifying the HAIM, we also demonstrate the modeling and verification applied at each stage of development to verify the inherent behavior of the algorithm. The HAIM scheme is formally modeled using a variant of the language of Timed Automata. The model consists of automata that encode the behavior of vehicles, intersection manager (IM) and collision checkers. To verify the complete nature of the heuristic and ensure correct modeling of the system, we model it in layers and verify each layer separately for their expected behavior. Along with that, we perform implementation verification and error injection testing to ensure faithful modeling of the system. Results show with high confidence the freedom from collisions of the intersection controlled by the HAIM algorithm.

AB This article aims to develop a robust model predictive control (MPC) scheme for the trajectory tracking control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) subject to bounded disturbances. Based on the error dynamics model derived from the AUV dynamics and the desired trajectory, an improved tube-based MPC scheme is then developed. The tube-based MPC solves two optimal control problems, the first solves a standard problem for the nominal system which defines a reference state trajectory, and the other attempts to steer the state of the disturbed system to stay in a tube centered around the reference state trajectory thereby enabling robust control of the AUV systems. For tube-based nonlinear MPC, finding a local linear feedback to characterize the tube is challenging. To address it, we replace the local linear feedback controller with an ancillary one that incorporates the tightening constraints to ensure the disturbed system state stays in the online optimized tube. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Road scene understanding is crucial to the safe driving of autonomous vehicles. Comprehensive road scene understanding requires a visual perception system to deal with a large number of tasks at the same time, which needs a perception model with a small size, fast speed, and high accuracy. As multi-task learning has evident advantages in performance and computational resources, in this paper, a multi-task model YOLO-Object, Drivable Area, and Lane Line Detection (YOLO-ODL) based on hard parameter sharing is proposed to realize joint and efficient detection of traffic objects, drivable areas, and lane lines. In order to balance tasks of YOLO-ODL, a weight balancing strategy is introduced so that the weight parameters of the model can be automatically adjusted during training, and a Mosaic migration optimization scheme is adopted to improve the evaluation indicators of the model. Our YOLO-ODL model performs well on the challenging BDD100K dataset, achieving the state of the art in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

AB This study analytically investigates the morning commuting and parking patterns of autonomous vehicles (AVs) under different spatial road capacity allocation schemes (i.e., capacity split between inbound and outbound travel directions). Given that self-driving AV might park far away from commuters' destination, we investigate equilibrium departure/arrival and parking patterns for AVs subject to the spatial road capacity allocation. We also analyse the system optimum traffic pattern for AV morning commute under a given capacity allocation scheme. Furthermore, we examine optimal capacity allocation strategies under user equilibrium and system optimum AV traffic patterns, respectively, which aim to minimise the total system travel cost. Numerical studies are conducted to illustrate the model and analysis. The results reveal the sensitivity of different efficiency metrics with respect to AV parking supply and road capacity allocation schemes, and provide insights into the infrastructure management with future automated transport.

AB Oceans have been a source of food and resources for life on Earth even before the advent of civilization. In recent years, reliance on the oceans has increased due to an increasing population on land, which has resulted in unabated and un-sustainable ocean exploitation. While the oceans have been resilient so far and have allowed numerous misadventures of humanity, they have reached a tipping point in their resilience due to the extensive use of unsustainable means. One such area of exploitation is "deep seabed mining, " for which numerous studies have shown the expected impact on ocean life and the environment to be cata-strophic. It is expected that the resulting impact can be substantially reduced by avoiding direct interaction of humans with the environment. This understanding has led to the development of numerous technologies in the field of robotics and autonomous vehicles. This technical note thus assesses the current and future use of robotics and autonomous underwater vehicles to achieve sustainability during the exploration phase of deep seabed mining.

AB Experimental results are presented of the cooperative operation of two maritime autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) executing a pre-defined task in a complex marine environment. The ASVs are equipped with algorithms for motion-planning, path-following and motion control, where the motion-planning algorithm is based in the angle-guidance fast marching square method, the path-planning module is based in the vector-field path-following method and the controller is a PID. The ASVs are two self-propelled models of 2.5 m and 3.2 m length instrumented with several sensors, actuators and communication unit, such as, inertial measurement units, Global positioning system, anemometers, accelerometers, inclinometers, DC motors and Wi-Fi communication. To monitor and command the ASVs, a real-time program was coded in LabVIEW 2018 (R). Finally, in order to validate the developed system, experimental tests were carried out in an open-door pool with low wind conditions, and from these experiments good capabilities of the system were found.

ID PROCUREMENT
AB This study designs a new market for fractional ownership of autonomous vehicles (AVs), in which an AV is co-leased by a group of individuals. We present a practical iterative auction based on the combinatorial clock auction to match the interested customers together and determine their payments. In designing such an auction, we consider continuous-time items (time slots) that are defined by bidders and naturally exploit driverless mobility of AVs to form co-leasing groups. To relieve the computational burdens of both bidders and the auctioneer, we devise user agents who generate packages and bid on behalf of bidders. Through numerical experiments using the California 2010-2012 travel survey, we test the performance of the auction design. We also compare various bidding strategies and study the effect of activity rules on the bidders' payoffs. We find that the designed activity rules successfully remove the strategic behavior of bidders. We also find that core-selecting payment rule brings the largest revenue to the auctioneer in most cases.

AB A two-dimensional path following control system for autonomous surface vehicles is presented. The guidance system is obtained through a way-point guidance scheme based on a vector field algorithm. Vector field is a simple and robust method and its stability is proved using Lyapunov stability criteria. The 2-degree of freedom (sway-yaw) linear manoeuvring model is chosen as the control model and the parameters are obtained by using the least-square support vector regression. The sensitivity of the vector field algorithm to its parameters is studied and simulation tests are presented to compare the performance of the tradition line-of-sight scheme and vector field algorithm. The results show that the vector field has a better performance for autonomous surface vehicle's path following control, is a practical and robust method for accurate path following, and can be extended to higher dimensional control and guidance problems.

AB With the help of inter-vehicle communication (IVC), autonomous vehicles (AVs) can drive cooperatively, thus significantly improve road safety, traffic efficiency, and environmental sustainability. While substantial research has been conducted to investigate the efficiency of AVs in transportation systems, few attempts have been carried out to explore the lane-changing operations of AVs in multi-lane freeways, especially the dynamics of AVs at lane-drop bottlenecks. to this end, this paper aims to develop a cooperative space distribution method (CSDM) not only to increase the lane-drop bottleneck's throughput but also to equally distribute the AVs in the dropped lane to other lanes by efficiently coordinating the dynamics of AVs upstream of the bottleneck in a multi-lane freeway. More specifically, we propose a novel framework where the freeway (region of interest) is divided into three segments: i) platoon segment, ii) acceleration segment, and iii) merging segment. In the first segment, AVs travel together in the platoon to guarantee their safety; they will then speed up to attain the maximum velocity and reach the determined position in the second segment. Finally, these AVs change lanes in the last segment and pass through the bottleneck with maximum velocity and minimum gap (i.e., gap distance). Simulation results are tested to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, where we show that the proposed framework can significantly decrease the average travel time of all vehicles.

AB Self-driving cars need to make decisions while sharing the road with human drivers whose behavior is uncertain. However, the presence of uncertainty leads to a trade-off between two conflicting goals: safety and efficiency. In this work, we propose DRL-GAT-SA to achieve safe and efficient autonomous driving, which is a new runtime assurance approach. First, we construct a graph attention reinforcement learning controller (GARL) based on the safety field model, which combines graph attention network with deep reinforcement learning. We learn the interaction between vehicles through the representation of dynamic relationships between vehicles and make decisions. Then DRL-GAT-SA provides safety assurance for the vehicle when the GARL produces unsafe control, while also retraining the GARL to improve its efficiency. DRL-GAT-SA can restore GARL control of the system under conditions that confirm safety without undue sacrifice of efficiency. In two different driving environments, DRL-GAT-SA consistently shows excellent performance.

AB With the extensive developments in autonomous vehicles (AV) and the increase of interest in artificial intelligence (AI), path planning is becoming a focal area of research. However, path planning is an NP-hard problem and its execution time and complexity are major concerns when searching for optimal solutions. Thus, the optimal trade-off between the shortest path and computing resources must be found. This paper introduces a path planning algorithm, tide path planning (TPP), which is inspired by the natural tide phenomenon. The idea of the gravitational attraction between the Earth and the Moon is adopted to avoid searching blocked routes and to find a shortest path. Benchmarking the performance of the proposed algorithm against rival path planning algorithms, such as A*, breadth-first search (BFS), Dijkstra, and genetic algorithms (GA), revealed that the proposed TPP algorithm succeeded in finding a shortest path while visiting the least number of cells and showed the fastest execution time under different settings of environment size and obstacle ratios.

AB This paper aims to solve the problem that a single control method can't fit to each operating condition of heading control for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). A multi-mode strategy based on soft-switching is proposed, which can get better performance by smooth switching of control modes. The control mode consists of two levels, which is named as two-level-mode method. On the first level, the control mode is divided into six according to the operating state of AUV. On the second level, based on the existing mode the control mode is divided into three depending on AUV' speed. In addition, the BB-PID controller is designed for heading control, as well as the sigmoid function is constructed to smoothly switching at different speed without saltation. The simulation and experiment results demonstrate that BB-PID controller achieves outstanding performance and the switching strategy is much more effective by comparing the RMS, RMSE, SSE between switching based on sigmoid function and switching based on threshold.

AB Underwater acoustic source localization is important in many underwater applications. However, due to the intensity declination of the acoustic signal as the distance from the source increases, the possibility to detect and localize the source using a single surface platform become harder. This paper presents an underwater acoustic source localization strategy by a group of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) using a combined systematic and metaheuristic searching methods. The proposed localization strategy consists of two phases known as a source detection phase (based on a systematic searching method) and a source tracing phase (based on a metaheuristic searching method) implemented when none of the ASVs detect the presents of the acoustic source and when at least one of the ASVs detect the presents of the source, respectively. A formation based and a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used as a systematic and metaheuristic search method, respectively. The reliability of the proposed localization strategy is demonstrated through a series of a simulation studies.

AB An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is an aircraft with no pilot. The autonomous flight technology of a UAV is combined with emerging Information and Communication Technology (ICT) applications and services to monitor diverse kinds of environments. UAVs are suitable for surveillance of targets because of their onboard cameras. It is possible to autonomously capture images of surveillance targets based on predefined paths. However, UAVs must generate a flight path for autonomous flight considering the surveillance targets. This paper proposes a UAV control process for surveillance taking into account various aspects of their operation. In particular, because flights of autonomous UAVs are based on analyzed past flight records, this paper first described surveillance using UAVs and then introduced the sequential processes for the generation of optimal UAV flight paths.

AB This research proposes an approach for vision-based autonomous navigation planning of unmanned aerial vehicles for the collection of images suitable for the rapid post-earthquake inspection of reinforced concrete railway viaducts. The proposed approach automatically recognizes and localizes critical structural components, columns in this case, and determines appropriate viewpoints for inspection relative to the identified components. Structural component recognition and localization are formulated through online detection of rectangular prismatic shapes from the parsed sparse point-cloud data, where prior knowledge of the target structural system is incorporated. The proposed approach is tested in a synthetic environment representing Japanese high-speed railway viaducts. First, the ability to detect the columns of the target viaduct is assessed. The results show that the columns are detected completely and robustly, with centimeter-level accuracy. Subsequently, the entire approach is demonstrated in the synthetic environment, showing the significant potential of collecting highquality images for post-earthquake structural inspection efficiently.

AB To ensure the mission implementation of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), faults occurring on actuators should be detected and located promptly; therefore, reliable control strategies and inputs can be effectively provided. In this paper, faults occurring on the propulsion and attitude control systems of a torpedo-shaped AUV are analyzed and located while fault features may induce confusions for conventional fault localization (FL). Selective features of defined fault parameters are assorted as necessary conditions against different faulty actuators and synthesized in a fault tree subsequently to state the sufficiency towards possible abnormal parts. By matching fault features with those of estimated fault parameters, suspected faulty sections are located. Thereafter, active FL strategies that analyze the related fault parameters after executing purposive actuator control are proposed to provide precise fault location. Moreover, the generality of the proposed methods is analyzed to support extensive implementations. Simulations based on finite element analysis against a torpedo-shaped AUV with actuator faults are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

SO ROAD & TRANSPORT RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper builds on the work presented by the authors at the 2015 AITPM National Conference. The focus of the new work has been researching the likely uptake rates for autonomous vehicles (AVs) and building a model which determines what percentage of the fleet will be fully AV by a certain year. In addition to this we have also added extra capability to the model which allows us to address the issue of shared autonomous vehicles which we have not done before. Both single-occupant and multi-occupant shared AVs will reduce overall car ownership and also parking requirements. The behavioural impacts for shared AVs are uncertain - we have assumed that people make choices based on the marginal cost of travel. The higher marginal costs felt by users of a shared AV service lead to lower car demand; more public and active transport; and less congestion. We also believe that multi-occupant shared AVs could significantly increase the efficiency of our networks. All of these issues, as well as potential safety implications, are explored in our paper using TransPosition's 4S Model.

AB This paper presents a rule-based intelligent guidance strategy for autonomous pursuit of mobile targets by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in an area with threats, obstacles, and restricted regions. The probabilistic threat exposure map (PTEM) is used as the mathematical formulation of the area of operation for the guidance strategy to make intelligent decisions based on a set of defined rules. The rules are developed for three objectives in the order of priority as: 1) avoid obstacles/restricted regions; 2) maintain the target proximity; 3) minimize UAV threat exposure level. A least-square estimation and kinematic relations are used to estimate/predict the target states based on noisy position measurements. The work presented herein addresses the same problem as in a previous work by the authors, and aims at improving the computational efficiency without compromising the performance. Simulation results of several pursuit scenarios demonstrate the full capabilities of the strategy and the improvement over the previous work.

AB In complex lane change (LC) scenarios, semantic interpretation and safety analysis of dynamic interaction pattern are necessary for autonomous vehicles to make appropriate decisions. This study proposes a learning framework that combines primitive-based interaction pattern recognition and risk analysis. The Hidden Markov Model with the Gaussian mixture model (GMM-HMM) approach is developed to decompose the LC scenarios into primitives. Then K-means clustering with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is applied to gather the primitives into 13 LC interaction patterns. Finally, this study considers time-to-collision (TTC) of two conflict types involved in the LC process. And the TTC is used to analyze the risk of interaction patterns and extract high-risk LC interaction patterns. The LC events obtained from the Highway Drone Dataset (highD) demonstrate that the identified LC interaction patterns contain interpretable semantic information. This study identifies the dynamic spatiotemporal characteristics and risk formation mechanism of the LC interaction patterns. The findings are useful to comprehensively understand the latent interaction patterns, which can then be used to design and improve the decision-making process during lane changes and enhance the safety of autonomous vehicle.

TI Adaptive Steering Angle Controller for Autonomous Vehicles in the

DE Adaptive backstepping control; Electric power steering; Autonomous

AB This paper addresses the problem of controlling the electric power steering angle for autonomous vehicles in the presence of model parameter uncertainty and disturbances. Usually, the electric power steering manufacturer provides it as a black box to the automotive companies and does not provide the model or the model parameters. Identifying those parameters is a time-consuming process that requires a special vehicle setting, and does not always give accurate results. Inaccuracies on those parameters deteriorate the behavior of the model-based controller that is using them. To overcome those problems, an adaptive backstepping steering angle controller is designed, which assumes the steering model parameters are unknown and develops parameter update laws to estimate them. Adaptive laws are also developed to estimate the disturbance resulting from self-aligning moment. Usually, self-aligning moment estimation requires tire parameters knowledge. In the adaptive backstepping method, it is treated as disturbance and no knowledge of tire parameters is required in order to estimate it. Coulomb friction and static friction are considered as disturbances and estimated together with the self-aligning moment disturbance. The performance of the proposed method was validated with numerical simulation.

AB The industry is changing in order to improve the economy sector. This is the reason why technology is improving and developing new devices. The autonomous guided vehicle with free navigation is a new machine, which uses different techniques to move such as mapping, localization, path planning, and path following. In this paper, a path following is proposed. The path following is called moving to a point, which uses the proportional distance between the target and the autonomous guided vehicles (AGV) to calculate the velocity and direction. If some obstacles appear in the trajectory, however, the vehicle stops. Instead of stopping the machine, by using moving to a point logic, an obstacle avoidance function will be implemented. In this implementation, different parameters can be configured, such as: security distance, which determinates when the obstacle avoidance must correct the pose; and proportional values, which modify the velocity and steering commands. It is also compared to a dynamic window approach (DWA) obstacle avoidance solution. Additionally, the AGV navigates to a non-static target with a path following algorithm.

AB In the last decades, huge efforts have been made to develop innovative solutions supporting the automation of logistics activities. Among the available technologies, autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) are very promising: they use light vehicles able to independently travel on different axes, and thus perform different tasks at the same time. Despite the increasing diffusion of such systems, there is still a lack of performance evaluation techniques. Furthermore, there are no standards available to provide performance evaluation criteria. In this paper, novel analytical models to assess the performance of AVS/RS pertaining to deep-lane racks. These models extend the state of the art by (i) taking into account the real criteria related to the storage and retrieval of items, (ii) considering the capability of the shuttle and the satellite to simultaneously perform different tasks, and (iii) evaluating the standard deviation of the cycle time, beside its average value. The presented models are validated through simulations performed on different warehouse layouts, in different deployment scenarios. The ultimate aim of such models is to support warehouse equipment designers in evaluating the performance of their systems, considering a multiplicity of realistic scenarios.

AB Terrain-aided navigation is a potentially powerful solution for obtaining submerged position fixes for autonomous underwater vehicles. The application of terrain-aided navigation with high-accuracy inertial navigation systems has demonstrated meter-level navigation accuracy in sea trials. However, available sensors may be limited depending on the type of the mission. Such limitations, especially for low-grade navigation sensors, not only degrade the accuracy of traditional navigation systems, but further impact the ability to successfully employ terrain-aided navigation. To address this problem, a tightly-coupled navigation is presented to successfully estimate the critical sensor errors by incorporating raw sensor data directly into an augmented navigation system. Furthermore, three-dimensional distance errors are calculated, providing measurement updates through the particle filter for absolute and bounded position error. The development of the terrain aided navigation system is elaborated for a vehicle equipped with a non-inertial-grade strapdown inertial navigation system, a 4-beam Doppler Velocity Log range sensor and a sonar altimeter. Using experimental data for navigation performance evaluation in areas with different terrain characteristics, the experiment results further show that the proposed method can be successfully applied to the low-cost AUVs and significantly improves navigation performance.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful concept still in its infancy that has the potential, if utilised responsibly, to provide a vehicle for positive change that could promote sustainable transitions to a more resource-efficient livability paradigm. AI with its deep learning functions and capabilities can be employed as a tool which empowers machines to solve problems that could reform urban landscapes as we have known them for decades now and help with establishing a new era; the era of the "smart city". One of the key areas that AI can redefine is transport. Mobility provision and its impact on urban development can be significantly improved by the employment of intelligent transport systems in general and automated transport in particular. This new breed of AI-based mobility, despite its machine-orientation, has to be a user-centred technology that "understands" and "satisfies" the human user, the markets and the society as a whole. Trust should be built, and risks should be eliminated, for this transition to take off. This paper provides a novel conceptual contribution that thoroughly discusses the scarcely studied nexus of AI, transportation and the smart city and how this will affect urban futures. It specifically covers key smart mobility initiatives referring to Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), autonomous Personal and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (PAVs and UAVs) and Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS), but also interventions that may work as enabling technologies for transport, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Physical Internet (PI) or reflect broader transformations like Industry 4.0. This work is ultimately a reference tool for researchers and city planners that provides clear and systematic definitions of the ambiguous smart mobility terms of tomorrow and describes their individual and collective roles underpinning the nexus in scope.

AB Providing a railway transit system (RTS) in less populated areas is a challenging task for transportation agencies due to its high construction and operating costs. With the advent of automation, shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) as an integral part of public transit services has the potential to enhance the design of transit systems. In this paper, we present a joint optimization framework of railway transit network design and SAV first-mile service that minimizes the total cost of the combined RTS-SAV services and commuters' waiting time, while serving a dynamic travel demand in the network. The proposed model optimizes the SAV fleet size and the RTS alignment while enabling vehicle relocations to tackle the vehicle imbalance issue in the SAV service. Due to the non-linear and mixed-integer formulation, we develop a fixed-point algorithm for this joint RTS-SAV problem where we transform the original problem into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. Our results indicate that the joint RTS-SAV services can be constructed and operated at a lower cost than either of the RTS or SAV services alone. Furthermore, the resulting joint RTS-SAV services are underpinned by a shorter railway alignment and larger fleet size rather than a multi-link extension. Additionally, the joint RTS-SAV services is robust to the variation in total demand, with respect to the railway alignment, SAV utilization and commuters' waiting time.

AB Purpose This paper aims to study the localization problem for autonomous industrial vehicles in the complex industrial environments. Aiming for practical applications, the pursuit is to build a map-less localization system which can be used in the presence of dynamic obstacles, short-term and long-term environment changes. Design/methodology/approach The proposed system contains four main modules, including long-term place graph updating, global localization and re-localization, location tracking and pose registration. The first two modules fully exploit the deep-learning based three-dimensional point cloud learning techniques to achieve the map-less global localization task in large-scale environment. The location tracking module implements the particle filter framework with a newly designed perception model to track the vehicle location during movements. Finally, the pose registration module uses visual information to exclude the influence of dynamic obstacles and short-term changes and further introduces point cloud registration network to estimate the accurate vehicle pose. Findings Comprehensive experiments in real industrial environments demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and practical applicability of the map-less localization approach. Practical implications This paper provides comprehensive experiments in real industrial environments. Originality/value The system can be used in the practical automated industrial vehicles for long-term localization tasks. The dynamic objects, short-/long-term environment changes and hardware limitations of industrial vehicles are all considered in the system design. Thus, this work moves a big step toward achieving real implementations of the autonomous localization in practical industrial scenarios.

AB Today, driverless cars, as a new technology that allows a more accessible, dynamic and intelligent form of Shared Mobility, are expected to revolutionize urban transportation. One of the conceivable mobility services based on driverless cars is shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). This service could merge cabs, carsharing, and ridesharing systems into a singular transportation mode. However, the success and competitiveness of future SAV services depend on their operational models, which are linked intrinsically to the service configuration and fleet specification. In addition, any change in operational models will result in a different demand. Using a comprehensive framework of SAV simulation in a multimodal dynamic demand system with integrated SAV user taste variation, this study evaluates the performance of various SAV fleets and vehicle capacities serving travelers across the Rouen Normandie metropolitan area in France. Also, the impact of ridesharing and rebalancing strategies on service performance is investigated.
   Research results suggest that the performance of SAV is strongly correlated with the fleet size and the strategy of individual or shared rides. Further analysis indicates that for the pricing scheme proposed in this study (i.e., 20% lower for ridesharing scenario), the standard 4-seats car with shared ride remains the best option among all scenarios. The results also underline that enabling vehicle-rebalancing strategies may have an important effect on both user and service-related metrics. The estimated SAV average and maximum driven distance prove the importance of vehicle range and charging station deployment.

AB Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) have gained popularity for the last decades, especially for the purpose of not risking human life in dangerous operations. On the other hand, underwater environment introduces numerous challenges in navigation, control and communication of such vehicles. Certainly, this fact makes the development of these vehicles more interesting and engineering-wise more attractive. In this paper, we first revisit the existing technology and methodology for the solution of aforementioned problems, then we try to come zip with a system solution of a generic unmanned underwater vehicles.

AB This paper presents the trajectory tracking problem for constrained autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). More specifically, a novel control framework of model predictive control based on dual closed-loop is designed enhancing the tracking performance of the AUV. On the basis of the dynamic characteristics of the AUV, the initial optimization problem is transformed into the design of an outer-loop position controller and an inner-loop velocity controller. The contraction constraint devised in the control problem of two loops ensures the conver-gence of the AUV motion trajectory. The recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability of the system are demonstrated. In addition, the inner-loop controller design is supplied with robustness through a combination of robust model predictive control and backstepping control. Despite the existence of model dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances of the ocean currents, the tracking errors of the closed-loop system can converge to a small neighborhood of zero. Finally, the simulation experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB Many complicated road intersections are seen while driving. In some, blind spots make it difficult for drivers or automated vehicles to discern moving objects coming from certain directions, possibly confusing drivers or autonomous vehicles wishing to cross or to turn at the intersection. To address this problem, we investigate detection and tracking of all moving objects at an intersection using a single 360-degree-view camera (3DVC). Through experiments, we develop methods allowing a 3DVC to capture the entirety of a four-way intersection when installed at one corner. This paper also presents image processing algorithms for detecting and tracking moving objects at intersections by processing images from the installed 3DVC. Experiments under varied conditions demonstrate that the proposed detection algorithm has a very high detection rate. We also confirm the tracking ability for moving objects detected using the proposed algorithm.

AB In this study, the authors co-ordinated collective motion patterns for a group of autonomous vehicles with Cartesian co-ordinate coupling in a discrete-time setting and present experimental results to validate the theoretical results. The collective motion patterns include rendezvous, circular patterns and logarithmic spiral patterns. The authors first study the collective motion patterns for a group of autonomous vehicles with single-integrator kinematics in a discrete-time setting when there exists time delay. The conditions on the network topology, the sampling period, the time delay and the Euler angle are presented such that different collective motion patterns can be achieved. The collective motion patterns for a group of autonomous vehicles with double-integrator dynamics in a discrete-time setting in the presence of relative damping are studied. The conditions on the network topology, the sampling period, the damping factor and the Euler angle are presented such that different collective patterns can be achieved. Finally, the theoretical results are experimentally validated on a multi-robot platform.

AB A discrete time-delay control (DTDC) law for a general six degrees of freedom unsymmetric autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is presented. Hydrodynamic parameters like added mass coefficients and drag coefficients, which are generally uncertain, are not required by the controller. This control law uncertainties in the AUV dynamics by direct estimation of the uncertainties using time-delay estimation technique. The discrete-time version of the time-delay control does not require the derivative of the system state to be measured or estimated, which is required by the continuous-time version of the controller. This particularly provides an advantage over continuous-time controller in terms of computational effort or availability of sensors for measuring state derivatives, i.e., linear and angular accelerations. Implementation issues for practical realization of the controller are discussed. Experiments on a test-bed AUV were conducted in depth, pitch, and yaw degrees of freedom. Results show that the proposed control law performs well in the presence of uncertainties. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Programming autonomous vehicles to accomplish complex missions is a complicated task for which the development of control architectures is of prime importance. The goal of this paper is to describe the accomplishments of both French and American teams within a cooperative research program focused on the development of high-level control of semi-autonomous underwater vehicles. In particular, two different mission-programming methodologies are examined in the context of the requirements of a generic, reactive and complex underwater mission. The French team uses a combination of the ESTEREL synchronous programming language and the PIRRAT real-time control library to implement a methodology derived from the ORCCAD programming system. The approach taken by the American team builds a trilevel hybrid architecture using the CONTROLSHELL real-time software development environment. The details of each methodology are highlighted through the presentation of the high-level programs designed by each team using their approach to control an underwater robot to perform a multiphased underwater mission. The utility of both programming methodologies was verified through the successful completion of those missions in experimental demonstrations by the French VORTEX and American OTTER autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB With the rise of digital sustainable business models in the Autonomous Vehicles (AV) industry, the traditional automakers are undergoing a major restructuring in their key performance areas and associated supply chains processes. Focusing on an innovative AV design (AD) concept, this paper investigates how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain-based Smart Contracts can enhance sustainable supply chain operations. A novel design element, Margin Indicator (MI), is developed to obtain reliable predictive analytics results from the mainstream machine learning algorithms. The proposed approach supports a robust control of costs and energy, while maintaining a high level of transparency in managing decentralized AV supply chain processes, monetary impacts, and environmental sustainability. Testing the developed concept through a preliminary case study, we observed a reduction in energy wastage and hidden financial transactions by 12.48% and 11.58%, respectively. Supported by the rapid advancement in the blockchain and AI tech-nologies, the developed framework is expected to improve product traceability, transaction transparency, and sustainable economic growth for the AV supply chains.

   H infinity
AB In the navigation of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), the positioning accuracy and stability of the navigation system will decrease due to uncertainties such as mobility, inaccuracy of a priori process noise characteristic, and simplification of a dynamic model. In order to solve the above problems, a new, adaptive factor-based H infinity cubature Kalman filter based on a fading factor (AF-H infinity CKF) is proposed in this paper. On the one hand, the H infinity game theory provides AF-H infinity CKF good robustness in the worst case; on the other hand, the fading factor makes the innovation orthogonal and inflates the predicted error covariance and the Kalman gain, which avoids a decrease in estimation precision in the case of model uncertainty. The simulation and experiment results show that the AF-H infinity CKF filter can deal with AUV navigation better than other existing algorithms in the presence of outliers and model uncertainty, which confirms its effectiveness and superiority.

AB Considering the dynamic changes of unmanned surface vehicle (USV) in berthing tasks, the planning and control modes are divided into two phases: the remote phase and the terminal phase. According to the main influencing factors of the two phases, an improved artificial potential field method is proposed to complete autonomous berthing trajectory planning based on the analysis of environment constraint, berth point constraint and USV's dynamics constraint. Combining with the dynamic characteristics and control objectives at different phases of berthing and analyzing the fuzzy rule regulation strategy of USV's heading and speed control, an improved adaptive fuzzy PID control method is proposed to solve the control problem of USV, which is influenced by weak maneuver, large disturbance, limited water area and strong shore effect. Finally, the comparative test of berthing simulation verifies the superiority of the proposed control method. The autonomous berthing field experiment is completed based on the "Dolphin-I" small USV. It verifies the validity and feasibility of the proposed autonomous berthing method.

AB In this paper, the problem of the surveillance and the security of indoor environments is addressed through the development of an autonomous surveillance vehicle (ASV). The ASV has been designed to perform, in addition to the classical robotic tasks (e.g., navigation and obstacle avoiding), the tracking of objects (e.g., persons) moving in indoor environments. The selection of the target object to be tracked can be decided by a remote operator or autonomously by the ASV itself in the case that a suspicious behavior has been detected (e.g., a person entering a forbidden area, etc.). The tracking procedure allows the ASV to maintain the interesting objects in the center of the image and in specific cases to localize particular parts of the object (e.g., face of a person, etc.) in order to recognize it. Experimental results have been performed on different real scenarios where no objects move inside the monitored scene and where a group of people move in a hallway.

AB Bounding satellites' nominal measurement errors to calculate the protection level (PL) of the position error is a salient step of integrity monitoring of positioning autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this work, the focus is on applying the network RTK approach which is a suitable technique for precise positioning of AVs. A measurement weighting matrix formed from the overbounding standard deviation (STD) and considers the correlation among differenced observations was developed to achieve conservative PLs. Two approaches were designed to estimate the overbounding parameters and compute the correlation coefficients using one full year of different satellites measurements from multiple constellations. The Two-Step Gaussian Bounding method is used to calculate the overbounding parameters. The overbounding mean and STD of both code and phase observation errors for both approaches were in the range of 0.0003-1.369 m and 0.007-2.497 m, respectively. While the first approach provides a tight overbounding results, the second is more conservative.

AB Family farming in Brazil is responsible for the country's food security, ensuring most of the food consumed by Brazilians. However, the agricultural machinery and equipment industry has not been dedicated to providing innovations to this sector, focusing mainly on supplying large agribusiness properties with the most advanced technology equipment. Thus, the introduction of new technological solutions regarding agricultural machines for family farming is necessary. Considering the need to supply this branch of the Brazilian agricultural sector with new technologies, this study aimed to establish the design specifications of an autonomous electric vehicle that serves as a multifunction platform, which was primarily designed to remove weeds, mainly meeting the needs of family farmers. The product development methodology in its informational phase was applied to obtain and study these needs. As a result, 19 design specifications were established with their associated target values, allowing defining the physical and economic parameters that will be the basis for the development of the autonomous electric vehicle in its conceptual phase.

AB This paper deals with the finite-time trajectory tracking problem for a typical 3-DOF (degree of freedom) autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) subjected to parametric uncertainties and environmental disturbances. Based on the nonsingular terminal sliding mode control (NTSMC) method, several separate classes of robust control inputs are designed to exactly steer all position states of the 3-DOF AVS to the desired paths during alterable finite times. By exploiting the Lyapunov stability theorem and using mathematical analysis, it is proven that all classes of designed robust control inputs are able to fulfill the mentioned finite-time tracking aim. Moreover, three applicable formulas (represented as several nonlinear inequalities) are extracted to determine the required total finite times for the suggested control schemes. Lastly, all designed control methods are numerically tested onto a benchmark 3-DOF AVS called CyberShip II. Provided computer-based numerical simulations (using MATLAB software) depicted the acceptable performance of the proposed control techniques.

AB A variable-fuzzy-predictor-based predictive control approach is presented to solve the dynamic trajectory tracking problem of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in a three-dimensional underwater environment. To adapt to the characteristics of AUV's motion such as nonlinearity and time-varying dynamics, a predictive controller framework is proposed based on a variable fuzzy predictor whose structure and parameters are both online adjusted. To achieve a precise estimation of AUV's motion, the variable multi-dimensional fuzzy predictor employs a sliding data window (SDW) as the system status observer, and uses the Delaunay triangulation partition method for model construction. The predictive control scheme takes advantages of the constraints-tolerance of predictive control, the uncertainty immunity of fuzzy logic calculation, and the adaptability of variable fuzzy model. The comparative simulation of the AUV trajectory tracking control is conducted in the scenario of underwater operation of an offshore platform, and the result demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy in respect of accuracy and stability.

AB Autonomous vehicles have been emerging over the past few years because of the sophisticated processing of data from different types of perception sensors, such as LiDAR, radar, and camera. Ground segmentation plays an important role in the sequence of data processing for environment perception tasks, as it can help to reduce the size of data to be processed and further decrease the overall computational time. However, the over-segmentation, under-segmentation, or slow-segmentation on non-flat surface usually occurs due to the characteristics of the 3D LIDAR data, such as occlusion in complex urban environment. To address these problems, in this paper, we proposed a probability occupancy grid-based approach for real-time ground segmentation by using a single LiDAR sensor. The effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method are evaluated and demonstrated by the real-time experiments that span different traffic scenarios from heavy traffic to light traffic.

AB In this paper, a highly non-linear model with six degrees of freedom (DOF) is used for the manoeuvring and depth control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). A simplified scheme to design a conventional fuzzy logic controller known as robust Proportional Derivative (PD)-like Fuzzy Controller (PD-FZ) is designed separately for diving and steering subsystems of an AUV and then applied for combined steering, diving and speed control functions. Simulation results are shown by using the slender form of the Naval Post-Graduate School (NPS, Monterey, CA) AUV. Results of simulation studies using a nonlinear AUV dynamics are presented under the presence of any bounded ocean currents orwave disturbances and results show that proposed controller gives robust performance against these disturbances and modeling nonlinearity. Waypoint acquisition based on line of sight guidance is used to achieve path tracking.

AB This paper analyzes the motion planning of a custom-built all position autonomous mobile welding robot. It proposes a novel motion planning method that allows the robot to complete fillet seam welding while the vehicle turns around the right angle seam simultaneously. The global optimal solution is obtained through model modification.
   Note to Practitioners-This paper is motivated by the problem of turning and welding of a custom-built all position autonomous mobile welding robot system. This type of welding is pervasive in the metal fabrication industry. But to produce smooth fillet welding while the mobile vehicle turns simultaneously proves to be challenging. This paper presents two optimization models that calculate the best initial position and the turning radius of the robot vehicle, respectively. Furthermore, global optimal solution is obtained through model optimization.

AB Present study discusses prelimary design of sea glider autonomous underwater vehicle platform referred to as ITB-SGAUV. AUV is designed to be compact in size, with the purpose of exploring and monitoring marine living resources. Its hardware is designed to be reconfigurable enabling the researchers to change the placement of the sensors for testing different navigation scenarios. Hardware and software components are designed to be re-usable, which reduces the development and testing time. A low-cost sea glider has 1 degree-of-freedom utilizing buoyancy driver (glider) with fiberglass hull material that can operate up to a depth of 200 meters. Experimental result demonstrates that the sea glider works well in ascent and descent motion with maximum slope 30 degree. Maximum yaw angle is set to +3/-3 degree relative with respect to North. Thus it is expected that the sea glider can be used effectively in real environment. Future works include modeling the dynamic of the AUV and its advanced control design, along with its sea-trial.

ID AVOIDANCE
AB We propose real-time path planning schemes employing limited information for fully autonomous unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) in a hostile environment. Two main algorithms are proposed under different assumptions on the information used and the threats involved. They consist of several simple (computationally tractable) deterministic rules for real-time applications. The first algorithm uses extremely limited information (only the probabilistic risk in the surrounding area with respect to the UAV's current position) and memory, and the second utilizes more knowledge (the location and strength of threats within the UAV's sensory range) and memory. Both algorithms provably converge to a given target point and produce a series of safe waypoints whose risk is almost less than a given threshold value. In particular, we characterize a class of dynamic threats (so-called, static-dependent threats) so that the second algorithm can efficiently handle such dynamic threats while guaranteeing its convergence to a given target. Challenging scenarios are used to test the proposed algorithms. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cellular vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications can support advanced cooperative driving applications such as vehicle platooning and extended sensing. As the safety critical applications require ultra-low communication latency and deterministic service guarantee, it is vital to characterize the latency upper bound of cellular V2V communications. However, the contention-based Medium Access Control (MAC) and dynamic vehicular network topology brings many challenges to model the upper bound of cellular V2V communication latency and assess the link capability for quality of service (QoS) guarantee. In this paper, we are motivated to reduce the research gap by modelling the latency upper bound of cellular V2V with network calculus. Based on the theoretical model, the probability distribution of the delay upper bound can be obtained under the given task features and environment conditions. Moreover, we propose an intelligent scheme to reduce upper bound of end-to-end latency in vehicular platoon scenario by adaptively adjusting the V2V communication parameters. In the proposed scheme, a deep reinforcement learning model is trained and implemented to control the time slot selection probability and the number of time slots in each frame. The proposed approaches and the V2V latency upper bound are evaluated by simulation experiments. Simulation results indicate that our network calculus based analytical approach is effective in terms of the latency upper bound estimations. In addition, with fast iterative convergence, the proposed intelligent scheme can significantly reduce the latency by about 80% compared with the conventional V2V communication protocols.

AB This paper describes a fluid simulation application for the generation of driving trajectories in a simulated environment. The proposed method translates a segmented view from a front-facing camera into a top-down view of a road network, which is used as a river system where fluid flow is being simulated. Inspired by the natural phenomenon of water particles navigating complex riverbed obstacles, the driving trajectory is planned by tracing the simulated fluid flow. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed solution, the method was tested in several driving scenarios proposed in state-of-the-art papers, including navigating traffic and obstacles in city and highway environments. This solution shows that even very complex tasks can be solved using elegant nature-inspired approaches.

AB Recent developments indicate that emerging technologies like connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and mobility-on-demand services and their possible integrations can revolutionize travel behavior. Recent research studies also establish the importance of peer inputs and media advertisements in expediting the adoption of such emerging technologies. This study quantifies individuals' ranking preference towards multiple CAV-based travel modalities (owned, ride-hailing, carpooled, and public transport) based on psychological constructs-capturing the perceptions of the CAV-related information received from their peers and advertisements-using a statewide survey and hybrid choice model. Results indicate individuals' increased concern towards their social status and barriers associated with CAVs when adopting a CAV-based travel mode. Also, individuals prioritize peer input over media advertisements and CAV-based ride-hailing services over other modalities. This study's findings and inferred implications will offer policymakers and public agencies valuable information to measure end-users ' inclinations to rank and adopt CAV-based travel modalities.

AB YThe landing task is fundamental to Micro air vehicles (MAVs) when attempting to land in an unpredictable environment (e.g., presence of static obstacles or moving obstacles). The MAV should immediately detect the environment through its sensors and decide its actions for landing. This paper addresses the problem of the autonomous landing approach of a commercial AR. Drone 2.0 in presence of uncertain obstacles in an indoor environment. A localization methodology to estimate the drone's pose based on the sensor fusion techniques which fuses IMU and Poxyz signals is proposed. In addition, a vision-based approach to detect and estimate the velocity, position of the moving obstacle in the drone's working environment is presented. To control the drone landing accurately, a cascade control based on an Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (APSO) is designed. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the obtained model is appropriate for the measured data.

AB The motion control of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has got more and more attention because AUV has been used in many applications in recent years. In order to find the optimal path for AUV to reach the specified destination in complex undersea environment, an improved ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed. Due to the various constraints, such as the limited energy and limited visual distance, the improved ACO algorithm uses improved pheromone update rule and heuristic function based on PSO algorithm to make AUV find the optimal path by connecting the chosen nodes of the undersea environment while avoiding the collision with the complex undersea terrain (static obstacles). The improved ACO algorithm based on PSO algorithm can overcome disadvantages of the traditional ACO algorithm, such as falling into local extremum, poor quality, and low accuracy. Experiment results demonstrate that improved ACO algorithm is more effective and feasible in path planning for autonomous underwater vehicle than the traditional ant colony algorithm.

AB This paper addresses localization of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) from acoustic time-of-flight measurements received by a field of surface floating buoys. It is assumed that measurements are corrupted by unknown-but-bounded errors, with known bounds. The localization problem is tackled in a set-membership framework and an algorithm is presented, which produces as output the set of admissible AUV positions in a three-dimensional (3-D) space. The algorithm is tailored for a shallow water situation (water depth less than 500 m), and accounts for realistic variations of the sound speed profile in sea water. The approach is validated by simulations in which uncertainty models have been obtained from field data at sea. Localization performance of the algorithm are shown comparable with those previously reported in the literature by other approaches who assume knowledge of the statistics of measurement uncertainties. Moreover, guaranteed uncertainty regions associated to nominal position estimates are provided. The proposed algorithms can be used as a viable alternative to more traditional approaches in realistic at-sea conditions.

AB This paper investigates the robust tracking control problem of disturbed unknown autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs), and whereby a sliding-mode-control-based model-free tracking control (SMTC) approach by the combination of sliding-mode control and data-driven backstepping techniques is innovatively devised. By deploying a data-driven backstepping sliding-mode surface, a robust modelfree adaptive controller is designed to achieve strong adaptability and robustness to unknown couplings, uncertainties and disturbances. Besides, a data-driven adaptive law based on disturbance observer and feedforward control strategies is effectively developed to estimate these unknowns, and thereafter the estimation is served as the compensation within the controller. Rigorous analysis proves that asymptotic tracking performance and strong robustness can be guaranteed theoretically. Lastly, simulation studies for the ASV are explored to demonstrate the validity and superiority of the devised SMTC approach in terms of disturbance attenuation, nonlinearity adaption, and high accurate tracking.(c) 2022 ISA.

AB With model uncertainties and input saturation, a novel control method is developed to steer an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle that realizes the following of the planned path in three-dimensional (3D) space. Firstly, Serret-Frenet frame is applied as virtual target, and the path following errors model in 3D is built. Secondly, the control method which includes kinematic controller and dynamic controller was presented based on cascade control strategy. The kinematic controller, which is responsible for generating a series of constrained velocity signals, is designed based on model predictive control. The adaptive radial basis function neural network is used to estimate the model uncertainty caused by hydrodynamic parameters. Moreover, sliding mode control technology is applied in the design of dynamic controller to improve its robustness. Then, the control effect is compared with that of LOS guidance law and PID controller by simulation experiment. The comparison results show that the proposed algorithm can improve path following effect and reduce input saturation.

AB In this paper, a new concept of formation learning control is introduced to the field of formation control of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), which specifies a joint objective of distributed formation tracking control and learning/ identification of nonlinear uncertain AUV dynamics. A novel two-layer distributed formation learning control scheme is proposed, which consists of an upper-layer distributed adaptive observer and a lower-layer decentralized deterministic learning controller. This new formation learning control scheme advances existing techniques in three important ways: 1) the multi-AUV system under consideration has heterogeneous nonlinear uncertain dynamics; 2) the formation learning control protocol can be designed and implemented by each local AUV agent in a fully distributed fashion without using any global information; and 3) in addition to the formation control performance, the distributed control protocol is also capable of accurately identifying the AUVs' heterogeneous nonlinear uncertain dynamics and utilizing experiences to improve formation control performance. Extensive simulations have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.

AB Marine traffic rules play an important role for all marine vessels to reduce the collision risk, thus The International Marine Organization (IMO) defined The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) in 1972. All marine crafts including Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) should follow COLREGs to avoid the collision when they encounter each other at sea or other water areas. However, the target ship may be located at the position which can cause collision if the ASV is forced to make a COLREGs compliant evasive manoeuvre. Thus, the navigation system of ASV is required to have the ability to identify the encounter situation and determine whether the ASV should obey the COLREGs or not when avoiding the target ship. To perform smart navigation and collision avoidance, the encounter situation division diagram is combined with Artificial Potential Field (APF) as the guidance system. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed guidance system successfully achieved the navigation of ASV at open sea and avoiding collision with moving target ship for different encounter situations.

AB We present a three-dimensional (3D) intersection traffic management platform for small autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), particularly quadcopters, in urban airspace. Assuming many autonomous UAVs are approaching a shared airspace, where UAVs have varying sources and destinations, we propose a system model for a 3D intersection that aims to provide safe and systematic management of UAVs. We also devised a scheduling scheme to ensure that the intersection is efficiently utilized and that there are no collisions among the UAVs in the intersection. The scheduling scheme applies the reservation-based approach, which is sensitive to the sequence of the UAVs in scheduling, thus genetic algorithm is used to determine the best sequence of the UAVs. Simulations were performed to evaluate the efficiency of the system. We also show through the simulations that our scheduling scheme reduces the UAVs' average time in the system by 27 percent compared with when the UAVs are scheduled in a first-come, first-served manner for the highly crowded intersection.

AB Precise navigation is essential for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The measurement deviation of the navigation sensors, especially the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors, is a crucial factor that affects the localization accuracy. Deep learning is a novel method to solve this problem. However, the calculation cycle and robustness of the deep learning method may be insufficient in practical application. This paper proposes an adaptive navigation algorithm with deep learning to address these questions and realize accurate navigation. Firstly, this algorithm uses deep learning to generate low-frequency position information to correct the error accumulation of the navigation system. Secondly, the chi 2 rule is selected to judge if the Doppler velocity log (DVL) measurement fails, which could avoid interference from DVL outliers. Thirdly, the adaptive filter, based on the variational Bayesian (VB) method, is employed to estimate the navigation information simultaneous with the measurement covariance, improving navigation accuracy even more. The experimental results, based on AUV field data, show that the proposed algorithm could realize robust navigation performance and significantly improve position accuracy.

AB This study presents a model to characterize changes in network traffic flows as a result of implementing connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology based on traffic network and built-environment characteristics. To develop such a model, first, the POLARIS agent-based modeling platform is used to predict changes in average daily traffic (ADT) under CAV scenario in the road network of Chicago metropolitan area as the dependent variable of the model. Second, a comprehensive set of variables and indicators representing network characteristics and urban structure patterns are generated. Finally, three machine learning techniques, namely, K-Nearest neighbors, Random Forest, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting, are used to characterize changes in ADT based on network characteristics under a CAV scenario. The estimated models are validated and are found to yield acceptable performance. In addition, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis tool is employed to investigate the impact of important features on changes in ADT.

AB This paper addresses the problem of three-dimensional trajectory tracking control for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles in the presence of parametric uncertainties, environmental disturbances and input saturation. First, a virtual guidance control strategy is established on the basis of tracking error kinematics, which resolves the overall control system into two cascade subsystems. Then, a first-order sliding mode differentiator is introduced in the derivation to avoid tedious analytic calculation, and a Gaussian error function-based continuous differentiable symmetric saturation model is explored to tackle the issue of input saturation. Combined with backstepping design techniques, the neural network control method and an adaptive control approach are used to estimate composite items of the unknown uncertainty and approximation errors. Meanwhile, Lyapunov-based stability analysis guarantees that control error signals of the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, simulation studies are conducted for the trajectory tracking of a moving target and a spiral line to validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

AB The following letter presents an adaptive path planning algorithm for cooperative localization in the maritime environment. It considers the scenario where an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) acts as a Communication and Navigation Aid (CNA) to support Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) with range measurements. As AUVs have no access to GPS while submerged, range measurements can bind the otherwise continuously growing navigational error. This can be done by methods such as range-only Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). In such methods, the resulting uncertainty and positional error depends on the geometry between transmitter (CNA) and receiver (AUV). This letter proposes a planning algorithm that combines priority based expansion of a search tree with random sampling-based exploration to position the CNA at strategic positions to transmit ranging messages at optimal times to reduce the uncertainty and error at theAUVs' position. The approach is validated and shows an increased confidence forAUVs' localization in simulated environments as well as real experiments using a dataset gathered from AUV Sirius.

AB Dynamic detection in challenging lighting environments is essential for advancing intelligent robots and autonomous vehicles. Traditional vision systems are prone to severe lighting conditions in which rapid increases or decreases in contrast or saturation obscures objects, resulting in a loss of visibility. By incorporating intelligent optimization of polarization into vision systems using the iNC (integrated nanoscopic correction), we introduce an intelligent real-time fusion algorithm to address challenging and changing lighting conditions. Through real-time iterative feedback, we rapidly select polarizations, which is difficult to achieve with traditional methods. Fusion images were also dynamically reconstructed using pixel-based weights calculated in the intelligent polarization selection process. We showed that fused images by intelligent polarization selection reduced the mean-square error by two orders of magnitude to uncover subtle features of occluded objects. Our intelligent real-time fusion algorithm also achieved two orders of magnitude increase in time performance without compromising image quality. We expect intelligent fusion imaging photonics to play increasingly vital roles in the fields of next generation intelligent robots and autonomous vehicles.

AB For trajectory tracking control problem of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with model uncertainties, unknown nonlinear external disturbances, and input saturation, an observer-based adaptive second-order sliding mode control scheme with prescribed performance is proposed. Firstly, a finite time performance function (FTPF) is constructed to constrain the tracking error to the prescribed precision within the preset finite time, and achieve the prescribed dynamic convergence performance and tracking accuracy. Then, a neural network-based distur-bance observer (NNDO) is designed to deal with model uncertainties and external disturbances, respectively. Based on prescribed performance control and sliding mode control technique, an adaptive prescribed perfor-mance second-order sliding mode control strategy was proposed. In addition, we construct an auxiliary system to overcome the effect of thrust saturation. Lyapunov method is applied to demonstrate the stability of the closed -loop system. Finally, the validity of the proposed control law is verified by numerical simulations.

ID MODEL
AB Range and bearing navigation is commonly used in many autonomous systems such as guided vehicles and freely moving robots. The obtained measurements are accompanied by noise and possible errors, which may lead to wrong decisions of the control and guidance system. An improved method, over Kalman filter with standard gates, of filtering unexpected high measurement noise due to clutter, glittering, or shaking of the measuring system, featuring minimum computational effort and minimum time, is suggested. Optimal variable correlation gates around the predicted values of the signal states - the Autonomous Guided Vehicle or its target/obstacle position - reduce the unexpected noise effect. Values of measurements out of these gates are not considered and the integration of the prediction model for the tracked signal continues until a new measurement is received within the gate opening. The dimensions of the correlation gates are determined by filter predictions and measurement error variances that are related to the probability of the unexpected high measurement noise and its approximated covariances.

AB Gas leaks from subsea oil and gas facilities could cause significant ocean environment damage. Such leaks can cause fire and explosion, for example, a fire on the ocean surface west of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. Detecting a gas leak is critical in managing fire and explosion risks. This study proposes using autonomous underwater vehicles-robotic fish-for gas leak plume detection. The robotic fish is equipped with advance two well-known deep learning models, Faster RCNN and YOLOV4. A physical experiment system of various sizes of underwater gas leaks is used to generate the benchmark dataset. The results demonstrated the YOLOV4 model has a stronger online real-time capability. It is 43 times faster than the Faster RCNN model with the same level of accuracy. This study verifies the feasibility of integrating deep learning models with the mobile vehicle for real-time autono-mous gas leak detection. This contribution will enable the development of a safe and reliable digital twin of subsea emergency management.

AB For an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), control surfaces are usually used for high-speed manoeuvres, while at low speed the AUV relies upon through-body thrusters for manoeuvring. In this paper, the speed intervals of high-speed and low-speed manoeuvres are quantitatively analyzed. To this end, the AUV's dynamics equations composed of body hydrodynamics and actuator models are first established with specific regard to operation at different speeds. Resorting to the above complete dynamics model, turning manoeuvring tests are carried out to forecast the AUV's advance and turning time at different speeds. Initial turning ability criterion approved by International Maritime Organization is then used to calculate thresholds for low-speed and highspeed manoeuvres. Due to non-overlap, the entire speed profile is divided into low-speed, medium-speed and high-speed intervals, where different actuator combinations and characteristics are analyzed. Finally, a smooth switching law is designed to manage the contribution of two types of actuators through the entire AUV's speed profile.

AB For robots to succeed in complex missions, they must be reliable in the face of subsystem failures and environmental challenges. In this paper, we focus on autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) autonomy as it pertains to self-perception and health monitoring, and we argue that automatic classification of state-sensor data represents an important enabling capability. We apply an online Bayesian nonparametric topic modeling technique to AUV sensor data in order to automatically characterize its performance patterns, then demonstrate how in combination with operator-supplied semantic labels these patterns can be used for fault detection and diagnosis by means of a nearest-neighbor classifier. The method is evaluated using data collected by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute's Tethys long-range AUV in three separate field deployments. Our results show that the proposed method is able to accurately identify and characterize patterns that correspond to various states of the AUV, and classify faults at a high rate of correct detection with a very low false detection rate.

AB The use of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) survey method for population density estimates of Iceland scallops Chlamys islandica (O.F. Muller) was evaluated. The main focus was on statistical evaluations and survey design. The underlying objective was to illustrate how a repeated AUV survey approach can be used to generate variance estimates of population parameters to verify statistical precision of population density estimates. As a case study, 5 small-scale surveys were conducted at a site off West Iceland. The scallops were enumerated visually from a random selection of photos of the seafloor and the count data were used to estimate mean scallop population abundance with confidence limits. A nested random effects model yielded no significant difference among the 5 surveys, showing that such small-scale surveys are repeatable. The application was small scale, but the methodologies established can be applied to larger areas of a similar nature.

AB The accumulated positioning errors are required to be eliminated after a long run-up of an underwater vehicle equipped with an inertial navigation system (INS). Tor the better position accuracy with less cost, a single-source aided passive location method is proposed, which applies acoustic positioning together with inertial navigation. The fixed sound source periodically emits the acoustic wave pulse under water. After a number of signals are received, a high-precision synthetic array is built with the positions measured by inertial instruments and clock on board. Then, the source is located by time-difference-of-arrival positioning technology and the navigation error of the moving vehicle is reduced. Different from fully autonomous, there is a radiation source and sound is provided as intermediary locally. It is independent of the control and the algorithm. The operation and calculation are performed on the vehicle, so it is called semi-autonomous. Multiple users are supported simultaneously. Since no radiation is sent from the vehicle, it is extremely concealed. More importantly, it is inexpensive and the accuracy has nothing to do with the amount of error before. In the simulation, the position error could be suppressed to 50 m or less. The results show that the new approach for underwater positioning is effective and reliable. After a period of time, INS error can be eliminated quickly when the vehicle returns to the correction area within the range of the single-source. In this way, long-time and accurate navigation is realized underwater.

TI Adaptive Collision-Free Trajectory Tracking Control for String Stable

ID BARRIER LYAPUNOV FUNCTIONS; SLIDING MODE CONTROL
AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) platoons, especially those with the bidirectional communication topology, have significant practical value, as they not only increase link capacity and reduce vehicle energy consumption, but also reduce the consumption of communication resources. Small gaps between AVs in a platoon easily lead to emergency braking or even collisions between consecutive AVs. This paper applies barrier Lyapunov functions to collision avoidance between AVs in a bidirectional platoon during trajectory tracking. Based on backstepping technique, an adaptive collision-free platoon trajectory tracking control algorithm is developed to distributedly design control laws for each AV in the platoon. The control algorithm does not need to introduce additional car-following models to simulate AV driving, and only needs to integrate the position trajectories of consecutive AVs to avoid inter-vehicle collisions. Two sign functions are introduced into the control laws of each AV to ensure strong string stability for bidirectional AV platoons. Moreover, uncertainties and external disturbances in vehicle motion are effectively compensated by introducing adaptation laws. Strong string stability is rigorously proved. CarSIM-based comparison simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm in avoiding inter-vehicle collisions, compensating for uncertainties in vehicle motion, and suppressing the amplification of spacing errors along the platoon.

ID NAVIGATION
AB Underwater navigation that relies solely on dead reckoning (DR) suffers from unbounded position error growth. A common approach for alleviating the problem is to have the underwater vehicle surface occasionally for a Global Positioning System (GPS) fix, at the risk of jeopardizing the vehicle's safety and consuming precious mission time. Other alternatives include deploying a long-baseline (LBL) acoustic positioning system in the mission area; this involves substantial deployment effort. The idea of having active mobile beacons as navigational aids has recently gained interest. We explore the use of a single-beacon vehicle for range-only localization to support other autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Specifically, we focus on cooperative path-planning algorithms for the beacon vehicle using dynamic programming and Markov decision process formulations. These formulations take into account and minimize the positioning errors being accumulated by the supported AUV. This approach avoids the use of LBL acoustic positioning systems as well as allows the supported AUV to remain submerged for a longer period of time with small position error. Simulation results and field trials data demonstrate that the beacon vehicle is able to help keep the position error of the supported AUV small via acoustic range measurements.

AB The Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm is a reinforcement learning algorithm that combines Q-learning with a policy. Nevertheless, this algorithm generates failures that are not well understood. Rather than looking for those errors, this study presents a way to evaluate the suitability of the results obtained. Using the purpose of autonomous vehicle navigation, the DDPG algorithm is applied, obtaining an agent capable of generating trajectories. This agent is evaluated in terms of stability through the Lyapunov function, verifying if the proposed navigation objectives are achieved. The reward function of the DDPG is used because it is unknown if the neural networks of the actor and the critic are correctly trained. Two agents are obtained, and a comparison is performed between them in terms of stability, demonstrating that the Lyapunov function can be used as an evaluation method for agents obtained by the DDPG algorithm. Verifying the stability at a fixed future horizon, it is possible to determine whether the obtained agent is valid and can be used as a vehicle controller, so a task-satisfaction assessment can be performed. Furthermore, the proposed analysis is an indication of which parts of the navigation area are insufficient in training terms.

AB In recent years, using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for submarine missions has increased substantially. One of the problems in controlling these nonlinear devices is the possibility of a fault in the system operators. Failure causes increased operating costs and reduced vehicle performance. Therefore, the use of fault tolerance control is essential to ensure the stability and ability of the device to continue its activity. The focus of this article is on the trajectory tracking control for an underactuated AUV with actuator faults using kinematics and dynamics modeling. An adaptive rule is used as an online estimation to compensate for malfunctions in robot performance. In this regard, the adaptive fault-tolerant control plan is proposed, so that the closed-loop system is stable, and all control objectives are achievable. At first, the dynamic model of AUV with actuator fault and disturbance is described. Next, the control algorithm is designed for trajectory tracking in the presence of time-varying disturbances and actuator faults. The proposed adaptive rules will overcome disturbances and actuator faults. Finally, to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the provided controller is compared with other common control methods.

AB The combination of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and free-floating car-sharing scheme is expected to deliver high potentials of both through effective AV self-relocations. Little research has been done on the deployment of shared AVs (SAVs) considering the interplays among SAV relocations, supply-demand dynamics, and travelers' multi-modal multi-activity schedules. This study aims to propose a bi-level system optimal model inclusive of a new hub-based relocation strategy to moderate the supply and demand of SAVs. The lower-level captures travelers' activity-travel scheduling behavior by an extended dynamic user equilibrium model and the upper-level determines the hub locations, fleet size, and initial distribution of SAVs. A heuristic algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation is developed to solve the network design problem. Numerical examples demonstrate that SAV relocations can significantly influence travelers' daily schedules and enhance mobility efficiency in the multi-modal transport system. We also find that the proposed hub-based relocation strategy outperforms two common SAV relocation strategies in the literature. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB As the widespread use of autonomous vehicles (AVs) becomes increasingly likely, an important consideration is the extent to which individuals prefer either private ownership or shared use modes. Both modes are currently evolving, each with distinct but overlapping challenges. Understanding the preferences of different population segments can provide insights into where to focus initial efforts to attract individuals into the market, especially in terms of promoting the uptake of shared AVs to optimise the potential positive outcomes of AVs (e.g., crash reduction) while reducing possible negative outcomes (e.g., increased congestion). The results from a sample of 1345 Australians aged 16 + years (97% of whom were drivers) were analysed using latent profile analysis. Five discrete classes were identified on the basis of their (i) self-reported knowledge of AVs; (ii) perceptions of the positive and negative outcomes of AVs; and (iii) AV usage intentions. The classes were titled Non-adopters (29% of the sample), Ride-sharing (20%), AV ambivalent (19%), Likely adopters (17%), and First movers (14%). The results indicate the types of individuals who may be most likely to be early adopters and the implications for public policies designed to encourage socially optimal forms of adoption.

AB The 3D point cloud data collected by 3D lidars have become a significant resource for autonomous vehicles to acquire road information. But these data tend to be inaccurate due to the turning or moving of autonomous vehicles while the lidar is working. Moreover, the traditional Euclidean clustering algorithm often causes false detection in the vicinity or missed detection in the distance if the Euclidean distance threshold is not selected properly. This paper proposes a method which contains three main steps to solve these problems: First, a de-distortion algorithm is applied to diminish the influence of distortion caused by the moving and turning of lidar; second, optimize the structure of the Euclidean clustering algorithm to make it run faster; and third, we applied an adaptive threshold of the Euclidean distance in the improved algorithm, so the improved algorithm is able to detect the relatively small objects in the distance while it can also detect the objects nearby without misjudgment. These features are all confirmed by the results of vehicle experiments which shows that with the help of proposed method, the distortion of point cloud reduced, the detection distance has increased by nearly 8 meters, and the clustering speed has also increased by 15%.

AB This paper studies the energy and traffic impact of a proposed Anticipative Cruise Controller in a PTV VISSIM microsimulation environment. We dissect our controller into two parts: 1. the unconnected mode, active when following a human-driven vehicle, and 2. the connected mode, active when following another automated vehicle equipped with connectivity. Probabilistic constraints balance safety considerations with inter-vehicle compactness, and vehicle constraints for acceleration capabilities are expressed through the use of powertrain maps. Emergent highway traffic scenarios are then modeled using time headway distributions from empirical traffic data. To study the impact of automation over a range of demands of free-flow to stop-and -go, we vary vehicle flux from low to high and vary automated vehicle penetration from low to high. When examining all-human driving scenarios, network capacity failed to meet demand in high-volume scenarios, such as rush-hour traffic. We further find that with connected automated vehicles introduced, network capacity was improved to support the high-volume scenarios. Finally, we examine energy efficiencies of the fleet for conventional, electric, and hybrid vehicles. We find that automated vehicles perform at a 10%-20% higher energy efficiency over human drivers when considering conventional powertrains, and find that automated vehicles perform at a 3%-9% higher energy efficiency over human drivers when considering electric and hybrid powertrains. Due to secondary effects of smoothing traffic flow and reducing unnecessary braking, energy benefits also apply to human-driven vehicles that interact with automated ones. Such simulated humans were found to drive up to 10% more energy-efficiently than they did in the baseline all-human scenario.

AB Autonomous vehicles are at the forefront of interest due to the expectations of changing transportation for the better. In order to make better decisions on the road, vehicles use information from various sources: their own sensors, messages arriving from surrounding vehicles and objects, as well as from centralized entities-including their own Digital Twin. Certain decisions require the information to arrive with low latency and some of this information (such as video) requires broadband communication. Furthermore, the vehicles can populate an area, so they can represent mass communication endpoints that still need low latency and massive broadband. The mobility of the vehicles obviously requires the complete coverage of the roads with reliable wireless communication technologies fulfilling the previously mentioned needs. The fifth generation of cellular mobile technologies, 5G, addresses these requirements. The current paper presents real-life scenarios-on the M86 highway and the ZalaZONE proving ground in Hungary-for the demonstration of vehicular communication with 5G support, where the cars exchange sensor and control information with each other, their environment, and their Digital Twins. The demonstrations were carried out through the Scenario-in-the-Loop (SciL) methodology, where some of the actionable triggers were not physically present around the vehicles, but sensed or simulated around their Digital Twin. The measurements around the demonstrations aim to reveal the feasibility of the 5G Non-Standalone Architecture for certain communication scenarios, and they mainly aim to reveal the current latency and throughput limitations under real-life conditions.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) play an increasingly important role in underwater missions. However, traditional visual localization methods struggle to meet the accuracy requirements for AUV terminal docking in strong-illumination or turbid water conditions. This work proposes a universal navigation system using electromagnetic (EM) and light beacons for nontorpedo AUVs to be recovered using a planar docking station. The major challenge in designing this system is to deal with the incomplete sensing of the light and EM beacons. To solve this problem, a two-step fusion method of EM localization information is given first. The kinematic model of the AUV and visual information are also utilized to improve the robustness of the navigation system. Based on the localization result, a comprehensive docking strategy is proposed to address the time-varying sensing conditions. Localization and docking experiments were conducted in a pool. The test results show that the maximum EM localization error is less than 20 cm in both static and dynamic tests. The AUV completed all six docking attempts.

AB This paper investigates the finite-time tracking problem for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the presence of external disturbance and modelling uncertainty. A finite-time tracking control scheme is proposed based on an improved non-singular terminal sliding mode manifold. Firstly, in order to achieve finite-time stability and avoid singular problem, a continuous and smooth non-singular terminal sliding mode manifold is designed based on a piecewise function. And then a continuous control law is designed by indirectly estimating the bound of the general uncertainty, to compensate the external disturbance and modelling uncertainty. Based on the Lyapunov stability analysis, it is verified that the tracking error can converge to a certain range near zero in a finite time. Finally, the proposed control scheme is applied to ODIN AUV and compared with another two finite-time tracking controllers. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

ID ACOUSTIC SENSOR NETWORKS; NAVIGATION; TRACKING
AB In underwater acoustic sensor networks, long baseline localization for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) requires distance estimation that always encounters severe problems: (a) Time-synchronization is hard to achieve in underwater environment, which baffles ranging methods based on the synchronized time. (b) Long propagation delay of acoustic signals and the impact of AUVs' mobility make it rash to use the round trip ranging (RTR) technology. (c) Sound speed uncertainty enlarges the inaccuracy of distance estimation. This work addresses those problems above and proposes an AUVs self-localization algorithm with accurate sound travel time solution (SL-STTS), which is time-synchronization free and ranging optimization based. Simulation results show that under the measurement noise of time and angles, the root mean square error of SL-STTS is decreased by about 8-79% compared with the counterparts. In addition the average distance estimation error of SL-STTS is declined by 42% compared with RTR. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Efficiency and safety are two crucial aspects that have garnered significant attention in the context of traffic networks. The investigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in terms of efficiency and safety in a traffic network is a relatively new topic, and there have not been many practical developments reported so far. However, despite the availability of information, it is scattered across fragments within multiple resources dealing with efficiency and safety under the influence of AVs. Therefore, this study focused on the effect of efficiency and safety under the influence of AVs in a traffic network and provides an overview of the main research outcomes in this field. The review then delves into the challenges and opportunities associated with integrating AVs into existing traffic systems. The methodologies and approaches used in analyzing the effects of AVs are also explored. This review identifies critical gaps in knowledge and suggests future research directions to further enhance the understanding of how AVs can contribute to the efficiency and safety of traffic networks. Finally, this study offers valuable insights and guidance for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners involved in the planning, design, and management of transportation systems as they navigate the integration of AVs into traffic networks.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) scenarios have more stringent requirements on the communication rate, de-lay, and reliability of the Internet of vehicles (IoV). New radio vehicle to everything (NR-V2X) adopts link adaptation (LA) to improve the efficiency and re-liability of road safety information transmission. In or-der to solve the problem that the existing LA schedul-ing algorithms cannot adapt to the Doppler shift and complex fast time-varying channel in V2I scenario, re -sulting in low reliability of information transmission, this paper proposes a deep Q-learning (DQL)-based massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) LA scheduling algorithm for autonomous driving V2I sce-nario. The algorithm combines deep neural network (DNN) with Q-learning (QL) algorithm, which is used for joint scheduling of modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and space division multiplexing (SDM). The system simulation results show that the algorithm pro-posed in this paper can fully adapt to the different channel environment in the V2I scenario, and select the optimal MCS and SDM for the transmission of road safety information, thereby the accuracy of road safety information transmission is improved, colli-sion accidents can be avoided, and bring a good au-tonomous driving experience.

AB With the development of artificial intelligence and wireless communication technology, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have been treated as a promising strategy to increase road capacity and mitigate traffic congestion. Besides the technology of CAVs, innovative intersection design was also originally introduced as a countermeasure for dealing with traffic congestion at intersections. Though many studies have been conducted to explore the benefits of CAVs under various transportation scenarios, few have been implemented to explore the impact of CAVs on traffic flow at innovative intersections. Hence, to achieve a better understanding of the impacts of CAVs on existing transportation infrastructure, this study conducts a simulation-based study to investigate the operational performance of CAVs with available Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) information in the environment of typical innovative intersection design, i.e. superstreets. The impact of CAVs with different market penetration rates on the operational performance of a superstreet is identified. The operational performance of the superstreet increases as the market penetration rate increases overall. Average speed and average traffic delay for vehicles in the superstreet system can be improved with the increase of market penetration rates.

ID POINT CLOUD
AB The object detection algorithm based on vehicle-mounted lidar is a key component of the perception system on autonomous vehicles. It can provide high-precision and highly robust obstacle information for the safe driving of autonomous vehicles. However, most algorithms are often based on a large amount of point cloud data, which makes real-time detection difficult. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a 3D fast object detection method based on three main steps: First, the ground segmentation by discriminant image (GSDI) method is used to convert point cloud data into discriminant images for ground points segmentation, which avoids the direct computing of the point cloud data and improves the efficiency of ground points segmentation. Second, the image detector is used to generate the region of interest of the three-dimensional object, which effectively narrows the search range. Finally, the dynamic distance threshold clustering (DDTC) method is designed for different density of the point cloud data, which improves the detection effect of long-distance objects and avoids the over-segmentation phenomenon generated by the traditional algorithm. Experiments have showed that this algorithm can meet the real-time requirements of autonomous driving while maintaining high accuracy.

DT Article
AB To improve the multidirectional motion control accuracy and driving stability of Distributed Drive Autonomous Vehicles (DDAVs) under extreme conditions, the extreme speed estimation method based on dynamic boundary and the multidirectional motion coupling control law design method based on multi degrees of freedom vehicle dynamic model are proposed. The extreme speed estimation method identifies the stable state of DDAVs by the dynamic boundary composed of yaw rate, sideslip angle and roll angle, and then estimates the extreme speed of the vehicle. The design method of multidirectional motion coupling control law adopts eight-degrees-of-freedom (8-DOF) vehicle dynamic model to design path tracking control law, speed tracking control law, yaw stability control law, and active suspension control law at the same time, so as to realize multidirectional motion coupling control. Based on the above method, the Multidirectional Motion Coupling Control System (MMCCS) of DDAVs is designed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by double-line-shifting and serpentine driving simulations under different road adhesion conditions. The superiority of the method is proved by comparing the existing integrated control method.

DE Optimal vehicle manoeuvring; at-the-limit operation; force allocation
AB Autonomous vehicles allow utilisation of new optimal driving approaches that increase vehicle safety by combining optimal all-wheel braking and steering even at the limit of tyre-road friction. One important case is an avoidance manoeuvre that, in previous research, for example, has been approached by different optimisation formulations. An avoidance manoeuvre is typically composed of an evasive phase avoiding an obstacle followed by a recovery phase where the vehicle returns to normal driving. Here, an analysis of the different aspects of the recovery phase is presented, and a subsequent formulation is developed in several steps based on theory and simulation of a double lane-change scenario. Each step leads to an extension of the optimisation criterion. Two key results are a theoretical redundancy analysis of wheel-torque distribution and the subsequent handling of it. The overall contribution is a general treatment of the recovery phase in an optimisation framework, and the method is successfully demonstrated for three different formulations: lane-deviation penalty, minimum time, and squared lateral-error norm.

AB The vehicle collision warning system (CWS) is an important research and application subject for vehicle safety. Most of this topic's research focuses on autonomous CWSs, where each vehicle detects potential collisions based entirely on the information measured by itself. Recently, an alternative scenario has arisen. This scenario is known as cooperative driving, where either the vehicle or the infrastructure can communicate its location, intention, or other information to surrounding vehicles or nearby infrastructure. Since installing a low-cost global-positioning-system (GPS) unit is becoming a common practice in vehicle applications, its implications in cooperative driving and vehicle safety deserve closer investigation. Furthermore, the future trajectory prediction may lead to a straightforward approach to detect potential collisions, yet its effectiveness has not been studied. This paper explores the engineering feasibility of a future-trajectory-prediction-based cooperative CWS when vehicles are equipped with a relatively simple differential GPS unit and relatively basic motion sensors. The goals of this paper are twofold: providing an engineering argument of possible functional architectures of such systems and presenting a plausible example of the proposed future-trajectory-based design, which estimates and communicates vehicle positions and predicts and processes future trajectories for collision decision making. In this paper, common GPS problems such as blockage and multipath, as well as common communication problems such as dropout and delays, are assumed. However, specific choices of GPS devices and communication protocol or systems are not the focus of this paper.

AB The demand for and the scope of connected services have rapidly grown and developed in many industries such as electronic appliances, robotics, and industry automation. In the automotive field, including connected vehicles, different types of connected services have become available and they provide convenience and comfort with users while yielding new business opportunities. With the advent of connected vehicles, the threat of cyber attacks has become a serious issue and protection methods against these attacks are urgently needed to provide safe and secure connected services. From 2017, attack methods have become more sophisticated through different attack surfaces attached to navigation systems and telematics modules, and security requirements to circumvent such attacks have begun to be established. Individual threats have been addressed previously; however, there are few reports that provide an overview of cyber security related to connected vehicles. This paper gives our perspective on cyber security for connected vehicles based on a survey of recent studies related to vehicle security. To introduce these studies, the environment surrounding connected vehicles is classified into three categories: inside the vehicle, communications between the back-end systems and vehicles, and the back-end systems. In each category, this paper introduces recent trends in cyber attacks and the protection requirements that should be developed for connected services. We show that the overall security covering the three categories must be considered because the security of the vehicle is jeopardized even if one item in the categories is not covered. We believe that this paper will further contribute to development of all service systems related to connected vehicles including autonomous vehicles and to the investigation into cyber security against these attacks.

AB Compared to conventional private vehicles (CPVs), shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) provide users the potential for the reduced value of time (VoT), improved mobility experience, and less traffic congestion. In the presence of the SAV system, numerous studies have mainly concentrated on the strategic planning and operational decision problem separately while ignoring the complicated interaction between them and the distinct features of autonomous vehicles. It is imperative to determine the relocation and pricing strategies at the operational level. In this study, in terms of the pricing strategy, we formalize a logit model to capture the mode choice behavior in a multimodal network, where the reduced VoT is considered simultaneously. A time-space network is employed to capture the daily operation problem based on the elastic demand. The minimum customer service rate is regarded as a constraint to ensure the system's reliability. Moreover, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is formulated to jointly determine the number of stations and parking spaces, fleet size, relocation, and pricing strategies to maximize the total profit. Then, we integrate the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm with the optimization solver Gurobi to address the complex problem. Numerical experiments and comparative analyses are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed model.

AB The relationship between drivers and their cars is increasingly personal, where the cars become an extension of the drivers' self-identity. However, the penetration of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology threatens consumers' self-identity as expressed by the act of driving. This study thus aims to examine the impacts of technology-identity concerns on consumers' acceptance of AV technology. Theories of identity threat, identity control and innovation diffusion are synthesised to build the conceptual framework. Face-to-face interview data were collected from 353 consumers (all with a driving license) in Singapore. The results show that consumers' technology anxiety and self-identity expressiveness act as two sources of resistance that cause consumers' intentional avoidance of the AV technology. The avoidance is further characterised by consumers' disengagement from the 'observe' and 'try' stages of technology penetration, which ultimately dissuades consumers' acceptance of AV technology. The impacts of socio-demographics are also explored. Our findings contribute to multiple streams of literature and create practical implications to AV manufacturers and retailers.

ID LATERAL ACCELERATION
AB In terms of vehicle dynamics, motion sickness (MS) occurs because of the large lateral acceleration produced by inappropriate wheel turning. In terms of passenger behavior, subjects experience MS because they normally tilt their heads towards the direction of lateral acceleration. Relating these viewpoints, the increment of MS originates from the large lateral acceleration produced by the inappropriate wheel's turn, which then causes greater head movement with respect to the lateral acceleration direction. Therefore, this study proposes the utilization of fuzzy-proportional integral derivative (PID) controller for an MS minimization control structure, where the interaction of the lateral acceleration and head tilt concept is adopted to diminish the lateral acceleration. Here, the head movement is used as the controlled variable to compute the corrective wheel angle. The estimation of the head movement is carried out by an estimation model developed by the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) method. An experiment involving a driving simulator was conducted, to verify the proposed control system's performance in regard to the autonomous vehicle's passengers. The results show that the averages of motion sickness incidence (MSI) index can be lowered by 3.95% for single lap and 11.49% for ten laps.

AB There is great uncertainty about the transition from human to autonomous driving vehicles (AVs), as well as about the extent and direction of their potential impacts on the urban built environment. Planners are aware of the importance of leading this transition but are hesitant about how to proceed, and public administrations generally show a passive attitude. One of the reasons is the difficulty of defining long-term visions and identifying transition paths to achieve the desired future. The literature on AVs is growing rapidly but most of the visions proposed so far do not consider in detail how circulation and parking of AVs will (or could) be differently regulated in cities. In this study, three visions for the Italian city of Turin are proposed. The aim of these visions is to highlight how different forms of regulation of AV circulation and parking can impact on the sustainability and livability of the city. A focus group and a set of interviews with experts and stakeholders were used to validate the three visions and assess their advisability and sustainability. This visioning exercise is the first step in the development of a backcasting process.

AB In this paper, a simple but efficient framework is proposed to achieve finite-time decentralized formation tracking of multiple autonomous vehicles with the introduction of decentralized sliding mode estimators. First, we propose and study both first-order and second-order decentralized sliding mode estimators. In particular, we show that the proposed first-order decentralized sliding mode estimator can guarantee accurate position estimation in finite time and the proposed second-order decentralized sliding mode estimator can guarantee accurate position and velocity estimation in finite time. Then the decentralized sliding mode estimators are employed to achieve decentralized formation tracking of multiple autonomous vehicles. In particular, it is shown that formation tracking can be achieved for systems with both single-integrator kinematics and double-integrator dynamics in finite time. By using the decentralized sliding mode estimators, many formation tracking/flying scenarios can be easily decoupled into two subtasks, that is, decentralized sliding mode estimation and vehicle desired state tracking, without imposing a stringent condition on the information flow. Finally, several simulation results are presented as a proof of concept. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ROUTING PROBLEM; TIME WINDOWS
AB This work presents a multi-objective genetic algorithm to solve route planning problem for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for interdisciplinary coastal research. AUVs are mobile unmanned platforms that carry their own energy and are able to move themselves in the water without intervention from an external operator. Using AUVs one can provide high-quality measurements of physical properties of effluent plumes in a very effective manner under real oceanic conditions. The AUV's route planning problem is a combinatorial optimization problem, where the vehicles must travel through a three-dimensional irregular space with all dimensions known. Therefore, minimization of the total travel distance while considering the maximum number of water samples is the main objective. Besides the AUV kinematics restrictions other considerations must be taken into account to the problem, like the ocean currents. The practical applications of this approach are the environmental monitoring missions which typically require the sampling of a volume of water with non-trivial geometry for which parallel line sweeping might be a costly solution. Some real-life test problems and related solutions are presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB For the six-degree of freedom dynamics of hypersonic flight vehicle, an autonomous reliable intelligent controller using online estimation and condition monitoring is designed in this paper. Based on model transformation, the outer-loop trajectory tracking is converted to the inner-loop attitude tracking. According to the aerodynamic model of large flight envelope and the thrust model of combined engine, the original dynamics is transformed into a switched nonlinear form. For each subsystem, neural network and nonlinear observer are employed to deal with aerodynamic uncertainty and external disturbance, while modeling errors are built to design composite update laws. Considering that the statically unstable HFV is prone to large deviation due to mode switching and wind disturbance, the condition monitoring signal with finite-time robust design is introduced to adjust control surfaces. With the average dwell time on the switching signal, the stability of the whole switched system is proved using Lyapunov approach. Simulation studies are performed to show the effectiveness of the design.

AB This paper investigates the fixed-time trajectory tracking problem of small autonomous underwater vehicles (S-AUVs) in the Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse (TAG) active mound with ocean current, unknown disturbances, model uncertainties, actuator faults, and input saturations. First, the effect of the near-bottom environment of the mound on S-AUVs is analyzed in detail from three issues. Without the upper bound and gradient of lumped uncertainties, a high-order adaptive extended state observer (ESO) is designed. Then, a continuous fixed-time sliding mode manifold is applied to obtain fast convergence performance. In order to realize the fixed-time convergence of tracking errors, an adaptive fault-tolerant trajectory tracking control law with an auxiliary dy-namic system (ADS) is proposed. In addition, the simulated topography of the TAG mound is constructed and the trajectory based on path points is modeled by cubic spline interpolation. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm are validated by comprehensive simulations.

AB Effective communication between multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is necessary for formation control. As the most reliable underwater communication method, acoustic communication still has many constraints compared with radio communication, which affects the effectiveness of formation control. Therefore, this paper proposes a formation control scheme for multiple AUVs under communication delay, packet discreteness and dropout. Firstly, the communication delay is estimated based on the kernel density estimation method. To solve the problem of packet discreteness and dropout, the curve fitting method is used to predict the states of the AUV. Secondly, a follower controller is designed based on the leader-follower approach using input-output feedback linearization, which is proven to be stable with Lyapunov stability theory. Then, some simulation results are presented to demonstrate the stability and accuracy of the formation control in different communication environments. Finally, the field tests on the lake show that the scheme introduced in this paper is valid and practical.

AB Road scene analysis is a fundamental task for both autonomous vehicles and ADAS systems. Nowadays, one can find autonomous vehicles that are able to properly detect objects in the scene in good weather conditions; however, some improvements still need to be done when the visibility is altered. People claim that using some non-conventional sensors such as, infra-red or Lidar, combined with classical vision, enhances road scene analysis in optimal weather conditions. In this work, we present the improvements achieved using polarimetric imaging in the complex situation of some adverse weather conditions. This rich modality is known for its ability to describe an object not only by its intensity information, even under poor illumination or strong reflection. The experimental results have shown that, using a new multimodal dataset, polarimetric imaging was able to provide generic features for both good weather conditions and adverse weather conditions, especially fog. By combining polarimetric images with an adapted learning model, the different detection tasks under fog were improved by about 15% to 44%.

AB This paper investigates the trajectory tracking control problem for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) subject to the external disturbance, modelling uncertainty and an initial tracking error. A trajectory tracking control strategy is proposed based on a virtual closed-loop system. The proposed control architecture is based on a virtual closed-loop system used to generate the virtual reference trajectory that the AUV should follow instead of the original desired trajectory. At first, in the virtual closed-loop system, a fixed feedback controller is designed based on an approximation dynamic model of the AUV to relieve the chattering phenomenon of control input at the early stage. Then, a robust controller based on a generalised saturation function is combined with neural network estimation to allow the AUV to track the generated virtual reference trajectory. Finally, simulations with different trajectories are performed on an AUV to evaluate the performance of the new design.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB An image shadow in an autonomous vehicle often causes failures in image segmentation and object tracking and in recognition algorithms. In this paper, a shadow detection method based on a support vector machine (SVM) is proposed. Firstly, an RGB image was converted to LAB color space, and a shadow detection model based on an SVM was obtained by training the image with a shadow. Then, the image was divided into a shadow region, a shadow boundary, and a light region. Moreover, the light intensity in the shadow region was adjusted by eliminating the pixel difference between the shadow region and the light region. Meanwhile, the image gradient was established within the shadow boundary, and the boundary shadow was replaced by smooth interpolation to achieve a smooth transition from the light region to the shadow region. Finally, a clear image without a shadow was recovered using wavelet gradient data. Experimental results show that this method can detect the shadow region in an image and reproduce the image without the shadow effectively.

AB The promotion and application of autonomous vehicles (AVs) will bring huge benefits to society in economic and environmental aspects, and the public acceptance degree is a crucial influencing factor. Based on technology acceptance model (TAM) and information system success (ISS) model, this research develops a new framework from the perspective of AVs information system to explain public acceptance. The framework explores the relationship between variables such as system quality, information quality, service quality, perceived usefulness, perceived ease-of-use and AVS acceptance, and it also examines the mediating role of perceived ease-of-use and perceived usefulness. Based on a survey of 323 respondents, the results indicate that system quality, information quality, and service quality are key factors affecting AVS acceptance. Additionally, compared to perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use manifested a greater mediation on explanatory variables with AVs acceptance. Moreover, the research also makes recommendations for AVs manufacturers to focus on system quality and information interaction mode in the design and development process of AVs. And thus, making AVs easier to use without cognitive load could improve the AVs acceptance and adoption.

AB A novel adaptive iterative learning control (NAILC) strategy is proposed to enhance static and dynamic control performances for the autonomous farming vehicle tracking repetitive trajectories of alternating parallel straight and large curvature. The method integrates an exponential decay function, an internal model principle (IMP), and an input constraint auxiliary variable design system in an adaptive iterative learning control framework. The introduction of exponential decay improves the convergence rate of the iterative process and ensures the control system's dynamic performance. The IMP enhances the static performance of the trajectory tracking control system and guarantees the alignment condition setting. The auxiliary variable design system reduces the adverse effects of input constraints on the control system performance during the iterative process. Moreover, the adaptive iterative learning updating law estimates the total time-varying disturbance to improve the robustness of the tracking process against the actual disturbance. Simulation comparisons with existing results verify the effectiveness and advantages of the designed NAILC strategy under the MATLAB/Simulink environment.

AB Testing and evaluation are critical steps in the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs). This paper aims to provide an online adaptive generation framework for critical boundary driving scenarios (CBDS) with flexible complexity and diversity. Both static scenarios and dynamic scenarios are comprehensively investigated based on real traffic flow data, where the generated static scenarios contain variables of drivable area, weather visibility, and road friction coefficient on autonomous vehicles, and the generated dynamic scenarios consider the effects of mixed traffic streams of AVs, human-driven vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. Two complexity models are proposed to characterize the complexity of static scenarios and dynamic scenarios separately, which help to construct feedback for the adaptive generation of CBDS. The scenario-based test is carried out on a joint simulation platform, and the multi-dimensional evaluation system, including safety, driving comfort, driving performance, and traffic coordination, is developed to assess the performance of AVs. Based on the proposed complexity models and multi-dimensional evaluation system, the generation of CBDS is transformed into online environmental parameter optimization. Moreover, the naturalistic driving scenarios generation, scenario complexity calculation, intelligent driving algorithm execution, and intelligent driving evaluation are all concatenated together to form a closed loop so as to adaptively generate critical boundary driving scenarios. Extensive simulations are conducted at the intersection with two different types of intelligent driving algorithms, which show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

AB We model a monopoly ride-sourcing market where the platform adopts the service types of human-driven vehicles (HVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs). Both congestion externality under mixed traffic flow and heterogeneity on riders' perceived utility of the ride-sourcing service are considered when formulating the mode choice behavior of riders. We analyze the impact of the platform's fleet size and its price for riders on demand rates and riders' waiting time in the market equilibrium state. The analytical results show that the demand rates of mixed on-demand ride service types are not necessarily monotonous to the price for riders or the fleet size, due to the congestion externality and existence of a wild goose chase regime. Under either profit maximi-zation or welfare maximization strategies, numerical results demonstrate that a higher pure AV traffic flow capacity benefits human ride-sourcing drivers and both types of riders. The platform should arrange more AVs than HVs even under the high AV depreciation cost. In a surging de-mand scenario, the platform should encourage riders to switch from the HV service to the AV service through price regulation. Moreover, an extended scenario considering the integrated service is discussed. The economic analysis and gained managerial insights benefit the on-demand ride services platform's decision making on operational strategies of HVs and investment in AVs with mixed traffic congestion effects.

TI Path Planning for Autonomous Vehicle Based on a Two-Layered Planning

LA English
DT Article
ID AVOIDANCE
AB The autonomous vehicle consists of perception, decision-making, and control system. The study of path planning method has always been a core and difficult problem, especially in complex environment, due to the effect of dynamic environment, the safety, smoothness, and real-time requirement, and the nonholonomic constraints of vehicle. To address the problem of travelling in complex environments which consists of lots of obstacles, a two-layered path planning model is presented in this paper. This method includes a high-level model that produces a rough path and a low-level model that provides precise navigation. In the high-level model, the improved Bidirectional Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (Bi-RRT) based on the steering constraint is used to generate an obstacle-free path while satisfying the nonholonomic constraints of vehicle. In low-level model, a Vector Field Histogram- (VFH-) guided polynomial planning algorithm in Frenet coordinates is introduced. Based on the result of VFH, the aim point chosen from improved Bi-RRT path is moved to the most suitable location on the basis of evaluation function. By applying quintic polynomial in Frenet coordinates, a real-time local path that is safe and smooth is generated based on the improved Bi-RRT path. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed planning model, the real autonomous vehicle has been placed in several driving scenarios with different amounts of obstacles. The two-layered real-time planning model produces flexible, smooth, and safe paths that enable the vehicle to travel in complex environment.

AB To better characterize and improve our understanding of coastal waters, there has been an increasing emphasis on autonomous systems that can sample the ocean on relevant scales. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with active propulsion are especially well suited for studies of the coastal ocean because they are able to provide systematic and near-synoptic spatial observations. With this capability, science users are beginning to integrate sensor suits for a broad range of specific and often novel applications. Here, the relatively mature Remote Environmental Monitoring Units (REMUS) AUV system is configured with multi-spectral radiometers to delineate benthic habitat in Sequim Bay, WA. The vehicle was deployed in a grid pattern along 5 km of coastline in depths from 30 to less than 2 m. Similar to satellite and/or aerial remote sensing, the bandwidth ratios from the downward looking radiance sensor and upward looking irradiance sensor were used to identify beds of eelgrass on submeter scales. Strong correlations were found between the optical reflectance signals and the geo-referenced in situ data collected with underwater video within the grid. Results demonstrate the ability of AUVs to map littoral habitats at high resolution and highlight the overall utility of the REMUS vehicle for nearshore oceanography. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Underwater autonomous manipulation is a challenging task, which not only includes a complicated multibody dynamic and hydrodynamic process, but also involves the limited observation environment. This study systematically investigates the dynamic modeling and control of the underwater vehicle-manipulator multibody system. The dynamic model of underwater vehicle-manipulator system has been established on the basis of the Newton-Euler recursive algorithm. On the basis of dynamic analysis, a motion planning optimization algorithm has been designed in order to realize the coordinate motions between AUV and manipulator through reducing the restoring forces and saving the electric power. On the other hand, a disturbance force observer including the coupling and restoring forces has been designed. An observer-based dynamic control scheme has been established in combination with kinematic and dynamic controller. Furthermore, from the simulations, although the disturbance forces such as restoring and coupling forces are time varying and great, the observer-based dynamic coordinate controller can maintain the AUV attitude stable during the manipulator swing and pitch motions. During the precise manipulation simulation, the stable AUV attitude and minimization of disturbance forces have been realized through combination of optimal motion planning and the observer-based dynamic coordinate controller.

TI Modified 1D Virtual Force Field Approach to Moving Obstacle Avoidance

   Moving obstacle; Time-to-collision estimation; Virtual force field
ID MOBILE; ALGORITHM
AB A modified 1D-virtual force field (1D-VFF) approach is newly proposed to effectively avoid moving obstacles for autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) applications. The underlying idea of this approach is to construct an obstacle force field based on the predicted trajectory of a moving obstacle. To do this, the time-to-collision and the probable area of collision are estimated using the obstacle position and velocity information measured from a FMCW radar. The predicted obstacle force field (POFF) replaces the obstacle force field (OFF) of the conventional 1D-VFF to enhance the AGV's obstacle avoidance performance. As in the conventional 1D-VFF scheme, the steering force field (SFF) is generated by using the prescribed position of the goal and the current position of the ground vehicle. In order to ensure a collision-free local path against the moving obstacle, the steering command is determined as the maximizing solution of the integrated force field (IFF) defined by a linear combination of POFF and SFF. Simulations of various scenarios show that the proposed algorithm provides an improved local path planning performance against moving obstacles compared to the existing 1D-VFF methodology.

AB The use of commercially available autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has increased during the last fifteen years. While they are mainly used for routine survey missions, there is a set of applications that nowadays can be only addressed by manned submersibles or work-class remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) equipped with teleoperated arms: the intervention applications. To allow these heavy vehicles controlled by human operators to perform intervention tasks, underwater structures like observatory facilities, subsea panels or oil-well Christmas trees have been adapted, making them more robust and easier to operate. The TRITON Spanish founded project proposes the use of a light-weight intervention AUV (I-AUV) to carry out intervention applications simplifying the adaptation of these underwater structures and drastically reducing the operational cost. To prove this concept, the Girona 500 I-AUV is used to autonomously dock into an adapted subsea panel and once docked perform an intervention composed of turning a valve and plugging in/unplugging a connector. The techniques used for the autonomous docking and manipulation as well as the design of an adapted subsea panel with a funnel-based docking system are presented in this article together with the results achieved in a water tank and at sea.

ID TOLERANT CONTROL; LOCALIZATION; TRACKING; SYSTEMS; MODEL
AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are designed to operate in complex external environments, making fault detection crucial to overall safety. While a general kinetic model can be applied to describe the dynamics of an AUV, obtaining accurate parameters for the dynamic model is challenging due to the complexity of the outline structure of the AUV and external influence factors. In addition, environmental influence on model parameters is usually time-varying and stochastic, which is different from simple model uncertainties. In this paper, we model external perturbations as stochastic model uncertainties that share some characteristics with noise. We also apply an improved robust filtering method to estimate system states and alleviate the effects of stochastic system uncertainties. Based on the proposed filtering approach, a residual signal is computed based on reconstruction errors of the observations and smoothed using a sliding-window technique, which is directly applied to the fault detection problem. Finally, simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting actuator faults in several cases.

AB Autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) are gaining ground around the world. They are equipped with intelligent decision-making capabilities that allow them to optimize on their battery usage and engage in energy trading for profit maximization. This paper envisions a market model, where energy aggregators considers buying and selling electricity from AEVs. In this system, the aggregators reside on cloudlets at the edge of a cloud computing system for prompt communication and negotiation with AEVs. Whether they are parked or en-route, AEVs can be crowdsourced to provide energy to consumers at needed times. This study proposes double auction models to incentivize AEV agents to participate in the market based on their time preferences and energy pricing. The proposed system implements dynamic pricing structures, which are applicable to various scenarios of energy trading. To evaluate the proposed system, this paper provides extensive theoretical analysis and simulation experiments to demonstrate that the proposed auctioning models are computationally efficient, truthful, individually rational, and budget balanced.

AB Autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) have been deployed in various working environments. Human-AGV coexisting environments introduce many challenges into the motion planning procedure. The planner should be smart enough to guide the AGV to move safely and smoothly. Besides, the efficiency of the planner is essential for real-time response. Risk-based motion planning algorithms consider the risk of collision with dynamic and static obstacles to deal with planning problems in human-AGV coexisting environments. However, their performance needs to be further improved. The bidirectional search sampling strategy is widely used to obtain real-time response capability. However, when considering kinodynamic constraints, the bidirectional search sampling strategy needs to solve the two-point boundary value problem (TBVP), which is not always solvable for all kinds of kinodynamic constraints. To achieve efficient AGV navigation in the environment with pedestrians, we propose a risk-based algorithm with a bidirectional search sampling strategy, namely bidirectional Risk-RRT (Bi-Risk-RRT). Additionally, by using the other direction as a heuristic, Bi-Risk-RRT bypasses TBVP and retains the advantages of the bidirectional search sampling strategy. The simulation experiments are conducted in various challenging environments, and the results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

AB PurposeThe goal of this research is to develop a dynamic step path planning algorithm based on the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm that combines Q-learning with the Gaussian distribution of obstacles. A route for autonomous vehicles may be swiftly created using this algorithm.Design/methodology/approachThe path planning issue is divided into three key steps by the authors. First, the tree expansion is sped up by the dynamic step size using a combination of Q-learning and the Gaussian distribution of obstacles. The invalid nodes are then removed from the initially created pathways using bidirectional pruning. B-splines are then employed to smooth the predicted pathways.FindingsThe algorithm is validated using simulations on straight and curved highways, respectively. The results show that the approach can provide a smooth, safe route that complies with vehicle motion laws.Originality/valueAn improved RRT algorithm based on Q-learning and obstacle Gaussian distribution (QGD-RRT) is proposed for the path planning of self-driving vehicles. Unlike previous methods, the authors use Q-learning to steer the tree's development direction. After that, the step size is dynamically altered following the density of the obstacle distribution to produce the initial path rapidly and cut down on planning time even further. In the aim to provide a smooth and secure path that complies with the vehicle kinematic and dynamical restrictions, the path is lastly optimized using an enhanced bidirectional pruning technique.

AB Ride sharing can reduce the number of vehicles in the streets by increasing the occupancy of vehicles, which can facilitate traffic and reduce crashes and the number of needed parking slots. Autonomous vehicles can make ride sharing convenient, popular, and also necessary because of the elimination of the driver effort and the expected high cost of the vehicles. However, the organization of ride sharing requires the users to disclose sensitive detailed information not only on the pick-up/drop-off locations but also on the trip time and route. In this paper, we propose a scheme to organize ride sharing and address the unique privacy issues. Our scheme uses a similarity measurement technique over encrypted data to preserve the privacy of trip data. The ride sharing region is divided into cells and each cell is represented by one bit in a binary vector. Each user should represent trip data as binary vectors and submit the encryptions of the vectors to a server. The server can measure the similarity of the users' trip data and find users who can share rides without knowing the data. Our analysis has demonstrated that the proposed scheme can organize ride sharing without disclosing private information. We have implemented our scheme using Visual C on a real map and the measurements have confirmed that our scheme is effective when ride sharing becomes popular and the server needs to organize a large number of rides in short time.

AB Alternative vehicle technologies promise a sustainable future by reducing carbon emissions and pollution. However, their widespread adoption tends to be slow due to high costs and uncertainties in benefits. Using a life cycle-based approach, this study calculates ownership savings and societal benefits for various alternative vehicle technologies against their baseline vehicle technology (e.g. gasoline or diesel). The assessment is performed from a developing country context - in the Philippines. Furthermore, immediate and distant future scenarios are modeled. The immediate future scenario assesses costs and benefits if the shift is to happen now, while the distant future scenario considers the effect of widespread autonomous driving and ridesharing. The results of the study echo the significant societal benefits from electric- and fuel cell-powered vehicles found in literature, but they are hindered by high ownership costs. In the immediate future, the diesel hybrid electric vehicle can potentially have both positive societal and operational costs for public transportation. For a gasoline-powered private passenger car, a simple shift to diesel, 20% biodiesel or 85% methanol can be beneficial. In the distant future, it is expected that autonomous, rideshared vehicles can potentially lure people away from driving their own vehicles, because of lower costs per passenger-kilometer while sustaining the privacy and comfort of a private car.

AB Clustered multi-task learning, which aims to leverage the generalization performance over clustered tasks, has shown an outstanding performance in various machine learning applications. In this paper, a clustered multi-task sequence-to-sequence learning (CMSL) for autonomous vehicle systems (AVSs) in large-scale semiconductor fabrications (fab) is proposed, where AVSs are widely used for wafer transfers. Recently, as fabs become larger, the repositioning of idle vehicles to where they may be requested has become a significant challenge because inefficient vehicle balancing leads to transfer delays, resulting in production machine idleness. However, existing vehicle repositioning systems are mainly controlled by human operators, and it is difficult for such systems to guarantee efficiency. Further, we should handle the small data problem, which is insufficient for machine learning because of the irregular time-varying manufacturing environments. The main purpose of this study is to examine CMSL-based predictive control of idle vehicle repositioning to maximize machine utilization. We conducted an experimental evaluation to compare the prediction accuracy of CMSL with existing methods. Further, a case study in a real largescale semiconductor plant, demonstrated that the proposed predictive approach outperforms the existing approaches in terms of transfer efficiency and machine utilization.

TI Autonomous Vehicle Application for Improving Traffic Sign Learning near
   Ramps
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL MEDIA
AB The state-of-the-art traffic sign recognition (TSR) algorithms are designed to recognize the textual information of a traffic sign at over 95% accuracy. Even though, they are still not ready for complex roadworks near ramps. In real-world applications, when the vehicles are running on the freeway, they may misdetect the traffic signs for the ramp, which will become inaccurate feedback to the autonomous driving applications and result in unexpected speed reduction. The misdetection problems have drawn minimal attention in recent TSR studies. In this paper, it is proposed that the existing TSR studies should transform from the point-based sign recognition to path-based sign learning. In the proposed pipeline, the confidence of the TSR observations from normal vehicles can be increased by clustering and location adjustment. A supervised learning model is employed to classify the clustered learned signs and complement their path information. Test drives are conducted in 12 European countries to calibrate the models and validate the path information of the learned sign. After model implementation, the path accuracy over 1,000 learned signs can be increased from 75.04% to 89.80%. This study proves the necessity of the path-based TSR studies near freeway ramps and the proposed pipeline demonstrates a good utility and broad applicability for sensor-based autonomous vehicle applications.

AB In this paper, a sampled-data networking strategy is investigated for the formation problem of multiple 6-DOF autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the presence of external disturbances. Unlike the common condition in most literatures associated with multiple vehicles, where the information is assumed to be exchanged continuously, in our proposed strategy, the position and orientation information of the multiple AUVs is exchanged according to a discrete-time sequence, which is more applicable to current technologies for underwater communications. More precisely, this strategy can be modeled by a sample-and-hold mechanism and is capable of both uniform and non-uniform sampling cases. In particular, it has a potential advantage from an energy perspective, since communication reduction always leads to less energy consumption. By model transformation, distributed controllers are designed based on input-to-state stability (ISS) property to ensure that both configuration formation and rendezvous-type formation can be achieved. An optimization procedure is also presented to calculate the maximum allowable sampling period. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the theoretical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes a novel hybrid car-following model: the physics-informed conditional generative adversarial network (PICGAN), designed to enhance multi-step car-following modeling in mixed traffic flow scenarios. This hybrid model leverages the strengths of both physics-based and deep-learning-based models. By taking advantage of the inherent structure of GAN, the PICGAN eliminates the need for an explicit weighting parameter typically used in the combination of traditional physics-based and data-driven models. The effectiveness of the proposed model is substantiated through case studies using the NGSIM I-80 dataset. These studies demonstrate the model's superior trajectory reproduction, suggesting its potential as a strong contender to replace conventional models in trajectory prediction tasks. Furthermore, the deployment of PICGAN significantly enhances the stability and efficiency in mixed traffic flow environments. Given its reliable and stable results, the PICGAN framework contributes substantially to the development of efficient longitudinal control strategies for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in real-world mixed traffic conditions.

In a suitable computational environment, the dynamic electrical model of the entire hybrid powertrain, consisting of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell, a hydrogen metal hydride storage system, a lithium battery, two brushless DC motors, and two control subsystems, is implemented. The developed calculation tool is used to perform the dynamic analysis of the hybrid propulsion system during four different operating journeys, investigating the performance achieved to examine the obtained performance, determine the feasibility of the work runs and highlight the critical points. During the trips, the engine shows fluctuating performance trends while the energy consumption reaches 1087 Wh for the fuel cell (corresponding to 71 g of hydrogen) and 370 Wh for the battery, consuming almost all the energy stored on board.

AB This paper addresses trajectory tracking control problem for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) using quaternion-based attitude representation. A quaternion based adaptive non-singular terminal sliding mode control scheme is proposed for an AUV subject to ocean current and modelling uncertainty. At first, kinematic equations of the translational and rotational motions are described by unit quaternions. And then, a class of modified non-singular terminal sliding mode surface is developed by smoothly switching into a non-singular sliding mode surface formed by sinusoidal functions when the tracking error reaches a small range of the origin. The finite-time convergences of both the position tracking error and quaternion error are proved based on Lyapunov theory. Finally, the proposed control scheme is applied on a typical fully-actuated AUV to perform simulations. And the simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme in comparison with another terminal sliding mode control algorithm.

AB The Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC) held in spring 2017 was a very successful competition well attended by teams from all over the world. One of the challenges (Challenge 1) required an aerial robot to detect, follow, and land on a moving target in a fully autonomous fashion. In this paper, we present the hardware components of the micro air vehicle (MAV) we built with off the self components alongside the designed algorithms that were developed for the purposes of the competition. We tackle the challenge of landing on a moving target by adopting a generic approach, rather than following one that is tailored to the MBZIRC Challenge 1 setup, enabling easy adaptation to a wider range of applications and targets, even indoors, since we do not rely on availability of global positioning system. We evaluate our system in an uncontrolled outdoor environment where our MAV successfully and consistently lands on a target moving at a speed of up to 5.0 m/s.

AB As the navigation interface of fully autonomous vehicles (FAV) will be wholly dependent on On-board Navigation Systems (ONS), it is foreseeable that ONS will replace steering wheels as the primary control mode of future FAVs. Thus, the ease of setting precise destinations using ONS may become a key factor affecting FAV user acceptance. A survey (N = 200) comprising Navigation Anxiety Questionnaire and User Preference Questionnaire reveals the user's acceptable measurements of distance error and execution time when navigating FAVs in six common situations. Subsequently, an in-vehicle simulation test (N = 24) found most participants in the simulation test performed worse than the user's acceptable measurements obtained through the questionnaire survey, which indicated that the existing ONS failed to meet users' expectations for the FAV navigation experience. Findings of the questionnaire survey and the simulation test reveal a severe "last-100 meters" issue when controlling FAVs by ONS, and that destination familiarity, gender difference, text input behavior, map scale, and map display mode should be seriously considered when designing ONS for FAV control.

AB A port-Hamiltonian model is suitable to represent the dynamics of many physical processes, which has an essential feature of underscoring a significance of an energy function, an interconnection pattern, and a dissipation for physical systems. Hence, adaptive path-tracking control with a passivity-based observer is designed by the port-Hamiltonian model for autonomous vehicles in this article. Firstly, a passivity-based observer of lateral velocity is established by designing a gain matrix to assign the interconnection and damping parts, which makes an observation error system transform into a desired port-Hamiltonian system and renders the observer passive. At the same time, it's convergence and stability analysis is given. Then, a port-Hamiltonian model with perturbations and actuator saturations is constructed to describe lateral vehicle dynamics in terms of tracking errors for path-tracking, and an L2-gain disturbance attenuation strategy is developed to overcome the adverse influence caused of external disturbances. Furthermore, the robust stability of the controller is proved in the presence of observation errors and external disturbances. Finally, simulations and experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

AB Scenario understanding and motion prediction are essential components for completely replacing human drivers and for enabling highly and fully automated driving (SAE-Level 4/5). In deeply stochastic and uncertain traffic scenarios, autonomous driving software must act beyond existing traffic rules and must predict critical situations in advance to provide safe and comfortable rides. In addition, comprehensive prediction models intend not just to reproduce, but rather to encode the human driver behavior, which requires profound scenario understanding. Hence, research in the field of scenario understanding and motion prediction also contributes to enable intelligent driver behavior models in general. This paper aims to review the state of research and outline common methods. A classification of these models is proposed according to their underlying investigation methodology. Based on this classification, a comparison is drawn between three specific prediction methods, which considers specific functional aspects and general requirements of applicability. The results of the comparison reveal a trade-off between holism and explainability in the state of the art. In conclusion, suggestions for future research objectives to solve this conflict are proposed.

AB Purpose This paper aims to present a multi-source information fusion algorithm based on factor graph for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) navigation and positioning to address the asynchronous and heterogeneous problem of multiple sensors. Design/methodology/approach The factor graph is formulated by joint probability distribution function (pdf) random variables. All available measurements are processed into an optimal navigation solution by the message passing algorithm in the factor graph model. To further aid high-rate navigation solutions, the equivalent inertial measurement unit (IMU) factor is introduced to replace several consecutive IMU measurements in the factor graph model. Findings The proposed factor graph was demonstrated both in a simulated and vehicle environment using IMU, Doppler Velocity Log, terrain-aided navigation, magnetic compass pilot and depth meter sensors. Simulation results showed that the proposed factor graph processes all available measurements into the considerably improved navigation performance, computational efficiency and complexity compared with the un-simplified factor graph and the federal Kalman filtering methods. Semi-physical experiment results also verified the robustness and effectiveness. Originality/value The proposed factor graph scheme supported a plug and play capability to easily fuse asynchronous heterogeneous measurements information in AUV navigation systems.

   analysis; Visualization; Autonomous vehicles; Task analysis; Long-term
   localisation; feature-based map; map update
AB For autonomous vehicles to operate persistently in a typical urban environment, it is essential to have high accuracy position information. This requires a mapping and localisation system that can adapt to changes over time. A localisation approach based on a single-survey map will not be suitable for long-term operation as it does not incorporate variations in the environment. In this paper, we present new algorithms to maintain a featured-based map. A map maintenance pipeline is proposed that can continuously update a map with the most relevant features taking advantage of the changes in the surroundings. Our pipeline detects and removes transient features based on their geometrical relationships with the vehicle's pose. Newly identified features became part of a new feature map and are assessed by the pipeline as candidates for the localisation map. By purging out-of-date features and adding newly detected features, we continually update the prior map to more accurately represent the most recent environment. We have validated our approach using the USyd Campus Dataset, which includes more than 18 months of data. The results presented demonstrate that our maintenance pipeline produces a resilient map which can provide sustained localisation performance over time.

ID UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES; COLLISION-AVOIDANCE
AB For Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), it is of crucial importance to develop a technically advanced Collision Avoidance System (CAS). Such a system must necessarily consist of many sensors of various types, each one having special characteristics and performance. The poor performance of one of the sensors can lead to a total failure in collision avoidance if there is no provision for the performance of each separate sensor to be continuously monitored. In this work, a Sensor Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (SAIM) methodology is proposed. The configuration of the sensors and their interaction is based on a fusion procedure that involves a total of five sensors. Accordingly, the performance of each one of the sensors is continuously checked against the combined (fused) operation of the other four. A complementary experiment with a total of four sensors, one of which had low performance, was also conducted. Experimental results reveal a reliable approach for Sensor Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (SAIM). The method can be easily extended to a larger number of sensors.

AB Recently, research on path planning for the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has developed rapidly. Heuristic algorithms have been widely used to plan a path for AUV, but most traditional heuristic algorithms are facing two problems, one is slow convergence speed, the other is premature convergence. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a new heuristic algorithms fusion, which improves the genetic algorithm with the ant colony optimization algorithm and the simulated annealing algorithm. In addition, to accelerate convergence and expand the search space of the algorithm, some algorithms like trying to cross, path self-smoothing and probability of genetic operation adjust adaptively are proposed. The advantages of the proposed algorithm are reflected through simulated comparative experiments. Besides, this paper proposes an ocean current model and a kinematics model to solve the problem of AUV path planning under the influence of ocean currents.

AB In this paper, an alternative design method is presented for the horizontal trajectory tracking of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) subject to unknown internal and external disturbances. In the guidance loop, a kinematic control law of the desired surge speed and trajectory angle is derived. To meet the previous convergence requirement, a kinetic control law is developed. It consists of two terms: the disturbance rejection and the stabilizing controller. The former is given by using an extended state observer (ESO) based on the high gain technique. In this process, the singular perturbation theory is applied to analyze the extended state system via order reduction. Then the latter is designed in the reduced model independently, in term of the backstepping technique and a composite-system method. Moreover, this paper also proves that the proposed controller makes the closed-loop system asymptotically stable. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate the control performance.

ID FAULT-TOLERANT CONTROL
AB For long-term missions in complex seas, the onboard energy resources of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are limited. Thus, energy consumption reduction is an important aspect of the study of AUVs. This paper addresses energy consumption reduction using model predictive control (MPC) based on the state space model of AUVs for trajectory tracking control. Unlike the previous approaches, which use a cost function that consists of quadratic deviations of the predicted controlled output from the reference trajectory and quadratic input changes, a term of quadratic energy (i.e., quadratic input) is introduced into the cost function in this paper. Then, the MPC control law with the new cost function is constructed, and an analysis on the effect of the quadratic energy term on the stability is given. Finally, simulation results for depth tracking control are given to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the improved MPC on energy consumption optimization for AUVs.

AB Underwater imaging sonar has been developed for obstacle avoidance and navigation of the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) "URASHIMA". The acoustic image. the distance and the azimuth of the target are obtained using an acoustic lens. Tone burst acoustic waves are transmitted and scattered at the target, and a direct image of the target call be created oil it two-dimensional receiving array. The merits of the acoustic lens system are the possibility to omit the extensive calculation required for signal processing of received signals at each element to form two-dimensional beams, and reduction of equipment size. In this report, the Outline of the imaging sonar with a single spherical lens and the experimental results for file acoustic lens in a water tank are presented. Then. theoretical calculation of the sound field through the lens using the parabolic equation method is introduced as a useful tool for improvement of lens performance to Sol re problem,,, in resolution and aberration.

AB Considering autonomous navigation in busy marine traffic environments (including harbors and coasts), major study issues to be solved for autonomous ships are avoidance of static and dynamic obstacles, surface vehicle control in consideration of the environment, and compliance with human-defined navigation rules. The reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, which demonstrates high potential in autonomous cars, has been presented as an alternative to mathematical algorithms and has advanced in studies on autonomous ships. However, the RL algorithm, through interactions with the environment, receives relatively fewer data from the marine environment. Moreover, the open marine environment causes difficulties for autonomous ships in learning human-defined navigation rules because of excessive degrees of freedom. This study proposes a sustainable, intelligent learning framework for autonomous ships (ILFAS), which helps solve these difficulties and learns navigation rules specified by human beings through neighboring ships. The application of case-based RL enables the participation of humans in the RL learning process through neighboring ships and the learning of human-defined rules. Cases built as curriculums can achieve high learning effects with fewer data along with the RL of layered autonomous ships. The experiment aims at autonomous navigation from a harbor, where marine traffic occurs on a neighboring coast. The learning results using ILFAS and those in an environment where random marine traffic occurs are compared. Based on the experiment, the learning time was reduced by a tenth. Moreover, the success rate of arrival at a destination was higher with fewer controls than the random method in the new marine traffic scenario. ILFAS can continuously respond to advances in ship manufacturing technology and changes in the marine environment.

AB Recently, improvements in sensing, communicating, and computing technologies have led to the development of driver-assistance systems (DASs). Such systems aim at helping drivers by either providing a warning to reduce crashes or doing some of the control tasks to relieve a driver from repetitive and boring tasks. Thus, for example, adaptive cruise control (ACC) aims at relieving a driver from manually adjusting his/her speed to maintain a constant speed or a safe distance from the vehicle in front of him/her. Currently, ACC can be improved through vehicle-to-vehicle communication, where the current speed and acceleration of a vehicle can be transmitted to the following vehicles by intervehicle communication. This way, vehicle-to-vehicle communication with ACC can be combined in one single system called cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC). This paper investigates CACC by proposing a novel approach for the design of autonomous vehicle controllers based on modern machine-learning techniques. More specifically, this paper shows how a reinforcement-learning approach can be used to develop controllers for the secure longitudinal following of a front vehicle. This approach uses function approximation techniques along with gradient-descent learning algorithms as a means of directly modifying a control policy to optimize its performance. The experimental results, through simulation, show that this design approach can result in efficient behavior for CACC.

AB As computer computing capabilities increase, optimization algorithms are becoming more useful for solving engineering problems. Up to now, several metaheuristic algorithms have been exploited in control engineering. However, this effort remains weak in addressing the autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) trajectory tracking problem. This research presents a novel optimal approach merging the robust non-singular fast terminal sliding-mode control method (NFTSMC) and the neural network optimization algorithm (NNA) for automatic lane changing. First, a reference double lane-change path (DLC) is designed, and the robust non-singular fast terminal sliding-mode steering controller is developed, according to Lyapunov stability theory, to suppress the lateral deviation and ensure the yaw stability. Then, the control strategy is optimized by the NNA algorithm to adjust the steering controller optimally while avoiding local optimums. A comparison, under the same conditions, with the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) revealed the superiority of the control law resulting from the NNA-based optimization. Furthermore, the proposed approach shows its excellent tracking performance versus the integrated backstepping sliding-mode controller (IBSMC) and the adaptive sliding-mode control (ASMC) under severe conditions typical of real-world lane changes.

AB Risk analysis for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is essential to assist decision making for safer operations. This study aims to provide a systematic review of risk analysis research to enhance the safety performance of AUVs. Forty-two domain articles were retrieved and analyzed. Critical risk factors and causal relationships of AUV operations were identified. A comparative analysis of evolving methods and models was performed by categorizing them as qualitative, semi-quantitative, and quantitative. Future trends of research in this field were also outlined. The study observes that as AUV technologies gradually mature, environmental factors, human factors, and their interactive impacts are gathering more attention. Quantitative risk analysis methods have recently played a key role in improving the accuracy and handling the uncertainties of risk estimation. The study recommends devoting efforts to dynamic risk analysis, addressing limited historical data, intelligent risk analysis, and multi-vehicles risk analysis for future works. This study is expected to help AUV stakeholders gain comprehensive insights into fundamental concepts and evolving methods for risk analysis of AUVs. At the same time, it is expected to highlight future directions to bridge existing gaps.

AB Autonomous navigation in underground environments remains a hot topic for the autonomous vehicle engineering community. There is a wealth of information available in the literature for implementing hardware and software solutions for robust navigation in an underground environment. Well-established algorithms are widely used for real-time data processing for self-awareness, situational awareness, and autonomous navigation. However, the geometry of the underground environment is rarely considered for the development of these approaches, in favor of more generalized approaches. In the mining sector, where production vehicles are utilized inside highly structured underground environments, the integration of underground geometry into the development of the navigation system could be beneficial. The inherent simplicity of such environments can significantly mitigate the complexity of the navigation system, as well as the composition and number of the multisensory modalities required for automating mining equipment. This paper presents a GPS-denied navigation system developed for underground coal mines that use the room and pillar mining method. Leveraging this simple and repetitive pattern, the navigation system uses only a few 2D LiDAR scanners that provide the information needed for autonomous navigation in underground room and pillar systems. Under the proposed approach, the calculation of an absolute global position is unnecessary, and navigation can be performed using only the relative position of the vehicle with respect to the immediate environment. The performance of this system is evaluated based on a lab-scale shuttle car prototype that is set to navigate a mock mine setup for a number of different scenarios simulating common missions that a shuttle car may undertake in a typical room and pillar section. The results show a minimum success ratio of 84%.

AB This paper proposes a cascaded backstepping control method with an augmented observer for the lateral control of an autonomous vehicle. The proposed cascaded backstepping control structure consists of an inner-loop electric power steering (EPS) system and an outer-loop lane-keeping system (LKS). The outer-loop controller for LKS calculates and provides the desired steering angle to the inner-loop EPS system for maintaining the vehicle at the center of the lane. Subsequently, the inner-loop controller for the EPS system generates steering torque to track the desired steering angle from the outer loop. The proposed method can guarantee the stability of the vehicle considering both inner-loop and outer-loop dynamics. In addition, an augmented observer affords robustness against unknown model parameters and external disturbances. The stability of the closed loop of the overall system, including the lateral dynamics and the EPS system, is proven using the input-to-state stable property. Controller design with consideration of the overall system can improve the lateral control performance.

AB As the rapid development of automotive telematics, modern vehicles are expected to be connected through heterogeneous radio access technologies and are able to exchange massive information with their surrounding environment. By significantly expanding the network scale and conducting both real-time and long-term information processing, the traditional Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) are evolving to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which promises efficient and intelligent prospect for the future transportation system. On the other hand, vehicles are not only consuming but also generating a huge amount and enormous types of data, which is referred to as Big Data. In this article, we first investigate the relationship between IoV and big data in vehicular environment, mainly on how IoV supports the transmission, storage, computing of the big data, and how IoV benefits from big data in terms of IoV characterization, performance evaluation and big data assisted communication protocol design. We then investigate the application of IoV big data in autonomous vehicles. Finally, the emerging issues of the big data enabled IoV are discussed.

AB This paper reviews aspects of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomy as suggested by the Autonomous Control Logic chart of the U.S. DoD UAV autonomy roadmap; levels of vehicle autonomy addressed through intelligent control practices and a hierarchical/intelligent control architecture are presented for UAVs. Basic modules of the control hierarchy and their enabling technologies are reviewed; of special interest, from an intelligent control perspective, are the middle and high echelons of the hierarchy. Here, mission planning, trajectory generation and vehicle navigation routines are proposed for the highest level. At the middle level, the control role is portrayed by mode transitioning, envelope protection, real-time adaptation and fault detection/control reconfiguration algorithms which are intended to safeguard the UAV's integrity in the event of component failures, extreme operating conditions or external disturbances. The UAV thus exhibits attributes of robustness and operational reliability assuring a satisfactory degree of autonomy. The control technologies are demonstrated through flight testing results.

DT Article
AB Autonomous driving has recently been in considerable progress, and many algorithms have been suggested to control the motions of driverless cars. The model predictive controller (MPC) is one of the efficient approaches by which the speed and direction of the near future of an automobile could be predicted and controlled. Even though the MPC is of enormous benefit, the performance (minimum tracking error) of such a controller strictly depends on the appropriate tuning of its parameters. This paper applies the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to find the global minimum tracking error by tuning the controller's parameters and ultimately calculating the front steering angle and directed motor force to the wheels of an autonomous vehicle (AV). This article consists of acquiring vehicle dynamics, extended model predictive control, and optimization paradigm. The proposed approach is compared with previous research in the literature and simulation results show higher performance, and also it is less computationally expensive. The simulation results show that the proposed method with only three adjustable parameters has an overshoot of about 8% and its RMSE is 0.72.

ID KEEPING ASSISTANCE
AB This paper presents a personalized lane keeping system for an autonomous vehicle using recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short term memory (LSTM) cell. The proposed algorithm is trained by datasets collected by manual driving of three drivers. The collected driving data is analyzed for the target lane offset and responsiveness to the road curvature of each driver. 178744 and 76605 datasets are used to train and validate the LSTM-RNN based model. An encoder is used to standardize the input feature to improve the accuracy of network training. The proposed lane keeping algorithm for each driver has been evaluated through prediction accuracy analysis and simulation study using MATLAB/Simulink and Carsim. 99.7 % of the prediction error of steering wheel angle was bounded between -0.87 deg to 0.89 deg with mean of 0.01 deg. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm precisely modeled the lane keeping characteristics of three drivers.

AB This article involves the design of a novel path tracking control technique for the self-driving car. Fixed settling time sliding mode control (FSTSMC) with barrier Lyapunov function is implemented to deal with the non-linear lateral dynamics and to ensure stable standard double-lane-change (DLC) maneuver of self-driving cars in the presence of unknown lateral tire forces and parametric uncertainties. A two-time scale-based approach is employed to deal with the slow and fast dynamics of the car separately. The proposed control scheme efficacy is investigated using simulations based on CarSim and Simulink. The simulation results validate the path-tracking ability of the proposed controller for self-driving cars while accomplishing the stable double-lane-change maneuver at various forward speeds.

AB The designs of the optimal shape of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and its aft propeller's optimal circulation can interact with each other. We propose an optimization approach that integrates the lifting line theory and the continuous adjoint method to address this conflict. The optimal circulation of a propeller is obtained via lifting line theory. The corresponding propeller force is introduced into the Reynolds-averaged flow equations as a source term and is considered in the development of a continuous adjoint formulation for the AUV shape optimization. Adjoint equations, with boundary conditions and sensitivity derivative expressions for the drag reduction problem, are derived in detail. The shapes of a small AUV and its aft propeller are simultaneously optimized using the proposed approach. Numerical results show that the proposed method decrease AUV drag by 17% at a rated speed. And a prototype test further confirms the effectiveness of the method.

AB This paper presents the control design and stability analysis for path-following of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), with dynamics restricted to the horizontal plane. As illustration, the time-scale separation caused by different rates of numerous variables is exploited via a singular perturbation model formulation. On the basis of that, a time-scale decomposition method is used to decompose the full system into three-time scale subsystems. The three-time scale structure allows independent analysis of dynamics in each time scale. Therefore, control strategies are designed in each subsystem separately, leading to a reduction of control complexity and a relatively simple control law. This paper also demonstrates the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system with a composite Lyapunov function candidate and provides alternative, simple but generic mathematical bounds on the singularly perturbed parameters. Finally, the simulation results are presented to illustrate the effective performance of proposed controller.

AB Autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) is an important capability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for further applications in both military and civilian domains. This paper focuses on the description and comparison of visual measurement strategies in the simulation environment of AAR of UAVs. The visual measurement methods are employed for pose estimation between tanker and UAV receiver aircrafts. Within this effort, methods and techniques for marker detection, pose estimation, and visualization of aerial refueling in virtual reality have been designed and implemented. Series of comparative experiments indicate the preference of various visual measurement approaches in our work. Boom and stationkeeping controllers are designed to ensure system stability when wind turbulence is induced. Furthermore, the hardware-in-loop simulation platform is built to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scenarios in actual conditions. The visual attention mechanism is adopted in the preprocessing for the images of virtual scene to remove potential noises. The achieved results make excellent performances of our proposed scheme during the docking maneuver in AAR.

AB In this paper, we investigate the synchronization control of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), considering both state feedback and output feedback cases. Treating multiple AUVs as a graph, we define the tracking error of each AUV with both its own tracking error and the relative position errors with respect to its neighbors taken into account. Lyapunov analysis is used to derive the control law for each AUV. For the output feedback case, a passive filter is used to compensate for the unknown relative velocity errors among AUVs, and an observer is employed to estimate the velocity of the AUV itself. Rigid mathematical proof is provided for the proposed algorithms for both state feedback and output feedback cases. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. It is shown that, the synchronization error is smaller in the case of considering the relative errors between AUVs than in the case of considering the tracking error of the single AUV only.

AB This paper develops a robust nonlinear controller that asymptotically drives the dynamic model of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) onto a predefined path at a constant forward speed. A kinematic controller is first derived, and extended to cope with vehicle dynamics by resorting to backstepping and Lyapunov-based techniques. Robustness to vehicle parameter uncertainty is addressed by incorporating a hybrid parameter adaptation scheme. The resulting nonlinear adaptive control system is formally shown and it yields asymptotic convergence of the vehicle to the path. Simulations illustrate the performance of the derived controller.

AB The Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) is considered to be a promising technology to improve the traffic congestion. However, to realize its expected benefits, the real-time, accurate and forward-looking guidance message are required. Based on this, considering various practical constraints and the characteristics of the CAVs fully, multiple distributed edge computing servers are deployed at the network edge to provide the real-time storage and computation support in our paper. Furtherly, based on the fruitful deployment for edge computing servers, an efficient traffic flow online prediction model is constructed, which can adaptively modify according to the dynamic changes of the actual road traffic state, thus providing more accurate and forward-looking results. The simulation results based on MATLAB platform show the proposed deployment scheme for edge computing servers only needs more cost than the enumeration method. Moreover, compared with other baseline methods, the online prediction model proposed can improve 37.5%-76.9% in terms of prediction accuracy.

ID IMAGE-ENHANCEMENT
AB In this study, an underwater sphere-target localisation method based on non-parallel binocular vision for an autonomous underwater vehicle manipulator system (AUVMS) is investigated. Existing extraction methods for underwater targets require considerable processing time, such that the real-time requirements for an AUVMS are not satisfied, and the shape features of the targets are not considered. In this study, an underwater target extraction method with reduced processing time is developed based on the known target edge constraint. The experimental results show that the developed method requires less time than the existing target extraction methods and satisfies the real-time requirements. In addition, the localisation precision of existing target localisation methods is relatively low, which leads to a low rate of successful implementation for an AUVMS. To solve this problem, a secondary compensation-based target localisation method is developed. A theoretical analysis is also presented. The experimental results show that the developed target localisation method can effectively improve the localisation accuracy and rate of successful implementation.

ID RISK ANALYSIS
AB This study proposed a fault diagnosis method based on deep learning and attention mechanism for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Firstly, a data attention mechanism is proposed to introduce dynamic weighting coefficients of monitoring variables to realize dynamic decorrelation. Then, the automatic feature engineering is realized by a bi-directional gated recurrent unit (GRU) network to acquire the time dynamic characteristics of monitoring variables. Finally, fault detection is implemented via multi-layer perceptron (MLP). With respect to fault identification, this study embeds a spatial attention mechanism in the fault detection network to capture the semantic relationship between monitoring variables and faults, and fault identification result can be obtained by parsing this semantic relationship. We present a new loss function and training strategy for cooperation between the fault detection and identification tasks. The proposed method is validated on the monitoring data of Qianlong-2 AUV obtained during the mission in the South China Sea, which shows the effectiveness and superiority of the method.

AB A monitoring mission to map and characterize the Point Loma Ocean Outfall (PLOO) wastewater plume using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) was performed on 3 March 2011. The mobility of an AUV provides a significant advantage in surveying discharge plumes over traditional cast-based methods, and when combined with optical and oceanographic sensors, provides a capability for both detecting plumes and assessing their mixing in the near and far-fields. Unique to this study is the measurement of Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) in the discharge plume and its application for quantitative estimates of the plume's dilution. AUV mission planning methodologies for discharge plume sampling, plume characterization using onboard optical sensors, and comparison of observational data to model results are presented. The results suggest that even under variable oceanic conditions, properly planned missions for AUVs equipped with an optical CDOM sensor in addition to traditional oceanographic sensors, can accurately characterize and track ocean outfall plumes at higher resolutions than cast-based techniques.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are applied in a variety of industries to increase the efficiency and safety of maritime operations. Traditional docking and recovery techniques for AUVs, however, can be inefficient. Therefore, the development of a dynamic underwater recovery mechanism for AUVs is now needed. Recent research has investigated the symbiotic relationship between the remora fish and the shark from a hydrodynamic perspective. Numerical simulations have demonstrated that by exploiting the boundary layer and adverse pressure gradient regions around the shark, the resistance experienced by remora fish can be significantly reduced. Inspired by this, an AUV was designed, and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the impact of various attachment locations. Moreover, simulations were performed to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the AUV during the docking process, specifically when it enters the boundary layer of the submarine and approaches it. The boundary layer flow, which influences the AUV's resistance, can also provide a force that attract the AUV towards the submarine. This research identifies an optimal attachment location and investigates the effects on the AUV when two underwater vehicles of significantly different sizes are in close proximity. It supports further study to develop a dynamic underwater docking operation.

AB Recent advancements on autonomous vehicles (AVs) have revolutionized the aviation industry, providing great potential to enhance sustainability for this fuel-intensive industry. Diverse operation types of AVs at airports have emerged (e.g., for baggage/passenger movement). This study aims to provide a guideline on how to switch from the traditional human-driving vehicle operations to AV operations, to help improve the smartness and sustainability of airport operations. Five alternative operation types are evaluated under ten criteria. We propose a new CIVL-BWM-TODIM with Dombi Bonferroni mean operator (DBM) decision framework. The combination of the Continuous Interval-Valued Linguistic tool (CIVL) and the Best Worst Method (BWM) improves the criterial evaluation consistency, and the integration of CIVL and TODIM increases the evaluation accuracy on human language and psychological feelings. Besides, the DBM operator helps effectively integrate information from different experts. Results suggest that applying AVs for both functional activities and scheduled people delivery is the best alternative to build smart and sustainable airports. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to examine the impacts of various parameters on decision making. Moreover, comparative analysis over existing decisionmaking methods are carried out to validate the merits of the proposed approach.

AB With the technological advancements, the autonomous vehicle (AV) is expected to play an active role in the future transportation system. An AV-based public transportation system was recently proposed to unleash the full capability of AVs to provide effective and flexible transportation services. It establishes a new public transportation market that can accommodate multiple vehicle operators. Such multi-tenant system encourages market competition for better quality of service. The pricing process in the original proposal was designed based on the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism, but it is vulnerable to the problems of payoff reduction and shill-bidding. In this paper, we reinvestigate the pricing process to address these vulnerabilities. We formulate it as core-selecting reverse combinatorial auctions and investigate the properties of the "core." We establish a core-selecting mechanism that can maximize customer's utility and prevent shill-bidding. We analyze the theoretical properties of the formulated auctions and the core-selecting mechanism. We verify the results with extensive simulations. The simulation results show that the core-selecting mechanism can result in lower service charge, and suppress untruthfulness, shill-bidding, and coalition formation. It can produce auction results in linear computation time, making it scalable and practical.

AB There is a large body of literature on solving the SLAM problem for various autonomous vehicle applications. A substantial part of the solutions is formulated based on using statistical (mainly Bayesian) filters such as Kalman filter and its extended version. In such solutions, the measurements are commonly some point features or detections collected by the sensor(s) on board the autonomous vehicle. With the increasing utilization of scanners with common autonomous cars, and availability of 3D point clouds in real-time and at fast rates, it is now possible to use more sophisticated features extracted from the point clouds for filtering. This paper presents the idea of using planar features with multi-object Bayesian filters for SLAM. With Bayesian filters, the first step is prediction, where the object states are propagated to the next time based on a stochastic transition model. We first present how such a transition model can be developed, and then propose a solution for state prediction. In the simulation studies, using a dataset of measurements acquired from real vehicle sensors, we apply the proposed model to predict the next planar features and vehicle states. The results show reasonable accuracy and efficiency for statistical filtering-based SLAM applications.

AB In many underwater missions, it is necessary for the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to be stationed at a particular position and orientation to carry out tasks like inspection, opening/closing of valves, or repair of underwater installations. The ability of an AUV to maintain its position and orientation dynamically is termed as dynamic station keeping. Being a free-floating device, dynamic station keeping is not natural to most of the AUVs. This becomes more complex when the vehicle is underactuated and is not neutrally buoyant. In this paper, the problem of dynamic station keeping of an underactuated flat-fish type AUV is analysed and a new method of station keeping is proposed with an addition of dedicated thrusters. Effect of introduction of additional thrusters on tracking performance has been analysed and a modular configuration (using retractable thrusters) is proposed to reduce its influence on tracking control. The effects of underwater current magnitudes and angle of incidences on the station keeping performance are also analyzed. A comparative analysis on power consumption during station keeping is presented to prove the effectiveness of the proposed modular configuration. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
AB This paper describes one aspect of our approach in developing an intelligent off-road autonomous vehicle, the Intelligent Off-Road Navigator (ION), as Team Desert Buckeyes from the Ohio State University for the DARPA Grand Challenge 2005. The real-time navigation is one of the critical components in an autonomous ground vehicle system. In this paper, we focus on the navigation module, whose main responsibility is to generate smooth and obstacle-free local paths with appropriate speed setpoints. For the smooth path generation, we introduce a polynomial interpolation method. To generate obstacle-free paths, a steering controller utilizing a fuzzy obstacle avoidance algorithm is presented. A speed fuzzy controller is introduced to generate the speed setpoints. These two fuzzy controllers collaborate with each other to guide our vehicle ION to the goal safely. The obstacle avoidance algorithm proposed in this paper was also tested in simulations and on small robots successfully. Other issues related to the navigation module are discussed in the paper as well, such as the vehicle's system structure and its finite state machine. As a result, ION achieved great performance in the National Qualification Event, covered about 30 miles in the Nevada Desert with complete autonomous operations, and finished 10th in the Grand Challenge 2005.

AB Traffic sign recognition is a pivotal technology in the advancement of autonomous vehicles as it is critical for adhering to country- or region-specific traffic regulations. Defined as an image classification problem in computer vision, traffic sign recognition is a technique that determines the class of a given traffic sign from input data processed by a neural network. Although image classification has been considered a relatively manageable task with the advent of neural networks, traffic sign classification presents its own unique set of challenges due to the similar visual features inherent in traffic signs. This can make designing a softmax-based classifier problematic. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel traffic sign recognition model that employs angular margin loss. This model optimizes the necessary hyperparameters for the angular margin loss via Bayesian optimization, thereby maximizing the effectiveness of the loss and achieving a high level of classification performance. This paper showcases the impressive performance of the proposed method through experimental results on benchmark datasets for traffic sign classification.

AB Accurate, robust and drift-free global pose estimation is a fundamental problem for autonomous vehicles. In this work, we propose a global drift-free map-based localization method for estimating the global poses of autonomous vehicles that integrates visual-inertial odometry and global localization with respect to a pre-built map. In contrast to previous work on visual-inertial localization, the global pre-built map provides global information to eliminate drift and assists in obtaining the global pose. Additionally, in order to ensure the local odometry frame and the global map frame can be aligned accurately, we augment the transformation between these two frames into the state vector and use a global pose-graph optimization for online estimation. Extensive evaluations on public datasets and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method can provide accurate global pose-estimation results in different scenarios. The experimental results are compared against the mainstream map-based localization method, revealing that the proposed approach is more accurate and consistent than other methods.

AB The aim of this study is to achieve the trajectory-tracking control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the presence of random system uncertainties and external current disturbances. A comprehensive model of an AUV is developed based on its kinematic and dynamic models. By means of appropriate transformations, a new system dynamic equation with arguments of positions and orientations is obtained for the controller design. Here, a proposed finite-time robust tracking control (FTRTC) based on a nonlinear sliding surface constructed using the tracking error which leads not only to trajectory-tracking of the AUV system with a finite-time convergence, but also a high level of robust performance. The stability of the overall system is assured via the Lyapunov stability criteria. Computer simulations conducted using the developed controller demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed FTRTC. Moreover, the simulation results showed that the proposed control scheme resulted in a high level of robustness of the closed-loop control system.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) may significantly impact people's choice of residential locations and spatial structures. The impact may vary across different countries, but few studies have focused on it. This study drew on China and the United States (US) as two cases to study car drivers' knowledge of AVs and willingness to move farther if AVs were available by estimating ordered logistic regression models. The results showed that 42.3% of Chinese and 29.8% of US respondents were likely to consider moving farther away from the nearest city or the destination for the most frequent trip if they had an AV. The Chinese sample had less knowledge of AVs than the US sample, but they were more likely to consider a move. AVs may lead to a new round of urban sprawl, but the challenge may be greater for China. We captured the socio-economic and transport factors that affected this result.

AB Path planning is a prerequisite for autonomous underwater vehicles to perform tasks autonomously. Many shortest distance algorithms are applied, and ocean currents are ignored to plan a short path in distance, which is usually time and energy consuming. In fact, the favourable currents can be exploited while avoiding the opposite ocean flows. Based on the bioinspired neural network architecture, this paper proposes a novel dynamic neural network model to plan the time-saving path in ocean current environments. After that, the path is smoothed by the B-spline algorithm. Analysis of the model shows that it can find out the minimum time path. Many simulations have also been introduced to test the effectiveness of the proposed model, showing good results. The dynamic neural network model has no learning procedure and can run in parallel. It has the advantages of loose parameter restrictions and wide spreading of neural activities. In addition, it has also been proven to be suitable for strong ocean currents.

AB This paper designs a novel double closed-loop three-dimensional (3-D) trajectory tracking method based on model predictive control (MPC) for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) under external disturbances. Different from the conventional model predictive control, the designed double closed-loop control can be divided into two stages: 1) the outer-loop controller generates the desired speed instruction and passes it to the inner-loop speed controller; 2) the inner-loop speed controller generates the available control inputs to ensure the whole closed-loop trajectory tracking. In the controller design stage, the actual constraints on system inputs and state are effectively considered. In order to ensure the smooth operation of AUV, the double closed-loop controller takes the control increments as the control inputs. In addition, the stability analysis based on Lyapunov method proves the nominal stability of the controller. Finally, simulation experiments are designed to verify the tracking performance of the AUV under external disturbances. The results show the effectiveness of the controller.

AB This paper develops and evaluates methods for performing auto-retrieval of a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) using fast 6D relocalisation from visual features. Auto-retrieval involves a combination of guided operation to direct the vehicle through obstacles using a human pilot and autonomous operation to navigate the vehicle on its return or during re-exploration. This approach is useful in tasks such as industrial inspection and monitoring, and in particular to operate indoors in GPS-denied environments. Our relocalisation methodology contrasts two sources of information: depth data and feature co-visibility, but in a novel manner that validates matches before a RANSAC procedure. The result is the ability of performing 6D relocalisation at an average of 50Hz on individual maps containing 120K features. The use of feature co-visibility reduces memory footprint as well as removes the need to employ depth data as used in previous work. This paper concludes with an example of an industrial application involving visual monitoring from a MAV aided by autonomous navigation.

AB We design controllers and derive implementable algorithms for autonomous and cooperative car-following control (CFC) systems under a receding horizon control framework. An autonomous CFC system controls vehicle acceleration to optimize its own situation, whereas a cooperative CFC (C-CFC) system coordinates accelerations of cooperative vehicles to optimize the joint situation. To realize simultaneous control of many vehicles in a traffic system, decentralized and distributed algorithms are implemented in a microscopic traffic simulator for CFC and C-CFC controllers, respectively. The impacts of the proposed controllers on dynamic traffic flow features, particularly on formation and propagation of moving jams, are investigated through a simulation on a two-lane freeway with CFC/C-CFC vehicles randomly distributed. The simulation shows that the proposed decentralized CFC and distributed C-CFC algorithms are implementable in microscopic simulations, and the assessment reveals that CFC and C-CFC systems change moving jam characteristics substantially.

AB Trajectory data of road users play a crucial role in transportation engineering and traffic safety research. Previous vehicle trajectory data, including naturalistic driving data, trajectory data captured by drones and traffic cameras, have greatly promoted the research of traffic safety, traffic simulation, and other transportation engineering fields. However, existing technologies in collecting trajectory data are limited their detection range. With the development of the sensing and tracking technologies, it is possible to track the trajectory information of road users at the wide-area level, i.e., the real-time trajectory data of all road users on the entire road. Recently, we published our data sharing platform, Tongji Road Trajectory Sharing (TJRD TS, available online at https://tjrdts.com) Platform, providing our open wide-area vehicle trajectory data for researchers, academics, and road traffic professionals. Advanced vehicle tracking and trajectory splicing technologies, such as millimeter wave radar and edge computing technology, were employed to obtain such wide-area vehicle trajectory data. In this short communication article, we brainstorm ideas of using wide-area vehicle trajectory data in traffic safety research, traffic efficiency research, and connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) application. We hope this short communication and our published data sharing platform can serve as the steppingstone for those who are interested in road transportation engineering and road safety research using such wide-area vehicle trajectory data.

AB With the flourishing and advancement of autonomous vehicles, the vehicular digital twin (VDT) has become an emerging paradigm, consisting of inter-twin communication and intra-twin communication. VDT can effectively address the current shortcomings of the autonomous vehicle and provide enhanced and scalable services to the users. Nevertheless, strict security and privacy concerns arise, as VDT collects a wide range of privacy-sensitive information of the users in real-time and is exposed to an open network environment in both physical and virtual horizons. In this article, we investigate the security and privacy of VDT. We first describe the vehicular digital twin network architecture in detail and then investigate some VDT-related applications. After that, we discuss the security and privacy issues in VDT. Finally, we put forward several potential countermeasures and open research issues for VDT from the perspective of security and privacy. We expect this work will bring more attention to further investigation on security and privacy solutions for vehicular digital twin networks.

ID PERCEPTION; SYSTEM
AB This study investigates the convex optimization frameworks for accurate and fast negative obstacle detection as well as depth estimations that are vital for real-time, superior autonomous vehicle operations. A convex framework is proposed in conjunction with a unique stereo perception approach to manage the complex nature of such invisible obstacles. The proposed stereo configuration incorporates an alignment that displaces the cameras along a vertical baseline to extract useful information pertaining to negative obstacle features for various illustrative terrain settings. The convex framework exploits these properties to evaluate depth jumps in the disparity space image and perform geometrical analysis of potential occlusion regions. The corresponding convex formulations are based on linear matrix inequalities to detect sudden disparity, angle profile, and intensity variations for potential negative obstacles and to estimate the internal depth of the detected obstacles. Experimental results demonstrate that consecutive processes can be structured in a convex framework to efficiently identify negative obstacle attributes at a range of distances for texture varying environments, providing a vital extension to real-time vehicular system implementations with superior detection rates.

AB Ocean exploration is of major importance for several reasons, including energy and mineral resource retrieval, sovereignty, and environmental concerns. The use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) has thus been receiving increased attention from the scientific community. In this context, it has been shown that the use of buoyancy change modules (BCMs) can significantly improve the energy efficiency of an AUV. However, the literature regarding the detailed design of these modules is scarce. This paper contributes to this field by describing the development of an electromechanical buoyancy change module prototype to be incorporated into an existing AUV. A detailed description of the constraints and compromises existing in the design of the device components is presented. In addition, the mechanical design of the hull based on FEM simulations is described in detail. The prototype is experimentally tested in a shallow pool where its full functionality is shown. The paper also presents preliminary experimental values of the power consumption of the device and compares them with the ones provided by existing models in the literature.

AB The convergence of electrification and automated driving will introduce opportunities to improve the operation and energy-efficiency of transportation systems. This paper discusses the challenges of dispatching autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) in a ride-hailing fleet and their interactions with charging infrastructure. An integrated decision-making framework for dispatching and charging has been proposed using system optimization approaches. An agent-based platform has been developed for simulating and testing the proposed methods. A case study using New York City taxi data has been performed with different fleet sizes, dispatching strategies, and charging networks. Advantages of optimization-based approaches for AEV fleet management have been studied and demonstrated, for example, for a fleet of 1,750 AEVs to meet 100,000 daily requests, optimization-based centralized fleet management would result in 14% more ride requests satisfied and 43% fewer zero-occupancy miles traveled than if AEVs make independent decisions based on heuristic strategy. Benefits on reducing fleet size and charging downtime from optimization approaches are also comprehensively illustrated.

AB In this paper, a novel robust particle filter is proposed to address the measurement outliers occurring in the multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) based cooperative navigation (CN). As compared with the classic unscented particle filter (UPF) based on Gaussian assumption of measurement noise, the proposed robust particle filter based on the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) exhibits better robustness against heavy-tailed measurement noises that are often induced by measurement outliers in CN systems. Furthermore, the proposed robust particle filter is computationally much more efficient than existing robust UPF due to the use of a Kullback-Leibler distance-resampling to adjust the number of particles online. Experimental results based on actual lake trial show that the proposed maximum correntropy based unscented particle filter (MCUPF) has better estimation accuracy than existing state-of-the-art robust filters for CN systems with heavy-tailed measurement noises, and the proposed MCUPF has lower computational complexity than existing robust particle filters.

The AUV formation under consideration is constrained by the desired separations and orientations of follower AUVs with respect to a time-varying lead er AUV. First, a time-varying, smooth feedback control law for the formation-keeping of multiple nonholonomic AUVs is presented by taking advantage of the Lyapunov direct method.. Its asymptotical convergence to a desired formation trajectory prescribed by a leader-follower pair is guaranteed. Second, a time-varying, smooth feedback control law with asymptotic stability is designed to collaboratively moor the follower AUV to its desired docking position and orientation with respect to the leader by using the integrator backstepping method. Third, the realization problems of physical AUV system and singularity avoidance are investigated for applying the aforementioned control laws to a real formation system of AUVs. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control laws.

AB In this paper, we propose a Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing mechanism for mission-critical services in the context of location-aware Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) communications. In particular, the available location information is used to design an ad-hoc wireless network with both inter and intra-slice radio isolation obtained through the reservation of bandwidth (BW) resources. In this general setting, a particular emphasis is given to the use case of autonomous driving for Lightrails and Tramways systems. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism for guaranteeing isolation and for providing the required Quality of Service (QoS) through simulations. In order to evaluate realistic and reference scenario settings, we leverage a customized version of the system-level 5G-air-simulator.

AB Designing a remote driving interface is a really complex problem. Numerous steps must be validated and prepared for the interface to be robust, efficient, and easy to use. We have designed different parts of this interface: the architecture of the remote driving, the mixed reality rendering part, and a simulator to test the interface. The remote driving interface is called SACARI (Supervision of an Autonomous Car by an Augmented Reality Interface) and is mainly working with an autonomous car developed by the IEF lab.

AB Recent technological developments have shown significant potential for transforming urban mobility. Considering first- and last-mile travel and short trips, the rapid adoption of dockless bike-share systems showed the possibility of disruptive change, while simultaneously presenting new challenges, such as fleet management or the use of public spaces. In this paper, we evaluate the operational characteristics of a new class of shared vehicles that are being actively developed in the industry: scooters with self-repositioning capabilities. We do this by adapting the methodology of shareability networks to a large-scale dataset of dockless bike-share usage, giving us estimates of ideal fleet size under varying assumptions of fleet operations. We show that the availability of self-repositioning capabilities can help achieve up to 10 times higher utilization of vehicles than possible in current bike-share systems. We show that actual benefits will highly depend on the availability of dedicated infrastructure, a key issue for scooter and bicycle use. Based on our results, we envision that technological advances can present an opportunity to rethink urban infrastructures and how transportation can be effectively organized in cities.

AB In recent years, considerable progress has been made in semantic segmentation of images with favorable environments. However, the environmental perception of autonomous driving under adverse weather conditions is still very challenging. In particular, the low visibility at nighttime greatly affects driving safety. In this paper, we aim to explore image segmentation in low-light scenarios, thereby expanding the application range of autonomous vehicles. The segmentation algorithms for road scenes based on deep learning are highly dependent on the volume of images with pixel-level annotations. Considering the scarcity of labeled large-scale nighttime data, we performed synthetic data collection and data style transfer using images acquired in daytime based on the autonomous driving simulation platform and generative adversarial network, respectively. In addition, we also proposed a novel nighttime segmentation framework (SFNET-N) to effectively recognize objects in dark environments, aiming at the boundary blurring caused by low semantic contrast in low-illumination images. Specifically, the framework comprises a light enhancement network which introduces semantic information for the first time and a segmentation network with strong feature extraction capability. Extensive experiments with Dark Zurich-test and Nighttime Driving-test datasets show the effectiveness of our method compared with existing state-of-the art approaches, with 56.9% and 57.4% mIoU (mean of category-wise intersection-over-union) respectively. Finally, we also performed real-vehicle verification of the proposed models in road scenes of Zhenjiang city with poor lighting. The datasets are available at https://github.com/pupu-chenyanyan/semantic-segmentation-on-nightime.

AB When Bertha Benz started her trip from Mannheim to Pforzheim in 1888 it was the first time that a car was used for a long distance journey. 125 years later, the Mercedes S-class S 500 Intelligent Drive repeated this historical journey - autonomously, without any intervention by the driver, and in normal traffic. The historical route is 103 km long and exhibits a large variety of situations which are representative for today's traffic. The route passes through the city centers of Mannheim, Heidelberg and through 23 villages and small towns. On this route, the vehicle had to cope with roundabouts, crossroads with and without traffic lights, zebra crossings, narrow street sections, and sometimes it also had to overtake cyclists. In contrast to other projects of autonomous driving, the vehicle was only equipped with close-to-production sensors. Cameras, radar units and an accurate digital map enabled the vehicle to perceive and interpret its environment, even in complex situations. This paper provides a survey of the technical solutions which enabled the vehicle to drive autonomously including the camera based environment perception, the digital maps, the self-localization algorithm, and the behavior planning approach for complex traffic situations.

AB Docking is a safety-critical operation for autonomous surface vehicles and requires highly accurate navigation signals. Since Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) can be unreliable and inaccurate in urban environments, other sensors should be considered for increased redundancy and reliability. To this end, we present a low-cost visual-inertial navigation system that we can use for automatic docking of small vehicles. The proposed system produces state estimates of the vehicle, including position, velocity, and attitude, based on raw image and inertial data. To simplify the navigation task, we use easily identifiable tags as a reference on the dockside. When the vehicle approaches the dock, a visual fiducial system recognizes the tags and estimates the relative pose between the camera onboard the vehicle and the tags at the dockside. The camera-tag pose and inertial data are then fused using an error-state Kalman filter for robust state estimation of the vehicle. For benchmarking, we use an unmanned surface vehicle equipped with a dual-antenna real-time kinematic GNSS receiver for accurate positioning and heading. We show that the proposed method performs well on regular and adverse weather data. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in feedback control through field experiments and can supplement traditional navigation systems for docking operations.

AB The major challenge faced by autonomous vehicles today is driving through busy roads without getting into an accident, especially with a pedestrian. To avoid collision with pedestrians, the vehicle requires the ability to communicate with a pedestrian to understand their actions. The most challenging task in research on computer vision is to detect pedestrian activities, especially at nighttime. The Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) has been developed for driving and parking support for vehicles to visualize sense, send and receive information from the environment but it lacks to detect nighttime pedestrian actions. This article proposes a framework based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) using Scale Invariant Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (SIFRCNN) technologies to efficiently detect pedestrian operations through which the vehicle, as agents train themselves from the environment and are forced to maximize the reward. The SIFRCNN has reduced the running time of detecting pedestrian operations from road images by incorporating Region Proposal Network (RPN) computation. Furthermore, we have used Reinforcement Learning (RL) for optimizing the Q-values and training itself to maximize the reward after getting the state from the SIFRCNN. In addition, the latest incarnation of SIFRCNN achieves near-real-time object detection from road images. The proposed SIFRCNN has been tested on KAIST, City Person, and Caltech datasets. The experimental results show an average improvement of 2.3% miss rate of pedestrian detection at nighttime compared to the other CNN-based pedestrian detectors.

AB Despite significant research progress on small-scale aerial-aquatic robots, most existing prototypes are still constrained by short operation times and limited performance in different fluids. The main challenge is to design a vehicle that satisfies the partially conflicting design requirements for aerial and aquatic operations. In this letter we present a new class of aerial-aquatic robot, the sailing micro air vehicle, "SailMAV." Thanks to a three-part folding wing design, the SailMAV is capable of both flying and sailing. The robot design permits long and targeted missions at the water interface by leveraging the wind as movement vector. It simultaneously offers the flexibility of flight for rapidly reaching a designated area, overcoming obstacles, and moving from one body of water to another, which can be very useful for water sampling in areas with many obstacles. With a total wingspan of 0.96 m, the SailMAV employs the same wing and actuation surfaces for sailing as for flying. It is capable of water surface locomotion as well as takeoff and flight at a cruising speed of 10.8 m.s(-1). The main contributions of this letter are new solutions to the challenges of combined aerial and aquatic locomotions, the design of a novel hybrid concept, the development of the required control laws, and the demonstration of the vehicle successfully sailing and taking off from the water. This letter can inform the design of hybrid vehicles that adapt their morphology to move effectively.

AB Sideslip angle estimation is vital to the safety and active control of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, an innovative vehicle kinematic-based sideslip angle estimation method is proposed. The method is built on multi-sensor fusion, which fuses the information of inertial measurement unit, global navigation satellite system (GNSS), and onboard sensors to continuously estimate the attitude and velocity of the vehicle and thus obtain the sideslip angle. The invariant extended Kalman filter framework is adopted and the left-invariant form is derived to implement the GNSS measurement update. In order to solve the unobservability problem when only a single GNSS receiver is equipped, the vehicle motion constraint is introduced into the filter to improve the accuracy of heading angle estimation. The method is validated by field test and the results show that the method is robust in terms of converge efficiency. Furthermore, the sideslip angle estimation accuracy is satisfactory with the average absolute error less than 0.25 degrees, which meets the active safety control requirements for autonomous driving.

AB Strategic investment(s) in vehicle automation technologies led to the rapid development of technology that revolutionised transport services and reduced fatalities on a scale never seen before. Technological advancements and their integration in Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) increased uptake and adoption and pushed firmly for the development of highly supportive legal and regulatory and testing environments. However, systemic threats to the security and privacy of technologies and lack of data transparency have created a dynamic threat landscape within which the establishment and verification of security and privacy requirements proved to be an arduous task. In CAVs security and privacy issues can affect the resilience of these systems and hinder the safety of the passengers. Existing research efforts have been placed to investigate the security issues in CAVs and propose solutions across the whole spectrum of cyber resilience. This paper examines the state-of-the-art in security and privacy solutions for CAVs. It investigates their integration challenges, drawbacks and efficiencies when coupled with distributed technologies such as Blockchain. It has also listed different cyber-attacks being investigated while designing security and privacy mechanism for CAVs.

AB The past decade has seen a rapid acceleration in investment on and development of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Cities need to be ready for the mass adoption of CAVs, to harness their benefits and minimise negative impacts. However, currently there are no concrete frameworks and criteria to measure city readiness for CAVs, and existing literature lacks quantitative multi-stakeholder analysis for this multi-stakeholder issue. This study thus aims to contribute to the knowledge gaps by exploring different stakeholders' assessment criteria on cities' infrastructure readiness, policy and regulation readiness, and citizen readiness for CAVs, using analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Data were collected through an online survey (N = 381) with participants representing three professional and three general public stakeholder groups. The results show that infrastructure readiness was overall considered most important, and there were different opinions between stakeholder groups especially regarding policy and regulation readiness. These differences might be associated with stakeholder groups' expectations on the potential impacts of CAVs. Exchanges of views and concerns between different stakeholder groups are needed to gain a comprehensive understanding of how cities can be best prepared for CAVs.

AB To reduce the adverse effect of the functional insufficiency of the steering system on the accuracy of path tracking, a path tracking approach considering safety of the intended functionality is proposed by coordinating automatic steering and differential braking in this paper. The proposed method adopts a hierarchical architecture consisting of a coordinated control layer and an execution control layer. In coordinated control layer, an extension controller considering functional insufficiency of the steering system, tire force characteristics and vehicle driving stability is proposed to determine the weight coefficients of automatic steering and the differential braking, and a model predictive controller is designed to calculate the desired front wheel angle and additional yaw moment. In execution control layer, a H infinity steering angle controller considering external disturbances and parameter uncertainty is designed to track desired front wheel angle, and a braking force distribution module is used to determine the wheel cylinder pressure of the controlled wheels. Both simulation and experiment results show that the proposed method can overcome the functional insufficiency of the steering system and improve the accuracy of path tracking while maintaining the stability of the autonomous vehicle.

ID GENDER
AB This paper discusses the concept of 'fairness' in transport, specifically regarding women using public transport, future autonomous vehicle taxis or bicycle sharing. Women generally have varying and complex mobility patterns compared to men and suffer disproportionate fairness issues when using transport. Different concepts of fairness are explored, including: equality of opportunity, equity and justice (including procedural, social and distributional justice). While each of these concepts has different implications for women using transport, it is also recognized that fairness principles should apply to all people (regardless of sex, gender or other characteristics). Analysis of the different forms of mobility, as represented by public transport, autonomous vehicles and bicycle sharing, illustrate a variety of specific fairness issues. Factors such as safety and security, cost, physical design of infrastructure and vehicles, and characteristics such as low-income or childcare responsibilities arise in each case. The three cases also indicate a range of both horizonal fairness factors (similar people being treated similarly) and vertical fairness factors (such as more disadvantaged people receiving greater support). Further research is required into setting frameworks for a more comprehensive inclusion of, and balance between, different concepts of fairness and their interactions in both transport policy and practice.

AB This article presents an adaptive event-triggered dynamic output feedback interval type-2 (IT-2) T-S fuzzy control method for autonomous electric vehicle systems. First, the IT-2 T-S fuzzy model is introduced to describe the nonlinear lateral dynamics of the vehicle systems. Second, a novel adaptive event-triggered strategy is designed to reduce the computational burden. Third, the phenomenon of intermittent measurements is depicted by the Bernoulli random distributed process, and the failure of the actuator is also included. According to the Lyapunov stability theory, an IT-2 T-S fuzzy dynamic output feedback controller (DOFC) is presented to ensure the random stability and performance of the vehicle systems. Finally, the effectiveness and real-time performance of the proposed control strategy are verified via numerical simulation and a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test platform.

AB This paper addresses the driver-automation shared driving control for lane keeping and obstacle avoidance of automated vehicles in highway traffic. The proposed shared control framework is established from a novel cooperative trajectory planning algorithm and a fuzzy steering controller. Based on polynomial functions, the cooperative trajectory planning is formulated by judiciously exploiting the information on the maneuver decision, the conflict management, and the driver monitoring. As a result, the planned trajectory of the vehicle is continuously adapted according to the driver's actions and intentions. By means of Lyapunov stability arguments, sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities are given to design a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model-based controller. This robust steering controller provides a necessary assistive torque to track the planned vehicle trajectory. The new shared driving control framework allows reducing effectively the driver-automation conflict issue while offering the driver more freedom to swerve within a predefined lane. The advantages of the proposed approach are evaluated using both objective and subjective results, experimentally obtained from several human drivers and an advanced interactive dynamic driving simulator.

AB In this study, the performance of a slope Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) system that estimates the angle of inclination in a V2V-based vehicle was evaluated. Existing AEB systems do not take changes in the angle of inclination into account or they use a reference angle, which results in limited braking properties on a slope. To improve the braking properties of AEB systems on slopes, the angle of inclination must be estimated. We propose an AEB system that employs an extended Kalman filter, along with an in-vehicle sensor (ESC) combined with a bicycle model and linear tire model to estimate the angle of inclination. We conducted comparative analysis via simulations of the performance of the proposed AEB system with those of an AEB system that does not consider slope and another one that uses a reference angle of inclination at a variety of angles of inclination and velocities. The results obtained verify the utility of the proposed extended Kalman filter-based AEB system on slopes.

AB This paper studies target tracking control of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles in the presence of model uncertainties and environmental disturbances. Dynamic surface control, neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to develop a target tracking controller for underwater vehicles in three-dimensional space. Then, a Lyapunov-based stability analysis proves that all signals are bounded in the closed loop control system and tracking errors converge to a neighborhood of the origin. Following advantages are highlighted in this paper: (1) the proposed controller utilizes line-of-sight measurements of range and angle sensors to track a manoeuvring underwater target in three-dimensional space; (ii) computational complexities of the traditional backstepping method are greatly reduced via command filtering by employing dynamic surface control (DSC) technique; (iii) the proposed controller is easily implemented in practice without any prior knowledge of vehicle dynamics, parameters and environmental disturbances. At the end, simulation results demonstrate the tracking performance of the proposed control system for offshore applications.

AB This article investigates an improved adaptive dynamic event-triggered control scheme for autonomous under-water vehicles (AUVs) under the quaternion-based attitude representation. The main innovation in this paper is to improve the dynamic event-triggered (DET) algorithm, which makes the trade-off between the control per-formance of the AUV system and the communication frequency in the controller-to-actuator (CA) channel easier to be achieved. Primarily, to describe the attitude representation of the AUV in a unique form, a unified auxiliary variable confining the scalar quaternion's initial error value is developed to avoid the potential unwinding phenomenon. Subsequently, based on the unified auxiliary variable, an event-based adaptive control law is tactfully designed to mitigate the adverse effects of lumped external perturbations and unknown model dy-namics. Moreover, by introducing the modified trigger adjustment algorithm, the trigger frequency can be adapted to the performance requirements of the AUV system at different evolutionary stages. Finally, theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of the provided method.

AB With the development of autonomous bus (AB) technology, flexible marshaling strategies based on platooning with different numbers of buses have been proposed. However, the environmental benefits of platooning have been ignored or set to a fixed value. Therefore, a methodology is proposed to measure the AB energy consumption considering platooning. First, the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is used to explore the impact of platooning on aerodynamics. Second, vehicle specific power (VSP) is introduced to quantify the environmental characteristics of the AB in a single-bus scenario. Third, an energy consumption model that considers platooning is developed. Finally, the environmental benefits of AB platooning are discussed under different conditions while considering speed, acceleration, and spacing. The results show that platooning can significantly improve the environmental benefits of ABs under conditions of close spacing and high speed. This study supports the further development of platooning control algorithms and AB operation strategies.

AB This work focuses on motion control of high-velocity autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Conventional methods are effective solutions to motion control of low-and-medium-velocity AUV. Usually not taken into consideration in the control model, the residual dead load and damping force which vary with the AUV's velocity tend to result in difficulties in motion control or even failure in convergence in the case of high-velocity movement. With full consideration given to the influence of residual dead load and changing damping force upon AUV motion control, a novel sliding-mode controller (SMC) is proposed in this work. The stability analysis of the proposed controller is carried out on the basis of Lyapunov function. The sea trials results proved the superiority of the sliding-mode controller over sigmoid-function-based controller (SFC). The novel controller demonstrated its effectiveness by achieving admirable control results in the case of high-velocity movement.

AB Autonomous flight of micro air vehicles (MAVs) in hostile indoor environments poses significant challenges in terms of control and navigation. In order to support navigation and control research for indoor micro air vehicles, a four-wing tail-sitter type rotorcraft MAV weighing less than 350g has been designed in this paper. In an effort to achieve autonomous indoor flight, an embedded integrated avionic system has been developed. The modeling process has been conducted to obtain accurate six degrees of freedom dynamical model for the designed rotorcraft MAV. In addition, aerodynamic coefficients are evaluated from the results of Computational Fluid Dynamics A PI-ADRC double loop controller with inner-loop outer-loop control scheme has been proposed which takes into account the system's nonlinearities and uncertainties. The proposed flight controller was implemented on the designed rotorcraft MAV that has undergone various simulation and indoor flight tests. Experimental results that demonstrate robustness of the proposed controller with respect to external disturbances and the capabilities of the designed rotorcraft MAV are presented.

SO IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING

DE Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs); Markov chains; risk analysis
AB The deployment of complex autonomous underwater platforms for marine science comprises sequential steps each of which is critical to mission success. Here we present a state transition approach, in the form of a Markov chain, which models step sequence from prelaunch to operation to recovery. The aim is to identify states and state transitions presenting high risk to the vehicle and hence to the mission, based on evidence and judgment. Developing a Markov chain consists of two separate tasks. The first defines the structure that encodes event sequence. The second assigns probabilities to each possible transition. Our model comprises 11 discrete states, and includes distance-dependent underway survival statistics. Integration of the Markov model with underway survival statistics allows us to quantify success likelihood during each state and state transition, and consequently the likelihood of achieving desired mission goals. To illustrate this generic process, the fault history of the Autosub3 autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) provides the information for different operation phases. In our proposed method, faults are discriminated according to the mission phase in which they took place.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS

DT Article; Early Access
DE Scalable adaptive control; level-k game theory; driving aggressiveness;
   multi-vehicle interaction
AB Sharing the road with human drivers requires autonomous vehicles to account for interactions between them. To resolve traffic conflicts in unsignalized intersections, a robust adaptive game-theoretic decision-making algorithm with scalability is proposed based on the receding horizon optimization, level-k game theory, and switching directed graph. A mismatch between the inherent (k-1) assumption of level-k theory and actual driver type may lead to unsafe action selection and reduce driving safety. To handle this problem, in this work, an autonomous vehicle would predict the driver types of surrounding vehicles based on historical interactive behaviors between them and utilize its trust in the driver types to achieve an adaptive driving strategy. Besides, switching interaction graph is incorporated into an adaptive level-k framework for the first time, so as to cut off the connection between ego vehicle and nearby vehicles that do not affect driving behavior of the former, contributing to reducing the computing complexity. The feasibility, effectiveness, and real-time implementation of the proposed method are validated on both hardware and ROS-Gazebo platform.

DE Autonomous driving; Dynamic obstacle; Golden-section search; Lane
   change; Optimal path
AB To reduce the calculation time needed to determine the optimal path, the form of the road and the path of an autonomous vehicle were linearized; additionally, among multiple obstacles, only those that were potentially dangerous were chosen. By considering the movement of moving obstacles, the cost was calculated. The calculation time was shortened by reducing the number of design variables of the optimal path, when changing lanes to avoid obstacles, to two. Limiting conditions, such as the lateral and longitudinal acceleration, were excluded from the cost calculation by restricting the search region of the design variable. The final result was calculated using a relatively free search of the golden-section search regarding the initial value setting. For the golden-section search, the number of final design variables was reduced to one; this was done by optimizing the search direction. The search direction was determined based on the final position of the vehicles and the calculated optimal points. By including a collision avoidance algorithm and moving in a short period of time, the calculated optimal path prevented accidents due to path errors caused by simplification. The path could be found easily, even for complex road shapes and with multiple vehicles nearby.

AB Decision-making is one of the key parts of the research on vehicle longitudinal autonomous driving. Considering the behavior of human drivers when designing autonomous driving decision-making strategies is a current research hotspot. In longitudinal autonomous driving decision-making strategies, traditional rule-based decision-making strategies are difficult to apply to complex scenarios. Current decision-making methods that use reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning construct reward functions designed with safety, comfort, and economy. Compared with human drivers, the obtained decision strategies still have big gaps. Focusing on the above problems, this paper uses the driver's behavior data to design the reward function of the deep reinforcement learning algorithm through BP neural network fitting, and uses the deep reinforcement learning DQN algorithm and the DDPG algorithm to establish two driver-like longitudinal autonomous driving decision-making models. The simulation experiment compares the decision-making effect of the two models with the driver curve. The results shows that the two algorithms can realize driver-like decision-making, and the consistency of the DDPG algorithm and human driver behavior is higher than that of the DQN algorithm, the effect of the DDPG algorithm is better than the DQN algorithm.

AB Automated driving and the widespread use of large-scale communication infrastructure are expected to facilitate highly cooperative driving. Although considerable research has focused on developing efficient cooperative control methods for nonsignalized intersections, the effect of cooperative control for conflicting target vehicles on future traffic flow is yet to be investigated. Therefore, we aim to investigate whether the impact of such cooperative control on future traffic should be considered. We established a traffic simulator and several machine-learning methods to select the optimal cooperative method. The decision tree and deep neural network were trained on two indices that evaluate short-term/long-term predictive control: to minimize the travel time of the 1) conflicting vehicles and 2) all vehicles including future traffic flow. Simulation analysis results indicated that there were no significant differences in the total travel times between these indices. This finding indicates that efficient traffic flow, which includes future traffic flow, is achievable by short-term cooperative control methods that can be established easily.

AB A ski-stunt maneuver is a type of aggressive vehicle motions in which a four-wheel vehicle runs on two wheels on one side, and the other two wheels are lifted in the air. It is a challenging task even for skilled car drivers to perform a ski-stunt maneuver. We present the safety-guaranteed motion control of autonomous ski-stunt maneuvers. Inspired by bicycle dynamics, a vehicle dynamic model is first built for ski-stunt motion. To prevent possible rollovers, a control barrier function is used in a model predictive control formulation to plan a safe motion trajectory. A motion controller is then designed to follow the safe trajectory with guaranteed balance. Ski-stunt maneuver initiation and switching strategies are also analyzed and designed. Extensive experiments are conducted using a scaled truck platform to demonstrate the control design. The experimental results confirm that the vehicle can successfully initiate the ski-stunt maneuver to safely navigate among obstacles and narrow passes and then switch back to normal driving.

AB At a public parking facility, only electric vehicles (EVs) that are parked at dedicated parking spaces with charging points can enjoy charging services. Installing a charging point at each parking space is an expensive way to support increasing EV penetration. As an alternative, this paper proposes the novel idea of autonomous robot-like mobile charger, which can move freely to visit different parking spaces to charge vehicles. Mobile charger decouples EV charging requirement from parking requirement. A Markov chain model is developed to describe the mobile charger operation in a parking facility, which is shared by EVs and non-EVs with stochastic arrivals and departures. The model is used to study performance of the charger, in terms of system throughput, charging delay, and blocking probability. Accuracy of the proposed model has been verified through extensive simulations. It is found that the maximum throughput of a mobile charger is dependent only on the effective charging powers, which may be affected by the size of parking facility. As a system planning criterion, EV arrival rate must not exceed the maximum charger throughput.

   Uniting control; Hybrid control systems
AB We consider the problem of autonomously controlling a fixed-wing aerial vehicle to visit a neighborhood of a pre-defined waypoint, and when nearby it, loiter around it. To solve this problem, we propose a hybrid feedback control strategy that unites two state-feedback controllers: a transit controller capable of steering or transitioning the vehicle to nearby the waypoint and a loiter controller capable of steering the vehicle about a loitering radius. The aerial vehicle is modeled on a level flight plane with system performance characterized in terms of the aerodynamic, propulsion, and mass properties. Thrust and bank angle are the control inputs. Asymptotic stability properties of the individual control algorithms, which are designed using backstepping, as well as of the closed-loop system, which includes a hybrid algorithm uniting the two controllers, are established. In particular, for this application of hybrid feedback control, Lyapunov functions and hybrid systems theory are employed to establish stability properties of the set of points defining loitering. The analytical results are confirmed numerically by simulations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present a system consisting of a miniature unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a small carrier vehicle, in which the UAV is capable of autonomously starting from the moving ground vehicle, tracking it at a constant distance and landing on a platform on the carrier in motion. Our visual tracking approach differs from other methods by using low-cost, lightweight commodity consumer hardware. As main sensor we use a Wii remote infrared (IR) camera, which allows robust tracking of a pattern of IR lights in conditions without direct sunlight. The system does not need to communicate with the ground vehicle and works with an onboard 8-bit microcontroller. Nevertheless the position and orientation relative to the IR pattern is estimated at a frequency of approximately 50 Hz. This enables the UAV to fly fully autonomously, performing flight control, self-stabilisation and visual tracking of the ground vehicle. We present experiments in which our UAV performs autonomous flights with a moving ground carrier describing a circular path and where the carrier is rotating. The system provides small errors and allows for safe, autonomous indoor flights.

AB The control principle implies that people should not feel guilt for outcomes beyond their control. Yet, the so-called 'agent and observer puzzles' in philosophy demonstrate that people waver in their commitment to the control principle when reflecting on accidental outcomes. In the context of car accidents involving conventional or autonomous vehicles (AVs), Study 1 established that judgments of responsibility are most strongly associated with expressions of guilt-over and above other negative emotions, such as sadness, remorse or anger. Studies 2 and 3 then confirmed that, while people generally endorse the control principle, and deny that occupants in an AV should feel guilt when involved in an accident, they nevertheless ascribe guilt to those same occupants. Study 3 also uncovered novel implications of the observer puzzle in the legal context: Passengers in an AV were seen as more legally liable than either passengers in a conventional vehicle, or even their drivers-especially when participants were prompted to reflect on the passengers' affective experience of guilt. Our findings document an important conflict-in the context of AV accidents-between people's prescriptive reasoning about responsibility and guilt on one hand, and their counter-normative experience of guilt on the other, with apparent implications for liability decisions.

AB Model predictive control is one of the main methods used in path tracking for autonomous vehicles. To improve the path tracking performance of the vehicle, a path tracking method based on model predictive control with variable predictive horizon is proposed in this paper. Based on the designed model predictive controller for path tracking, the response analysis of path tracking control system under the different predictive horizons is carried out to clarify the influence of predictive horizon on path tracking accuracy, driving comfort and real-time of the control algorithm. Then, taking the lateral offset, the steering frequency and the real-time of the control algorithm as comprehensive performance indexes, the particle swarm optimization algorithm is designed to realize the adaptive optimization for the predictive horizon. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated via numerical simulation based on Simulink/CarSim and hardware-in-the-loop experiment on an autonomous driving simulator. The obtained results show that the optimized predictive horizon can adapt to the different driving environment, and the proposed path tracking method has good comprehensive performance in terms of path tracking accuracy of the vehicle, driving comfort and real-time.

AB This brief is concerned with the distributed maneuvering of multiple autonomous surface vehicles guided by a virtual leader moving along a parameterized path. In the guidance loop, a distributed guidance law is developed by incorporating a constant bearing strategy into a path-maneuvering design such that a prescribed formation pattern can be reached. To optimize the guidance signal under velocity constraint as well as minimize control torque during transient phase, an optimization-based command governor is employed to generate an optimal guidance signal for vehicle kinetics. The optimization problem is formulated as a bound-constrained quadratic programming problem, which is solved using a recurrent neural network. In the control loop, an estimator is developed where a fuzzy system is used to approximate unknown kinetics based on input and output data. Next, a kinetic control law is constructed based on the optimal command signal and the fuzzy-system-based estimator. By virtue of cascade stability analysis, it is proven that distributed maneuvering errors converge to a residual set. The simulation results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

AB This study intends to redescribe the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) combined with belief classification and relation in the theory of reasoned action in a study on the intention to use Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Using need motivation theory, the study constructs descriptive be-liefs in TAM and introduces Perceived Safety (PS) into TAM to explain the use intention of po-tential users of AVs. The participants filled out an online questionnaire after watching a video of AVs driving on an open roadway. The study collected 470 valid questionnaires. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to organize data, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was further used to perform hypotheses testing and effect analysis. The results indicated that PS, Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), and Perceived Usefulness (PU) exert direct effects on use intention. PS and PEU also exerted indirect effects use intention through PU, and the total and indirect effects of PS were found to be greater than those of PEU, which validates the sig-nificant influence of PS in TAM. Moreover, the findings validated the role of PS as a descriptive belief in TAM in influencing the PU of inferred beliefs.

AB The demand for autonomous motion control of unmanned aerial vehicles in air combat is boosted as taking the initiative in combat appears more and more crucial. Unmanned aerial vehicles inability to manoeuvre autonomously during air combat that features highly dynamic and uncertain manoeuvres of the enemy; however, limits their combat capabilities, which proves to be very challenging. To meet the challenge, this article proposes an autonomous manoeuvre decision model using an expert actor-based soft actor critic algorithm that reconstructs empirical replay buffer with expert experience. Specifically, the algorithm uses a small amount of expert experience to increase the diversity of the samples, which can largely improve the exploration and utilisation efficiency of deep reinforcement learning. And to simulate the complex battlefield environment, a one-to-one air combat model is established and the concept of missile's attack region is introduced. The model enables the one-to-one air combat to be simulated under different initial battlefield situations. Simulation results show that the expert actor-based soft actor critic algorithm can find the most favourable policy for unmanned aerial vehicles to defeat the opponent faster, and converge more quickly, compared with the soft actor critic algorithm.

AB With the potential of increasing mobility and reducing cost, shared mobility of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is going to gain solid growth in the coming decade. The major issue for the shared use of AVs is how to project serving routes in an efficiently way. From another perspective, this issue could be understood as to segment maximum number of passengers into groups. Therefore, this paper intends to investigate passengers' similarity instead of directly matching AVs and passengers. The goal is to determine the minimum number of groups and assign each group with an AV. To this end, a cluster-based algorithm is proposed to classify passengers. Numerical experiments with both small-size and large-size demands are performed to present the validity of the proposed algorithm. Results indicate that the cluster-based algorithm could bring benefit to minimizing the number of vehicles and total travel distance. At last, sensitivity analysis of key parameters shows that vehicle capacity will have little impact when the number of seats exceeds four, and time windows could make continuous influence on gathering passengers.

AB When using deep reinforcement learning algorithm to complete Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) autonomous obstacle avoidance and target tracking tasks, there are often some problems such as slow convergence speed and low success rate. Therefore, this paper proposes a new deep reinforcement learning algorithm, namely Multiple Pools Twin Delay Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MPTD3) algorithm. Firstly, the state space and action space of UAV are established as continuous models, which is closer to engineering practice than discrete models. Then, multiple experience pools mechanism and gradient truncation are designed to improve the convergence of the algorithm. Furthermore, the generalization ability of the algorithm is obtained by giving UAV environmental perception ability. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

   Unmanned surface vehicle (USV)
AB The unmanned surface vehicle (USV) has been widely used to accomplish missions in the sea or dangerous marine areas for ships with sailors, which greatly expands protective capability and detection range. When USVs perform various missions in sophisticated marine environment, autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance will be necessary and essential. However, there are few effective navigation methods with real-time path planning and obstacle avoidance in dynamic environment. With tailored design of state and action spaces and a dueling deep Q-network, a deep reinforcement learning method ANOA (Autonomous Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance) is proposed for the autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance of USVs. Experimental results demonstrate that ANOA outperforms deep Q-network (DQN) and Deep Sarsa in the efficiency of exploration and the speed of convergence not only in static environment but also in dynamic environment. Furthermore, the ANOA is integrated with the real control model of a USV moving in surge, sway and yaw and it achieves a higher success rate than Recast navigation method in dynamic environment.

AB Unpredictable situations frequently occur in real driving environments, and it is often difficult to recognize road signs. In this case, autonomous vehicles (AVs) have a limited ability to predict areas that cannot be detected, making it difficult to judge objects accurately when some information is lost. Therefore, we propose a framework that helps AVs infer proper information under limited conditions. The entire process consists of three steps. First, the missing part of the road sign is restored using the image generative pre-trained transformer model. Next, the sample image with the highest classification accuracy and restored quality is selected among several sample images. Finally, the selected image is provided to users through the designed user interface. The proposed framework improved recognition accuracy compared with unrestored accuracy, indicating the possibility of application as a driving assistance system, and is meaningful in that it is a system that mimics human reasoning ability.

AB This paper aims to address the obstacle avoidance problem of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in complex environments by proposing a trajectory planning method based on the Gauss pseudospectral method (GPM). According to the kinematics and dynamics constraints, and the obstacle avoidance requirement in AUV navigation, a multi-constraint trajectory planning model is established. The model takes energy consumption and sailing time as optimization objectives. The optimal control problem is transformed into a nonlinear programming problem by the GPM. The trajectory satisfying the optimization objective can be obtained by solving the problem with a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm. For the optimization of calculation parameters, the cubic spline interpolation method is proposed to generate initial value. Finally, through comparison with the linear fitting method, the rapidity of the solution of the cubic spline interpolation method is verified. The simulation results show that the cubic spline interpolation method improves the operation performance by 49.35% compared with the linear fitting method, which verifies the effectiveness of the cubic spline interpolation method in solving the optimal control problem.

AB This paper describes in detail a novel multi-sonar controller developed at the University of Limerick and tested on the new smart, remotely operated vehicle (ROV) Latis at sea in March 2009. The multi-sonar controller allows the simultaneous operation of similar-frequency imaging and mapping sonar by interrogating the sonar returns of the multi-beam sonar in real time and adaptively triggering the pings of each sonar in a terrain-adaptive manner to avoid cross-talk and interference in sonar returns. The technique has benefits in hydrographic mapping and in payload sonar management on unmanned underwater vehicles. Detailed results on the testing of the sonar controller system are reported. The paper also describes the smart ROV Latis, designed and built at the University of Limerick, on which the sonar systems have been tested. With its advanced control systems and high-bandwidth networking capabilities, the ROV Latis is an ideal platform for experimentation of new techniques such as the multi-sonar controller, which can be ported to other ROVs and autonomous underwater vehicle platforms once proven.

AB A coordination control strategy based on stability judgment is presented for autonomous vehicles (AVs) aiming to enhance the handling and stability performance. Firstly, the stability judgment scheme is used to evaluate the real-time stability level of vehicles based on the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) neural network and K-Means algorithm. Secondly, a coordination controller of active front steering (AFS) and direct yaw moment control (DYC) is designed to track the desired vehicle motion. To enhance the handling and stability of AVs, the weights of AFS and DYC controllers are adaptively adjusted according to the vehicle stability level. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified in co-simulation environment of CarSim and Simulink, and a rapid control prototyping test is implemented to evaluate the feasibility and robustness. The results indicate that the stability judgment scheme and coordination control strategy for AVs can not only satisfy the requirements of path tracking accuracy but also enhance the handling and stability performance.

AB The introduction of light emitting diodes (LED) in automotive exterior lighting systems provides opportunities to develop viable alternatives to conventional communication and sensing technologies. Most of the advanced driver-assist and autonomous vehicle technologies are based on Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR) or Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems that use radio frequency or laser signals, respectively. While reliable and real-time information on vehicle speeds is critical for traffic operations management and autonomous vehicles safety, RADAR or LiDAR systems have some deficiencies especially in curved road scenarios where the incidence angle is rapidly varying. In this paper, we propose a novel speed estimation system so-called the Visible Light Detection and Ranging (ViLDAR) that builds upon sensing visible light variation of the vehicle's headlamp. We determine the accuracy of the proposed speed estimator in straight and curved road scenarios. We further present how the algorithm design parameters and the channel noise level affect the speed estimation accuracy. For wide incidence angles, the simulation results show that the ViLDAR outperforms RADAR/LiDAR systems in both straight and curved road scenarios.

AB Objective: To lay the basis of studying autonomous driving comfort using driving simulators, we assessed the behavioral validity of two moving-base simulator configurations by contrasting them with a test-track setting.
   Background: With increasing level of automation, driving comfort becomes increasingly important. Simulators provide a safe environment to study perceived comfort in autonomous driving. To date, however, no studies were conducted in relation to comfort in autonomous driving to determine the extent to which results from simulator studies can be transferred to on-road driving conditions.
   Method: Participants (N = 72) experienced six differently parameterized lane-change and deceleration maneuvers and subsequently rated the comfort of each scenario. One group of participants experienced the maneuvers on a test-track setting, whereas two other groups experienced them in one of two moving-base simulator configurations.
   Results: We could demonstrate relative and absolute validity for one of the two simulator configurations. Subsequent analyses revealed that the validity of the simulator highly depends on the parameterization of the motion system.
   Conclusion: Moving-base simulation can be a useful research tool to study driving comfort in autonomous vehicles. However, our results point at a preference for subunity scaling factors for both lateral and longitudinal motion cues, which might be explained by an underestimation of speed in virtual environments.
   Application: In line with previous studies, we recommend lateral-and longitudinal-motion scaling factors of approximately 50% to 60% in order to obtain valid results for both active and passive driving tasks.

AB Near-ground manoeuvres, such as landing, are key elements in unmanned aerial vehicle navigation. Traditionally, these manoeuvres have been done using external reference frames to measure or estimate the velocity and the height of the vehicle. Complex near-ground manoeuvres are performed by flying animals with ease. These animals perform these complex manoeuvres by exclusively using the information from their vision and vestibular system. In this paper, we use the Tau theory, a visual strategy that, is believed, is used by many animals to approach objects, as a solution for relative ground distance control for unmanned vehicles. In this paper, it is shown how this approach can be used to perform near-ground manoeuvres in a vertical and horizontal manner on a moving target without the knowledge of height and velocity of either the vehicle or the target. The proposed system is tested with simulations. Here, it is shown that, using the proposed methods, the vehicle is able to perform landing on a moving target, and also they enable the user to choose the dynamic characteristics of the approach.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) movement in a narrower traffic lane and anticipated climate change are crucial for asphalt concrete (AC) pavement distress. This study assesses the combined effect of AVs and climate change on the performance of AC pavement for a road section in Ontario, Canada. The performance of AC pavement due to AVs and climate change has been evaluated using the AASHTOWare Mechanistic-Empirical (ME) pavement design. AVs were incorporated in ME pavement design using traffic factors such as adjusting traffic volume with the load equivalency and lane distribution factors. This analysis was carried out to determine the individual and combined influence of AVs and climate change on pavement performance. This study determines the combined impacts of AVs and climate change by comparing pavement performances for human-driven vehicles with historical climate and AVs with projected climate. The comparative performance analyses of human-driven vehicles and AVs with projected climate demonstrated the effect of climate change. AVs and climate change combinedly and AVs alone accelerate the accumulation of AC rutting and bottom-up fatigue cracking. The regulation of AVs explicitly to ensure uniform loading distribution and the placement of AVs with non-AVs in a controlled manner were the best alternatives to minimise pavement distress.

AB Aim This study identifies and compares perceptions of autonomous vehicle (AV) implementation among three Swedish stakeholder groups: Future Users, Urban Planners, and Developers. Method Semi-structured comparative focus groups were conducted separately with each of the three groups of stakeholders and the transcripts were analysed in broad themes using thematic analysis. Results Assumptions, hopes, concerns, and direction of development were the main themes that emerged from the analysis. Assumptions included electrification of vehicles, changes in travel demand, and the need for regulations; Hopes included the idea that AVs will contribute to a more accessible and safer transport system; Concerns included overtrust in AV technology, a possible detrimental impact on the city in the form of congestion and higher demand for investments in infrastructure that could outcompete other modes of transport; and Direction of development and their own role, where the need for collaboration between stakeholders and implementation of AVs in connection with society's needs were emphasised. Conclusions AVs were seen to lead to both positive and negative consequences depending on implementation and the development of society. The study shows that dialogue between different stakeholders is lacking but it is desired for the inclusive implementation of AVs.

AB Owning to its extremely long endurance, small size, cost-effective employment, easy, and fast transported properties, the merits of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) exceed those of manned underwater vehicles. Therefore, it has become an indispensable member in navies throughout the world, as well as with oceanographic research, commercial resource explorations, and especially the underwater search and rescue (SAR) sectors. Up to date, the tragic MH370 and QZ8501 flight incidents have dramatically increasing the awareness of high-performance SAR equipment, which in turn will stimulate the states party to the incident to urgently upgrade their shallow-and deep-sea SAR equipment. To extend the range (endurance) and shorter the searching period for the next generation SAR AUV, a sea water cooled high-power density magnetically slotless permanent magnet brushless motor is proposed and integrated with pump-jet's impeller to achieve designated shaftless pump-jet propulsor. In this paper, the developed shaftless pump-jet propulsion system is applied in Naval University of Engineering series multi-purpose long-range and high-speed deep-sea AUV, which could provide excellent performance as a SAR platform.

ID ASTERISK; ALGORITHMS
AB We present an algorithm that, given a representation of a road network in lane-level detail, computes a route that minimizes the expected cost to reach a given destination. In doing so, our algorithm allows us to solve for the complex trade-offs encountered when trying to decide not just which roads to follow, but also when to change between the lanes making up these roads, in order to-for example-reduce the likelihood of missing a left exit while not unnecessarily driving in the leftmost lane. This routing problem can naturally be formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), in which lane change actions have stochastic outcomes. However, MDPs are known to be time-consuming to solve in general. In this paper, we show that-under reasonable assumptions-we can use a Dijkstra-like approach to solve this stochastic problem, and benefit from its efficient O(n log n) running time. This enables an autonomous vehicle to exhibit lane-selection behavior as it efficiently plans an optimal route to its destination.

TI CSG: Classifier-Aware Defense Strategy Based on Compressive Sensing and

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Adversarial defense; autonomous vehicle; visual classification;
   compressive sensing; generative neural networks
AB Visual classification algorithms based-on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been widely adopted in autonomous vehicle design. However, DNN suffers from adversarial attacks including pixel attacks and patch attacks, and its adoption may introduce new vulnerability into such security-critical scenarios. Existing defense techniques only focus on defending against one category, either pixel attacks or patch attacks, but does not translate to the other. Hence, the design of a practical comprehensive real-time defense algorithm for DNN-based classifiers presents a challenging task in this adversarial context. This paper attempts to address the abovementioned problem by combining Compressive Sensing with Generative neural networks (CSG) to construct an efficient defense framework, in conjunction with the proposal of a classifier-aware adversarial training way. Extensive experiments have been conducted using the LISA road sign dataset to evaluate the performance of CSG. The results show its superiority in comprehensively defending adversarial examples generated using attacks including CW-L2, FGSM and Sticker, compared with other state-of-the-art defense techniques.

AB This paper proposes and simulates an integrated autonomous vehicle (AV) and public transportation (PT) system. After discussing the attributes of and the interaction among the prospective stakeholders in the system, we identify opportunities for synergy between AVs and the PT system based on Singapore's organizational structure and demand characteristics. Envisioning an integrated system in the context of the first-mile problem during morning peak hours, we propose to preserve high demand bus routes while repurposing low-demand bus routes and using shared AVs as an alternative. An agent-based supply-side simulation is built to assess the performance of the proposed service in fifty-two scenarios with different fleet sizes and ridesharing preferences. Under a set of assumptions on AV operation costs and dispatching algorithms, the results show that the integrated system has the potential of enhancing service quality, occupying fewer road resources, being financially sustainable, and utilizing bus services more efficiently.

AB In this paper, we investigate the trajectory tracking problem for a fully actuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that moves in the horizontal plane. External disturbances, control input nonlinearities and model uncertainties are considered in our control design. Based on the dynamics model derived in the discrete-time domain, two neural networks (NNs), including a critic and an action NN, are integrated into our adaptive control design. The critic NN is introduced to evaluate the long-time performance of the designed control in the current time step, and the action NN is used to compensate for the unknown dynamics. To eliminate the AUV's control input nonlinearities, a compensation item is also designed in the adaptive control. Rigorous theoretical analysis is performed to prove the stability and performance of the proposed control law. Moreover, the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed control method are tested and validated through extensive numerical simulation results.

AB This paper presents a systematic approach for developing a concise self-adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (SANFIS) with a fast hybrid parameter learning algorithm for on-line learning of the control knowledge for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) control. The multi-layered network structure of SANFIS incorporates fuzzy basis functions for better function approximations. We investigate three SANFIS structures with three different types of fuzzy IF-THEN rule-based models and cast the rule formation problem as a clustering problem. A recursive least-squares algorithm and a modified Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with limited memory are exploited to accelerate the parameter learning process. This hybrid parameter learning algorithm together with an on-line clustering technique and rule examination provide SANFIS with the capability of self-organizing and self-adapting its internal structure (i.e. the fuzzy rules and term sets) for learning the required control knowledge for an AUV to follow desired trajectories. Computer simulations for modeling a control system for an AUV have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed SANFIS.

AB An incremental-learning-by-navigation approach to vision-based autonomous land vehicle (ALV) guidance in indoor environments is proposed. The approach consists of three stages: initial learning, navigation, and model updating. In the initial learning stage, the ALV is driven manually, and environment images and other status data are recorded automatically, Then, an off-line procedure is performed to build an initial environment model. In the navigation stage, the ALV moves along the learned environment automatically, locates itself by model matching, and records necessary information for model updating. In the model updating stage, an off-line procedure is performed to refine the learned model. A more precise model is obtained after each navigation-and-update iteration. Used environment features are vertical straight lines in camera views. A multiweighted generalized Hough transform is proposed for model matching. A real ALV was used as the testbed, and successful navigation experiments show the feasibility of the proposed approach.

AB With the increase of population and the fast growth of private vehicle ownership in urban areas, many roads have become more congested than ever before. The road traffic information plays a crucial role in traffic management. The currently available traffic information collection systems mainly rely on static road-side units, which passively record the traffic information. This article considers an alternative option, i.e., the usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for aerial surveillance, which is more efficient than the conventional ground-based strategies. We focus on deploying a UAV network to monitor the traffic on a road. We propose a decentralized navigation scheme that enables the UAV network to detect blockage and then gather to the blocked area to have better views of the ground vehicles. This scheme only requires the UAVs to share some light measurement information and positions, and it can be implemented in real time.

AB Security threats to smart and autonomous vehicles cause potential consequences such as traffic accidents, economically damaging traffic jams, hijacking, motivating to wrong routes, and financial losses for businesses and governments. Smart and autonomous vehicles are connected wirelessly, which are more attracted for attackers due to the open nature of wireless communication. One of the problems is the rogue attack, in which the attacker pretends to be a legitimate user or access point by utilizing fake identity. To figure out the problem of a rogue attack, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm to identify rogue nodes by exploiting the channel state information of the communication link. We consider the communication link between vehicle-to-vehicle, and vehicle-to-infrastructure. We evaluate the performance of our proposed technique by measuring the rogue attack probability, false alarm rate (FAR), mis-detection rate (MDR), and utility function of a receiver based on the test threshold values of reinforcement learning algorithm. The results show that the FAR and MDR are decreased significantly by selecting an appropriate threshold value in order to improve the receiver's utility.

ID STRATEGIES
AB With the emergence of vehicle-communication technologies, many researchers have strongly focused their interest in vehicle energy-efficiency control using this connectivity. For instance, the exploitation of preview traffic enables the vehicle to plan its speed and position trajectories given a prediction horizon so that energy consumption is minimized. To handle the strong uncertainties in the traffic model in the future, a constrained controller is generally employed in the existing researches. However, its expensive computational feature largely prevents its commercialization. This paper addresses computational burden of the constrained controller by proposing a computationally tractable model prediction control (MPC) for real-time implementation in autonomous electric vehicles. We present several remedies to achieve a computationally manageable constrained control, and analyze its real-time computation feasibility and effectiveness in various driving conditions. In particular, both warmstarting and move-blocking methods could relax the computations significantly. Through the validations, we confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach while maintaining good performance compared to other alternative schemes.

AB Navigating safely in urban environments remains a challenging problem for autonomous vehicles. Occlusion and limited sensor range can pose significant challenges to safely navigate among pedestrians and other vehicles in the environment. Enabling vehicles to quantify the risk posed by unseen regions allows them to anticipate future possibilities, resulting in increased safety and ride comfort. This letter proposes an algorithm that takes advantage of the known road layouts to forecast, quantify, and aggregate risk associated with occlusions and limited sensor range. This allows us to make predictions of risk induced by unobserved vehicles even in heavily occluded urban environments. The risk can then be used either by a low-level planning algorithm to generate better trajectories, or by a high-level one to plan a better route. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on intersection layouts from real-world map data with up to five other vehicles in the scene, and verified to reduce collision rates by 4.8x comparing to a baseline method while improving driving comfort.

AB In this article, we aim to investigate the path following control problem for four-wheel-independent-drive electric vehicles with consideration of modeling errors and complex driving scenarios. In order to guarantee operational safety and robustness, a supertwisting second-order sliding mode (SOSM) control strategy is employed to suppress the heavy chattering issue existing in the traditional sliding mode control (SMC). To degrade the lumped disturbance, a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDOB) technique is proposed to estimate the disturbance and compensate the modeling error. Then, a composite control strategy, which combines the SMC algorithm and NDOB technique is proposed based on stability analysis of the corresponding closed-loop system. Finally, hardware-in-the-loop experimental results show that the supertwisting SOSM control algorithm with the NDOB technique can achieve better tracking performance and suppress the chattering phenomenon.

AB Accurately self-localizing a vehicle is of high importance as it allows to robustify nearly all modern driver assistance functionality, e.g., lane keeping and coordinated autonomous driving maneuvers. We examine vehicle self-localization relying only on video sensors, in particular, a system of four fisheye cameras providing a view surrounding the car, a setup currently growing popular in upper-class cars. The presented work aims at an autonomous parking scenario. The method is based on park markings as orientation marks since they can be found in nearly every parking deck and require only little additional preparation. Our contribution is twofold: (1) we present a new real-time capable image processing pipeline for topview systems extracting park markings and show how to obtain a reliable and accurate ego pose and ego motion estimation given a coarse pose as starting point. (2) The aptitude of this often neglected sensor array for vehicle self-localization is demonstrated. Experimental evaluation yields a precision of 0.15 +/- 0.18 m and 2.01 degrees +/- 1.91 degrees.

AB In this paper a novel algorithm with a dynamic fuzzy controller applied to the control of trajectory of vehicles with two independent wheels is proposed. An automatic control of trajectory of a vehicle can behave in a not efficient way. It is necessary to consider the friction of the actuators and possible perturbations coming from the outside environment, as for instance the variable characteristics of the ground where the vehicle moves. These perturbations, which depend also on the contact between the wheel and the ground, involve violations of nonholonomic constraints. Thus it is necessary to compensate for these perturbations to obtain a robust control system. The controller synthetized in this work is able to obtain a term of additive adaptation to the dynamic control law by means of a fuzzy inference mechanism. Asymptotic stability of equilibrium state of fuzzy control system is developed by the Direct Lyapunov method and Barbalat's lemma. A series of simulations in Matlab 6.5 confirms the validity of the algorithm. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SYSTEM
AB We introduce a new distributed planning paradigm, which permits optimal execution and dynamic replanning of complex multi-goal missions. In particular, the approach permits dynamic allocation of goals to vehicles based on the current environment model while maintaining information-optimal route planning for each individual vehicle to individual goals. Complex missions can be specified by using a grammar in which ordering of goals, priorities, and multiple alternatives can be described. We show that the system is able to plan local paths in obstacle fields based on sensor data, to plan and update global paths to goals based on frequent obstacle map updates, and to modify mission execution, e.g., the assignment and ordering of the goals, based on the updated paths to the goals.
   The multi-vehicle planning system is based on the GRAMMPS planner; the on-board dynamic route planner is based on the D* planner. Experiments were conducted with stereo and high-speed ladar as the to sensors used for obstacle detection. This paper focuses on the multi-vehicle planner and the systems architecture. A companion paper (Brumitt et al., 2001) analyzes experiments with the multi-vehicle system and describes in details the other components of the system.

AB Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been employed in many applications of robotics and has steadily been gaining traction in the field of Autonomous Driving (AD). This paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning based approach for lateral Vehicle Motion Control (VMC), and explores the generalization capabilities of the approach. The proposed methodology uses a sequence of waypoints generated from a planning module of an AD stack as the input. The network has been trained to predict accurate steering commands to follow the given trajectory. In this paper we detail our implementation and share our learning experience on real-vehicle deployment of the RL based controller. Our experiments yield promising results with an agent trained on less than 4 h of simulated driving experience without any real-world data. The trained agent is able to successfully complete unseen and more complex tracks using different unseen vehicle models. The agent safely reached up to 150 km/h in simulation and up to 60 km/h in a real-life Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) weighing more than 2000 kg.

AB The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) communication platform provides seamless information exchange facilities in a dynamic mobile city environment. Heterogeneous communication is a common medium for information exchange through autonomous resources distributed and accessed using infrastructure units. Cyber-security is a primary concern in accessing autonomous information from the distributed resources due to anonymity and different types of targeted adversaries. This article proposes token-based authorization and authentication (TAA) for securing IoV communications. The proposed method relies on blockchain technology and random forest learning for authorization and key management for authentication, respectively. In this process, frequent change in tokens and key update features are restricted in a view to maximize the seamlessness in information exchange. Authentication is preceded by knowledge of the data classification without errors to prevent additional overhead. Blockchain-based authorization helps to update specific fields of the tokens to retain the communication ratio by reducing vehicle-to-vehicle losses. The performance of the proposed method is assessed using appropriate simulations for these metrics by varying vehicle density, error rate, and classification sets.

AB Model-based analysis and synthesis applied to the dynamics, guidance, and control of an autonomous undersea vehicle are presented. As the dynamic model for describing vehicle motion mathematically, the equations of motion are derived. The stability derivatives in the equations of motion are determined by a simulation-based technique using computational fluid dynamics analysis. The dynamic model is applied to the design of the low-level control systems, offering model-based synthetic approach in dynamics and control applications. As an intelligent navigational strategy for undersea vehicles, we present the optimal guidance in environmental disturbances. The optimal guidance aims at the minimum-time transit of a vehicle in an environmental flow disturbance. In this paper, a newly developed algorithm for obtaining the numerical solution of the optimal guidance law is presented. The algorithm is a globally working procedure deriving the optimal guidance in any deterministic environmental disturbance. As a fail-safe tactic in achieving the optimal navigation in environments of moderate uncertainty, we propose the quasi-optimal guidance. Performances of the optimal and the quasi-optimal guidances are demonstrated by the simulated navigations in a few environmental disturbances.

AB This paper presents the optimization of a novel docking design for docking and charging of autonomous underwater vehicles. The docking design has been optimized to maximize the capture envelope and minimize the maximum contact force. Two design parameters, sweep angle and ramp angle, were optimized as was the velocity during terminal homing and capture. The optimization was an exhaustive optimization with 5600 unique simulations completed that included the vehicle hydrodynamics, impact dynamics, and controller. Unique to the presented docking design is the ability to support a wide variety of vehicles from different size classes through its simplified funnel design and use of a docking adapter as validated in simulation with a Dolphin II AUV and Bluefin SandShark. The only part of the docking system that contacts the vehicle is a standardized docking adapter that is meant as a drop-in replacement for an antenna mast. The presented docking system is low-cost, compact, and can be deployed in a wide variety of situations including mobile docking.

AB With proactive safety assessment gaining significant attention in the literature, the rela-tionship between traffic conflicts (which form the underpinnings of proactive safety mea-sures) and observed crashes remains a critical research need. Such a need will grow significantly with the ongoing introduction of connected and autonomous vehicles where software and hardware improvements are likely to be determined from observed traffic conflict data as opposed to data from accumulated crashes. Extreme value theory has been applied for over two decades to study the relationship between traffic conflicts and crashes. While several advancements have been made in extreme value theory models over time, the need to continually evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of these models remains, particularly considering their likely use in improving the safety-critical elements of con-nected and autonomous vehicles. This paper seeks to comprehensively review studies on extreme value theory applications in traffic conflict/crash contexts by providing an in-depth assessment of alternate modelling methodologies and associated issues. Critical research needs relating to the further development of extreme value theory models are identified and include identifying efficient techniques for sampling extremes, determining optimal sample size, assessing and selecting appropriate traffic conflict measures, incorpo-rating covariates, accounting for unobserved heterogeneity, and addressing issues associ-ated with real-time estimations.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

DE COLREGS; unmanned surface vehicle (USV); velocity obstacles (VOs)
ID MARINE VEHICLES; AVOIDANCE; BEHAVIORS
AB This paper presents an autonomous motion planning algorithm for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to navigate safely in dynamic, cluttered environments. The algorithm not only addresses hazard avoidance (HA) for stationary and moving hazards, but also applies the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (known as COLREGS, for COLlision REGulationS). The COLREGS rules specify, for example, which vessel is responsible for giving way to the other and to which side of the "stand-on" vessel to maneuver. Three primary COLREGS rules are considered in this paper: crossing, overtaking, and head-on situations. For autonomous USVs to be safely deployed in environments with other traffic boats, it is imperative that the USV's navigation algorithm obeys COLREGS. Furthermore, when other boats disregard their responsibility under COLREGS, the USV must fall back to its HA algorithms to prevent a collision. The proposed approach is based on velocity obstacles (VO) method, which generates a cone-shaped obstacle in the velocity space. Because VOs also specify on which side of the obstacle the vehicle will pass during the avoidance maneuver, COLREGS are encoded in the velocity space in a natural way. Results from several experiments involving up to four vessels are presented, in what we believe is the first on-water demonstration of autonomous COLREGS maneuvers without explicit intervehicle communication. We also show an application of this motion planner to a target trailing task, where a strategic planner commands USV waypoints based on high-level objectives, and the local motion planner ensures hazard avoidance and compliance with COLREGS during a traverse.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become popular in a wide range of applications, including many military and civilian uses. State-of-the-art control strategies for these vehicles are typically tailored to a specific platform and are often limited to a portion of the vehicle's flight envelope. This article presents a single physics-based controller capable of aggressive maneuvering for the majority of UAVs. The controller is applicable to UAVs with the ability to apply a force along a body-fixed direction, and a moment about an arbitrary axis, which includes UAVs such as multi-copters, conventional fixed-wing, agile fixed-wing, most flying-wings, most tailsitters, some tilt-rotor/wing platforms, and some flapping-wing vehicles. We describe the implementation of this controller on numerous platforms, and demonstrate autonomous flight in outdoor flight tests for a quadrotor and an agile fixed-wing aircraft. To specifically demonstrate the extreme maneuvering capability of the control logic, we perform a rolling flip with the quadrotor and a rolling Harrier and an aggressive turnaround with the fixed-wing aircraft, all using a single controller.

AB Scientists have been using pump systems to sample biological, chemical, and geological matter for years, but many of these systems are intended for fixed mooring use or remotely operated vehicle (ROV) deployment and do not meet the often strict size and weight requirements of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Because the current technology of AUVs does not allow for the traditional methods of sampling used on ROVs and human occupied vehicles (HOVs), we look to an integrated pump and sampling system to gather a genomic overview of an area. An AUV biological pump sampler would allow scientists to explore unknown territories with little to no a priori knowledge, allowing scientists a new degree of freedom and opening the possibility of adaptive sampling capabilities as part of a suite of in situ vehicle sensors. We design and test a compact pump mechanism for collecting biological samples on a spooling filter system. We have collected and confirmed sea-water samples using our demonstration prototype, demonstrating viable potential for biological AUV sampling capabilities in uncharacterized environments.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE; SYSTEMS; RELIANCE
AB Overtrust and undertrust are major issues with partially automated vehicles. Ideally, trust should be calibrated ensuring that drivers' subjective feelings of safety match the objective reliability of the vehicle. In the present study, we examined if drivers' trust toward Level 2 cars changed after on-road experience. Drivers' self-reported trust was assessed three times: before having experience with these vehicles, immediately after driving two types of vehicles, and two weeks after the driving experience. Analysis of the results showed major changes in trust scores after the on-road driving experience. Before experiencing the vehicles, participants tended to overestimate the vehicle capabilities. Afterwards they had a better understanding of vehicles' limitations, resulting in better calibrated trust.

AB Intelligent vehicle needs the turn light information of front vehicles to make decisions in autonomous navigation. A recognition algorithm was designed to get information of turn light. Approximated center segmentation method was designed to divide the front vehicle image into two parts by using geometry information. The number of remained pixels of vehicle image which was filtered by the morphologic features was got by adaptive threshold method, and it was applied to recognizing the lights flashing. The experimental results show that the algorithm can not only distinguish the two turn lights of vehicle but also recognize the information of them. The algorithm is quiet effective, robust and satisfactory in real-time performance.

AB High-speed cornering can typically be performed only by an expert driver. Advanced control system design for (semi-) autonomous vehicles requires an understanding of such aggressive driving maneuvers in order to be able to take advantage of the full handling capacity of the vehicle, resulting in enhanced stability and improved safety vehicle characteristics. In this article, we first learn a primitive high-speed cornering maneuver using a series of demonstrations obtained by solving the minimum-time cornering problem subject to different initial conditions. This primitive trajectory indicates that a typical high-speed cornering maneuver can be approximated by three segments, namely, entry corner guiding, steady-state sliding, and exiting. Based on this observation, we divide a high-speed cornering maneuver into three stages. A switch-mode control strategy is designed for these three stages, using a combination of linear and nonlinear control techniques. Conditions for fast trajectory replanning, optimal speed profile generation, and tracking control are analyzed. Simulation and experimental results validate the proposed approach on a fifth-scale robotic vehicle.

AB Integrating autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with fifth-generation (5G) networks presents a significant challenge due to network interference. UAVs' high altitude and propagation conditions increase vulnerability to interference from neighbouring 5G base stations (gNBs) in the downlink direction. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm, powered by AI, to address interference through power control. By formulating and solving a signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) optimization problem using the deep Q-learning (DQL) algorithm, interference is effectively mitigated, and link performance is improved. Performance comparison with existing interference mitigation schemes, such as fixed power allocation (FPA), tabular Q-learning, particle swarm optimization, and game theory demonstrates the superiority of the DQL algorithm, where it outperforms the next best method by 41.66% and converges to an optimal solution faster. It is also observed that, at higher speeds, the UAV sees only a 10.52% decrease in performance, which means the algorithm is able to perform effectively at high speeds. The proposed solution effectively integrates UAVs with 5G networks, mitigates interference, and enhances link performance, offering a significant advancement in this field.

AB In the field of autonomous driving, obstacle avoidance is of great significance for safe driving. At present, in addition to traditional obstacle avoidance algorithms including VFH algorithm, artificial potential field method, a large number of related researches are focused on algorithms based on vision and neural networks. Researches on these algorithms have achieved some results, and some of which have completed real road tests. However, most of algorithms consider only local environmental information which may cause local optimum in complex driving environments. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the environmental information beyond the sensor's perceptual ability for autonomous driving in complex environment. In the network-assisted automated driving system, networked vehicles can obtain road obstacles' and condition information through roadside sensors and mobile network, so as to gain extra sensing ability. Therefore, network-assisted automated driving is of great significance in obstacle avoidance. Under this background, this paper presents an automatic driving obstacle avoidance strategy combining path planning and reinforcement learning. At first, a global optimal path is planned through global information, then merge the global optimal path and vehicle information into a vector. Use this vector as input of reinforcement learning neural network and output vehicle control signals to follow optimal path while avoiding obstacles.

AB An effective intelligent transportation system is a core part of modern smart city. The Internet of Things and vehicular communication technologies facilitate rapid development of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). While most studies focus on standalone CAV technologies, collective CAV control has much potential. With the connectivity and automation of CAVs, we can employ dynamic lane reversal (DLR) to optimize the travel schedules of CAVs for performance enhancement. In this paper, we propose the dynamic lane reversal-traffic scheduling management (DLR-TSM) scheme for CAVs. The system collects the travel requests from CAVs and determines their optimal schedules and routes over dynamically reversible lanes. We formulate the routing and scheduling problem on DLR as an integer linear program. To address the scaling effect, an algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers is designed to solve the problem in a distributed manner. We extensively evaluate the DLR-TSM and the distributed algorithm with real-world transportation data. The simulation results show that the DLR-TSM can significantly improve the travel times of CAVs and the distributed algorithm can dramatically reduce the required computational time.

AB This paper investigates the trajectory tracking control problem for autonomous underwater vehicles whose initial starting position differs substantially from that specified by the desired trajectory. This scenario is very likely to cause serious chattering in the control output, especially in the early stages, when the large tracking error is the input to the controller. A novel trajectory tracking control strategy is developed based on fuzzy re-planning of a local desired trajectory. At each time instant, a local desired trajectory is reconstructed based on the AUV's current position and that specified by the original desired trajectory at a future time. Also the control effort is computed based on the local desired trajectory, rather than the original one. Moreover, the interval between each time instant is determined by a new single-input fuzzy model, where the input is determined by the distance between AUV's current and desired trajectories and the change in the distance. Finally, the effectiveness of the new control strategy is verified by simulation-based case studies using an actual vehicle model as a necessary step prior to experimental validation.

AB The relationship between inherent optical properties (IOPs), phytoplankton community structure and the abundance of suspended particles in the size range 3-500 mum was studied near the Isles of Scilly (UK) in May 2000. Autositb, an autonomous submersible vehicle specifically designed for science missions, was used as an instrument-positioning platform. It carried a CTD system, an ac-9+ dual tube spectrophotometer, a prototype submersible flow cytometer and an Aqua-monitor water sampler. The vehicle made a 10-km transect at constant depth across a boundary between water masses with contrasting remote sensing reflectance, which was located using SeaWiFs ocean colour imagery. This boundary corresponded to a sharp (1 km) transition between one phytoplankton community consisting of coccolithophores, flagellates and dinoflagellates, and a second community dominated by diatoms and flagellates. Inherent optical properties measured along the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) track showed marked changes in magnitudes, ratios, spectral shapes and fine-scale spatial variability. These changes were well correlated with variations in the composition of the suspended particle assemblage measured by microscopy and in situ flow cytometry.

AB Modern vehicles are equipped with a myriad of sensors. Proprioceptive sensors monitor the vehicle status and operation, whereas exteroceptive ones sense the external environment, i.e., outside the vehicle's mechanics domain. A myriad of vehicular applications, from monitoring to autonomous driving, rely on the information provided by sensors. In this article, we focus those which depend on exteroceptive sensors, which are critical for modern Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles, regardless of their automation level. Initially, we provide an overview of vehicular sensors and Off-the-Shelf (OTS) devices. Then, we focus on exteroceptive sensors, identifying different technologies, usages, pros and cons, as well as their availability in existing OTS devices. Next, we review the services and applications using exteroceptive sensors, especially regarding safety, navigation, and driving profiling. Besides referencing the most relevant literature on exteroceptive sensors, we also identify the datasets available in the literature. We conclude with open challenges using exteroceptive sensors from both industry and research perspectives.

AB In order to solve the stability problem caused by the communication time lag between the upper-level trajectory tracking controller and the lower-level motor controller in the dual-motor autonomous steering system, this paper proposes an LMI-based trajectory tracking control method to improve the stability and tracking accuracy of the vehicle. First, time-varying network time lag modeling is carried out based on the working mechanism of on-board CAN communication. Upon the vehicle lateral dynamics state space model, a vehicle lateral dynamics model containing the uncertainty term of the network time lag is established. Next, a feedback controller is designed based on LMI, and a feedforward control quantity is introduced into the controller to eliminate the lateral position steady-state error. Finally, it is proved by simulation and HiL test that the LMI trajectory controller considering CAN network time lag has good tracking accuracy and vehicle stability, and the controller has strong robustness to vehicle speed. Meanwhile, the lower-level motor controllers under the control of the robust controller also present good stability.

ID OPTIMAL PREVIEW CONTROL; COLLISION-AVOIDANCE; STATE; FILTER
AB Curved path tracking control is one of the most important functions of autonomous vehicles. First, small turning radius circular bends considering bend quadrant and travel direction restrictions are planned by polar coordinate equations. Second, an estimator of a vehicle state parameter and road adhesion coefficient based on an extended Kalman filter is designed. To improve the convenience and accuracy of the estimator, the combined slip theory, trigonometric function group fitting, and cubic spline interpolation are used to estimate the longitudinal and lateral forces of the tire model (215/55 R17). Third, to minimize the lateral displacement and yaw angle tracking errors of a four-wheel steering (4WS) vehicle, the front-wheel steering angle of the 4WS vehicle is corrected by a model predictive control (MPC) feed-back controller. Finally, CarSim (R) simulation results show that the 4WS autonomous vehicle based on the MPC feed-back controller can not only significantly improve the curved path tracking performance but also effectively reduce the probability of drifting or rushing out of the runway at high speeds and on low-adhesion roads.

AB In this paper, a design course organization is presented, which is the result of 15 years of experience with a two-semester senior design course sequence in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Detroit Mercy. An organization has been determined, which for the authors, balances team experience, individual assessment, design complexity, realism, writing content, and faculty workload. The current course structure is based on the integration of a capstone program with the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition (IGVC) sponsored by the Association For Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) [1], The competition rules require that the students design and build an autonomous land vehicle which can navigate while sensing lane lines, avoiding obstacles, and traveling over ramps and sand traps. There are two main competition events: the vehicle performance competition where the autonomous robotic vehicles compete to finish the course in the shortest time or by traveling the farthest in the allotted time, and the vehicle design competition that evaluates the documentation, design process, and presentation of each team. The authors have found that this type of competition matches both the spirit and the practical needs of their capstone design course.

AB Platooning of connected and autonomous vehicles has been extensively researched for its potential benefits in energy consumption, safety, comfort, traffic flow, and capacity. However, little attention has been given to the general platoon sorting problem of how to regulate the platoon to a desired formation and order. The problem poses a challenge as it involves multiple vehicles changing lanes in various directions, which makes them vulnerable to conflicts. This paper proposes a centralized trajectory planning method to address this problem. We construct a time-space-velocity network and formulate the problem as a multi-commodity flow model. To handle the large-scale network, we decompose the proposed model into several time-dependent least-cost path sub-problems using Lagrangian relaxation- and ADMM-based decomposition algorithms. Our method was tested through a series of experiments, which demonstrated its superiority in facilitating a faster and safer platoon sorting process compared to the existing method and achieving significant travel time savings at high traffic volumes compared to the simulations with SUMO.

AB Driver's hands on/off detection is very important in current autonomous vehicles for safety. Several studies have been conducted to create a precise algorithm. Although many studies have proposed various approaches, they have some limitations, such as robustness and reliability. Therefore, we propose a deep learning model that utilizes in-vehicle data. We also established a data collection system, which collects in-vehicle data that are auto-labeled for efficient and reliable data acquisition. For a robust system, we devised a confidence logic that prevents outliers' sway. To evaluate our model in more detail, we suggested a new metric to explain the events, considering state transitions. In addition, we conducted an extensive experiment on the new drivers to demonstrate our model's generalization ability. We verified that the proposed system achieved a better performance than in previous studies, by resolving their drawbacks. Our model detected hands on/off transitions in 0.37 s on average, with an accuracy of 95.7%.

AB This article presents a novel integrated path-following, crash avoidance, and crash mitigation control algorithm for autonomous vehicles. To improve stability and tracking accuracy of the algorithm in extreme conditions, combined-slip tire forces are considered in the system model. A predictive control framework that monitors slip conditions at each tire is then developed to achieve good dynamics performance by controlling active front steer and brake modulation at each corner. A novel switching mechanism that does not rely on a separate path generation module is designed for avoidance and mitigation phases, which is verified in various harsh driving conditions. Another strong point is the objective function for the crash mitigation phase that is developed based on real-world crash statistics. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm can not only track the desired path in normal driving phase, but also avoid crash and reduce crash severity with ensured vehicle stability.

AB In this letter, we present a distributed pressure sensory system, inspired by the lateral line found in fish, for estimating hydrodynamic forces acting on an autonomous underwater vehicle. By canceling these forces using the vehicle control system, the dynamics of the vehicle can be decoupled from the state of the surrounding fluid. We discuss a control scheme which combines the measured hydrodynamic forces with a feedback controller that is robust to disturbances and measurement errors, achieving asymptotic tracking in the presence of bounded disturbances and errors. We compare this robust lateral line controller to a baseline robust controller not using the lateral line system and to a controller using the lateral line with simple PD feedback. We simulate a spatially and time varying velocity flow field on the scale of the vehicle and show that the robust lateral line controller has improved performance compared to both the baseline robust controller and the PD controller using the lateral line system.

AB This paper addresses the problem of estimating a likelihood map for the location of the source of a chemical plume using an autonomous vehicle as a sensor probe in a fluid flow. The fluid flow is assumed to have a high Reynolds number. Therefore, the dispersion of the chemical is dominated by turbulence, resulting in an intermittent chemical signal. The vehicle is capable of detecting above-threshold chemical concentration and sensing the fluid flow velocity at the vehicle location. This paper reviews instances of biological plume tracing and reviews previous strategies for a vehicle-based plume tracing. The main contribution is a new source-likelihood mapping approach based on Bayesian inference methods. Using this Bayesian methodology, the source-likelihood map is propagated through time and updated in response to both detection and nondetection events. Examples are included that use data from in-water testing to compare the mapping approach derived herein with the map derived using a previously existing technique.

AB Traffic modeling is vitally important to the simulation test of autonomous driving, as on-road testing is not only tedious, inefficient, costly, and often unsafe. The fidelity of the traffic model is thus the key to achieving effective and efficient simulation test results. However, high-fidelity traffic modeling remains a challenge due to the complexity of vehicle movement and the dynamic spatiotemporal interactions among vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel system-based traffic modeling approach that considers traffic as a whole, or a collection of all vehicles' movement and their interactions involved simultaneously. In addition, a long short-term memory (LSTM) encoding-decoding framework with a multi-head self-attention mechanism is proposed to capture the temporal dependency of vehicle motion and represent the vehicle-vehicle interaction. Furthermore, some traffic data are collected and used for model training purposes. A metric representing one of the traffic attributes, as the criterion for data screening, is proposed to describe the traffic complexity and disorder, or chaos. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model has achieved better performance compared with others from the literature.

AB One of the largest uncertainties in modelling the impacts of autonomous vehicles in future is whether they will be owned or used as automated ride (hailing) services. This paper addresses this issue by modelling the inherent attractiveness or convenience value of ownership of an automated vehicle, beyond the regular convenience parameters such as journey time, waiting or access time and reliability. Using mixed logit model on a choice experimentation data, we find that ownership is inherently valued more compared to the ride services by women. However, we also report significant heterogeneity in this valuation depending on gender and other car-ownership related characteristics, which can diminish this inherent attractiveness to the point that a majority of men may find ownership no more attractive than exclusive use ride services. We also find substantial inconvenience value associated with shared/pooled automated ride services compared to exclusive-use ride services. Implications of the results are illustrated using an example of the share of automated vehicle ownership, and exclusive-use and pooled use ride services.

TI Motion Planning and Tracking Control of Autonomous Vehicle Based on
   Improved <i>A</i>* Algorithm
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The traditional A* algorithm, applied to the motion planning of autonomous vehicles, easily causes high computational costs and excessive turning points generated in the planning path. In addition, the vehicle cannot track the path due to the unsmooth inflection point. To overcome these potential limitations, an improved A* algorithm-based motion planning algorithm and a tracking control strategy based on model predictive control theory were proposed in this work. The method of expanding the search neighborhood is adopted to improve the planning efficiency of A* algorithm. The artificial potential field method is also incorporated into the proposed A* algorithm. The resultant force generated by each potential field is further introduced into the evaluation function of A* algorithm to plan the driving path, which could be suitable for autonomous vehicles. The sharp nodes in the path are smoothed by cubic quasi-uniform B-spline curve. The tracking control strategy is designed based on model predictive control theory to realize the accurate tracking of the planned path. Typical obstacle avoidance conditions were selected for co-simulation test verification. The experimental results show that the proposed motion planning algorithm and tracking control strategy can effectively plan the obstacle avoidance path and accurately track the path in different environments.

AB Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) have potential benefits for the society and environment. This study con-structs a novel framework to investigate the combined effects of the external environment and personal attributes on SAVs adoption. Using questionnaire data from 669 Chinese consumers, a range of methods, including partial least squares structural equation modeling and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, were employed to conduct the empirical study. Results show that both the external environment (i.e., policy support, social norms, and media publicity) and personal attributes (i.e., environmental concern, risk preference, and personal innovativeness) significantly affect consumers' intentions to adopt SAVs, while the former plays a greater role. Any single factor of external environment or personal attributes cannot lead to high SAVs adoption, thus four combinations covering different factors are provided to achieve a high adoption intention of SAVs. The findings can help global transportation managers make informed decisions to promote the adoption of SAVs.

AB An adaptive potential field is designed to adapt the acceleration/deceleration and mass of the obstacle. The potential fields are established in a transformed road coordinate system to improve the feasibility and robustness. A path planning method is proposed based on the designed adaptive potential field to improve the driving safety and the ride comfort of autonomous vehicles in complex driving scenarios, which including the cut-in, emergency braking, obstacle sudden accelerating during overtaking and the curve road driving scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by simulationswith constructed and real data, respectively. The TTC (Time-to-Collision) and the maximum lateral accelerations are used to evaluate the improvements on safety and ride comfort. The results show that both the driving safety and ride comfort are efficiently improved by using the proposed approach in emergency braking and accelerating scenarios. Meanwhile, the proposed method can be well applied in a curve road driving environment.

ID SURFACE; ALGORITHM
AB When an autonomous vehicle is traveling through some scenario it receives a continuous stream of sensor data. This sensor data arrives in an asynchronous fashion and often contains overlapping or redundant information. Thus, it is not trivial how a representation of the environment observed by the vehicle can be created and updated over time. This paper presents a novel methodology to compute an incremental 3D representation of a scenario from 3D range measurements. We propose to use macro scale polygonal primitives to model the scenario. This means that the representation of the scene is given as a list of large scale polygons that describe the geometric structure of the environment. Furthermore, we propose mechanisms designed to update the geometric polygonal primitives over time whenever fresh sensor data is collected. Results show that the approach is capable of producing accurate descriptions of the scene, and that it is computationally very efficient when compared to other reconstruction techniques.

AB Accurate localization for autonomous vehicle operations is essential in dense urban areas. In order to ensure safety, positioning algorithms should implement fault detection and fallback strategies. While many strategies stop the vehicle once a failure is detected, in this work a new framework is proposed that includes an improved reconfiguration module to evaluate the failure scenario and offer alternative positioning strategies, allowing continued driving in degraded mode until a critical failure is detected. Furthermore, as many failures in sensors can be temporary, such as GPS signal interruption, the proposed approach allows the return to a non-fault state while resetting the alternative algorithms used in the temporary failure scenario. The proposed localization framework is validated in a series of experiments carried out in a simulation environment. Results demonstrate proper localization for the driving task even in the presence of sensor failure, only stopping the vehicle when a fully degraded state is achieved. Moreover, reconfiguration strategies have proven to consistently reset the accumulated drift of the alternative positioning algorithms, improving the overall performance and bounding the mean error.

AB Autonomous vehicle platoon is a promising paradigm towards traffic congestion problems in the intelligent transportation system. However, under certain circumstances, the advantage of the platoon cannot be fully developed. In this paper, we focus on the highway Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) charging problem. We try to let the opportunistic platoon pass the ETC as a whole. There are three main issues in this scenario. Firstly, the opportunistic platoon is temporarily composed; vehicles do not trust each other. Secondly, single vehicle may try to escape from the ETC charging by following the platoon. Finally, platoon members may collude with each other and try to underreport the number of vehicles in the platoon so as to evade payment. To solve these challenges, we propose a blockchain-based efficient highway toll paradigm for the opportunistic platoon. The driving history, credential information of every registered vehicle, is recorded and verified from the blockchain. A roadside unit (RSU) is adopted to distinguish the single vehicle from the platoon and in charge of lane allocation. Additionally, an aggregate signature is introduced to accelerate the authentication procedure in the RSU. We analyse the potential security threats in this scenario. The experimental result indicates that our scheme is efficient and practical.

TI Accident Liability Determination of Autonomous Driving Systems Based on

DT Article
AB With the rise of self-driving technology research, the establishment of a scientific and perfect legal restraint and supervision system for self-driving vehicles has been gradually paid attention to. The determination of tort liability subject of traffic accidents of self-driving cars is different from that of ordinary motor vehicle traffic accident tort, which challenges the application of traditional fault liability and product liability. The tort issue of self-driving cars should be discussed by distinguishing two kinds of situations: assisted driving cars and highly automated driving, and typological analysis of each situation is needed. When the car is in the assisted driving mode, the accident occurs due to the quality defect or product damage of the self-driving car, and there is no other fault cause; then, the producer and seller of the car should bear the product liability according to the no-fault principle; if the driver has a subjective fault and fails to exercise a high degree of care; the owner and user of the car should bear the fault liability. This paper analyzes the study of the impact of autonomous driving public on public psychological health, summarizes the key factors affecting the public acceptance of autonomous driving, and dissects its impact on public psychological acceptance. In order to fully study the responsibility determination of autonomous driving system accidents and their impact on public psychological health, this paper proposes an autonomous driving risk prediction model based on artificial intelligence technology, combined with a complex intelligent traffic environment vehicle autonomous driving risk prediction method, to complete the risk target detection. The experimental results in the relevant dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

ID REACHABILITY ANALYSIS
AB This paper presents an algorithm for overapproximating the drivable area of road vehicles in the presence of time-varying obstacles. The drivable area can be used to detect whether a feasible trajectory exists and in which area one can limit the search of drivable trajectories. For this purpose, we abstract the considered road vehicle by a point mass with bounded velocity and acceleration. Our algorithm calculates the reachable occupancy at discrete time steps. At each time step, the set is represented by a union of finitely many sets, which are each the Cartesian product of two 2-D convex polytopes. We demonstrate our method with three examples: i) a traffic situation with identical dynamic constraints in the x- and y-directions; ii) a highway scenario with different lateral and longitudinal constraints of the dynamics; and iii) a highway scenario with different traffic predictions. The examples demonstrate that we can compute the drivable area quickly enough to deploy our approach in real vehicles.

AB The development of automated and coordinated driving systems (platooning) is an hot topic today for vehicles and it represents a challenging scenario that heavily relies on distributed control in the presence of wireless communication network. To actuate platooning in a safe way it is necessary to design controllers able to effectively operate on informations exchanged via Inter-Vehicular Communication (IVC) systems despite the presence of unavoidable communication impairments, such as multiple time-varying delays that affect communication links. To this aim in this paper we propose a novel distributed adaptive collaborative control strategy that exploits information coming from connected vehicles to achieve leader synchronization and we analytically demonstrate its stability with a Lyapunov-Krasovskii approach. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is shown via numerical simulations in PLEXE, a state of the art IVC and mobility simulator that includes basic building blocks for platooning.

AB This paper proposes two novel vehicle sideslip estimators, that aim at achieving ease of implementation and tuning, low computational cost and robustness, using only the most common automotive measurements, like vehicle position, acceleration and rotational velocity. The two estimators are only based on the unicycle kinematic model, thus they do not require any knowledge of uncertain or time-varying parameters, like vehicle parameters, or of road conditions, as it usually happens when dynamic models are adopted, and they have been derived by recasting an estimation problem into a linear control problem. Different experiments, ranging from standard driving manoeuvres to drifting driving and autonomous driving, have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposal even in particularly critical scenarios, like driving at the limits of vehicle's handling. A comparison with a state-of-the-art sideslip estimator, using simulation and experimental data, is presented, as well.

AB We develop and experimentally test a prescribed performance control methodology for trajectory tracking of underactuated autonomous aerial vehicles under unknown time-varying disturbances. An extended state observer is first proposed to filter position and velocity measurements, and to compensate for disturbances, including model parametric uncertainty and/or exogenous perturbations, e.g., wind. Then, by resorting to a barrier function and to constraints on the transient and steady-state response of the position error, we derive a thrust command law that follows from a desired stabilizing force. This force is inherently associated with the vehicle's attitude, which is controlled using angular velocity commands. The errors stemming from the closed-loop system are shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation results, including comparison data, are presented to validate the proposed solution. Experimental results are also included to showcase the performance of our strategy in a real-world application using a quadrotor vehicle.

AB Automated guided vehicle technology has become a hot area of scientific research due to its increasing use in manufacturing and logistics. Its main features are programming and control, remote computer eye tracking, command receiving and execution, autonomous route planning, and autonomous driving execution of tasks, with the advantages of high intelligence and flexibility. In this work, a simple vehicle model is used to study the route planning and tracking control of automatic guided vehicles. This paper uses wireless communication to find the optimal route planning problem. Using geometric methods, we develop a model of the working environment of the mobile automatic guided vehicle and develop a route finding algorithm. Based on the kinematic model, an advanced routing controller is designed to conduct experimental simulation of two trajectories and verify the effectiveness of the trajectory tracking controller. When the time is after 2 s, the position error is almost completely zero. In the path planning, when the number of iterations is greater than 10, the path length remains constant, verifying the effectiveness of the method in this paper.

AB This paper investigates a methodology for autopilot design for an unmanned air vehicle where one of the lateral control surfaces, i.e. the aileron or rudder, becomes jammed and unusable. The autopilot handles the automatic recovery, autonomous guidance and landing of the disabled unmanned aerial vehicle. An accurate nonlinear aircraft model is used to build local flight control laws using loop-shaping to decouple longitudinal and lateral channels. The design is carried out in a way to allow smooth scheduling over the local controllers without losing stability and performance, culminating in a robust emergency autopilot over the full flight envelope. The autopilot is tested on an example distress scenario involving aileron surface jam. It is confirmed through simulations that the autopilot design is capable of resuming safe flight and autonomous navigation under the fault scenario and is able to safely land the unmanned aerial vehicle to a target runway.

AB Scheduling driverless vehicles with different priorities to pass through intersections efficiently and safely has been becoming an important passing-through intersection (PTI) problem in the field of novel intelligent traffic systems (ITS), which is increasingly becoming cyber-physical-fused and social-serviceoriented. Considering new emerging features with possible priorities, a novel centralized priority scheduling mechanism is mainly explored in this paper. First, related pivotal aspects of environment and driverless vehicles are modeled by fusing their physical and kinematic characters. Based on these models, PTI-related motions are further abstracted as several reservation-oriented standard states and actions. Then, an event-triggered and state-driven autonomous control procedure is designed. By mapping vehicular relations in spatiotemporal domain into time-distance windows, a universal passing-through principle, rules, and priority-based scheduling mechanisms are proposed and described in detail. Finally, a priority scheduling algorithm sPriorFIFO is proposed and designed. These models and mechanisms are then implemented within an algorithm simulator, through which scheduling performances are verified and evaluated.

AB This paper presents a trajectory planning framework to deal with the highly dynamic environments for on-road driving. The trajectory optimization problem with parameterized curvature control was formulated to reach the goal state with the vehicle model and its dynamic constraints considered. This in contrast to existing curve fitting techniques guarantees the dynamic feasibility of the planned trajectory. With generation of multiple trajectory candidates along the Frenet frame, the vehicle is reactive to other road users or obstacles encountered. Additionally, to deal with more complex driving scenarios, its seamless interaction with an upper behavior planning layer was considered by having longitudinal motion planning responsive to the desired goal state. The trajectory evaluation and selection methodologies, along with the low-level tracking control, were also developed under this framework. The potential of the proposed trajectory planning framework was demonstrated under different dynamic driving scenarios such as lane-changing or merging with surrounding vehicles with its computation efficiency proven in real-time simulations.

ID SERVICE ATTACKS
AB One of the challenges in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) and Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) is jamming attacks. These attacks present safety concerns and may render the whole communication network ineffective. Designing an anti-jamming solution for CAVs and VANETs is non-trivial because every jamming scenario presents itself with unique characteristics. In this paper, we extend our previous work in Alam (2021) by proposing a scheme that localizes jamming vehicles, maps the jammed area, and prevents the jamming vehicles from sending and/or receiving beacons in the network. To achieve these objectives, we apply Centroid Localization (CL), Graham Scan Hull Algorithm (GSHA), and bloom filter data structure. The novelties of our work are three-fold. 1) We dynamically change the X, Y positions and radii of the jamming vehicles. 2) We implement multiple jamming attack scenarios with multiple jammers and varying number of vehicles. 3) We prevent the jamming vehicles from sending messages in the network. Simulation results show that on average, our model achieves an accuracy of 97.77%, a precision of 99.14%, a recall of 93.54%, and an F1 score of 96.03% for all the attack scenarios implemented.

ID MODEL
AB Multi-task intersection navigation, which includes unprotected turning left, turning right, and going straight in heavy traffic, remains a difficult task for autonomous vehicles. For the human driver, negotiation skills with other interactive vehicles are the key to guaranteeing safety and efficiency. However, it is hard to balance the safety and efficiency of the autonomous vehicle for multi-task intersection navigation. In this paper, we formulate a multi-task safe reinforcement learning framework with social attention to improve the safety and efficiency when interacting with other traffic participants. Specifically, the social attention module is used to focus on the states of negotiation vehicles. In addition, a safety layer is added to the multi-task reinforcement learning framework to guarantee safe negotiation. We deploy experiments in the simulators SUMO, which has abundant traffic flows, and CARLA, which has high-fidelity vehicle models. Both show that the proposed algorithm improves safety while maintaining stable traffic efficiency for the multi-task intersection navigation problem.

AB This paper revisits the state vector of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) dynamics coupled with the underwater Markovian stochasticity in the 'non-linear filtering' context. The underwater stochasticity is attributed to atmospheric turbulence, planetary interactions, sea surface conditions and astronomical phenomena. In this paper, we adopt the Ito process, a homogeneous Markov process, to describe the AUV state vector evolution equation. This paper accounts for the process noise as well as observation noise correction terms by considering the underwater filtering model. The non-linear filtering of the paper is achieved using the Kolmogorov backward equation and the evolution of the conditional characteristic function. The non-linear filtering equation is the cornerstone formalism of stochastic optimal control systems. Most notably, this paper introduces the non-linear filtering theory into an underwater vehicle stochastic system by constructing a lemma and a theorem for the underwater vehicle stochastic differential equation that were not available in the literature.

AB In this article, we develop a novel approach to detecting the movement changes of an autonomous land vehicle. Movement changes are of two pan values, namely, the pan angle and the pan distance between the vehicle and the navigation line. Both of these two values have to be taken into account while making movement calibration. The approach is comprised of a learning phase and an operation phase. in the former phase, a navigation map is generated by taking four images based on the preset maximum and minimum tolerant pan angles of the vehicle, while it is located on the preset maximum and minimum tolerant pan distances on the side parallel to the navigation Line. In the latter phase, images are taken in regular time intervals while the vehicle follows the navigation Line, and the two pan values are calculated through interpolation based on the navigation map. To increase the performance of the proposed system, two refinement approaches are also presented. Experimental results are given to reveal the superiority of the proposed approach.

AB Robotaxis have provided services to the public in some cities by different operators. There would exist connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) belonging to multiple firms on urban roads in the future. Each firm takes charge of its CAVs by giving the plan of origin-destination (OD) routes and intersection trajectories. It is essential to investigate firms' interactions with each other and estimate their influence on the traffic system. The competition for limited road resources among CAV firms needs to be considered during their joint planning of intersection trajectories and OD routes. First, potential conflicts in the autonomous intersection are analyzed in detail. Next, a simulation framework is proposed to model the competition process of CAV firms. Third, two safety management strategies are designed for resolving conflicts among CAVs from different firms at intersections. Finally, some simulation experiments are accomplished in a road network with two firms. The results reveal that CAV firms' right to vehicle route planning should not be abridged. The competition ensures the fairness of using road resources and results in only a 15% system efficiency loss in a specific strategy.

AB Economic efficient Autonomous Road Vehicles (ARVs) are invariably subjected to uncertainties and perturbations. Therefore, control of vehicle systems requires stability to withstand the effect of variations in the nominal performance. Lateral path-tracking is a substantial task of ARVs, especially in critical maneuvering and cornering with variable speed. In this study, a new controller on the basis of interval type-3 (T3) fuzzy logic system (FLSs) is designed. The main novelties and advantages are as follows. (1) The uncertainty is a main challenge in the path-following problem of ARVs. However, in the fuzzy-based approaches, the bounds of uncertainty are assumed to be known. However, in the our suggested approach, the bounds of uncertainties are also fuzzy sets and type-3 FLSs with online adaptation rules are suggested to handle the uncertainties. (2) The approximation errors (AEs) and perturbations are investigated and tackled by the compensators. (3) The bounds of estimation errors are also uncertain and are estimated by the suggested adaptation laws. (4) The stability is ensured under unknown dynamics, perturbations and critical maneuvers. (5) Comparison with the benchmarking techniques and conventional fuzzy approaches verifies that the suggested path-following scheme results in better maneuver performance.

AB This paper presents a novel approach to the design of globally asymptotically stable position and assessment of an USBL-aided integrated navigation based on Condition-adaptive gain Extended Kalman Filter (CAEKF) for the deep water Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) subject to uncertainties (e.g., loss of USBL signal, irregular and gross positioning error). Due to the influence of underwater observation conditions, positioning gross error will often appear when exploiting USBL to assist AUV navigation in ocean exploration. Aiming at this kind of problem a method of adding the conditional constraints and confidence assessment to EKF was put forward to filter the positioning value of USBL, and which can make the filtering result more robust and smooth. In addition, in order to reduce positioning error for the deep water vehicle online, an integrated navigation system is constructed by adding the acoustic navigation. Finally, the long voyage of the sea-trials data acquired in suitable sea trials performed in the South China Sea verifying the robustness and practicability of the proposed methodology, a very effective trade-off between accuracy and computational load has been achieved, and which demonstrated that the proposed algorithm outperforms standard navigation algorithms and other classical filtering approaches.

AB This paper investigates the formation control problem of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). What makes this problem different and challenging is that, in the AUV model, the mass and damping matrices are not diagonal with nonzero off-diagonal terms and unknown hydrodynamic damping terms. To address the effect of nonzero off-diagonal terms, we introduce a coordinate transformation, while the unknown hydrodynamic damping terms are approximated adaptively by a neural network. Then, a leader-follower control strategy is presented, where each follower needs to track a virtual vehicle. This strategy translates the formation control problem into a set of position (including heading) tracking problems for the following AUVs. The position and heading tracking controller is designed based on Lyapunov direct method and backstepping technique, taking into account the effect of the nonzero off-diagonal terms in the mass matrix and the unknown hydrodynamic damping terms. Simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control method proposed.

AB The capability of self-driving cars to relocate occupant-free is suggested to become one of the most disruptive yet beneficial features in the era of fully autonomous vehicles (FAVs). One relocation option is cruising: Once arriving at the destination, a traveler may instruct her FAV to circle around to bridge the time span between drop-off and pick-up, implying no need to park at all. This seems promising, given the various inefficiencies associated with parking. In this paper we show that driverless vehicle cruising is accompanied by its own inefficiency and, thus, should be a major issue of concern. By developing and applying an integrated economic equilibrium speed and parking choice model, we identify the counterpart of the classical (negative) cruising-for-parking externality in the world of non-autonomous vehicles, namely a (positive) speeding-when-cruising externality that may occur in the era of self-driving cars. The externality emerges because driverless vehicle cruising entails moving at very low speed, thereby imposing congestion on regular (non-cruising) traffic. We show that when not accounted for by cruising FAVs themselves (e.g. via a Pigouvian speed subsidy), not corrected through regulation (e.g. via speed control) or planning (e.g. via dedicated lanes), the traffic system fails to achieve a socially optimal outcome. When parking-as-a-substitute-for cruising is feasible and properly priced, a welfare-maximizing speed regulator would enforce cruising speeds that deter travelers from choosing inefficient cruising. In this case, welfare is improved and parking would be even socially desirable (at least in the short term). However, when parking is free and parking externalities are substantial, the transport system features too many parkers, but to limit the efficiency losses in the parking market, socially optimal speed regulation enables cruising too. In that case, the result is a huge welfare loss even with regulation stemming from traditional cruising-for-parking induced by parkers, and road congestion caused by cruisers. Our findings support the idea of adopting economic instruments, planning tools, command-and-control approaches, and parking-as-a-substitute-for-cruising to tackle the potential inefficiencies resulting from driverless vehicle cruising, but also underscore the inappropriateness of parking-as-a-substitute-for-cruising when it is heavily underpriced.

AB The paper addresses the single range observability analysis of a kinematics model of cooperating underactuated underwater vehicles. Teams of underwater vehicles that communicate with each other may be able to access and exchange their relative distances through, by example, acoustic signal time-of-flight measurements. Such relative distance measurements together with vehicle's attitude and velocity information may be used onboard to implement a navigation filter to estimate the vehicle's relative positions and orientations. A pre-requisite for successfully designing such navigation filters is to assess the systems observability properties. Contrary to the majority of existing studies on single range observability, the paper considers a more realistic underactuated kinematics model for slender body autonomous underwater vehicles rather than a simple point mass model. The paper extends previous results building on an augmented state technique allowing to reformulate the nonlinear observability problem in terms of a linear time varying one. As a result, all possible (globally) unobservable motions are characterized in terms of the systems' initial conditions and velocity commands within the class of interest. The fundamental results reported are also illustrated by numerical simulations providing evidence of different motions generating the same output, namely lacking observability.

DT Article

AB We present a framework for the estimation of driver behavior at intersections, with applications to autonomous driving and vehicle safety. The framework is based on modeling the driver behavior and vehicle dynamics as a hybrid-state system (HSS), with driver decisions being modeled as a discrete-state system and the vehicle dynamics modeled as a continuous-state system. The proposed estimation method uses observable parameters to track the instantaneous continuous state and estimates the most likely behavior of a driver given these observations. This paper describes a framework that encompasses the hybrid structure of vehicle-driver coupling and uses hidden Markov models (HMMs) to estimate driver behavior from filtered continuous observations. Such a method is suitable for scenarios that involve unknown decisions of other vehicles, such as lane changes or intersection access. Such a framework requires extensive data collection, and the authors describe the procedure used in collecting and analyzing vehicle driving data. For illustration, the proposed hybrid architecture and driver behavior estimation techniques are trained and tested near intersections with exemplary results provided. Comparison is made between the proposed framework, simple classifiers, and naturalistic driver estimation. Obtained results show promise for using the HSS-HMM framework.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel method to estimate a goal of surround vehicles to perform a lane change at a merging section. Recently, autonomous driving and advance driver-assistance systems are attracting great attention as a solution to substitute human drivers and to decrease accident rates. For example, a warning system to alert a lane change performed by surrounding vehicles to the front space of the host vehicle can be considered. If it is possible to forecast the intention of the interrupting vehicle in advance, the host driver can easily respond to the lane change with sufficient reaction time. This paper assumes a mandatory situation where two lanes are merged. The proposed method assesses the interaction between the lane-changing vehicle and the host vehicle on the mainstream lane. Then, the lane-change goal is estimated based on the interaction under the assumption that the lane-changing driver decides to minimize the collision risk. The proposed method applies the dynamic potential field method, which changes the distribution according to the relative speed and distance between two subject vehicles, to assess the interaction. The performance of goal estimation is evaluated using real traffic data, and it is demonstrated that the estimation can be successfully performed by the proposed method.

AB The paper simulates the spatial variations in the sources of, and exposure to, traffic-related PM10 emissions for the city of Vienna, Austria. Using an extended and calibrated MATSim micro-simulation model, we reproduce agent-level mobility patterns for a representative day. Street-level PM10 emissions, mostly from cars, are extrapolated for the entire city to estimate concentration and exposure levels at hourly intervals. We show that exposure levels exceed the recommended 50 mu g/m3 threshold between peak travel hours at home, education, and work locations. Among different socioeconomic status (SES) groups, urban, single, 15 years and younger, and those living near the city center face high exposure levels, while car users, that cause a majority of the emissions, are relatively less exposed. Finally, we show that Shared Autonomous Electric Vehicles (SAEVs) reduce PM10 emissions, but the benefits are not homogeneously distributed across the different SES groups.

This article proposes a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) SLAM algorithm for an AUV equipped with a mechanically scanning imaging sonar (MSIS) that has a very slow scanning frequency. To tackle the issues of scan distortion and sonar data sparseness caused by the slow-sampling MSIS, the core of the algorithm is a carefully designed sliding window-based scan forming module. Then the formed scans are fed into the modified RBPF to build a consistent grid-based map thus localizing the AUV accurately. Extensive simulation and experiments are carried out to verify the proposed algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing ones in terms of the level of map consistency with the environment as well as the accuracy of pose estimation.

AB Mesoscale eddies regulate oceanic material transport and atmospheric current. The area around Xisha Islands is an important sink region for mesoscale eddies. We observed two cyclones during September to October 2019, and found that these two cold eddies had split from one local cold eddy. Using a Chinese Autonomous Underwater Vehicle(AUV), called 'Sea-Whale 2000 degrees, for field experiment, we successfully observed the fine structures at the interface of the two cyclones, which showed that two vertical layers of water developed into three layers. The AUV was operated at 300 m and captured the temperature, salinity and velocity oscillation at the bottom of the two cyclonic eddies. A simple barotropic quasi-geostrophic numerical experiment showed that the slope gradient effect played a major role in eddy splitting. Through energy conservation analysis, we confirmed that the barotropic instability was a major contributor to the development of the cold eddies.

ID SENSOR NETWORKS
AB As a special application of delay tolerant networks (DTNs), efficient data collection in the deep sea poses some unique challenges, due to the need for timely data reporting and the delay of acoustic transmission in the ocean. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are deployed in the deep sea to surface frequently to transmit collected data from sensors (in a 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional search space) to the surface stations. However, additional delay occurs at each resurfacing. In this paper, we want to minimize the average data reporting delay, through optimizing the number and locations of AUV resurfacing events. We also study the AUV trajectory planning using an extended Euler circuit, where the search space is a set of segments (e.g., oil pipes) in the deep sea. To further reduce the data reporting delay, several schemes, which schedules multiple AUVs cooperatively, are also explored. Finally, experiments in both the synthetic and real traces validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents an autonomous vision-based net-recovery system for small fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A fixed-wing UAV platform is constructed using various avionic sensors, and integrated with a flight control system and a vision system. The ground operation system consists of a vision station and ground control station that provide operation commands and monitor the UAV status. The vision algorithm to detect the recovery net and provide the bearing angle to the guidance algorithm is explained, along with the discussions on the techniques employed to improve the reliability of visual detection. The system identification process and controller are described, which enables to track given waypoints and to approach the detected net under the pursuit guidance law. Experimental results show the autonomous capabilities including take-off, waypoint following, and vision-based net recovery. The proposed technique can be an effective solution to recover fixed-wing UAVs without resorting to a complicated structure such as an instrumented landing system or expensive sensors such as a differential GPS.

AB Whereas autonomous vehicles are expected to provide several advantages, the current scenarios envisioned for self-driving vehicles are expected to increase the incidence of motion sickness. This study investigates the effects of dynamic visual stimuli on the development of carsickness under two different view conditions. A prototypical light-emitting diode (LED) feedback system visualizing longitudinal driving dynamics in the passenger's peripheral visual field was installed in the rear of a modified serial vehicle. A real driving experiment was conducted on the test track of a major car manufacturer. Subjective motion sickness ratings were recorded. It was hypothesized that carsickness can be mitigated with the information from the visual feedback system. Subjective motion sickness scores tended to be lower with the LED feedback system while there was no substantial interaction effect with the view condition. Although the results indicate potential benefits of the LED feedback system for the mitigation of motion sickness, further development of the system and its functionalities and the inclusion of psychophysiological measures to objectively quantify motion sickness is necessary to confirm these findings.

AB With the increasing demand for urban space, more and more multistory carparks are needed as they will play a central role in the city transportation system. An autonomous navigation solution for Intelligent Vehicles in these indoor scenarios is then required. One step to solve this problem is to localize Intelligent Vehicles in these specific environments. However, the lack of GPS due to signal obstruction (multipath, non-line of sight, interference, etc.) appears to be a significant concern for any localization system, let alone indoor ones. Hence, in this paper, a wireless sensor network based approach is proposed to replace the GPS (Global Positioning System) role for indoor environments. In addition, a fusion framework for multiple sensors such as Wi-Fi access points, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) or LiDAR is studied. Experiments in almost one-year duration yield a stable result of mean global localization error at 0.5m.

AB Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) forms the foundation of vehicle localization in autonomous driving. Utilizing high-precision 3D scene maps as prior information in vehicle localization greatly assists in the navigation of autonomous vehicles within large-scale 3D scene models. However, generating high-precision maps is complex and costly, posing challenges to commercialization. As a result, a global localization system that employs low-precision, city-scale 3D scene maps reconstructed by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is proposed to optimize visual positioning for vehicles. To address the discrepancies in image information caused by differing aerial and ground perspectives, this paper introduces a wall complementarity algorithm based on the geometric structure of buildings to refine the city-scale 3D scene. A 3D-to-3D feature registration algorithm is developed to determine vehicle location by integrating the optimized city-scale 3D scene with the local scene generated by an onboard stereo camera. Through simulation experiments conducted in a computer graphics (CG) simulator, the results indicate that utilizing a completed low-precision scene model enables achieving a vehicle localization accuracy with an average error of 3.91 m, which is close to the 3.27 m error obtained using the high-precision map. This validates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The system demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing low-precision city-scale 3D scene maps generated by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for vehicle localization in large-scale scenes.

AB The introduction of connected and autonomous vehicles enables new possibilities in vehicle routing: Knowing the origin and destination of each vehicle in the network can allow for coordinated real-time routing of the vehicles to optimize network performance. However, this relies on individual vehicles being "altruistic," i.e., willing to accept alternative less-preferred routes. We conduct a study to compare different levels of agent altruism in decentralized vehicles coordination and the effect on the network-level traffic performance. This work introduces novel load-balancing scenarios of traffic flow in real-world cities for varied levels of agent altruism. We show evidence that the new decentralized optimization router is more effective with networks of high load.

AB Most of the previously proposed vehicle controllers are developed with the no-skid assumption, also presume that full states of the vehicle are available, which are usually violated for industrial tractors. This article dedicates to building a practical vision-based antiskid tracking control framework for industrial tractors. For that, we first present a novel nonlinear visual-inertial estimator (VIE) to estimate the real-time position and velocity of the tractor in unstructured environments (GPS-denied, no prior feature maps, etc.). Subsequently, VIE-based kinematic and dynamic controllers are designed for trajectory tracking. The proposed kinematic controller is easy to implement. It works well even if the vehicle is towing payloads since the sideslip angle can be reactively estimated and compensated. Besides, by fully considering vehicle dynamics, the VIE-based dynamic controller can be compatible with occasions that require higher control performance. It is proved by Lyapunov theory that the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop estimation-control system is guaranteed. Extensive full-scale experiments on an autonomous tractor are implemented to show the validity of the VIE-based control system in unstructured environments.

AB Purpose For autonomous vehicles, trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles is beneficial to improving the situational awareness of dynamic and stochastic traffic environments, which is a crucial and indispensable element to realize highly automated driving. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the overall framework consists of two parts: first, a novel driver characteristic and intention estimation (DCIE) model is built to indicate the higher-level information of the vehicle using its low-level motion variables; then, according to the estimation results of the DCIE model, a classified Gaussian process model is established for probabilistic vehicle trajectory prediction under different motion patterns. Findings The whole method is later applied and analyzed in the highway lane-change scenarios with the parameters of models learned from the public naturalistic driving data set. Compared with other traditional methods, the performance of this proposed approach is proved superior, demonstrated by the higher accuracy in the long prediction horizon and a more reasonable description of uncertainty. Originality/value This hierarchical approach is proposed to make trajectory prediction accurately both in the short term and long term, which can also deal with the uncertainties caused by the perception system or indeterminate vehicle behaviors.

AB This paper treats the Piggyback Transportation Problem: A large vehicle moves successive batches of small vehicles from a depot to a single launching point. Here, the small vehicles depart toward assigned customers, supply shipments, and return to the depot. Once the large vehicle has returned and another batch of small vehicles has been loaded at the depot, the process repeats until all customers are serviced. With autonomous driving on the verge of practical application, this general setting occurs whenever small autonomous delivery vehicles with limited operating range, e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) or delivery robots, need to be brought in the proximity of the customers by a larger vehicle, e.g., a truck. We aim at the most elementary decision problem in this context, which is inspired by Amazon's novel last-mile concept, the flying warehouse. According to this concept, drones are launched from a flying warehouse and - after their return to an earthbound depot - are resupplied to the flying warehouse by an air shuttle. We formulate the Piggyback Transportation Problem, investigate its computational complexity, and derive suited solution procedures. From a theoretical perspective, we prove different im portant structural problem properties. From a practical point of view, we explore the impact of the two main cost drivers, the capacity of the large vehicle and the fleet size of small vehicles, on service quality. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper proposes an autonomous vehicle trajectory tracking system that fully considers road friction. When an intelligent vehicle drives at high speed on roads with different friction coefficients, the difficulty of its trajectory tracking control lies in the fast and accurate identification of road friction coefficients. Therefore, an improved strategy is designed based on traditional recursive least squares (RLS), which is utilized for accurate identification of the friction coefficient. First, the tire force and slip rate required for the estimation of the road friction coefficient by constructing the vehicle dynamics model and tire effective model are calculated. In this paper, a variable forgetting factor recursive least squares (VFF-RLS) method is proposed for the construction of the friction coefficient estimator. Second, the identified results are output to the model predictive controller (MPC) constructed in this paper as a way to improve tire slip angle constraints, to realize the trajectory tracking of the intelligent vehicle. Finally, the joint simulation test results of Carsim and Matlab/Simulink show that the trajectory tracking system based on the VFF-RLS friction coefficient estimator has outstanding tracking performance.

AB The traffic management system holds immense importance due to its significant impact on human living standards. With the advent of advanced technologies such as natural language processing and autonomous vehicles, this study proposes a novel cooperative traffic management system based on collection auctions at an isolated unsignalized intersection, taking into account the users' preferences for passing the intersection while being subject to their social credits. Once vehicles enter the vehicle-to-infrastructure communication zone, drivers provide the intersection control center with their bidding information, which reflects their urgency for right-of-way. According to the traffic and biding information, the vehicles' passing sequence is optimized by the control center, in order to maximize the drivers' average satisfaction. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, a series of simulation experiments were conducted under varying traffic volumes. The simulation results were then compared with several other traffic control systems from the literature. It was shown that the proposed algorithm demonstrates superior performance in terms of computational time, traffic delay, and drivers' personal satisfaction.

One of the nine infrared distance sensors located on the frame of the robotic vehicle in the front part of the frame is used for this application task. The infrared distance sensor characteristic is created from the measured experimental data, which is then linearized in the given section. The main aim of the experiment is to find such an equation of a line that corresponds to the stopping of a robotic vehicle with a given accuracy from an obstacle. The determined equation of the line is applied to the resulting program for autonomous control of the robotic vehicle. This issue is one of the many tasks performed by AGV in the industry. The introduction of AGVs into the industry is one of the many possibilities within Industry 4.0.

AB This paper focuses on online obstacle avoidance planning for unmanned underwater vehicles. To improve the autonomous ability and intelligence of obstacle avoidance planning, a recurrent neural network with convolution is proposed. In the proposed method, convolution replaces full connection in the standard recurrent neural network, thus reducing the number of parameters and improving the feature extraction capability. Training and test datasets are generated for the deep learning process and, combined with multibeam forward-looking sonar, this learning system can automatically realize online obstacle avoidance for unmanned underwater vehicles. Experiments are designed to compare the performance of the proposed structure with that of a recurrent neural network, gated recurrent units, and conventional ant colony optimization. The results fully verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method, and show that the powerful learning and memory capabilities of the proposed structure can be used in the unmanned underwater vehicle autonomous learning environment This study demonstrates that recurrent neural networks with convolution greatly enhance the ability of unmanned systems to sense and adapt to unknown environments.

AB The use of large numbers of unmanned air vehicles in a given air space presents a challenge for conventional air traffic control methods. Flocking (or schooling, swarming or herding) in nature arises when mobile organisms find benefit in living at high densities. The present paper applies rules of flocking (cohesion, alignment, separation, and migration) to the problem of managing the flight of a number of autonomous unmanned air vehicles. A six-degree of freedom aerodynamic model of an existing UAV is used to simulate the flocking flight vehicles. It is found that application of the cohesion and alignment rules is sufficient to generate true flocking behaviour in that the flight vehicle density is increased and the flock members converge on a common heading. Increasing rule strength reduces the time taken to achieve flocking behaviour. However increasing rule strength too far leads to oscillatory or unstable flight paths. It is found that flock behaviour can be adequately described using the time histories of two statistical parameters: the mean radius between flock members and the standard deviation of the flock members' heading angles.

In our research we composed a virtual reality experiment for a pedestrian crossing in an urban environment in order to test pedestrians' reactions on an LED light display mounted on a virtual AV. Our main research interest was to investigate whether communication patterns influence the decision making of pedestrians when crossing the road. In a VR environment, four scenarios were created with a vehicle approaching a pedestrian crossing with different speeds and displaying a special red/green sign to pedestrians. Here, 51 persons participating in the experiment had to decide when crossing is safe. Results show that the majority of people indicated they would cross in the time windows when it was actually safe to cross. Male subjects made their decision to cross slightly faster but no significant differences were found in the decision making by gender. It was found that age is not an influencing factor, either. Overall, a quick learning process was experienced proving that explicit communication patterns are self-explaining.

AB According to the position relationship between the vehicle and the obstacle, a new obstacle avoidance path planner was designed to solve the limitation of traditional local obstacle avoidance path planner in excessive obstacle avoidance. In order to improve the control accuracy of the path tracking controller and ensure the stability of the vehicle, a comprehensive evaluation index of path tracking performance considering control accuracy and driving stability was established. The optimal prediction time domain and control time domain parameters at different vehicle speeds were obtained, and an adaptive dual time domain parameter path tracking controller was designed. Based on the joint-simulation platform, the integrated structure of the planning layer and the control layer was simulated and verified. Simulation results show that the new obstacle avoidance function can avoid excessive obstacle avoidance while ensuring real-time performance, and improve the driving stability of the vehicle. The adaptive time-domain parameter path tracking controller has better comprehensive control performance and can improve driving safety under extreme conditions. The integrated structure of local obstacle avoidance path planning and path tracking control are beneficial for the vehicle to plan and accurately track the local obstacle avoidance path in multiple static obstacle scenes.

ID SYSTEM; AVOIDANCE
AB A distributed control framework intended to coordinate the motions of teams of autonomous agricultural vehicles operating in proximity is presented; master-slave and peer-to-peer operation modes are supported. Each vehicle has a nonlinear model predictive tracking controller, which keeps it as close as possible to the path demanded by the task, and coordinates and avoids collisions with nearby vehicles. To do this, it receives the motion trajectories of all other vehicles in its vicinity that may interfere with its own projected motion via a wireless network, and incorporates these trajectories in the computation of its own optimal control action. Each controller is supervised by a higher-level task controller that determines a limited set of the controller's parameters. Simulation experiments have shown that the minimisation of the tracking error along a finite horizon enabled the controller to track paths containing sharp turns, by applying appropriate steering well in advance of the turn. It has also been shown that the variation of specific predictive controller parameters results in a wide range of behaviours; i.e., vehicles can move in both operating modes, coordinate with nearby vehicles by altering their velocity profiles or the shapes of their paths, and avoid collisions.

TI Using Deficit Function to Determine the Minimum Fleet Size of an

LA English
DT Article
ID CAPACITY
AB Emerging technologies, such as connected and autonomous vehicles, electric vehicles, and information and communication, are surrounding us at an ever-increasing pace, which, together with the concept of shared mobility, have great potential to transform existing public transit (PT) systems into far more user-oriented, system-optimal, smart, and sustainable new PT systems with increased service connectivity, synchronization, and better, more satisfactory user experiences. This work analyses such a new PT system comprised of autonomous modular PT (AMPT) vehicles. In this analysis, one of the most challenging tasks is to accurately estimate the minimum number of vehicle modules, that is, its minimum fleet size (MFS), required to perform a set of scheduled services. The solution of the MFS problem of a single-line AMPT system is based on a graphical method, adapted from the deficit function (DF) theory. The traditional DF model has been extended to accommodate the definitions of an AMPT system. Some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the mathematical formulations. The limitations of traditional continuum approximation models and the equivalence between the extended DF model and an integer programming model are also provided. The extended DF model was applied, as a case study, to a single line of an AMPT system, the dynamic autonomous road transit (DART) system in Singapore. The results show that the extended DF model is effective in solving the MFS problem and has the potential to be applied to solving real-life MFS problems of large-scale, multi-line and multi-terminal AMPT systems.

AB Safe, autonomous operation in complex, cluttered environments is a critical challenge facing autonomous mobile systems. The research described in this paper was motivated by a particularly difficult example of autonomous mobility: flight of a small unmanned aerial vehicle through a forest. The focus was on enabling the three critical tasks that comprise flight: 1) maintaining controlled flight while avoiding collisions (aviate); 2) flying from a known start location to a known goal location (navigate); and 3) providing information about the environment-a map-to a human operator or other robots in the team (communicate). Presented here is a solution to the problem of estimating vehicle state (its position, orientation, and velocity) as well as the positions of obstacles or landmarks in the environment using only inertial measurements and bearings to landmarks. This is a highly nonlinear estimation problem, and standard estimation techniques such as the extended Kalman filter are prone to divergence in this application. In this paper a sigma-point Kalman filter is implemented, resulting in an estimator which is able to cope with the significant nonlinearities in the system equations and uncertainty in state estimates while remaining tractable for real-time operation. In addition, the issues of data association and landmark initialization are addressed. Estimator performance is examined through Monte Carlo simulations in two dimensions for scenarios involving unmanned aerial vehicle flight in cluttered environments. Simulations show that convergent, consistent estimates of vehicle state and obstacle positions can be obtained and that the estimates can be used by a trajectory planner to generate a path through a cluttered environment.

ID STRATEGY
AB In this paper, a vector data net solver is proposed, which can reduce bivariate discrete-time dynamic programming (DP) computation time by 98.0% without losing accuracy. Therefore, for the first time, bivariate discrete-time DP can operate under model predictive control rolling optimization to calculate future optimum vehicle velocity in real time considering future road altitude and instant traffic information. Simulation results indicate that with the solution presented in this paper, front vehicles and the proper windows to pass through front intersections can be constantly considered. Meanwhile, the calculated optimum vehicle velocity almost remains the same as the global optimum solutions. Simulation results are validated by real-car tests, and the test new energy vehicle (NEV) electricity consumption is reduced by up to 48.6%. A comparison experiment is performed between the solution presented in this paper and commonly used adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), and the results indicate that the former has better performance and stability. This paper describes a novel solution for online optimum velocity calculation under vehicle to everything (V2X) environment and can be used by all smart NEVs with autonomous driving or active cruise control functions for lower electricity consumption and better riding comfort.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have shown great promise in fulfilling surveillance, scavenging, and monitoring tasks. Traditional gliders and streamlined AUVs are designed for long-term operational efficiency in expansive environments but are limited in cluttered spaces due to their shape and control authority; agile AUVs can penetrate cluttered or sensitive environments but are limited in operational endurance at large spatial scales. This paper presents the dynamic modeling and control design of an underwater hull capable of actuating its shape morphology. The prototype hull incorporates flexible, buckled fiberglass ribs to ensure a rigid shape that is actuated by modulating the length of the body's semi-major axis. We represent the vehicle shape using a single control input actuating the vehicle's length-to-diameter ratio. Hydrodynamic modeling of the flexible hull suggests that dynamic shape actuation can modulate the mass and drag properties of the hull to improve control of the vehicle's forward speed. Using tools from nonlinear control theory, this paper presents the derivation of a shape-actuating autonomous control algorithm regulating the vehicle speed to a time-varying reference speed, subject to the actuator limits. The theoretical control results are illustrated using numerical simulations of the vehicle model.

AB Fleets of electric vehicles will likely shift electricity demand, and the effect of upstream charging emissions will come from generation sources that are dispatched in response. This study proposes a multi-stage charging and discharging problem to translate low-cost energy transactions into vehicle dispatch decisions. A day-ahead charging optimization problem minimizes electricity purchases and marginal emissions damages, with energy transactions becoming targets in an optimization-based dispatch strategy for an on-demand shared autonomous electric vehicle (SAEV) fleet. The framework was tested for Austin, Texas, using an agent-based simulator. Fleets can schedule charging to lower daily power costs (averaging 15.5% or $0.79/day/SAEV) while reducing health damages from generation-related pollution (2.8% or $0.43/day/SAEV). Fleet managers can increase profits ($8 per SAEV per day) by adopting a multi-stage charging and discharging strategy that can serve more passengers per day than price-agnostic dispatch strategies.

AB A dual-loop robust controller is proposed for precise position control of an autonomous underwater vehicle under uncertain hydrodynamics and unknown disturbances. In the inner-loop, a time-delay controller is presented in which a time-delay estimator estimates uncertain hydrodynamics and unknown disturbances from its time-delayed information and cancels these, thereby reducing control efforts on internal dynamics considerably. In the outer-loop, the linear controller stabilises the position error of the AUV without prior knowledge on values of hydrodynamic parameters. The proposed dual-loop controller features simple structure and easy implementation because it does not require real-time estimation of hydrodynamics.

AB A systems approach to Autonomous Underwater Vehicles propulsion system design is presented. The approach identifies the interface parameters of the various system components and relates them through two main analytical models; electric drive motor and screw propeller. From gross characteristics of the AUV and data given in the motor manufacturer's catalog, the overall propulsion system performance can be optimized while clearly observing the limits of critical design restrictions. Emphasis is given to the proper selection of the drive motor, its design operating point and the design of an intimately matched propeller: Rapid prototyping methods for fabrication of the final propeller design are presented.

AB The ability to sense and understanding the driving environment is a key technology for ADAS and autonomous driving. Human drivers have to pay more visual attention to important or target elements and ignore unnecessary ones present in their field of sight. A model that computes this visual attention of targets in a specific driving environment is essential and useful in supporting autonomous driving, object-specific tracking & detection, driving training, car collision warning, traffic sign detection, etc. In this paper, we propose a new framework of visual attention that can predict important objects in the driving scene using a conditional generative adversarial network. A large scale Visual Attention Driving Database (VADD) of saliency heat-maps is built from existing driving datasets using a saliency mechanism. The proposed framework model takes its strength from these saliency heat-maps as conditioning label variables. The results show that the proposed approach makes us able to predict heat-maps of most important objects in a driving environment.

AB A method used to detect anomaly and estimate the state of vehicle in driving was proposed. The kinematics model of the vehicle was constructed and nonholonomic constraint conditions were added, which refer to that once the vehicle encounters the faults that could not be controlled, the constraint conditions are violated. Estimation equations of the velocity errors of the vehicle were given out to estimate the velocity errors of side and forward. So the stability of the whole vehicle could be judged by the velocity errors of the vehicle. Conclusions were validated through the vehicle experiment. This method is based on GPS/INS integrated navigation system, and can provide foundation for fault detections in unmanned autonomous vehicles.

AB With the significant population growth in megacities everywhere, traffic congestion is becoming a severe impediment, leading to long travel delays and large economic loss on a global scale. Platooning is a promising intelligent transportation framework that can improve road capacity, on-road safety, and fuel efficiency. Furthermore, enabling inter-vehicle communications within a platoon and among platoons (in a multiplatoon) can potentially enhance platoon control by keeping constant inter-vehicle and inter-platoon distances. However, an efficient resource allocation (RA) approach is required for the timely and successful delivery of inter-vehicle information within multiplatoons. In this paper, subchannel allocation scheme and power control mechanism are proposed for LTE-based inter-vehicle communications in a multiplatooning scenario. We jointly consider the evolved multimedia broadcast multicast services and device-to-device (D2D) multicast communications to enable intra-and inter-platoon communications such that a desired tradeoff between the required cellular resources and the imposed communication delay can be achieved. Simulation results are given to demonstrate that the proposed approaches can reduce the communication delay comparing to D2D-unicast based RA scheme, especially in a multiplatoon scenario with a large number of vehicles.

The proposed method improves the optimization speed through the reduction of the search space. In addition, an improvement in convergence is demonstrated. The fuzzy controller optimized by the FRC scheme is employed to maintain the lateral position of an autonomous vehicle. The robustness of the controller to parameter variation is studied by Monte-Carlo analysis. Simulation and experimental studies demonstrate the performance of the lateral controller.

AB In most cases, a vehicle works in a complex environment, with working conditions changing frequently. For most model predictive tracking controllers, however, the impacts of some important working conditions, such as speed and road conditions, are not concerned. In this regard, an adaptive model predictive controller is proposed, which improves tracking accuracy and stability compared with general model predictive controllers. First, the proposed controller utilizes the recursive least square algorithm to estimate tire cornering stiffness and road friction coefficient online. Then, the estimated tire cornering stiffness is used to update vehicle dynamics model and the estimated road friction coefficient is used to update the road adhesion constraint. Moreover, the control parameters consist of prediction horizon, control horizon, and sampling time, all of which are set according to vehicle speed. A co-simulation based on MATLAB/Simulink and CarSim is conducted. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed controller has a great adaptive ability to changing working conditions, especially to speed and road conditions.

AB Mixed traffic control with connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human driving vehicles (HVs) is becoming a hot topic. CAV trajectory planning at work zones under the mixed traffic environment is a big challenge. Existing studies only focus on longitudinal trajectories (e.g., acceleration profiles), ignoring lateral trajectories (lane changing). This study proposes a trajectory planning model for CAVs at work zones under mixed traffic environment. Both longitudinal and lateral trajectories are considered. On the basis of the states of CAVs and of HVs observed by CAVs, the number and initial states of unobservable HVs in the planning horizon are estimated considering the interactions between vehicle driving behaviors. A trajectory planning model is then formulated to optimize acceleration profiles and lane choices of CAVs in the planning horizon in a centralized way. The minimization of total vehicle delay and fuel consumption is adopted as the objective function. A car-following model and a lane-changing model are adopted to capture the driving behaviors of HVs. The proposed model is a mixed-integer linear program. Numerical studies validate the advantages of the proposed trajectory planning model over late merge control for vehicle delay and fuel consumption.

AB This paper proposes a velocity-based robust fault tolerant automatic steering control approach for autonomous ground vehicles via an adaptive event triggered network communication mechanism. Firstly, as the vehicle longitudinal velocity is not fixed but time-varying, a polytope with finite vertices is adopted to construct a linear parameter varying vehicle system model. Secondly, since network-induced delay and actuator fault inevitably occur in the control system, a novel Lyapunov function is formulated to guarantee the asymptotical stability of the closed-loop system. Moreover, an advanced event triggered communication scheme is proposed for the co-design of robust automatic steering controller, which is quite effective to reduce network communication burden and enhance resource utilization of the shared band-limited in-vehicle communication network. Finally, numerical simulations on two cases are carried out to evaluate and verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller. Compared with existing studies, the proposed controller contributes greatly to the economization of communication resource and improvement of path following performance and lateral stability.

AB Waypoints have enhanced the prospect of fully autonomous drone applications. However, Geographical Position System (GPS) spoofing and signal interferences are key issues in waypoint-based drone applications. Also, conceptual waypoint-based drone applications require accurate awareness of waypoints based on environmental cues and integration of additional sensing modalities. Additional sensor modalities may overwhelm drones' processing resources, reducing operational time. This study proposes W-MobileNet, a denoising model for autonomous trajectory trail navigation based on precision control of a path planner, denoising capabilities of Weiner filters, and perceptual knowledge of convolutional neural networks. Creatively integrating the modules of W-MobileNet results in an intuitive drone navigation controller characterized by position, orientation, and speed estimation. Further, a generic loss function that significantly aids models to converge faster during training is proposed based on adaptive weights. An extensive evaluation of a simulated and real-world experiment shows that W-MobileNet is more favorable in precision and robustness than contemporary state-of-the-art models. W-MobileNet has the potential to become one of the standards for autonomous drone applications.

AB Expansion of today's underwater scenarios and missions necessitates the requisition for robust decision making of the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV); hence, design an efficient decision-making framework is essential for maximizing the mission productivity in a restricted time. This paper focuses on developing a deliberative conflict-free-task assignment architecture encompassing a global route planner (GRP) and a local path planner (LPP) to provide consistent motion planning encountering both environmental dynamic changes and a priori knowledge of the terrain, so that the AUV is reactively guided to the target of interest in the context of an uncertain underwater environment. The architecture involves three main modules: The GRP module at the top level deals with the task priority assignment, mission time management, and determination of a feasible route between start and destination point in a large-scale environment. The LPP module at the lower level deals with safety considerations and generates collision-free optimal trajectory between each specific pair of waypoints listed in obtained global route. Re-planning module tends to promote robustness and reactive ability of the AUV with respect to the environmental changes. The experimental results for different simulated missions demonstrate the inherent robustness and drastic efficiency of the proposed scheme in enhancement of the vehicles autonomy in terms of mission productivity, mission time management, and vehicle safety.

TI Efficient Game-Theoretic Planning With Prediction Heuristic for
   Socially-Compliant Autonomous Driving
SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS
LA English

DE Agent-based systems; autonomous agents; intelligent transportation
   systems
AB Planning under social interactions with other agents is an essential problem for autonomous driving. As the actions of the autonomous vehicle in the interactions affect and are also affected by other agents, autonomous vehicles need to efficiently infer the reaction of the other agents. Most existing approaches formulate the problem as a generalized Nash equilibrium problem solved by optimization-based methods. However, they demand too much computational resource and easily fall into the local minimum due to the non-convexity. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) successfully tackles such issues in game-theoretic problems. However, as the interaction game tree grows exponentially, the general MCTS still requires a huge amount of iterations to reach the optima. In this letter, we introduce an efficient game-theoretic trajectory planning algorithm based on general MCTS by incorporating a prediction algorithm as a heuristic. On top of it, a social-compliant reward and a Bayesian inference algorithm are designed to generate diverse driving behaviors and identify the other driver's driving preference. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with datasets containing naturalistic driving behavior in highly interactive scenarios.

AB In this paper, we have demonstrated a robust in-cabin monitoring system (IMS) for safety, security, surveillance, and monitoring, including privacy concerns for personal and shared autonomous vehicles (AVs). It consists of a set of monitoring cameras and an onboard device (OBD) equipped with artificial intelligence (AI). Hereafter, this combination of a camera and an OBD is referred to as the AI camera. We have investigated the issues for mobility services in higher levels of autonomous driving, what needs to be monitored, how to monitor, etc. Our proposed IMS is an on-device AI system that indigenously has improved the privacy of the users. Furthermore, we have enlisted the essential actions to be considered in an IMS and developed an appropriate database (DB). Our DB consists of multifaced scenarios important for monitoring the in-cabin of the higher-level AVs. Moreover, we have compared popular AI models applied for object and occupant recognition. In addition, our DB is available on request to support the research on the development of seamless monitoring of the in-cabin higher levels of autonomous driving for the assurance of safety and security.

AB Autonomous landing in complex environments is a critical problem for unmanned aerial vehicle autonomous control, and efficiently detecting landing identification mark in real-world scenario is still challenging. Due to the limited computational power of airborne computing equipment, current target detection algorithms cannot meet the demand efficiently. In this paper, we proposed a new landing marker detection algorithm for autonomous landing systems in a real environment. We used an ellipse detection algorithm to detect the ellipse landmark or other elliptical objects. Furthermore, convolution neural networks were utilized to obtain the correct landmarks, which is robust, fast and can achieve a speed of 25 fps with 720p resolution video on an Intel NUC onboard computer. Unlike the other methods, the accuracy and speed of our algorithm is verified in a real-time application with more harsh conditions. During system testing, the flight system can detect the object above 20 m, track it, and automatically land on it with this vision algorithm. The algorithm has helped us achieve the first position at Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge in Abu Dhabi this year.

AB The utility of micro air vehicles (MAVs) has expanded significantly in the last decade, and there are now numerous commercial systems available at relatively low cost. This expansion has arisen mainly due to the miniaturisation of flight control systems and advances in energy storage and propulsion technologies. Several emerging applications involve routine operation of MAVs in complex urban environments such as parcel delivery, communications relay and environmental monitoring. However, MAVs currently rely on one or more operators-in-the-loop and, whilst desirable, full autonomous operation has not yet been achieved. In this review paper, autonomous MAV operation in complex environments is explored with conceptualisation for future MAV operation in urban environments. Limitations of current technologies are systematically examined through consideration of the state-of-the-art and future trends. The main limitations challenging the realisation of fully autonomous MAVs are mainly attributed to: computational power, communication and energy storage. These limitations lead to poor sensing and planning capabilities, which are essential components of autonomous MAVs. Possible solutions are explored with goal of enabling MAVs to reliably operate autonomously in urban environments.

AB To achieve the widespread diffusion of autonomous electric buses (AEBs) and thus harness their environmental potential, a broad acceptance of new technology-based mobility concepts must be fostered. Still, there remains little known about the factors determining their acceptance, especially in the combination of vehicles with alternative fuels and autonomous driving modes, as is the case with AEBs. In this study, we first conducted qualitative research to identify relevant factors influencing individual acceptance of autonomously driven electric buses. We then developed a comprehensive research model that was validated through a survey of 268 passengers of an AEB, operated in regular road traffic in Germany. The results indicate that a mix of individual factors, social impacts, and system characteristics determine an individual's acceptance of AEBs. Notably, it is important that users perceive AEBs, not only as advantageous, but also trustworthy, enjoyable, and in a positive social light. Our research supplements the existing corpora by demonstrating the importance of individual acceptance and incorporating it to derive policy implications.

   complementarity problem (LCP); path tracking
AB Model-predictive control (MPC) offers significant advantages in addressing constraint-related challenges and plays a pivotal role in self-driving car technology. Its primary goal is to achieve precise trajectory tracking while prioritizing vehicle stability and safety. However, real-time operations often face challenges related to computational demands and low computational efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel lateral control algorithm for self-driving vehicles, which utilizes the linear complementarity problem (LCP) instead of the conventional quadratic programming (QP) method as the MPC optimization solution. This innovative approach incorporates the electric steering system into the vehicle dynamics model, allowing for precise torque regulation of the steering motor and enhancing control accuracy. The MPC algorithm adopts the LCP solution method to calculate control signals based on the vehicle's state, ensuring both rapid and stable vehicle control. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MPC algorithm, utilizing the LCP solution method, effectively addresses efficiency issues in the lateral motion of self-driving cars. This leads to improvements in both driving stability and real-time performance. Overall, this innovative approach lays a solid foundation for the practical implementation of self-driving cars.

AB Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) realizes efficient, intelligent control of vehicle acceleration, deceleration, and steering, through inter-vehicle communication and cooperative control. However, the close combination of the platoon makes it difficult for other vehicles to cut-in, which can lead to severe traffic jams on certain sections of the road. The control effect of the CACC depends on the platoon penetration rate, which is the percentage of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in the total number of platoon members. There is no quantitative control method for different penetration rates, and it is difficult to quantify the impact of CACC vehicles on traffic. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative CACC control method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). First, the altruism control and the quantitative control of the car-following strategy are realized by the virtual car-following distance method to reduce the exclusivity of the CACC platoon or improve the road utilization efficiency. Second, a more appropriate platoon reward function and collision avoidance method are proposed. Finally, the Car Learning to Act (CARLA) simulator is used. The obtained results confirm that the CACC control of CAVs based on DRL can absorb speed oscillation and improve fuel economy.

AB It is very necessary for an intelligent heavy truck to have the ability to prevent rollover independently. However, it was rarely considered in intelligent vehicle motion planning. To improve rollover stability, a motion planning strategy with autonomous anti rollover ability for an intelligent heavy truck is put forward in this paper. Considering the influence of unsprung mass in the front axle and the rear axle and the body roll stiffness on vehicle rollover stability, a rollover dynamics model is built for the intelligent heavy truck. From the model, a novel rollover index is derived to evaluate vehicle rollover risk accurately, and a model predictive control algorithm is applicated to design the motion planning strategy for the intelligent heavy truck, which integrates the vehicle rollover stability, the artificial potential field for the obstacle avoidance, the path tracking and vehicle dynamics constrains. Then, the optimal path is obtained to meet the requirements that the intelligent heavy truck can avoid obstacles and drive stably without rollover. In addition, three typical scenarios are designed to numerically simulate the dynamic performance of the intelligent heavy truck. The results show that the proposed motion planning strategy can avoid collisions and improve vehicle rollover stability effectively even under the worst driving scenarios.

AB It is still a challenge to realize safe and fast autonomous driving through deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Most autonomous driving reinforcement learning models are subject to a single experience replay approach for training agents and how to improve the driving speed and safety of agents has become the focus of research. Therefore, we present an improved double-bias experience replay (DBER) approach, which enables the agent to choose its own driving learning tendency. A new loss function is proposed to ameliorate the relationship between negative loss and positive loss. The proposed approach has been applied to three algorithms to verify: deep Q network (DQN), dueling double DQN (DD-DQN), and quantile regression DQN (QR-DQN). Compared with the existing approaches, the proposed approach show better performance and robustness of driving policy on the driving simulator, which is implemented by the unity machine learning (ML) agents. The approach makes the vehicle agent obtain better performance, such as higher reward, faster driving speed, less lane changing, and more in the same training time.

AB The platooning of autonomous vehicles can significantly benefit road traffic. Most previous studies on platoon control have only focused on specific communication topologies, especially those with real eigenvalues. This paper extends existing studies on distributed platoon control to more generic topologies with complex eigenvalues, including both internal stability analysis and linear controller synthesis. Linear platoon dynamics are derived using an inverse vehicle model compensation, and graph theory is employed to model the communication topology, leading to an integrated high-dimension linear model of the closed-loop platoon dynamics. Using the similarity transformation, a sufficient and necessary condition is derived for the internal stability, which is completely defined in real number field. Then, we propose a Riccati inequality based algorithm to calculate the feasible static control gain. Further, disturbance propagation is formulated as an H-infinity performance, and the upper bound of spacing errors is explicitly derived using Lyapunov analysis. Numerical simulations with a nonlinear vehicle model validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

AB This paper focuses on the real-time trajectory planning problem for autonomous vehicles driving in realistic urban environments. To solve the complex navigation problem, we adopt a hierarchical motion planning framework. First, a rough reference path is extracted from the digital map using commands from the high-level behavioral planner. The conjugate gradient nonlinear optimization algorithm and the cubic B-spline curve are employed to smoothen and interpolate the reference path sequentially. To follow the refined reference path as well as handle both static and moving objects, the trajectory planning task is decoupled into lateral and longitudinal planning problems within the curvilinear coordinate framework. A rich set of kinematically feasible path candidates are generated to deal with the dynamic traffic both deliberatively and reactively. In the meanwhile, the velocity profile generation is performed to improve driving safety and comfort. After that, the generated trajectories are carefully evaluated by an objective function, which combines behavioral decisions by reasoning about the traffic situations. The optimal collision-free, smooth, and dynamically feasible trajectory is selected and transformed into commands executed by the low-level lateral and longitudinal controllers. Field experiments have been carried out with our test autonomous vehicle on the realistic inner-city roads. The experimental results demonstrated capabilities and effectiveness of the proposed trajectory planning framework and algorithms to safely handle a variety of typical driving scenarios, such as static and moving objects avoidance, lane keeping, and vehicle following, while respecting the traffic rules.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are a significant part of Vehicular Adhoc NETwork (VANET) as they increase transportation accessibility. However, the presence of unpredictably sized potholes on road surfaces hampers the comfort and safety of autonomous navigation. Existing pothole avoidance mechanisms cannot dynamically adapt in unpredictable environments and do not comfort the traveler well in VANET. This paper proposes a novel Smart Pothole-Avoidance Strategy (SPAS) for safe navigation in a pothole-intensive environment. Potholes are avoided using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm as it performs best in continuous action space tasks and has a faster convergence speed. A Hybrid Recognition Model using the Speech and Gesture mechanism (HRM-SG) is proposed in this paper to collect the traveler's real-time audio and visual feedback for the DDPG reward function. The received feedback aids in fine-tuning the model to avoid the pothole efficiently than the previous pothole. Traveler's feedback is coupled with the vehicle's sensor data and used to decide the time, speed, and angle at which lane change and speed change are executed. Finally, the SPAS continuously optimizes lane change parameters in VANET to achieve maximal traveler comfort during the operation. The result analysis indicates that SPAS achieves a 10-15% improvement in the accuracy of pothole avoidance, 10-12% higher comfort, and 8-10% faster convergence than the existing state-of-the-art techniques.

AB Model predictive control (MPC) is widely used in the motion control of autonomous vehicles. However, the conventional MPC relies on an accurate model and cannot achieve offset-free tracking in steady-state when the autonomous vehicle encounters external disturbance and parameter perturbation. Based on our recently designed C++ offset-free MPC (OF-MPC) solver, this paper uses MPC to solve the longitudinal and lateral coupling control problem directly. In the modeling stage, the constraints of the tire friction circle are approximated by the polygon. And then the polygon constraints are mapped into the state and control space. Finally, the tire friction circle constraints are approximated as convex linear inequality constraints, which are used as the vehicle stability boundary condition. Meanwhile, a convex optimization method is used to solve the reference value problem of MPC, and a systematic method that can prevent the reference value from being outside the feasible region is proposed. The real-time simulation and actual vehicle results show that the algorithm can solve both lateral and longitudinal disturbances problems. The algorithm achieves better tracking accuracy and high-speed stability due to consideration of the longitudinal and lateral coupling constraints. Benefiting from the proposed efficient solver, the average time to complete all calculations, including logic processing and input-output processing, is only about 5ms when the horizon length is 50.

AB Robotics is a part of today's communication that makes human life simpler in the day-to-day aspect. Therefore, we are supporting this cause by making a smart city project that is based on Artificial Intelligence, image processing, and some touch of hardware such as robotics. In particular, we advocate a self automation device (i.e., autonomous car) that performs actions and takes choices on its very own intelligence with the assist of sensors. Sensors are key additives for developing and upgrading all forms of self-sustaining cars considering they could offer the information required to understand the encircling surroundings and consequently resource the decision-making process. In our device, we used Ultrasonic and Camera Sensor to make the device self-sustaining and assist it to discover and apprehend the objects. As we recognize that the destiny is shifting closer to the Autonomous vehicles that are the destiny clever vehicles predicted to be driver-less, efficient, and crash-fending off best city vehicles of the destiny. Thus, the proposed device could be capable of stumbling on the item/object for easy and green running to keep away from crash and collisions. It could additionally be capable of calculating the gap of the item/object from the autonomous car and making the corresponding decisions. Furthermore, the device can be tracked-able by sending the location continuously to the mobile device through IOT using GPS and Wi-Fi Module. Interestingly. Additionally, the device is also controlled with the voice using Bluetooth.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) show promise for increasing roadway safety and capacity. During the AV transition era, which will be characterized by a mixed fleet of AVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), it is expected that the allure of these prospective benefits will motivate road agencies to allocate AV-dedicated lanes. This paper proposes a sustainability-driven AV-dedicated lane and pricing policy (SALP) framework that addresses the three pillars of sustainable development-social, environmental, and economic. The framework is formulated as a bilevel problem where the upper-level model yields decisions on the timing, location, and quantity of AV-dedicated lanes and tolling levels to minimize total travel time, emissions, and electricity consumption costs (that is, the economic and environmental pillars). To alleviate potential inequity (the social pillar), two considerations are proposed: revenue neutrality to compensate for the increase in travel costs of travelers and an equity constraint to limit the exacerbation of HDV travel costs. At the lower level, travelers react to the decisions made at the upper level by choosing their vehicle types (AV vs. HDV) and routes. The SALP is solved using Genetic and Frank-Wolfe algorithms. The results of the numerical experiments suggest that the proposed SALP addresses all three pillars, as it yields significant reductions in total travel time, emissions, and electricity costs.

ID ORIENTEERING PROBLEM
AB This paper is focused on improving the self-awareness of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) Operating in unknown environments. A runtime estimation framework is introduced to derive energy usage and navigation performance metrics in the presence of external disturbances, such as slowly varying sea currents. These are calculated by a state-of-the-art nonlinear regression algorithm (LWPR) using measurements commonly available on-board modern AUVs without relying on external sensors or a priori knowledge about the environment. The proposed framework is validated on two vehicles, an IVER3 AUV and a Nessie VII AUV, in the context of real sea trials with no modification required for the AUVs or their missions. Derived metrics are used to estimate the feasibility of underwater missions employing the concept of probability of mission completion (PoMC). If environmental effects modify the vehicle's effectiveness, a mission plan update is performed. This is based on an energy-aware route optimization algorithm that is also introduced in the paper. This algorithm, known as energy-aware orienteering problem (EA-OP), shows a practical usage for the runtime metrics. It allows an AUV to optimize its navigation and to maximize its mission's outcome according to measured performances. Simulation results are also presented for inspection scenarios. These show average improvements of 5%-20% for the mission's outcome when using the proposed strategy in the presence of environmental disturbances.

AB Fleet sizing is critical for shared autonomous vehicle(SAV) fleet management to reduce maintenance costs and traffic congestions. As the passenger demands are dynamic, how to make the demand-aware dynamic ridesharing and calculate the fleet size is an important and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a minimum fleet sizing method called Fleet Sizing for demand-aware Dynamic Ridesharing (FSDR) to accurately determine the fleet size for ridesharing enabled SAV system. Specifically, the travel demands are first predicted by an ensemble method that takes account of temporal correlations between regions. Then a concept called demand utility is proposed to measure the travel demands when planning vehicle paths, and the ride-matching dispatches vehicles to high travel demand regions by maximizing the demand utility along the vehicle path. Based on the ride-matching result, the minimum fleet size is calculated based on a trip graph by the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm. FSDR is evaluated on two real GPS taxi trajectory datasets from Wuhan, China, and San Francisco, USA. The result validates that the proposed demand-aware ridesharing in FSDR can significantly reduce the fleet size compared to the existing ride-matching methods. Moreover, the result shows that by allowing ridesharing, the vehicle fleet size can be reduced by 30%.

TI NeuroTrajectory: A Neuroevolutionary Approach to Local State Trajectory
   Learning for Autonomous Vehicles
SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB Autonomous vehicles are controlled today either based on sequences of decoupled perception-planning-action operations, either based on End2End or deep reinforcement learning (DRL) systems. Current deep learning solutions for autonomous driving are subject to several limitations (e.g., they estimate driving actions through a direct mapping of sensors to actuators, or require complex reward shaping methods). Although the cost function used for training can aggregate multiple weighted objectives, the gradient descent step is computed by the backpropagation algorithm using a single-objective loss. To address these issues, we introduce NeuroTrajectory, which is a multiobjective neuroevolutionary approach to local state trajectory learning for autonomous driving, where the desired state trajectory of the ego-vehicle is estimated over a finite prediction horizon by a perception-planning deep neural network. In comparison to DRL methods, which predict optimal actions for the upcoming sampling time, we estimate a sequence of optimal states that can be used for motion control. We propose an approach which uses genetic algorithms for training a population of deep neural networks, where each network individual is evaluated based on a multi-objective fitness vector, with the purpose of establishing a so-called Pareto front of optimal deep neural networks. The performance of an individual is given by a fitness vector composed of three elements. Each element describes the vehicle's travel path, lateral velocity and longitudinal speed, respectively. The same network structure can be trained on synthetic, as well as on real-world data sequences. We have benchmarked our system against a baseline Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), as well as against an End2End supervised learning method.

AB This article presents an accurate driving algorithm for autonomous greenhouse sprayer navigation. Due to the geological complexity of ground inside the greenhouse, the sprayer requires a stable driving algorithm under non-uniformal road conditions. We designed a body frame with an optimal size for the narrow aisle in a greenhouse. The driving algorithm was carried by an automatic turning algorithm under no-rail circumstance to maximize the utilization of a greenhouse space. Also, in order to segregate the turning algorithm and the straight path navigation, a photo sensor was additionally installed on the vehicle to detect the beginning of a turning area. The driving algorithm consisted of two kinds of autonomous procedures, which are the guidance rail tracking and the turning without any rail. The experimental results proved a driving function with an optimal turning radius, and a stable tracking performance on an unpaved clay road It confirmed an increased slip rate of the vehicle's wheel on the off-road situations, under the influence of a reduced rail width and an increased driving speed Despite the severe driving conditions, the autonomous sprayer's driving motion proved a stable tracking performance.

AB Identifying emerging technologies has been of long-standing interest to many scholars and practitioners. Previous studies have introduced methods to capture the concept of emergence from bibliographic records, including the recently proposed Technology Emergence Indicator (Carley et al. 2018). This indicator method has shown to be applicable to various technological fields. However, the indicator uses a limited time window, which can overlook the potential long-term evolution of emerging technologies. Moreover, the existing method suffers from interpretability, because it can be difficult to understand the context in which identified emerging terms are used. In this paper, we propose an improved version of the Technology Emergence Indicator that addresses these issues. In doing so, we examine emerging topics within the field of autonomous vehicles technologies during the period of 1991-2018, guided by a proposition about the long-term diffusion of an emerging technology topic. The results show that different autonomous vehicle technology topics emerge during each of the three 10-year periods under analysis, including an initial period of understanding the surrounding environment and path planning, a second period marked by DARPA Grand Challenge motivated factors associated with the urban environment and communication technologies, and a third period relating to machine learning and object detection. This association with certain emerging technology topics in each decade is also characterized by different trajectories of continued or cyclical carryover across the decades. The results suggest a methodology that practitioners can use in examining research areas to understand which topics are likely to persist into the future.

ID COOPERATIVE PERCEPTION; ASSOCIATION; MAPS
AB Today, perception solutions for Automated Vehicles rely on sensors on board the vehicle, which are limited by the line of sight and occlusions caused by any other elements on the road. As an alternative, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications allow vehicles to cooperate and enhance their perception capabilities. Besides announcing its own presence and intentions, services such as Collective Perception (CPS) aim to share information about perceived objects as a high-level description. This work proposes a perception framework for fusing information from on-board sensors and data received via CPS messages (CPM). To that end, the environment is modeled using an occupancy grid where occupied, and free and uncertain space is considered. For each sensor, including V2X, independent grids are calculated from sensor measurements and uncertainties and then fused in terms of both occupancy and confidence. Moreover, the implementation of a Particle Filter allows the evolution of cell occupancy from one step to the next, allowing for object tracking. The proposed framework was validated on a set of experiments using real vehicles and infrastructure sensors for sensing static and dynamic objects. Results showed a good performance even under important uncertainties and delays, hence validating the viability of the proposed framework for Collective Perception.

DE Unmanned aerial vehicle; asset management; autonomy
AB In the years to come, large power grid operators will operate and maintain an ever-increasing asset base. New innovative solutions are needed to increase the quality and efficiency of asset management to avoid corresponding growth in resources and cost. To this end, autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide a range of possibilities. Here, we present a novel prototype solution for autonomous and remotely operated inspection missions with resident drones on electrical substations, comprising: (1) an autonomous drone with sense and avoid and robustness to harsh weather capability; (2) a drone hangar for remote operations; and (3) drone operations and data acquisition management software. Further, we discuss the possibilities and challenges that such a system offers and give an overview of requirements that are key to realizing the potential of drones for improved asset management. These requirements are based on years of operational experience with electrical substations combined with the lessons learned during the development and testing of our drone system. We also experimentally investigate safety distances between the drone and high-voltage infrastructure. We demonstrate the usefulness of our autonomous inspection solution through extensive field testing at one of Statnett's fully operational electrical substations.

AB The deep phreatic thermal explorer (DEPTHX) is an autonomous underwater vehicle designed to navigate an unexplored environment, generate high-resolution three-dimensional (3-D) maps, collect biological samples based on an autonomous sampling decision, and return to its origin. In the spring of 2007, DEPTHX was deployed in Zacaton, a deep (similar to 318 m), limestone, phreatic sinkhole (cenote) in northeastern Mexico. As DEPTHX descended, it generated a 3-D map based on the processing of range data from 54 onboard sonars. The vehicle collected water column samples and wall biomat samples throughout the depth profile of the cenote. Post-expedition sample analysis via comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed a wealth of microbial diversity. Traditional Sanger gene sequencing combined with a barcoded-amplicon pyrosequencing approach revealed novel, phylum-level lineages from the domains Bacteria and Archaea; in addition, several novel subphylum lineages were also identified. Overall, DEPTHX successfully navigated and mapped Zacaton, and collected biological samples based on an autonomous decision, which revealed novel microbial diversity in a previously unexplored environment.

AB Realizing human-like perception is a challenge in open driving scenarios due to corner cases and visual occlusions. To gather knowledge of rare and occluded instances, federated learning assisted connected autonomous vehicle (FLCAV) has been proposed, which leverages vehicular networks to establish federated deep neural networks (DNNs) from distributed data captured by vehicles and road sensors. Without the need of data aggregation, FLCAV helps preserve privacy while reducing communication costs compared with conventional centralized learning. However, it is challenging to determine the network resources and road sensor placements for multi-stage training with multi-modal datasets in multi-variant scenarios. This article presents networking and training frameworks for FLCAV perception. Multi-layer graph resource allocation and vehicle-road contrastive sensor placement are proposed to address the network management and sensor deployment problems, respectively. We also develop CarlaFLCAV, a software platform that implements the above system and methods. Experimental results confirm the superiority of the proposed techniques compared with various benchmarks.

AB Underwater Wireless Communication is a rapidly growing technology in the research domain. The researchers have been working towards the developments in underwater communication by investigating climatic changes, prediction of natural disasters, marine environment, monitoring aquatic life, oceanographic transmission, and data collection. The main objective of underwater communication is to achieve lossless, high transmission with the least power consumption. The Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are set up with remote instruments and sensors to enable the natural exploration of the resources in the undersea environment. This research article is based on the study of various modes of communication, architectures, and protocol layers involved in underwater communication. Furthermore, an underwater hybrid connection is established by opto-acoustic signals, and the overview of various performance characteristics, channel behaviors, and issues in the underwater scenario are investigated.

AB Radar and camera information fusion sensing methods are used to solve the inherent shortcomings of the single sensor in severe weather. Our fusion scheme uses radar as the main hardware and camera as the auxiliary hardware framework. At the same time, the Mahalanobis distance is used to match the observed values of the target sequence. Data fusion based on the joint probability function method. Moreover, the algorithm was tested using actual sensor data collected from a vehicle, performing real-time environment perception. The test results show that radar and camera fusion algorithms perform better than single sensor environmental perception in severe weather, which can effectively reduce the missed detection rate of autonomous vehicle environment perception in severe weather. The fusion algorithm improves the robustness of the environment perception system and provides accurate environment perception information for the decision-making system and control system of autonomous vehicles.

AB Collision imminent steering is an automotive active safety feature designed to perform an evasive lane change maneuver when a forward collision cannot be avoided by braking alone. Previous work developed a nonlinear one-level model predictive controller to perform such a maneuver in a straight highway environment and at high speeds. In this article, a new formulation is presented that extends this capability to curved roads. The formulation includes a drivable tube concept, within which the maneuver is allowed to push the vehicle to its limits of handling, but only if the controller deems it necessary. Numerical simulation results showcase aggressive lane change maneuvers on curved roads at high speeds, allowing for both inside and outside lane changes, as well as single and double lane change maneuvers in a shorter distance than braking.

AB Threat assessment during semiautonomous driving is used to determine when correcting a driver's input is required. Since current semiautonomous systems perform threat assessment by predicting a vehicle's future state while treating the driver's input as a disturbance, autonomous controller intervention is limited to a restricted regime. Improving vehicle safety demands threat assessment that occurs over longer prediction horizons wherein a driver cannot be treated as a malicious agent. In this paper, we describe a real-time semiautonomous system that utilizes empirical observations of a driver's pose to inform an autonomous controller that corrects a driver's input when possible in a safe manner. We measure the performance of our system using several metrics that evaluate the informativeness of the prediction and the utility of the intervention procedure. A multisubject driving experiment illustrates the usefulness, with respect to these metrics, of incorporating the driver's pose while designing a semiautonomous system.

AB This paper presents a cooperative control strategy for a team of aerial robotic vehicles to establish wireless airborne communication networks between distributed heterogeneous vehicles. Each aerial robot serves as a flying mobile sensor performing a reconfigurable communication relay node which enabls communication networks with static or slow-moving nodes on gorund or ocean. For distributed optimal deployment of the aerial vehicles for communication networks, an adaptive hill-climbing type decentralized control algorithm is developed to seek out local extremum for optimal localization of the vehicles. The sensor networks estabilished by the decentralized cooperative control approach can adopt its configuraiton in response to signal strength as the function of the relative distance between the autonomous aerial robots and distributed sensor nodes in the sensed environment. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed decentralized cooperative control technique for robust communication networks.

SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

DT Article
AB CajunBot, an autonomous ground vehicle and a finalist in the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge, is built on the chassis of MAX IV, a six-wheeled all-terrain vehicle (ATV). Transformation of the ATV to an autonomous ground vehicle required adding drive-by-wire control, lidar sensors, an inertial navigation system (INS), and a computing system. Significant innovations in the core computational algorithms include an obstacle detection algorithm that takes advantage of shocks and bumps to improve visibility; a path planning algorithm that takes into account the vehicle's maneuverability limits to generate paths that are navigable at high speed; efficient data structures and algorithms that require just a single Intel Pentium 4 HT 3.2 GHz machine to handle all computations and a middleware layer that transparently distributes the computation to multiple machines, if desired. In addition, CajunBot also features support technologies, such as a simulator, playback of logged data, and live visualization on off-board computers to aid in development, testing, and debugging.

AB This paper deals with the complex problem of controlling and coordinating Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGV) by a decentralized approach. Each AGV selects its route by a consensus algorithm based on some Integer Linear Programming problem solutions. Moreover, the AGVs move inside a zone-controlled guidepath network and coordinate their movements by a decentralized protocol based on a zone-controlled approach, which guarantees the avoidance of deadlocks and collisions. The proposed decentralized strategy is applied to a guidepath network by means of a simulation software. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With a view toward enhancing pest control and achieving organic requirements in wine industry, development of a prototypical autonomous vehicle that automatically applies a band barrier on grapevine is detailed in this paper. A novel band wrapper mechanism is proposed in this work. The band wrapper serving as the carrier for pest control is applied by the vehicle's six degree-of-freedom articulator real-time controlled through classical inverse kinematics. It is found in the laboratory that the automated band wrapper robot can successfully detect a rod-like object and optimally place the band wrapper on the desired location for pest control.

AB The autonomous truck-mounted attenuator (ATMA) system is a lead-follower vehicle system based on autonomous driving and connected vehicle technologies. The lead truck performs maintenance tasks on the road, and the unmanned follower truck alerts passing vehicles about the moving work zone and protects workers and the equipment. While the ATMA has been under testing by transportation maintenance and operations agencies recently, a simulator-based testing capability is a supplement, especially if human subjects are involved. This paper aims to discover how passing drivers perceive, understand, and react to the ATMA system in road maintenance. With the driving simulator developed for this ATMA study, the paper performed a simulation study wherein a screen-based eye tracker collected 16 subjects' gaze points and pupil diameters. Data analysis evidenced the change in subjects' visual attention patterns while passing the ATMA. On average, the ATMA starts to attract subjects' attention from 500 ft behind the follower truck. Most (87.50%) understood the follower truck's protection purpose, and many (60%) reasoned the association between the two trucks. Nevertheless, nearly half of the participants (43.75%) did not recognize that the ATMA is a connected autonomous vehicle system. While all subjects safely changed lanes and attempted to pass the slow-moving ATMA, their inadequate understanding of the ATMA is a potential risk, for issues such as cutting into the ATMA. The results implied that transportation maintenance and operations agencies should consider this in establishing the deployment guidance.

The infrared positioning result is accurate only when the number of valid infrared receivers is more than three. An infrared receiver easily becomes invalid if it does not receive light from the infrared emitter due to indoor occlusions. This study proposes an occlusion-aware path planner that enables an autonomous vehicle to navigate toward the occlusion-free part of the drivable area. The planner consists of four layers. In layer one, a homotopic A* path is searched for in the 2D grid map to roughly connect the initial and goal points. In layer two, a curvature-continuous reference line is planned close to the A* path using numerical optimal control. In layer three, a Frenet frame is constructed along the reference line, followed by a search for an occlusion-aware path within that frame via dynamic programming. In layer four, a curvature-continuous path is optimized via quadratic programming within the Frenet frame. A path planned within the Frenet frame may violate the curvature bounds in a real-world Cartesian frame; thus, layer four is implemented through trial and error. Simulation results in CarSim software show that the derived paths reduce the poor positioning risk and are easily tracked by a controller.

AB This paper presents the design of a light-weight, compliant end-effector and an image processing strategy that together enable the Interacting-BoomCopter (I-BC) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to perform an autonomous door-opening task. Autonomy is achieved through the use of feedback from an onboard camera for door detection & localization, and embedded force and distance sensors in the end-effector for detecting the physical interaction with the door. The results of several experimental flight tests are presented in which the end-effector and image processing strategy were deployed on the I-BC to successfully open a small enclosure door autonomously.

AB Coordinated swarm behavior in certain types of animals can also occur in groups of autonomous vehicles. Swarm "cohesiveness" is characterized as a stability property. Conditions for one-dimensional asynchronous swarms to achieve collision-free convergence even in the presence of sensing delays and asynchronism during movements are provided. Each finite-size swarm member has proximity sensors and neighbor position sensors that only provide delayed position information. Such stability analysis is of fundamental importance if one wants to understand the coordination mechanisms for "platoons" of autonomous vehicles, where intermember communication channels are less than perfect and collisions must be avoided.

AB Ensuring that a vehicle can obtain its real location in a high-precision prebuilt map is one of the most important tasks of the Autonomous Internet of Vehicles (AIoV). In this work, we show that the resampling of the particle filter (PF) algorithm is optimized by using the prior information of particles that shift real localizations to improve vehicle localization accuracy without changing the existing PF process, i.e., the particle shift filter (PSF). The number of particles is critical to their convergence efficiency. We perform quantitative and qualitative analyses of how to improve particle localization accuracy while ensuring timeliness, without increasing the number of particles. Moreover, the cumulative error of the particles increases with time, and the localization accuracy and robustness decrease. Our findings show that the initial particle density is 159 particles/m(3), and the cumulative variance of the PSF particles is improved by 27%, 29%, and 82% at the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively, under the same conditions as the PF algorithm, while the calculation time only increases by 10.6%. Moreover, the cumulative mean error is reduced by 0.74 m, 0.88 m, and 0.68 m at the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively, indicating that the localization error of the PSF changes less with time. All experiments were performed using open-source software and datasets.

AB The emergence of biorobotic autonomous undersea vehicle (AUV) as a focus for discipline-integrated research in the context of underwater propulsion and maneuvering is considered within the confines of the Biorobotics Program in the Office of Naval Research. The significant advances in three disciplines, namely the biology-inspired high-lift unsteady hydrodynamics, artificial muscle technology and neuroscience-based control, are discussed in an effort to integrate them into viable products. The understanding of the mechanismis of delayed stall, molecular design of artificial muscles and the neural approaches to the actuation of control surfaces is reviewed in the context of devices based on the pectoral fins of fish, while remaining focused on their integrated implementation in biorobotic AUVs. A mechanistic understanding of the balance between cruising and maneuvering in swimming animals and undersea vehicles is given. All aquatic platforms, in both nature and engineering, except during short duration burst speeds that are observed in a few species, appear to lie within the condition where their natural period of oscillation equals the time taken by them to travel the distance of their own lengths. Progress in the development of small underwater experimental biorobotic vehicles is considered where the three aforementioned disciplines are integrated into one novel maneuvering device or propulsor. The potential in maneuvering and silencing is discussed.

AB The complexity of the environment makes rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) difficult to handle dynamic obstacle avoidance and system constraint in real-time path planning for autonomous vehicles. To handle this issue, this paper proposes a novel real-time double-tree rapidly-exploring random tree (RDT-RRT) algorithm framework. The collision-free path by RRT after B-spline smooth treatment is adopted as the reference path to reduce invalid sampling. Integrating G1 Hermite interpolation with G2 Hermite interpolation reduces the sampling dimension and takes more efficient samples. The optimal distance metric is designed considering dynamic collision detection mechanism and utilized to estimate the costs of the samples in terms of path curvature. Moreover, to have a better understanding of the environment, convolutional neural network (CNN) is embedded to strengthen the collision detection mechanism. By RDT-RRT the smooth, collision-free paths with small cur-vature changes can be evaluated. For the evaluations of our proposal in global and local planning, the experi-ments for a real scaled autonomous vehicle are implemented through parallel computing. By comparing with the mainstream RRT-based algorithms, it has shown that in terms of the path quality, our method reduces 92 % and 88 % of cumulative curvature change respectively in obstacle-free and static obstacle scenarios. Compared with other RRT methods, RDT-RRT performs faster convergence rate and Parallel computing increases the updating frequency from 1.1 Hz to 5.5 Hz. The obstacle avoidance capabilities are also improved.

AB The inventory inspection using autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is beneficial in terms of cost, time, and safety of human workers. However, in typical warehouses, it is very challenging for the autonomous UAVs to do inventory task motions safely because aisles are narrow and long, and the illumination is poor. Prior autonomous UAVs are not suitable for such environments, since they suffer from either localization methods prone to disturbance, drift and outliers, or expensive sensors. We present a low-cost sensing system with an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based multi-sensor fusion framework to achieve practical autonomous navigation of UAVs in warehouse environments. To overcome the inherent drift, outliers, and disturbance problems of naive UAV localization methods, we suggest 1) exploiting component test of Mahalanobis norm to reject outliers efficiently, 2) introducing pseudo-covariance to incorporate a visual SLAM algorithm, and 3) recognizing floor lanes to get absolute information-as robust data fusion methods. Exemplar results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods. The proposed system has been successfully implemented for diverse cyclic inventory inspection tasks in a materials warehouse.

AB Autonomous driving is experiencing rapid development. A lane-level map is essential for autonomous driving, and a lane-level road network is a fundamental part of a lane-level map. A large amount of research has been performed on lane-level road network generation based on various on-board systems. However, there is a lack of analysis and summaries with regards to previous work. This paper presents an overview of lane-level road network generation techniques for the lane-level maps of autonomous vehicles with on-board systems, including the representation and generation of lane-level road networks. First, sensors for lane-level road network data collection are discussed. Then, an overview of the lane-level road geometry extraction methods and mathematical modeling of a lane-level road network is presented. The methodologies, advantages, limitations, and summaries of the two parts are analyzed individually. Next, the classic logic formats of a lane-level road network are discussed. Finally, the survey summarizes the results of the review.

AB We propose the use of a second-order sliding-mode controller (2-SMC) to stabilize an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) which is subject to modeling errors and often suffers from unknown environmental disturbances. The 2-SMC is effective in compensating for the uncertainties in the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic parameters of the vehicle and rejecting the unpredictable disturbance effects due to ocean waves, tides, and currents. The 2-SMC is comprised of an equivalent controller and a switching controller to suppress the parameter uncertainties and external disturbances, and its closed-loop system is exponentially stable in the presence of parameter uncertainties and unknown disturbances. We performed numerical simulations to validate the proposed control approach, and experimental tests using Cyclops AUV were conducted to demonstrate its practical feasibility. The proposed controller increased the accuracy of trajectory tracking for an AUV in the presence of uncertain hydrodynamics and unknown disturbances.

AB The emerging autonomous electric vehicles have facilitated the implementation of the shared autonomous electric vehicle (SAEV) service. In real-life applications, the operations of SAEVs may be affected by various uncertain factors, such as uncertain travel time caused by traffic congestion and uncertain service time caused by unpredictable customer delay. It is essential to consider uncertain factors to design conservative and robust routes for SAEVs. In this paper, we study a routing optimization problem of SAEVs, where the charging schedules, uncertain travel time, and uncertain service time are considered. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total operational cost that consists of fixed cost and travel cost of SAEVs. A branch and-price algorithm is developed to solve the problem. Specifically, a tailored label setting algorithm is introduced to identify the robust feasible routes with accessible charging schedules for the pricing subproblem. The proposed algorithm is tested on a set of generated instances. The computational results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the commercial solver CPLEX in terms of both solution quality and computational time. Besides, based on the sensitivity analyses, we show the impact of the budgets of uncertainty, maximum deviations of uncertain parameters, battery capacity, fixed cost, and charging speed on the SAEV service. This work can also provide inspirations of both models and algorithms for many other application areas, such as urban logistics.

AB In this work, the trajectory tracking problem of an autonomous racing electrical vehicle is addressed. Accordingly, a two-layer control scheme is developed, such that stability, recursive feasibility, and constraint satisfaction are guaranteed. The outer layer includes a zonotopic tube-based predictive control to ensure trajectory tracking while minimizing energy consumption considering the state of charge of the vehicle's battery. Meanwhile, the inner layer combines a linear quadratic zonotopic controller with a zonotopic Kalman filter to reduce the effect of exogenous disturbances and modeling errors. Moreover, for control and estimation purposes, a data-driven Takagi-Sugeno (TS) model trained by an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is employed. To illustrate the performance of the proposed control scheme, a simulated 1/10 Scale RC car is used.

AB Innovative testing and validation methods are prerequisites concerning Connected, Cooperative, and Automated Mobility (CCAM), as the high number of cooperating participants and concurrent processes critically increase the probability of adverse safety and security incidents. The proposed new approaches deal with this increasing complexity of not currently having generally accepted validation mechanisms. The paper introduces a novel, mathematical model based, scenario identification methodology, facilitating the selection of critical road vehicle traffic scenarios, taking into account different testing objectives, such as maximizing the safety risk of the analyzed system. The presented results verify that applying specific decision models and quantifiable indicators related to the system elements of highly automated mobility systems can significantly contribute to the systematic identification of unsafe corner cases in connected and cooperative autonomous systems.

AB In order to be able to successfully navigate autonomously, a vehicle needs to have an understanding of the local world. It must understand where it is safe to drive, and be able to recognize static and moving objects. It must also be able to relate this understanding to the desired route plan, so that progress may be made in the most sensible way. This paper describes an attempt to bridge the large gap between making sparse three-dimensional measurements of static scene structure, and achieving a useful level of understanding of that structure. In particular, it addresses the need to know where in the scene it is safe to drive. The system described in this paper is known as ALTRUlSM-Automatic Local Three-dimensional Representation Using Image-based Scene Measurements. It is complementary to the ASSET system presented recently in this journal, which defects and tracks moving obstacles from a moving vehicle.

DT Article
DE Two-dimensional; Stochasticity propagation; Mixed autonomous vehicles
   (AV); Capacity adjustment factor (CAF)
ID MODEL; STABILITY
AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are revolutionizing the transportation system and necessitating a reevaluation of infrastructure capacity. Apart from their shorter headway, AVs exhibit distinct behavioral characteristics compared to human-driven vehicles (HDVs) in two key aspects: (1) significantly reduced noise levels, and (2) diminished bidirectional lateral influence. Unlike HDVs, AVs maintain closer alignment at the lane middle line and are not subject to the influence of the lateral wandering of neighboring vehicles. This is attributed to their remarkable ability to accurately predict HDV behavior. As the market penetration rate (MPR) of AVs increases, the interaction patterns of HDV flow between adjacent lanes, which traditionally lead to lateral friction and capacity loss, undergo gradual transformation. The current evaluation of capacity and adjustment factors (CAFs) based on theoretical models or simulation packages may overlook the stochastic lateral friction exhibited by mixed AV flow, resulting in potentially biased results. In this study, we develop a two-dimensional stochastic model that captures the random lateral dynamics and investigate the capacity and adjustment factors for multilane mixed AV flow. The findings demonstrate that the model effectively reproduces the lateral friction phenomenon, and as the number of lanes increases, the capacity experiences a decline of up to 20% due to lateral interactions. Moreover, the study clarifies the impact of dedicated lane assignment on the total capacity, as it hinders the propagation of lateral friction.

AB Effective ocean management requires integrated and sustainable ocean observing systems enabling us to map and understand ecosystem properties and the effects of human activities. Autonomous subsurface and surface vehicles, here collectively referred to as "gliders ", are part of such ocean observing systems providing high spatiotemporal resolution. In this paper, we present some of the results achieved through the project "Unmanned ocean vehicles, a flexible and cost-efficient offshore monitoring and data management approach-GLIDER ". In this project, three autonomous surface and underwater vehicles were deployed along the Lofoten-Vesteralen (LoVe) shelf-slope-oceanic system, in Arctic Norway. The aim of this effort was to test whether gliders equipped with novel sensors could effectively perform ecosystem surveys by recording physical, biogeochemical, and biological data simultaneously. From March to September 2018, a period of high biological activity in the area, the gliders were able to record a set of environmental parameters, including temperature, salinity, and oxygen, map the spatiotemporal distribution of zooplankton, and record cetacean vocalizations and anthropogenic noise. A subset of these parameters was effectively employed in near-real-time data assimilative ocean circulation models, improving their local predictive skills. The results presented here demonstrate that autonomous gliders can be effective long-term, remote, noninvasive ecosystem monitoring and research platforms capable of operating in high-latitude marine ecosystems. Accordingly, these platforms can record high-quality baseline environmental data in areas where extractive activities are planned and provide much-needed information for operational and management purposes.

AB Around 90% of accidents stem from human error. Disruptive technology, especially automated vehicles (AVs), can respond to the problems by, for instance, eradicating human error when driving, thus increasing energy efficiency due to the platoon effect, and potentially giving more space to human activities by decreasing parking space; hence, with the introduction of the autonomous vehicle, the public attitude towards its adoption needs to be understood to develop appropriate strategies and policies to leverage the potential benefits. There is a lack of a systematic and comprehensive literature review on adoption attitudes toward AVs that considers various interlinked factors such as road traffic environment changes, AV transition, and policy impacts. This study aims to synthesize past research regarding public acceptance attitude toward AVs. More specifically, the study investigates driverless technology and uncertainty, road traffic environment changes, policy impact, and findings from AV adoption modelling approaches, to understand public attitudes towards AVs. The study points out critical problems and future directions for analysis of AV impacts, such as the uncertainty on AVs adoption experiment, policy implementation and action plans, the uncertainty of AV-related infrastructure, and demand modelling.

AB This study investigates collaborative route mapping for a collection of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) traversing multi-lane pathways, with a particular emphasis on intersections without traffic signals. A distinctive feature of our research is the prioritization of emergency vehicles, such as ambulances and fire engines, according to their velocity demands. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis of the ethical ramifications of implementing such a prioritised system is engaged, while it is notable that in most of the existing studies, the ethical evaluation of intelligent transportation modalities is neglected. From a technical aspect, trajectories for CAVs in current models tend to be either inflexible or congruent with the collective formation of the fleet. Concurrently, the pre-set velocities for CAVs frequently demonstrate a lack of adaptability, which impedes cohesive operation. Moreover, there exists a pronounced deficiency in catering to the prioritization needs of emergency vehicles within these models. The current research endeavours to address these shortcomings by formulating the intersection management as an optimal control problem (OCP). This formulation enables CAVs to modulate their velocities in response to practical objectives, sidestepping fixed lane regulations at junctions. The control framework also encompasses autonomous vehicles of diverse sizes and velocities. An Adaptive Stepwise Optimization (ASO) methodology is proposed to augment the efficacy of the OCP resolution.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles localization and navigation are challenging due to the lack of Global Positioning System underwater: alternative techniques have then to be used in order to measure the position of the vehicle. To this aim, sensor fusion methods based on acoustic positioning systems are often exploited. This article faces the study and the improvement of the localization of an underwater target through an ultra short baseline-aided buoy built by the Mechatronics and Dynamic Modelling Laboratory of the University of Florence. Such a buoy relies on an ultra short baseline device for the localization and is aided by a proper sensor set in order to compensate variations in its pose. First, a study of the underwater localization based on the ultra short baseline technique is provided. The measurement errors entailed by the buoy motion are then analyzed and preliminarily compensated, exploiting linear least squares methods. Subsequently, filtering techniques are considered with the aim to further increase the accuracy of the ultra short baseline measurements. Due to the nonlinearities of the sensors characteristics, extended Kalman filter has been used, with different models for stationary and moving targets. The solutions proposed have been validated through experimental tests conducted with MArine Robotic Tool for Archaeology autonomous underwater vehicles built by the Mechatronics and Dynamic Modelling Laboratory. The results evidence an improved vehicle localization, suggesting interesting future developments concerning both mechanical and computational solutions.

AB Eco-driving is a term used to refer to a strategy for operating vehicles so as to minimize energy consumption. Without any hardware changes, eco-driving is an effective approach to improving vehicle efficiency by optimizing driving behavior, particularly for autonomous vehicles. Several approaches have been proposed for eco-driving, such as dynamic programming, Pontryagin's minimum principle, and model predictive control; how-ever, it is difficult to control the speed of the vehicle optimally in various driving situations. This study aims to derive an eco-driving strategy for reducing the energy consumption of a vehicle in diverse driving situations, including road slopes and car-following scenarios. A reinforcement learning-based energy efficient speed planning strategy is proposed for autonomous electric vehicles, which learn an optimal control policy through a data-driven learning process. A model-based reinforcement learning algorithm is developed for the eco-driving strategy; based on domain knowledge of the vehicle powertrain, a battery energy consumption model and longitudinal dynamics model of the vehicle are approximated from the driving data and are used for reinforcement learning. The proposed algorithm is tested using a vehicle simulation, and is compared to a global optimal solution obtained using an exact dynamic programming method. The simulation results show that the reinforcement learning algorithm can adjust the speed of the vehicle by considering driving conditions such as the road slope and a safe distance from the leading vehicle while minimizing energy consumption. The reinforcement learning algorithm achieves a near-optimal performance of 93.8% relative to the dynamic programming result.

AB Aerial images obtained from autonomous aerial vehicles have lots of small and densely distributed objects because of the capture distance. This paper proposes a deep neural network architecture and training/inference techniques for robust detection of objects in the aerial images. Based on cascade R-CNN, the proposed model adopts the recursive feature pyramid and switchable atrous convolution for robust detection of dense objects. A patch-level division and multi-scale inference techniques are applied to effectively detect small objects. The results show that the proposed approach achieves the highest performance on the VisDrone test-dev dataset, in the official ECCV VisDrone2020-DET challenge.

ID SYSTEMS
AB This paper presents an on-board architecture designed to enable an unmanned aerial vehicle to carry out an observation mission autonomously. The management performed by the architecture relates to the objectives of the mission. The response time to an external event does not need to be strictly defined: the architecture behaves like a soft real-time system. The mission of the vehicle is to observe several local areas in dynamic, partially known and unsafe environments. The vehicle must carry out an operation on each area while satisfying constraints related on the vehicle, the environment and the mission. The architecture contains a planning component, which computes the optimal sequence for the observation of the mission areas. The situation becomes degraded when the execution of the initial plan is no longer possible. The architecture makes it possible to react to these degraded situations; the calculation of a new plan takes into account the new constraints. The core of the architecture is an execution controller used in this application to specify the vehicle behaviour in the nominal and degraded situations and to manage the course of the mission. This tool is based on a Petri net formalism. The feasibility and the effectiveness of the architecture are checked by simulation with a simplified model of an aerial vehicle. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS.

To negate the PSO's inherent weakness in dynamic environments, a neighbourhood scheme is proposed that not only enables the efficient interception of targets several times faster than the UAVs but also facilitates the maintenance of effective airspace coverage. Empirical results suggest that these techniques may indeed be of use in autonomous navigation systems for UAVs in air defence roles.

AB In this study, we develop a stochastic dynamic network loading (DNL) model for the mixed traffic with autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs). The source of stochasticity is the uncertainty inherent in the arrival process of the two classes of vehicular flow. The developed model captures both within-link and between-link traffic flow dependencies and evaluates the network state distribution in an analytical manner. The model has two main components, a probabilistic link model and a probabilistic node model. The link model is a stochastic formulation of the link transmission model (LTM), which captures the boundary conditions of a link and approximates the evolution of link state distribution. The node model, on the other hand, characterizes the flow transmissions across a network node. It reflects the between-link dependency by evaluating the expected transmission flow through an iterative algorithm, with an explicit consideration of the interactions between supply and demand constraints associated with a node. The developed model is validated versus replicated running of the deterministic LTM as well as microscopic traffic simulations, and the results reveal that it yields relatively accurate estimations. We also present two applications of the proposed model, including a traffic signal control problem and a class-based ramp metering problem, to demonstrate its practical value.

AB Although manufacturers and experts consider autonomous vehicles (AVs) as a much safer alter -native than traditional human-driven vehicles, the lack of trust and high perceived risk by po-tential users can be a major obstacle to their acceptance. While both risk and trust have been the focus of interest for AV researchers, studies have often produced contradictory results. This study offers a new perspective to investigate the effect of trust and perceived risk to resolve these ambiguities. We identified three underlying dimensions of trust supplemented by two dimensions of risk and incorporated them into one model. The proposed model offers direct and indirect paths between trust dimensions and AV acceptance with the mediation of the dimensions of perceived risk. Based on a survey of 949 adult respondents, the model was tested with structural equation modeling (SEM). Results revealed that only performance trust affected directly intention to use AVs, while trust in manufacturers influenced intention to use with the mediation of privacy risk. An important result is that trust in institutions that can influence future rules and regulations for the use of AVs has no impact either directly or indirectly on intention to use. The practical im-plications can assist regulators and manufacturers to increase their efforts to build trust and confidence, thus enhancing the adoption of this technology.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are inevitably entering our lives with potential benefits for improved traffic safety, mobility, and accessibility. However, AVs' benefits also introduce a serious potential challenge, in the form of complex interactions with human-driven vehicles (HVs). The emergence of AVs introduces uncertainty in the behavior of human actors and in the impact of the AV manufacturer on autonomous driving design. This paper thus aims to investigate how AVs affect road safety and to design socially optimal liability rules in comparative negligence for AVs and human drivers. A unified game is developed, including a Nash game between human drivers, a Stackelberg game between the AV manufacturer and HVs, and a Stackelberg game between the lawmaker and other users. We also establish the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium of the game. The game is then simulated with numerical examples to investigate the emergence of human drivers' moral hazard, the AV manufacturer's role in traffic safety, and the lawmaker's role in liability design. Our findings demonstrate that human drivers could develop moral hazard if they perceive their road environment has become safer and an optimal liability rule design is crucial to improve social welfare with advanced transportation technologies. More generally, the game-theoretic model developed in this paper provides an analytical tool to assist policy-makers in AV policymaking and hopefully mitigate uncertainty in the existing regulation landscape about AV technologies.

   Cognitive control architectures; On-board decision-making
AB Advanced ocean systems are increasing their capabilities and the degree of autonomy more and more in order to perform more sophisticated maritime missions. Remotely operated vehicles are no longer cost-effective since they are limited by economic support costs, and the presence and skills of the human operator. Alternatively, autonomous surface and underwater vehicles have the potential to operate with greatly reduced overhead costs and level of operator intervention. This paper proposes an Intelligent Control Architecture (ICA) to enable multiple collaborating marine vehicles to autonomously carry out underwater intervention missions. The ICA is generic in nature but aimed at a case study where a marine surface craft and an underwater vehicle are required to work cooperatively. They are capable of cooperating autonomously towards the execution of complex activities since they have different but complementary capabilities. The architectural foundation to achieve the ICA lays on the flexibility of serviceoriented computing and agent technology. An ontological database captures the operator skills, platform capabilities and, changes in the environment. The information captured, stored as knowledge, enables reasoning agents to plan missions based on the current situation. The ICA implementation is verified and early validated in simulations by means of a team of two above autonomous marine robots. This paper also presents architectural details and evaluation scenarios of the ICA, results of simulations from different maritime operations, and future research directions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ID FRAMEWORK; FUSION
AB It is essential for autonomous vehicles at level 3 or higher to have the ability to predict the trajectories of surrounding vehicles to safely and effectively plan and drive along trajectories in complex traffic situations. However, predicting the future behavior of vehicles is a challenging issue because traffic vehicles each have different drivers with different driving tendencies and intentions and they interact with each other. This paper presents a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) encoder-decoder model that utilizes an attention mechanism that focuses on certain information to predict vehicles' trajectories. The proposed model was trained using the Highway Drone (HighD) dataset, which is a high-precision, large-scale traffic dataset. We also compared this model to previous studies. Our model effectively predicted future trajectories by using an attention mechanism to manage the importance of the driving flow of the target and adjacent vehicles and the target vehicle's dynamics in each driving situation. Furthermore, this study presents a method of linearizing the road geometry such that the trajectory prediction model can be used in a variety of road environments. We verified that the road geometry linearization mechanism can improve the trajectory prediction model's performance on various road environments in a virtual test-driving simulator constructed based on actual road data.

AB Sensors on autonomous vehicles have inherent physical constraints. To address these limitations, several studies have been conducted to enhance sensing capabilities by establishing wireless communication between infrastructure and autonomous vehicles. Various sensors are strategically positioned within the road infrastructure, providing essential sensory data to these vehicles. The primary challenge lies in sensor placement, as it necessitates identifying optimal locations that minimize blind spots while maximizing the sensor's coverage area. Therefore, to solve this problem, a method for positioning multiple sensor systems in road infrastructure is proposed. By introducing a voxel grid, the problem is formulated as an optimization challenge, and a genetic algorithm is employed to find a solution. Experimental findings using lidar sensors are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of this proposed approach.

AB Precise localization and autonomous docking at industrial standards are major issues to be handled in order to establish smart factories having end-user oriented production focus and to operate fully autonomous vehicles in the logistics of such factories. Therefore, in this paper, a precise localization algorithm utilizing the affine iterative closest point (ICP) method is proposed for logistic applications in manufacturing systems. In classical ICP, the least-squares criterion and the point-to-point metric are employed. In this study, however, correlation entropy (correntropy) criterion is used in order to provide robustness against noise and/or outliers. In addition, affine transformation is exploited to increase the flexibility of the developed algorithm and the point-to-line metric is put into use to perform pose estimation faster. The developed algorithm is suitable for logistic applications in smart factories, which involves reaching a target at industrial standards. On the other hand, this method can also be employed in some outdoor applications, for example, parking problems of autonomous vehicles. The improvements and performance gains achieved using this method are demonstrated in nine separate real-world cases. In the field tests, ITU-AGV, a robot operating system (ROS)-enabled differential drive mobile robotic platform, is deployed. The achieved results prove that it is possible to dock a vehicle used in logistics to a target with sub-centimeter precision.

AB Merging areas on freeways are primary locations for bottlenecks due to vehicles' mandatory lateral conflicts. These critical conflicts, however, are potentially avoidable with Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) technology. However, current literature using CAV technology mostly focuses on merging maneuvers between a single-lane mainline and an incoming ramp. An algorithm dealing with multilane merging areas is absent. In this paper, an online system control algorithm for multilane freeway merging areas is presented with a CAV environment based on optimizing vehicles' lane changing and car following trajectories. First, the lane flow distribution is adjusted upstream of the merging point under a rule-based lane changing decision, which eventually balances downstream lane flow distribution. A Cooperative Lane Changing Control (CLCC) optimization model is proposed to ensure safe and smooth lane changing execution. Second, a Cooperative Merging Control (CMC) model is adopted, analyzed, and generalized to conduct merging maneuvers around the merging point. Third, a dynamic moving border point method is designed to coordinate the consecutive execution of the CLCC and CMC models. To validate the proposed algorithm, a simulation platform based on VISSIM is developed for online computation and visualization. A typical two-lane freeway merging area is studied. Results under various demand scenarios demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms previous co-operative merging algorithms consistently with respect to delays and average travel speeds.

In this paper we propose, instead, to use a cognitive system that learns the intervention task from an expert operator through an intuitive learning by demonstration (LbD) algorithm. Taking as an input few operator demonstrations, the algorithm generalizes the task knowledge into a model and is able to control the vehicle and the manipulator simultaneously to reproduce the task, thus conferring a more adaptive behavior in front of the environment changes and allowing to easily transfer the knowledge of new tasks. A cognitive architecture has been implemented in order to integrate the LbD algorithm with the onboard sensors and actuators and to allow its interplay with the vehicle perception, control and navigation modules. To validate the full framework we present real experiments in a water tank using an AUV equipped with a four DoF manipulator. A human operator teaches the system to perform a valve turning intervention and we analyze the results of multiple task reproductions, including cases under the effect of water current perturbations, showing the success of the system in autonomously reproducing the task.

AB Currently autonomous or self-driving vehicles are at the heart of academia and industry research because of its multi-faceted advantages that includes improved safety, reduced congestion, lower emissions and greater mobility. Software is the key driving factor underpinning autonomy within which planning algorithms that are responsible for mission-critical decision making hold a significant position. While transporting passengers or goods from a given origin to a given destination, motion planning methods incorporate searching fora path to follow, avoiding obstacles and generating the best trajectory that ensures safety, comfort and efficiency. A range of different planning approaches have been proposed in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to review existing approaches and then compare and contrast different methods employed for the motion planning of autonomous on-road driving that consists of (1) finding a path, (2) searching for the safest manoeuvre and (3) determining the most feasible trajectory. Methods developed by researchers in each of these three levels exhibit varying levels of complexity and performance accuracy. This paper presentsz critical evaluation of each of these methods, in terms of their advantages/disadvantages, inherent limitations, feasibility, optimality, handling of obstacles and testing operational environments.
   Based on a critical review of existing methods, research challenges to address current limitations are identified and future research directions are suggested so as to enhance the performance of planning algorithms at all three levels. Some promising areas of future focus have been identified as the use of vehicular communications (V2V and V2I) and the incorporation of transport engineering aspects in order to improve the look-ahead horizon of current sensing technologies that are essential for planning with the aim of reducing the total cost of driverless vehicles. This critical review on planning techniques presented in this paper, along with the associated discussions on their constraints and limitations, seek to assist researchers in accelerating development in the emerging field of autonomous vehicle research.

TI CONTROL AND KINEMATIC DESIGN OF MULTI-DEGREE-OF-FREEDOM MOBILE ROBOTS
   WITH COMPLIANT LINKAGE
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) vehicles have many potential advantages over conventional (i.e., 2-DOF) vehicles.  For example, MDOF vehicles can travel sideways and they can negotiate tight turns more easily.  In addition, some MDOF designs provide better payload capability, better traction, and improved static and dynamic stability.  However, MDOF vehicles with more than three degrees-of-freedom are difficult to control because of their overconstrained nature.  These difficulties translate into severe wheel slippage or jerky motion under certain driving conditions.  These problems make it difficult to benefit  from the special motion capabilities of MDOF vehicles in autonomous or semi-autonomous mobile robot applications.  This is so because mobile robots (unlike automated guided vehicles) usually rely on dead-reckoning between periodic absolute position updates and their performance is diminished by excessive wheel slippage.
   This paper introduces compliant linkage, a new concept in the control and kinematic design of MDOF mobile robots.  As the name implies, compliant linkage provides compliance between the drive wheels or drive axles of a vehicle, to accommodate control errors which would otherwise cause wheel slippage.
   The concept of compliant linkage was implemented and tested on a 4-DOF vehicle built at the University of Michigan's Mobile Robotics Lab.  Experimental results show that control errors are effectively absorbed by the linkage, resulting in smooth and precise motion.  The dead-reckoning accuracy of the complaint linkage vehicle is substantially better than that reported in the literature for other MDOF vehicles; it was found equal to, or even better than that of comparable 2-DOF vehicles.

ID DESIGN; GUIDANCE
AB This paper presents an adaptive neuro-fuzzy sliding mode control (ANFSMC) scheme for diving motion control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the presence of parameter perturbations and wave disturbances. In the derivation of diving motion equations of an AUV, the pitch angle of the vehicle is often assumed to be small in the vertical plane. This is a quite strong restricting condition in underwater operations and may cause serious modeling inaccuracies in AUV's dynamics. The problem of nonlinear uncertain diving behavior with restricting assumption on the pitch angle directly is resolved by a neural network (NN) based equivalent control. The online NN estimator is designed to approximate a part of the equivalent control term containing nonlinear unknown dynamics and external disturbances. Subsequently, corrective control based on an adaptive fuzzy proportional-integral control is applied to eliminate the chattering phenomenon by smoothing the switching signal and also compensate structured uncertainties. The weights of NN are updated such that the corrective control signal of the ANFSMC converges towards zero. The adaptive laws are developed to compute coefficients of PID sliding manifold and adjust the gain of fuzzy switching control. The simulation results are presented to shows the efficacy of the control performance.

AB The uncertainty in work end time can prevent ridesharing between two commuters with identical home and work locations. This effect can be alleviated by autonomous vehicles (AV): when two commuters share a ride from home to work, if the realized work end times result in a long wait between the two, an additional AV can be easily repositioned from home to work, whereas with regular human-driven vehicles one has to either bear the long wait or request expensive taxi service. This observation implies that AVs have great potential for increasing commute ridesharing. To study this effect, we develop evening commute bottleneck models with uncertain work end time and establish mode choice equilibrium for the round-trip commute. We find that, with regular vehicles, because of the expected waiting cost caused by work end time uncertainty, commuters typically do not share rides even though they have the same home and work locations. With AVs, commuters always share rides for the morning commute, and they also share rides for the evening commute if their work end times turn out to be close; otherwise, they reposition an additional AV to pick one of them up. Our numerical examples show that AVs can encourage commute ridesharing and significantly reduce the expected round-trip travel costs for commuters. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MOBILITY; CAR; SPRAWL
AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are starting to hit our roads. It is only a matter of time until the technological challenges still facing full AV implementation are solved, and legal, social, and transport issues related to AVs become part of the public discussion. AVs have the potential to become a major catalyst for urban transformation. To explore some of these transformations, first, we discuss the possibility of decoupling the many functions of urban vehicles from the form factor (without drivers, do cars need to look like they look today?). Second, we question whether AVs will lead to more or fewer cars on the roads, highlighting the synergies between AVs and ride-sharing schemes. Third, with AVs as part of multimodal and sharing-mobility systems, millions of square kilometers currently used for parking spaces might be liberated, or even change the way we design road space. Fourth, freed from the fatigue related to traffic, we question whether AVs would make people search for home locations farther from cities, increasing urban sprawl, or would rather attract more residents to city centers, also freed from congestion and pollution. Fifth, depending on responses to the previous questions and innovative traffic algorithms, we ask whether AVs will demand more or less road infrastructure. We conclude by suggesting that AVs offer the first opportunity to rethink urban life and city design since cars replaced horse-powered traffic and changed the design of cities for a hundred years.

The capability of biological flight systems to autonomously maneuver, track, and pursue evasive targets in a cluttered environment is vastly superior to current engineered systems. Our effort seeks to mimic the behavior of biological systems to improve the design of engineered guidance and control systems for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles and, in particular, parafoil-based systems.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) must share space with pedestrians, both in carriageway cases such as cars at pedestrian crossings and off-carriageway cases such as delivery vehicles navigating through crowds on pedestrianized high-streets. Unlike static obstacles, pedestrians are active agents with complex, interactive motions. Planning AV actions in the presence of pedestrians thus requires modelling of their probable future behavior as well as detecting and tracking them. This narrative review article is Part II of a pair, together surveying the current technology stack involved in this process, organising recent research into a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from low-level image detection to high-level psychological models, from the perspective of an AV designer. This self-contained Part II covers the higher levels of this stack, consisting of models of pedestrian behavior, from prediction of individual pedestrians' likely destinations and paths, to game-theoretic models of interactions between pedestrians and autonomous vehicles. This survey clearly shows that, although there are good models for optimal walking behavior, high-level psychological and social modelling of pedestrian behavior still remains an open research question that requires many conceptual issues to be clarified. Early work has been done on descriptive and qualitative models of behavior, but much work is still needed to translate them into quantitative algorithms for practical AV control.

AB This paper develops a new approach to portray the equilibrium and analyze the appropriate lane policy during different deployment stages of autonomous vehicles (AVs) by innovatively inte-grating Vickrey's bottleneck model into the day-to-day dynamic model. The travel cost function in the classical bottleneck model is described by considering the impact of AVs' value of time (VOT) reduction and AV gain. The evolution of lane choice behaviors is described using the first -order and second-order day-to-day dynamic model. Furthermore, three lane policies are proposed to accommodate AVs' development, and the properties for the endogenous market penetration of AVs and travel cost under three lane policies are examined to recognize which policy is more suitable at different development stages of AVs. The results demonstrate that such equilibrium solutions as traffic flow, total travel cost, the convergence time are all analytically solvable and thus can perfectly answer the problem of stability and convergence involved in the day-to-day dynamic model. Finally, the numerical analysis is conducted to verify the previous findings and get some intuitive insights on system performance. This work not only provides new insights on the evolutionary process of AVs' and regular vehicles (RVs)' lane choice behaviors, but also recognizes appropriate lane policy to accommodate AVs from a novel perspective.

AB This paper studies the effects of different autonomous driving behaviors on an isolated intersection's safety and mobility performance measures in a mixed-autonomy environment. The movement of vehicles through the intersection is controlled by green, red, and "white" signal indications. Traffic operations during green and red signals are identical to a typical intersection. However, in the presence of the white phase, connected human-driven vehicles (CHVs) should follow connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to pass the intersection safely. Three levels of driving aggressiveness for CAVs are considered: (1) cautious behavior, (2) normal behavior, and (3) aggressive behavior. The mobility and safety impacts of these CAV behaviors are studied based on different CAV market penetration rates and demand levels. The results indicate that a more aggressive CAV driving behavior leads to a lower average delay while increasing the average number of stops for CAVs. Additionally, a more aggressive CAV driving behavior leads to more frequent activation of the white phase that contributes to significant reduction in the speed variance. Moreover, the total number of rear-end near-collision observations with a time to collision of less than 10 s decreases as the CAV penetration rate and aggressiveness level increase. The main reason for this observation is that aggressive CAVs have higher acceleration and lower deceleration values and, therefore, have more flexibility to avoid a crash.

AB This paper presents design and experimental evaluation of a distributed autonomous multi-hop vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication system over TV white space performed in Japan. We propose the two-layer control channel model, which consists of the Zone Aware Control Channel (ZACC) and the Swarm Aware Control Channel (SACC), to establish the multi-hop network. Several vehicles construct a swarm using location information shared through ZACC, and share route and channel information, and available white space information through SACC. To evaluate the system we carried out field experiments with swarm made of three vehicles in a convoy. The vehicles observe channel occupancy via energy detection and agree on the control and the data channels autonomously. For coarse synchronization of quiet periods for sensing we use GPS driven oscillators, and introduce a time margin to accommodate for remaining drift. When a primary user is detected in any of the borrowed channels, the vehicles switch to a vacant channel without disrupting the ongoing multi-hop communication. We present the experimental results in terms of the time to establish control channel, channel switching time, delivery ratio of control message exchange, and throughput. As a result, we showed that our implementation can provide efficient and stable multi-hop V2V communication by using dynamic spectrum access (DSA) techniques.

AB Autonomous driving will still use human-machine co-driving to handle complex situations for a long term, which requires the driver to control the vehicle and avoid hazards by executing appropriate behavioral sequences after takeover prompts. Previous studies focused on the division of static behavioral indicators and major phases in the initial phase of takeover, while lacking the construction of behavioral sequences based on the dynamic changes of behavioral characteristics during the takeover process. This study divides the takeover process in a detailed manner and investigates the impact of audio types on the behavioral sequence at each phase. 20 professional drivers performed the NDRT in autonomous driving mode on real roads, and after receiving audio prompts, they took over the vehicle and performed hazard avoidance maneuvers. The results show that the behavioral char-acteristics could construct the behavioral sequence of different phases, with the dynamic characteristics of the takeover operation change. In addition, different types of audio prompts will affect the timing of the takeover operation and its driving performance. Choosing different audio prompts or combinations can help improve the effect of taking over the vehicle. This study helps to provide guidance on the design of human-machine inter-action for behavior optimization at different phases, so that guiding the driver to take over the vehicle safely and effectively.

AB The increased need for just-in-time delivery of finite goods has pulled the development of novel automation solutions to manage warehouse activities. Among the available technologies, autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) rely on light vehicles able to travel independently and to perform different tasks at the same time, thus exhibiting enhanced flexibility and increased throughput level. Nonetheless, techniques to evaluate the performance of such systems still exhibit some gaps and are mainly focused on simple configurations. This paper aims to extend the state of the art by introducing novel analytical models capable to assess the performance of a tier-to-tier, multi-shuttle AVS/RS feeding a deep-lane rack. The proposed approach enables to evaluate the expected cycle time and throughput by (i) enabling the possibility to consider the real criteria adopted to store and retrieve items, and (ii) taking into account the ability of the vehicles to simultaneously perform different tasks. The model is validated against simulations performed on different rack layouts, on AVS/RS with different fleet compositions, for different types of cycle. The developed model aims to support both the design and the deployment phases of AVS/RS by enabling quick and accurate performance estimation in a wide variety of scenarios.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics enable autonomous vehicles (AVs) to dramatically change future intelligent transportation in smart cities. AVs are envisaged to evolve to a service rather than a product in the future. To provide best user experience of such services, three primary factors, namely, waiting time, travel time, and supply of AV services, are taken into consideration in a multiobjective optimization. Conventional optimization of services relies on traffic flow analysis over a queuing network model. However, due to the mobility of vehicles and the transfer uncertainty of road networks, the queuing network analysis is too complicated and practically intractable. For accuracy and convenient processing, network calculus (NC) is extended to model the queueing problem in this paper. The optimal number of available AVs can be identified by guaranteeing the waiting time of customers. The satisfaction of AV services can be viewed as a supply and demand problem, and optimized by bipartite graph matching. In order to reduce the average travel time, especially for rush hours with heavy traffic, we further propose a new online AVs fleet management scheme with congestion control for smart cities. It is shown that the intelligent management of AV fleet can be efficiently achieved, outperforming the cases of traditional vehicles. NC-assisted AI enables an efficient intelligent transportation paradigm in smart cities, while achieving substantial energy saving.

AB This study describes a method for detecting and tracking ocean fronts using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Multiple vehicles, equally spaced along the expected frontal boundary, complete near parallel transects orthogonal to the front. Two different techniques are used to determine the location of the front crossing from each individual vehicle transect. The first technique uses lateral gradients to detect when a change in the observed water property occurs. The second technique uses a measure of the vertical temperature structure over a single dive to detect when the vehicle is in upwelling water. Adaptive control of the vehicles ensure they remain perpendicular to the estimated front boundary as it evolves over time. This method was demonstrated in several experiment periods totaling weeks, in and around Monterey Bay, CA, in May and June of 2017. We compare the two front detection methods, a lateral gradient front detector and an upwelling front detector using the Vertical Temperature Homogeneity Index. We introduce two metrics to evaluate the adaptive control techniques presented. We show the capability of this method for repeated sampling across a dynamic ocean front using a fleet of three types of platforms: short-range Iver AUVs, Tethys-class long-range AUVs, and Seagliders. This method extends to tracking gradients of different properties using a variety of vehicles.

AB This article studies the problem of localization and tracking of a mobile target ship with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). A hybrid acoustic-optical underwater communication solution is proposed, in which the acoustic link is used for the Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) localization, and the optical link is for the Line-of-Sight (LoS) transmission. By coordinating these two complementary technologies, it is possible to overcome their respective weaknesses and achieve accurate localization, tracking, and high-rate underwater data transmission. The main challenge for reliable operation is to maintain the AUV over an optical link range while the target dynamics is unknown at all times. Hence, we design an error-based adaptive model predictive control (MPC) and a proportional-derivative (PD) controller incorporating a real-time acoustic localization system to guide the AUV toward the sensor node mounted on the surface ship. We define a connectivity threshold cone with its apex coinciding with the sensor node such that when the underwater vehicle stays inside of this cone, a minimum bit rate is guaranteed. The localization, tracking control, and optical communication scheme is validated through online simulations that integrate a realistic AUV model where the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive MPC and PD controllers is demonstrated.

AB Currently, one of the main challenges that large metropolitan areas must face is traffic congestion. To address this problem, it becomes necessary to implement an efficient solution to control traffic that generates benefits for citizens, such as reducing vehicle journey times and, consequently, environmental pollution. By properly analyzing traffic demand, it is possible to predict future traffic conditions, using this information for the optimization of the routes taken by vehicles. Such an approach becomes especially effective if applied in the context of autonomous vehicles, which have a more predictable behavior, thus enabling city management entities to mitigate the effects of traffic congestion and pollution, thereby improving the traffic flow in a city in a fully centralized manner. This paper represents a step forward towards this novel traffic management paradigm by proposing a route server capable of handling all the traffic in a city, and balancing traffic flows by accounting for present and future traffic congestion conditions. We perform a simulation study using real data of traffic congestion in the city of Valencia, Spain, to demonstrate how the traffic flow in a typical day can be improved using our proposed solution. Experimental results show that our proposed traffic prediction equation, combined with frequent updating of traffic conditions on the route server, can achieve substantial improvements in terms of average travel speeds and travel times, both indicators of lower degrees of congestion and improved traffic fluidity.

AB Navigation of Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) has traditionally been accomplished by means of fixed path navigation systems. The trend towards the use of such vehicles in unstructured external environments has led to a requirement for increasingly sophisticated sensory inputs.
   This paper describes the use of FM-CW radar for autonomous vehicle navigation and the development of a real time test platform for their evaluation. Experimental results have been processed off-line using Matlab to extract range information. Real time performance was achieved using a dual processor system comprising a Motorola 68000 single board computer for system control and supervision and a Texas Instruments Digital Signal Processor, TMS320C50, for performing 1024 point Fast Fourier Transformation to convert a digitised radar return signal into a frequency domain signal.

AB Modern vehicles communicate data to and from sensors, actuators, and electronic control units (ECUs) using Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, which operates on differential signaling. An autonomous ECU responsible for the execution of decision commands to an autonomous vehicle is developed by assimilating the information from the CAN bus. The conventional way of parsing the decision commands is motion planning, which uses a path tracking algorithm to evaluate the decision commands. This study focuses on designing a robust controller using behavioral cloning and motion planning of autonomous vehicle using a deep learning framework. In the first part of this study, we explore the pipeline of parsing decision commands from the path tracking algorithm to the controller and proposed a neural network-based controller ((NC)-C-2) using behavioral cloning. The proposed network predicts throttle, brake, and torque when trained with the manual driving data acquired from the CAN bus. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparing the accuracy with the Proportional-Derivative-Integral (PID) controller in conjunction with the path tracking algorithm (pure pursuit and model predictive control based path follower). The second part of this study complements (NC)-C-2, in which an end-to-end neural network for predicting the speed and steering angle is proposed with image data as an input. The performance of the proposed frameworks are evaluated in real-time and on the Udacity dataset, showing better metric scores in the former and reliable prediction in the later case when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AV) have the potential to disrupt the entire transport industry. AV may bring many opportunities as for example reduction of road accidents, less congestion on the roads, and a lower number of vehicles that are better utilized. Full AV also brings new social element as they enable mobility for all. In addition, the use of digital technologies in combination with AV introduces new business models in transportation, where the lines between car ownership, rental, and lease modes are more and more blurred. To explore the potential of AV in a smart city context, the AV Living Lab was created on the premises of BTC City in Ljubljana, Slovenia, in 2017. The AV Living lab was created to test and to learn about real-life solutions for implementation of AV. The underlying concept is BTC City as a Living lab innovation ecosystem, where the latest advanced technologies, business models, and services are tested with real users, real cars, on real roads over the real interactions in a cross-industry environment. In this paper, we describe the AV Living Lab concept and provide details of a specific use case-a large-scale pilot demonstration of AV and future mobility solutions. During the event, users participated in a survey and expressed their attitudes towards autonomous mobility. The results offer the first insights into the readiness of citizens for AV implementation and directs future actions needed for faster adoption of AV and future mobility solutions.

Based on an adaptive network structure a multivariable Sugeno style fuzzy inference system is tuned to produce autopilots for simultaneous central of multiple degrees of freedom for an AUV. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of this new multivariable approach for course-changing roll-regulating, and y-positional-changing yaw-regulating control when compared with a traditional multi-input single-output control approach whereby control of each degree of freedom is considered separately and hence no provision is made for the inherent cross-coupling between AUV channel motions.

AB This paper proposes a pose-based algorithm to solve the full simultaneous localization and mapping problem for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigating in unknown and possibly unstructured environments. The proposed method first estimates the local path traveled by the robot while forming the acoustic image (scan) with range data coming from a mono-beam rotating sonar head, providing position estimates for correcting the distortions that the vehicle motion produces in the scans. Then, consecutive scans are cross-registered under a probabilistic scan matching technique for estimating the displacements of the vehicle including the uncertainty of the scan matching result. Finally, an augmented state extended Kalman filter estimates and keeps the registered scans poses. No prior structural information or initial pose are considered. The viability of the proposed approach has been tested reconstructing the trajectory of a guided AUV operating along a 600 m path within a marina environment.

AB New transport technologies, such as autonomous vehicles, are increasingly discussed in the debate on the transition to a sustainable urban future. Automated vehicles (AVs) are expected to reduce the value of travel time (VoT), allowing the use of time for other types of activities during travel, including working, reading, sleeping, entertainment, etc. Our study aims to provide empirical insights on future modal choice preferences for regular trips for Romanian citizens, using a sample of 309 respondents to a web survey on issues related to automated vehicles. Using multinomial logistic models (MNL), we analysed the relationship between three mode choices: regular car, private automated vehicle, and shared automated vehicle, along with the individual and household characteristics. In addition, we calculated the VoT for each mode choice based on the results of MNL analysis. Results showed that VoT is strongly influenced by travel cost and travel time, by socio-economic characteristics such as age, gender, and education, and has the lowest value for the shared AV compared with a regular car or a private AV. Future research may conduct comparable studies in European countries but also explore the opinions and perceptions of vulnerable road users on AVs and VoT.

AB This paper describes how differential braking can be used to turn a vehicle in the context of providing fail-operational control for self-driving vehicles. Two vehicle models are developed with differential input. The models are used to explain the bounds of curvature that differential braking provides and they are then validated with measurements in a test vehicle. Particular focus is paid on wheel suspension effects that significantly influence the obtained curvature. The vehicle behaviour and its limitations due to wheel suspension effects are, owing to the vehicle models, defined and explained. Finally, a model-based controller is developed to control the vehicle curvature during a fault by differential braking. The controller is designed to compensate for wheel angle disturbance that is likely to occur during the control event.

AB Many vehicles spend a significant amount of time in urban traffic congestion. Due to the evolution of autonomous vehicles, driver assistance systems, and in-vehicle entertainment, these vehicles have plentiful computational and communication capacity. How can we deploy data collection and processing tasks on these (slowly) moving vehicles to productively use any spare resources? To answer this question, we study the efficient placement of distributed services on a moving vehicle cluster. We present a macroscopic flow model for an intersection in Dublin, Ireland, using real vehicle density data. We show that such aggregate flows are highly predictable (even though the paths of individual vehicles are not known in advance), making it viable to deploy services harnessing vehicles' sensing capabilities. After studying the feasibility of using these vehicle clusters as infrastructure, we introduce a detailed mathematical specification for a task-based, distributed service placement model. The distributed service scales according to the resource requirements and is robust to the changes caused by the mobility of the cluster. We formulate this as a constrained optimization problem, with the objective of minimizing overall processing and communication costs. Our results show that jointly scaling tasks and finding a mobility-aware, optimal placement results in reduced processing and communication costs compared to the two schemes in the literature. We compare our approach to an autonomous vehicular edge computing-based naive solution and a clustering-based solution.

AB This paper proposes an adaptive lane change trajectory planning scheme to road friction and vehicle speed for autonomous driving, while considering both the maneuver safety and the comfort of occupants. In regard to achieve smooth trajectory, a 7th-order polynomial function is constructed to ensure continuity of the planned trajectory up to the derivative of the curvature (jerk). Unlike traditional planning methods that only consider very limited maneuvering conditions, the proposed scheme adapts to a wide range of road friction and vehicle speed, while ensuring enhanced occupants' ride comfort and acceptance. The proposed trajectory planning scheme creatively integrates all the dynamic constraints which are defined by road friction, safety, comfort and human-like driving style. It is shown that the proposed lane change planning algorithm reduces to the identification of exclusively the lane change duration given a constant forward speed. Illustrative simulation examples in MATLAB/Simulink have been conducted to demonstrate the validity of the proposed scheme. The acceptable traceability of the planned lane change trajectories is further demonstrated through path tracking analysis of a full-vehicle model in CarSim. Finally, experimental tests have been conducted based on Quanser's latest self-driving car (QCar) to verify the practical effectiveness of the proposed trajectory planning scheme.

AB The dispatch and routing problems of shared autonomous vehicle (DR-SAV) have been widely studied, and one of the key challenges is the modeling complexity and computational burden associated with network congestion. Existing studies on DR-SAV are limited in the sense that traffic congestion and demand-supply interaction, resulting from dispatch and routing decisions, are not fully integrated into the optimization framework. In this work, we explicitly consider the congestion effect of SAV operations in a mixed traffic environment, consisting of SAVs and conventional vehicles (CVs), by proposing a computationally tractable traffic assignment framework for optimal matching and routing of SAV trips, while allowing the sharing of vehicle by up to two trips simultaneously. This problem is formulated as a Stackelberg game where the upper level is inherently a matching and routing problem for SAVs, and the lower level involves a user equilibrium among CVs. Two strategies are proposed to improve the tractability of the proposed problem: (1) a novel convex programming formulation of the joint SAV matching- routing problem based on the system optimal traffic assignment principle, and (2) the invocation of shareability network to facilitate path set generation. Numerical experiments of the proposed method show that the proposed SAV matching and routing scheme could lead to significant reduction in total travel cost.

AB An underwater vehicle may utilize underwater transponders (UTs) for navigation in the absence of global navigation satellite system signals. However, the position of each UT must be known by the underwater vehicle. The problem of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) optimally planning measurement locations to localize a set of arbitrarily predeployed acoustic UTs is considered. The ASV is assumed to make noisy range measurements to the UTs. A maximum a posteriori estimator is derived to localize the UTs. In addition, a multistep look-ahead (MSLA) ASV optimal measurement location planning (OMLP) strategy is developed. This planning strategy prescribes future multistep measurement locations. A physical interpretation of the proposed planner in the single-step, single transponder case is provided. Simulation results are presented demonstrating the tradeoff between expected localization performance and computational time associated with various look-ahead horizons and travel distances. Experimental results are given illustrating the proposed MSLA OMLP strategy's performance in environments containing one and two UTs. The proposed OMLP strategy is able to localize UTs to within 4 m of their true locations. Additionally, increasing the planning horizon is demonstrated to yield better UT localization at the cost of increased computational burden.

AB Problem, research strategy, and findings: Local government policies could affect how autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is deployed. In this study we examine how municipalities are planning for AVs, identify local characteristics that are associated with preparation, and describe what effects bureaucrats expect from the vehicles. We review existing plans of the 25 largest U.S. cities and survey transportation and planning officials from 120 cities, representative of all municipalities with populations larger than 100,000. First, we find that few local governments have begun planning for AVs. Second, cities with larger populations and higher population growth are more likely to be prepared. Third, although local officials are optimistic about the technology and its potential to increase safety while reducing congestion, costs, and pollution, more than a third of respondents worried about AVs increasing vehicle miles traveled and sprawl while reducing transit ridership and local revenues. Those concerns are associated with greater willingness to implement AV regulations, but there is variation among responses depending on political ideology, per capita government expenditures, and population density. Takeaway for practice: Municipal governments' future approaches to AV preparation will likely depend on the characteristics of city residents and local resources. Planners can maximize policy advancement if they work with officials in other cities to develop best practices and articulate strategies that overlap with existing priorities, such as reducing pollution and single-occupancy commuting.

AB A vision-based approach to unsupervised learning of the indoor environment for autonomous land vehicle (ALV) navigation is proposed. The ALV may, without human's involvement, self-navigate systematically in an unexplored closed environment, collect the information of the environment features, and then build a top-view map of the environment for later planned navigation or other applications. The learning system consists of three subsystems: a feature location subsystem, a model management subsystem, and an environment exploration subsystem. The feature location subsystem processes input images, and calculates the locations of the local features and the ALV by model matching techniques. To facilitate feature collection, two laser markers are mounted on the vehicle which project laser light on the corridor walls to form easily detectable line and corner features. The model management subsystem attaches the local model into a global one by merging matched corner pairs as well as line segment pairs, The environment exploration subsystem guides the ALV to explore the entire navigation environment by using the information of the learned model and the current ALV location. The guidance scheme is based on the use of a pushdown transducer derived from automata theory. A prototype learning system was implemented on a real vehicle, and simulations and experimental results in real environments show the feasibility of the proposed approach.

AB Over the past ten years, autonomous driving has garnered a great deal of interest from both the scientific community and business. Strong technological advancements have made automated driving more practical because human driving abilities seem limited in terms of driving experience, reaction time, and the effectiveness of real-time decisions. The development of highly autonomous driving algorithms is inextricably tied to planning and changing a vehicle path that must be user-acceptable, efficient, and collision-free. Path planning for road vehicles is a difficult problem due to the high speed involved and the requirement to assure passenger safety. Here, a new path-planning method is developed for both connected and disconnected automatic road vehicles on multilane highways. This paradigm states that the right phrases to describe the objectives of vehicle improvement, passenger comfort, prevention of vehicle-to-vehicle collisions and road deviations are included in the objective function. Hunger Games improved Archimedes optimization (HGE-ARCO) is used to optimize the paths for achieving better-planned outcomes. At the 100th penetration rate, the HGE-ARCO scheme reached a top speed of about 99 km/h. The results shows unmistakably that the proposed HGE-ARCO produces a time of 12.3021 s, which is less than other conventional methods.

AB The autonomous control and communication are the key technologies for unmanned earthwork machinery, and vehicle control terminals with compatibility are essential. This research develops a smart terminal-box (T-box) compatible with various types of unmanned earthwork machinery (including bulldozers, graders, and rollers). The data encoding and decoding model for the T-box communication is formulated to meet the instructions transmission requirements. Combined with our proposed control method implemented in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) platform, we can achieve high-precision trajectory control. Heterogeneous mechanical data can be inter-acted in real time in our proposed system. Multiple experiments were implemented, and results show that our proposed T-box can realize low-latency with average value of 27.03 ms. In unstructured construction sites, we can achieve trajectory control with average error of less than 0.1 m. Our research is of great significance for realizing autonomous control of unmanned earthmoving machines.

AB The ability to deal with systems parametric uncertainties is an essential issue for heavy self-driving vehicles in unconfined environments. In this sense, robust controllers prove to be efficient for autonomous navigation. However, uncertainty matrices for this class of systems are usually defined by algebraic methods which demand prior knowledge of the system dynamics. In this case, the control system designer depends on the quality of the uncertain model to obtain an optimal control performance. This work proposes a robust recursive controller designed via multiobjective optimization to overcome these shortcomings. Furthermore, a local search approach for multiobjective optimization problems is presented. The proposed method applies to any multiobjective evolutionary algorithm already established in the literature. The results presented show that this combination of model-based controller and machine learning improves the effectiveness of the system in terms of robustness, stability and smoothness.

AB Automated valet parking is a part of autonomous vehicles. Path tracking is a vital capability of autonomous vehicles. In the scenario of automatic valet parking, the existing control algorithm will produce a high tracking error and a high computational burden. This paper proposes a path-tracking algorithm based on model predictive control to adapt to low-speed driving. By using the model predictive control method and vehicle kinematics model, a path tracking controller is designed. Combining the dual algorithm to further optimize the solver, a new quadratic programming (QP) knows what it knows (QPKWIK) solver is proposed. The simulation results show that the solution time of the QPKWIK solver is 25% less than that of the QP solver, and the tracking error is reduced by up to 41% compared with the QP solver. In the parking lot, the tracking performance is tested under four common scenarios, and the experimental results show that this controller has better tracking performance.

AB In this work, we present a form of extremum seeking (ES) in which the unknown function being minimized enters the system's dynamics as the argument of a cosine or sine term, thereby guaranteeing known bounds on update rates and control efforts. We present general n-dimensional optimization and stabilization results as well as 2D vehicle control, with bounded velocity and control efforts. For application to autonomous vehicles, tracking a source in a GPS denied environment with unknown orientation, this ES approach allows for smooth heading angle actuation, with constant velocity, and in application to a unicycle-type vehicle results in control ability as if the vehicle is fully actuated. Our stability analysis is made possible by the classic results of Kurzweil, Jarnik, Sussmann, and Liu, regarding systems with highly oscillatory terms. In our stability analysis, we combine the averaging results with a semiglobal practical stability result under small parametric perturbations developed by Moreau and Aeyels.

AB Inertial navigation for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is challenging because of the drift error caused by the noise and measurement errors of inertial sensors, typically packaged as an inertial measurement unit (IMU), integrated over time. To mitigate the drift error, recent AUV state estimation approaches incorporate external references or environmental information obtained from exteroceptive sensors, with increased costs and limited operational domains. For improved navigation under sensor constraints, this article proposes an active perception framework that exploits vehicle motion to estimate the flow state together with the vehicle state using IMU and depth sensors only. The proposed framework uses the estimated flow state as external information to improve vehicle state estimation. We construct a linear time-varying system for the flow state, separated from a nonlinear system for the vehicle state. This formulation allows us to analyze uniform complete observability for the flow state, which is found to depend on vehicle motion. Then, along with vehicle and flow state estimators, we design a vehicle controller to enable vehicle motion to maximize an information metric pertaining to estimation performance based on either observability or constructability Gramian for the flow state. The proposed framework is validated through simulations for a case study with a vehicle descending through the water column in a time-varying flow field. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated by comparing results obtained from its four implementations with those from baseline approaches without active perception.

ID STABILITY
AB The focus of this paper is on the design of a control architecture of decentralized type for controlling a leader/follower pair of autonomous non-holonomic vehicles. A fundamental constraint in this trailing control requires that each agent employs local sensor information to process data on the relative position and velocity between its neighbouring vehicles, without relying on global communication with mission control. This constraint poses a challenge in the design of the control system because the reference trajectory to be tracked, which in the case considered in this paper is related to the motion of the leader, is not known a priori. It is shown in the paper that this specific control problem can be approached from the point of view of the internal model paradigm. In particular, once models of the autonomous dynamics of the leader are embedded in a decentralized dynamic controller, the design of the controller can be completed with a robust stabilizer, obtained by using ISS-gain-assignment techniques. It is shown that asymptotic convergence of the follower to an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of the desired steady-state configuration is achieved, despite the presence of possibly large parameter uncertainties, while the motion of each agent remains confined into specified 'sectors' to avoid possible collision between neighbouring vehicles during transients. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the design methodology. Copyright (C) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In recent years, autonomous driving technology has been changing from "human adapting to vehicle" to "vehicle adapting to human". To improve the adaptability of autonomous driving systems to human drivers, a time-series-based personalized lane change decision (LCD) model is proposed. Firstly, according to the characteristics of the subject vehicle (SV) with respect to speed, acceleration and headway, an unsupervised clustering algorithm, namely, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), is used to identify its three different driving styles. Secondly, considering the interaction between the SV and the surrounding vehicles, the lane change (LC) gain value is produced by developing a gain function to characterize their interaction. On the basis of the recognition of the driving style, this gain value and LC feature parameters are employed as model inputs to develop a personalized LCD model on the basis of a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network model (RNN). The proposed method is tested using the US Open Driving Dataset NGSIM. The results show that the accuracy, F1 score, and macro-average area under the curve (macro-AUC) value of the proposed method for LC behavior prediction are 0.965, 0.951 and 0.983, respectively, and the performance is significantly better than that of other mainstream models. At the same time, the method is able to capture the LCD behavior of different human drivers, enabling personalized driving.

TI Estimating the trip generation impacts of autonomous vehicles on car
   travel in Victoria, Australia
SO TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Autonomous vehicles; Driverless; Induced demand; Car trips; Life stages
AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) potentially increase vehicle travel by reducing travel and parking costs and by providing improved mobility to those who are too young to drive or older people. The increase in vehicle travel could be generated by both trip diversion from other modes and entirely new trips. Existing studies however tend to overlook AVs' impacts on entirely new trips. There is a need to develop a methodology for estimating possible impacts of AVs on entirely new trips across all age groups. This paper explores the impacts of AVs on car trips using a case study of Victoria, Australia. A new methodology for estimating entirely new trips associated with AVs is proposed by measuring gaps in travel need at different life stages. Results show that AVs would increase daily trips by 4.14% on average. The 76+ age group would have the largest increase of 18.5%, followed by the 18-24 age group and the 12-17 age group with 14.6 and 11.1% respectively. If car occupancy remains constant in AV scenarios, entirely new trips and trip diversions from public transport and active modes would lead to a 7.31% increase in car trips. However increases in car travel are substantially magnified by reduced car occupancy rates, a trend evidenced throughout the world. Car occupancy would need to increase by at least 5.3-7.3% to keep car trips unchanged in AV scenarios.

AB This article presents a task reassignment strategy that can flexibly handle changes in dynamic environments. Most existing studies have only considered static environments where the mission is predetermined and unexpected events do not occur. However, in practice, the environment in which unmanned aerial vehicles perform their mission is complex and includes various pop-up events. Therefore, task reassignment is essential through reoptimization to adjust the previous plan, which is no longer optimal whenever dynamic events occur. The importance of this article is that the modified receding horizon task assignment algorithm is applied for accurate and efficient task reassignment. In addition, this article aims to provide a complete system architecture from operator input to motor commands for autonomous area coverage missions. Reliable performance validation is also performed through various simulations and a challenging outdoor flight experiment with real hardware implementation.

AB Applications in artificial intelligence such as self-driving cars may profoundly transform our society, yet emerging technologies are frequently faced with suspicion or even hostility. Meanwhile, public opinions about scientific issues are increasingly polarized along the ideological line. By analyzing a nationally representative panel in the United States, we reveal an emerging ideological divide in public reactions to self-driving cars. Compared with liberals and Democrats, conservatives and Republicans express more concern about autonomous vehicles and more support for restrictively regulating autonomous vehicles. This ideological gap is largely driven by social conservatism. Moreover, both familiarity with driverless vehicles and scientific literacy reduce respondents' concerns over driverless vehicles and support for regulation policies. Still, the effects of familiarity and scientific literacy are weaker among social conservatives, indicating that people may assimilate new information in a biased manner that promotes their worldviews.
