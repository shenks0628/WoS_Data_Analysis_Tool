AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are an important tool to track the long-distance movement of plant pathogens above crop fields. Here, we describe the use of a control strategy (coordination via speed modulation) to synchronize two autonomous UAVs during aerobiological sampling of the potato late blight pathogen, Phytophthora infestans. The UAVs shared position coordinates via a wireless mesh network and modulated their speeds so that they were properly phased within their sampling orbits. Three coordinated control experiments were performed August 14-15,2008. In the first two experiments, two UAVs were vertically aligned at two different altitudes [25 and 45 m above ground level (AGL)] with identical sampling orbits (radii of 150 m). In the third experiment, two UAVs shared the same altitude (35 m AGL) with different sampling orbits (radii of 130 and 160 m). Orbit times did not vary significantly between the two UAVs across all three aerobiological sampling missions, and the phase error during sampling converged to zero within 2 mm following the start of the coordinated control algorithm. Viable sporangia of P. infestans were recovered following two of the coordinated flights. This is the first detailed report of autonomous UAV coordination during the aerobiological sampling of a plant pathogen in the lower atmosphere. UAVs operating independently of one another may experience significant sampling variations during the course of a flight. Coordinating the flight of two or more UAVs ensures that the vehicles enter, sample, and exit a spore plume at consistent times. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study aims to test additional AV adoption factors by considering social factors and privacy concerns in the AV era while relying on earlier adoption models and the AV adoption literature. Unlike in most previous studies, the focus is on millennials, namely a group of potential AV adopters with distinct characteristics that must be studied separately. Moreover, fully AVs are considered, i.e., level 5, a more distant and controversial phenomenon of much greater concern for most people. The data were collected in an online questionnaire distributed to a sample of university students and the proposed model was tested with structural equation modelling (SEM). The results show that privacy concerns in the AV era together with perceived safety have a significant effect on general concerns. Alongside general concerns, technological enthusiasm, social factors, perceived benefits, and facilitating conditions affect attitude to AVs. Finally, a more positive attitude to AV, perceived safety, and facilitating conditions is shown to lead to a stronger intention to adopt an AV. Apart from these theoretical contributions, practical contributions include new perspectives for policymakers while designing future AV development strategies. Namely, car manufacturers should strongly emphasize and demonstrate the safety features of their AVs, promote them through technology enthusiasts and focus on forming positive attitude to AVs through different aspects of AVs. Governments should also do their part by establishing support infrastructures that encourage individuals to choose an AV.

AB As one of the innovative technologies of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) have been deployed gradually. Given that there will be a long transition period before reaching a fully CAVs environment, it is crucial to assess the potential impacts of CAVs on mixed traffic flow. Considering platoon formation process, this study develops a platoon cooperation strategy based on "catch-up" mechanism, and then analyzes the impact on fundamental diagram, traffic oscillation, and traffic safety within mixed traffic. Simulation results show that with an increasing market penetration rate (MPR) of CAVs, road capacity shows an increasing trend. Compared with base scenario, a clear increase in road capacity is also observed under platoon scenario. With an increasing MPR, traffic oscillation is shown to reduce largely. Furthermore, the proposed platoon strategy could dampen frequent shockwaves and shorten the propagation range of waves. Regarding traffic safety, multiple surrogate safety measures (SSMs) are used to evaluate the traffic risk: including Criticality Index Function (CIF), Potential Index for Collision with Urgent Deceleration (PICUD), and Deceleration Rate to Avoid a Crash (DRAC). With increasing MPR, collision risk identified by CIF and DRAC shows an increase tendency, while that identified by PICUD has no apparent trend. Furthermore, the platoon strategy is shown to increase the severity of traffic conflicts significantly. Overall, this study provides novel insights into CAVs deployment through the analysis of platoon strategy.

ID SYSTEMS
AB As the motions of faulty actuators may change the faulty influences and introduce uncertain losses, this paper focuses on developing actively compensation-based fault-tolerant control (FTC), where unpredictable influences from an actuator fault are taken as active inputs to compensate for the loss and the correspondingly optimal input appears as a root to be approached asymptotically. One-point secant-based FTC (OS) is proposed to provide limited input convergence where referential gradients are taken to construct intersecting lines for approximating the fault curve and approaching the root. Comparatively, two-point secant-based FTC (TS) is given to provide global input convergence while the gradient is generated by two consecutive fault points. Toward real systems where actuator inputs are limited to feasible regions, selective secant-based FTC (SS) is deduced on the basis of TS and SS, which generates the gradients by using previous fault points selectively. Since the convergent effects could be constrained in specific cases, selective parabola-secant-based FTC (SPS) is developed by constructing parabolic curves to approximate the fault curve selectively. Moreover, a conservative feasible region is determined for designing required inputs to ensure the availability of FTC inputs. Toward the cases where the faulty actuator collaborates with fault-free ones in finite dimensions, SPS is extended to generate multidimensional FTC inputs. Comparative simulations against the rudder fault of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

AB This paper investigates the application of a secure group communication architecture to a swarm of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A multicast secure group communication architecture for the low earth orbit (LEO) satellite environment is evaluated to determine if it can be effectively adapted to a swarm of UAVs and provide secure, scalable, and efficient communications. The performance of the proposed security architecture is evaluated with two other commonly used architectures using a discrete event computer simulation developed using MATLAB. Performance is evaluated in terms of the scalability and efficiency of the group key distribution and management scheme when the swarm size, swarm mobility, multicast group join and departure rates are varied. The metrics include the total keys distributed over the simulation period, the average number of times an individual UAV must rekey, the average bandwidth used to rekey the swarm, and the average percentage of battery consumed by a UAV to rekey over the simulation period. The proposed security architecture can successfully be applied to a swarm of autonomous UAVs using current technology. The proposed architecture is more efficient and scalable than the other tested and commonly used architectures. Over all the tested configurations, the proposed architecture distributes 55.2-94.8% fewer keys, rekeys 59.0-94.9% less often per UAV, uses 55.2-87.9% less bandwidth to rekey, and reduces the battery consumption by 16.9-85.4%.

AB In this paper, a framework of active obstacle avoidance for autonomous vehicles based on the hybrid soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm is proposed. In the stage of local path planning, a comprehensive cost function considering collision risks, deviation from the global route, road lines crossing, and driving comfortability is developed to provide a local optimal path avoiding both static and dynamic obstacles considering multiple predicting timesteps. Then, a path tracking controller on the foundation of a hybrid SAC algorithm is designed to mitigate the problem of high sample complexity caused by random initialization of parameters in conventional reinforcement learning approaches. Model predictive control (MPC) plays a guiding role by applying its control action to combine with the action of SAC online to obtain a more effective state and reward information for training. The mechanism of the combination of MPC with SAC to balance the exploration and reliability is explained in detail. In order to improve the convergence rate and learning efficiency, a dual actor network structure for two different control actions is adopted. With considerations of various relevant factors influencing the control effect, the reward for the hybrid SAC algorithm is designed carefully. Finally, the results of simulation experiments illustrate that the proposed approach performs effectively with the assurance of safety and driving comfortability. In summary, the hybrid SAC algorithm with dual actor networks performs better than other algorithms for comparison in all test scenarios in this paper.

AB For economically advanced locations, a primary response to deindustrialization has been to emphasize higher value-added activities, the target frequently being research and development (R&D). R&D tends to occur in locations proximate to corporate headquarters in general and the headquarters of global lead firms in particular. This pattern is especially evident in the automotive industry. Thus, for countries or regions lacking a targeted industry's global lead firm, generating R&D is problematic. In the automotive industry, the introduction of frontier technologies- such as those supporting autonomous vehicles (AVs) - may reveal new patterns of R&D development, a consequence of firms engaging with innovation ecosystems disconnected from the traditional automotive industry and its headquarters-proximate geographic core or cores. This article explores these matters via a case study of Canada's efforts to build an AV R&D profile. Canada does not host an automaker's headquarters, but it does possess attributes that suggest it is well equipped to conduct such work. After constructing and analyzing a global database of patents related to AVs, this article demonstrates that Canada has contributed R&D focused on AVs at a rate above that which it has reached for automotive R&D overall. It also establishes that globally, even though AV-related R&D has emerged from non-traditional automotive locations, the preponderance of AV-related R&D is converging in core automotive locations: proximate to automakers' global headquarters.

AB Predicting the motion of other road agents enables autonomous vehicles to perform safe and efficient path planning. This task is very complex, as the behaviour of road agents depends on many factors and the number of possible future trajectories can be considerable (multi-modal). Most prior approaches proposed to address multi-modal motion prediction are based on complex machine learning systems that have limited interpretability. Moreover, the metrics used in current benchmarks do not evaluate all aspects of the problem, such as the diversity and admissibility of the output. The authors aim to advance towards the design of trustworthy motion prediction systems, based on some of the requirements for the design of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence. The focus is on evaluation criteria, robustness, and interpretability of outputs. First, the evaluation metrics are comprehensively analysed, the main gaps of current benchmarks are identified, and a new holistic evaluation framework is proposed. Then, a method for the assessment of spatial and temporal robustness is introduced by simulating noise in the perception system. To enhance the interpretability of the outputs and generate more balanced results in the proposed evaluation framework, an intent prediction layer that can be attached to multi-modal motion prediction models is proposed. The effectiveness of this approach is assessed through a survey that explores different elements in the visualisation of the multi-modal trajectories and intentions. The proposed approach and findings make a significant contribution to the development of trustworthy motion prediction systems for autonomous vehicles, advancing the field towards greater safety and reliability.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) plays a great role in the ocean engineering, and path planning is one of its key technologies. For such scenarios as oil spill detection, AUV should execute multiple tasks, which become more challenging due to the 3D ocean environment with obstacles. To solve the multi-task path planning problem of AUV, this paper first proposes a bi-level multi-objective path planning model aimed at minimizing the path length and dangerous distance. Then, a bi-layer hybrid algorithm is developed to solve the above model. In this algorithm, ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) is adopted to generate a task sequence of the upper level model in the outer layer; particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is employed to produce some waypoints between two adjacent tasks, and A* algorithm is used to generate a collision-free path of the lower level model based on waypoints in the inner layer. After that, the collision-free path in the inner layer is feedback to the ACO in the out layer to update its pheromone, and ACO yield a better task sequence in the next iteration, thus obtaining the shortest collision-free path traversing all tasks. Finally, PSO+A* and A* algorithms, together with the proposed bi-layer hybrid algorithm and some two-stage optimization algorithms are compared, respectively. Empirical results show that the proposed algorithm can produce an optimal collision-free path with shorter length and higher security.

AB In this study, we explore the precise trajectory tracking control problem of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) under the disturbance of the underwater environment. First, a model-free adaptive control (MFAC) is designed based on data-driven ideology and a full-form dynamic linearization (FFDL) method is utilized to online estimate time-varying parameter pseudo gradient (PG) to establish an equivalent data model of AUV motion. Second, the iterative extended state observer (IESO) scheme is designed to combine with FFDL-MFAC. Because the proposed novel controller is able to learn from repeated iterations, the proposed novel controller can estimate and compensate the model approximation error produced by external environmental unknown disturbance. Third, threedimensional motion is decoupled into horizontal and vertical and a multi closed-loop control structure is designed that exhibits faster convergence rate and reduces sensitivity to parameter jumps than single closed-loop system. Finally, two simulation scenarios are designed featuring non external disturbance and Gaussian noise of signal-to-noise ratio of 90 dB. The simulation results reveal the superiority of FFDL. Furthermore, we adpot the technical parameters data of T-SEA I AUV to conduct numerical simulation, aunderwater trajectory as the tracking scenario and set waves to 0.5 m and current to 0.2 m/s to simulate Lv.2 ocean conditions of "International Ocean State Standard". The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed tracking control algorithm.

AB This paper investigates the lane keeping control of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) considering the rollover prevention and input saturation. An enhanced state observer-based sliding mode control (SMC) strategy is proposed to achieve the control purpose and maintain the lane keeping errors as well as the roll angle within the prescribed performance boundaries. Three contributions are made in this paper. First, a prescribed performance function (PPF) is proposed in the controller design, aiming to implement the error transformation so as to constrain the controlled variables within the prescribed performance boundaries. Second, a modified sliding surface is developed incorporating two nonlinear functions, whose specialities and benefits are taken advantage of: one is a barrier function to restrict the load transfer ratio (LTR) in a safe boundary to guarantee the roll stability; another is a monotonely decreasing function to adaptively change the damping ratio of the closed-loop system to improve the transient performance, including reducing the transient overshoots and steady-state errors. Third, a modified multivariable adaptive SMC controller is proposed to achieve the integrated lane-keeping and roll control in the presence of the input saturation and bound-unknown disturbances. The stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously proved via the Lyapunov function. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified with a high-fidelity and full-car model via the CarSim platform.

AB This paper presents the first attempt at formulating the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) adaptive sampling problem considering a spatiotemporal ocean environment and energy constraints. A path re-planning system that applies fuzzy logic in decision-making is then proposed to increase the sampling efficiency and reduce power consumption to complete the mission. The goal of adaptive sampling is to plan the trajectories of gliders or AUVs to collect ocean measurements located in areas most relevant to the phenomena under investigation. However, in an actual marine environment, common conditions exist under which AUVs need to adjust their routes as the phenomena change over time. These conditions also require the monitoring of AUV energy consumption under the effect of currents that vary in space and time. This two-objective optimization problem is solved using the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm to produce a set of solutions. A new fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) method, based on decision-making using fuzzy logic, is then applied to select the optimum route from the solutions by adapting and regenerating trajectories according to the ocean forecast system, analysing different scenarios, and including constraints of the total operational time and energy restrictions. Several Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance and robustness of strategies determined via FCE for various scenarios.

AB Attitude estimation is a crucial aspect for navigation and motion control of autonomous vehicles. This concept is particularly true in the case of unavailability of localization sensors when navigation and control rely on dead reckoning strategies; in this case, indeed, the orientation estimate is also used along with speed measurements to update the position estimate. Among the different approaches proposed in the literature, the de facto state of the art in this field is represented by nonlinear complementary filters: they fuse the measurements of angular rate obtained through gyroscopes, and a measurement of gravity and Earth's magnetic field vectors respectively obtained through accelerometers and magnetometers. This paper is focused on an attitude estimation strategy for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). The proposed novelty includes the identification of some critical issues that arise when AUV attitude estimation algorithms are applied in practice. They are mainly due to the use of low-accuracy low-cost microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors and on different sources of magnetic disturbances. Some strategies to overcome the identified issues are proposed, including the integration of a single-axis fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) that ensures a considerable performance improvement with a moderate cost increase. The proposed strategies for detection of issues and sensor fusion have been experimentally tested and validated in a real application scenario estimating the attitude of an AUV performing a lawn mower path. The expected performance improvement is confirmed; the obtained results are described and analyzed in this paper.

AB This study proposes a framework for human-like autonomous car-following planning based on deep reinforcement learning (deep RL). Historical driving data are fed into a simulation environment where an RL agent learns from trial and error interactions based on a reward function that signals how much the agent deviates from the empirical data. Through these interactions, an optimal policy, or car-following model that maps in a human-like way from speed, relative speed between a lead and following vehicle, and inter-vehicle spacing to acceleration of a following vehicle is finally obtained. The model can be continuously updated when more data are fed in. Two thousand car-following periods extracted from the 2015 Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study were used to train the model and compare its performance with that of traditional and recent data driven car-following models. As shown by this study's results, a deep deterministic policy gradient car-following model that uses disparity between simulated and observed speed as the reward function and considers a reaction delay of 1 s, denoted as DDPGvRT, can reproduce human-like car following behavior with higher accuracy than traditional and recent data-driven car-following models. Specifically, the DDPGvRT model has a spacing validation error of 18% and speed validation error of 5%, which are less than those of other models, including the intelligent driver model, models based on locally weighted regression, and conventional neural network-based models. Moreover, the DDPGvRT demonstrates good capability of generalization to various driving situations and can adapt to different drivers by continuously learning. This study demonstrates that reinforcement learning methodology can offer insight into driver behavior and can contribute to the development of human-like autonomous driving algorithms and traffic-flow models.

AB Satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks have been introduced as enhanced approaches to provide dynamic control, massive connections and global coverage for future wireless communication systems. This paper considers a coordinated satellite-UAV communication system, where the UAV performs the environmental reconnaissance task with the assistance of satellites in a hostile jamming environment. To fulfill this task, the UAV needs to realize autonomous trajectory control and upload the collected data to the satellite. With the aid of the uploading data, the satellite builds the environment situation map integrating the beam quality, jamming status, and traffic distribution. Accordingly, we propose a closed-loop anti-jamming dynamic trajectory optimization approach, which is divided into three stages. Firstly, a coarse trajectory planning is made according to the limited prior information and preset points. Secondly, the flight control between two adjacent preset points is formulated as a Markov decision process, and reinforcement learning (RL) based automatic flying control algorithms are proposed to explore the unknown hostile environment and realize autonomous and precise trajectory control. Thirdly, based on the collected data during the UAV's flight, the satellite utilizes an environment situation estimating algorithm to build an environment situation map, which is used to reselect the preset points for the first stage and provide better initialization for the RL process in the second stage. Simulation results verify the validity and superiority of the proposed approach.

AB One of the most challenging issues for researchers and engineers in the field of autonomous underwater vehicles is the pressure applied to their bodies at different depths of the water. Given the type of application, operational position and expensive, and sensitive equipment of such robots, choosing the body material is very important. In addition to the need to move and maneuver properly in deep waters, the autonomous underwater robots' bodies must withstand various pressures in deep water to protect against failure and crack due to increased pressure from the sea to show maximum operational maneuverability in the deep sea. In this article, a small magnetic system is used to reduce the pressure on the body of an underwater robot with very low power. Using hydrostatic analysis of the robot body and calculating the stress on the body, the maximum stress is obtained at critical points of the underwater robot. To reduce the stress applied to the body, using the superposition principle and plate theory, the secondary pressure in the opposite direction of the primary pressure is calculated, and the repulsive force creates this pressure between two magnets. In this research, the analyses are obtained by the calculated data and using a pressure sensor, the external pressure on the of a Teflon underwater robot is compensated to a very good extent, and the vessel's allowable depth is increased from 8 to 12 m without changing the structure of the body.

AB Localizing small Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) that have limited payload and perception capability is of importance to promote popularization of underwater applications. Two different methodologies, filter and optimization based methods, can both be used to address the localization problem. But they are seldom rigorously compared and their relative advantages are rarely established. This paper presents a rigorous investigation on the relationship between these two methods. Based on this examination, a novel cooperative localization algorithm for the scenario where AUVs are localized by using range measurements from a single surface mobile beacon is proposed. The main contribution of this paper is threefold. First, major difference and close connection between filter based method and optimization based Maximum a Posteriori method are explicitly clarified by analytically solving optimization problems. Second, a novel localization algorithm combining a filter based extended Kalman filter and an optimization based Moving Horizon Estimation is developed for three-dimensional underwater localization in real-time and long-term applications. The algorithm allows data fusion of multiple sensors, imposes physical constraints on states and noises, bounds computational complexity, and achieves a compromise between better accuracy and lower computational requirement. Third, observability analysis of single beacon based localization algorithm is conducted in the context of nonlinear discrete time systems and a sufficient condition is derived. The observability and improved localization accuracy of the proposed localization algorithm are verified in a customized underwater simulator by extensive numerical simulations.

AB This paper presents a behavior-based adaptive mission planner (AMP) to trace a chemical plume to its source and reliably declare the source location. The proposed AMP is implemented on a REMUS autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with multiple types of sensors that measure chemical concentration, the flow velocity vector, and AUV position, depth, altitude, attitude, and speed. This paper describes the methods and results from experiments conducted in November 2002 on San Clemente Island, CA, using a plume of Rhodamine dye developed in a turbulent fluid flow (i.e., near-shore ocean conditions). These experiments demonstrated chemical plume tracing over 100 in and source declaration accuracy relative to the nominal source location on the order of tens of meters. The designed maneuvers are divided into four behavior types: finding a plume, tracing the plume, reacquiring the plume, and declaring the source location. The tracing and reacquiring behaviors are inspired by male moths flying upwind along a pheromone plume to locate a sexually receptive female. All behaviors are formulated by perception and action modules and translated into chemical plume-tracing algorithms suitable for implementation on a REMUS AUV. To coordinate the different behaviors, the subsumption architecture is adopted to define and arbitrate the behavior priorities. AUVs capable of such feats would have applicability in searching for environmentally interesting phenomena, unexploded ordnance, undersea wreckage, and sources of hazardous chemicals or pollutants.

AB It is important to build robust object detector (ROD) in real-world applications because snow, rain, fog, motion blur, and various kinds of corruption can occur in autonomous-driving environments. Adversarial training (AT) is one of the best solutions to build a robust deep neural network. However, applying AT has a risk of sacrificing clean performance, even though robustness is improved, which is called catastrophic forgetting (CF). In particular, CF in an autonomous-driving environment is more challenging for two reasons. The first is CF is worsened due to various types of corruption. The second is the degradation of clean performance can lead to a risk of overall performance degradation because more than 60% of the total data is clean (based on Bdd100k). Therefore, we propose an ROD framework to ensure not only robustness against corruption but also prevent degradation of clean performance, despite the two aforementioned difficulties. The ROD framework utilizes a training methodology with an adversarial defense module based on the intermediate representative feature concept. This framework can improve robustness without CF under multi-corruption environments. In this paper, we report on three main achievements. The first is that the mean performance under corruption (mPC) of RetinaNet was improved by 32.14% with an mAP degradation of only 0.2%, based on COCO 2017. The second is that our method achieved state-of-the-art results with 86.8% relative performance under corruption (rPC) compared to Hybrid Task Cascades with 64.6% rPC on the ROD benchmark. The third is that our ROD methodology achieved 32.29% and 31.54% mPC at 15-type seen corruptions and four-type unseen corruptions, respectively. The ROD framework is also applied to an autonomous-driving domain showing that it operates well, even under harsh environments in the Bdd100k dataset.

ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; MIXED TRAFFIC FLOW; STRING STABILITY; CONTROL
   DESIGN
AB By using kinematic state information obtained through vehicle-to-vehicle communications, connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can drive cooperatively to alleviate shockwave propagation associated with traffic disturbances. However, during the transition to full autonomy, CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) will coexist on the road, creating mixed-flow traffic. The inherent heterogeneity and randomness in human driving behavior can generate additional disturbances in the traffic flow. Further, HDVs without communication functionality (unconnected HDVs) can cause the control performance of CAVs to degrade by negatively impacting platoon formation. To proactively mitigate the negative impacts of HDVs in mixed-flow traffic, this study proposes a cooperative control strategy with three components for platoons consisting of CAVs and unconnected HDVs: (i) a number estimator for estimating the number of HDVs between two CAVs, (ii) a kinematic state predictor for predicting the kinematic states of HDVs, and (iii) a multi-anticipative car-following controller (i.e., control strategy using kinematic state information of multiple preceding vehicles) for CAVs to maintain string stability and desired time headway. To initialize the proposed strategy, the number estimator is developed using a deep neural network (DNN). Then, a DNN-based kinematic state predictor predicts the kinematic states of HDVs for CAVs to enable multi-anticipative car-following control. The multi-anticipative car-following controller is implemented using an extended intelligent driver model-guided deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, which ensures safety, string stability, and traffic efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated through numerical experiments using NGSIM data. Results indicate that the proposed strategy can produce accurate estimations of the number and the kinematic states of HDVs between CAVs. Further, it can achieve string stability while maintaining smaller time headways, compared to car-following models used for training guidance under different market penetration rates of CAVs, which significantly improves traffic smoothness and mobility.

AB With the advent of emerging technologies, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to become increasingly available to travelers. It is highly anticipated that there will be a transitional period when legacy vehicles (LVs) are gradually replaced by AVs before AVs take up a full penetration in the auto market. As a result, LVs and AVs will inevitably coexist during this period experiencing an interactive temporal evolution in terms of their market shares. Inspired by the classic Lotka-Volterra equations, we develop a continuous-time dynamical model capable of capturing such temporal evolution. A discrete choice model is constructed and incorporated into the dynamical model for describing the likelihood of choosing LVs or AVs. To achieve the desired temporal integration of AVs, monetary subsidies and investment in AV-specific transportation infrastructure are considered as decision variables to promote the adoption of AVs. Further, an optimal control problem is formulated with the objective of achieving a desired market penetration rate (MPR) of AVs at the end of the planning horizon, while minimizing the cost associated with AV subsidies and infrastructure investment. We prove the existence of an optimal AV integration policy. Moreover, we derive necessary conditions of optimality characterizing the mathematical properties of the optimal integration policy. Based on the optimality conditions derived, an iterative computational algorithm is developed to determine the time-dependent integration policy, which allows the government agency to appropriately subsidize AV purchases and invest in AV-specific infrastructure in an adaptive manner. Extensive numerical results are presented to show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach under two distinct demand patterns. In addition, a systematic cost-benefit analysis is conducted, along with appropriate sensitivity analysis, to evaluate the desirability of the integration of AVs. Since the dynamical model is general and the decision variables are easy to implement, the procedures presented in this article will provide significant managerial insights for government agencies into developing long-term strategic planning policies.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of forward collision warning (FCW) alone, a low-speed autonomous emergency braking (AEB) system operational at speeds up to 19 mph that does not warn the driver prior to braking, and FCW with AEB that operates at higher speeds in reducing front-to-rear crashes and injuries. Poisson regression was used to compare rates of police-reported crash involvements per insured vehicle year in 22 U.S. states during 2010-2014 between passenger vehicle models with FCW alone or with AEB and the same models where the optional systems were not purchased, controlling for other factors affecting crash risk. Similar analyses compared rates between Volvo 2011-2012 model S60 and 2010-2012 model XC60 vehicles with a standard low-speed AEB system to those of other luxury midsize cars and SUVs, respectively, without the system.
   FCW alone, low-speed AEB, and FCW with AEB reduced rear-end striking crash involvement rates by 27%, 43%, and 50%, respectively. Rates of rear-end striking crash involvements with injuries were reduced by 20%, 45%, and 56%, respectively, by FCW alone, low-speed AEB, and FCW with AEB, and rates of rear-end striking crash involvements with third-party injuries were reduced by 18%, 44%, and 59%, respectively. Reductions in rear-end striking crashes with third-party injuries were marginally significant for FCW alone, and all other reductions were statistically significant. FCW alone and low-speed AEB reduced rates of being rear struck in rear-end crashes by 13% and 12%, respectively, but FCW with AEB increased rates of rear-end struck crash involvements by 20%. Almost 1 million U.S. police-reported rear-end crashes in 2014 and more than 400,000 injuries in such crashes could have been prevented if all vehicles were equipped with FCW and AEB that perform similarly as systems did for study vehicles.

AB Public perception assessment is important for gaining a better understanding of the acceptance of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and identifying potential ways to resolve public concerns. This study investigated how pedestrians and bicyclists perceived AVs based on their knowledge and road sharing experiences, applying a combined inductive and deductive data analysis approach. Survey responses of pedestrians and bicyclists in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA collected by Bike Pittsburgh (BikePGH) in 2019, were analyzed in this research. AVs following traffic rules appropriately and AVs driving safer than the human drivers were the most notable positive perceptions towards AVs. Pedestrians and bicyclists showed comparatively fewer negative perceptions towards AVs than positive perceptions. Negative perceptions mostly included a lack of perceived safety and comfort around AVs and trust in the AV technology. Respondents also concerned about AV technology issues (e.g., slow and defensive driving, disruptive maneuver), while sharing the road with AVs. Perceptions of the respondents were significantly influenced by their views on AV safety, familiarity with the technology, the extent respondents followed AV on the news, and household automobile ownership. Regulating AV movement on roadways, developing safety assessment guidelines, and controlling oversights of improper practices by AV companies were the major suggestions from the survey participants. Findings of this study might help AV companies to identify potential improvement needed in AV technology to increase pedestrians and bicyclists acceptance, and policymakers to develop policy guidelines to ensure safe road sharing among pedestrians, bicyclists, and AVs.

AB 5G networks are anticipated to support a plethora of innovative and promising network services. These services have heterogeneous performance requirements (e.g., high-rate traffic, low latency, and high reliability). To meet them, 5G networks are entailed to endorse flexibility that can be fulfilled through the deployment of new emerging technologies, mainly software-defined networking (SDN), network functions virtualization (NFV), and network slicing. In this paper, we focus on an interesting automotive vertical use case: autonomous vehicles. Our aim is to enhance the quality of service of autonomous driving application. To this end, we design a framework that uses the aforementioned technologies to enhance the quality of service of the autonomous driving application. The framework is made of 1) a distributed and scalable SDN core network architecture that deploys fog, edge and cloud computing technologies; 2) a network slicing function that maps autonomous driving functionalities into service slices; and 3) a network and service slicing system model that promotes a four-layer logical architecture to improve the transmission efficiency and satisfy the low latency constraint. In addition, we present a theoretical analysis of the propagation delay and the handling latency based on GI/M/1 queuing system. Simulation results show that our framework meets the low-latency requirement of the autonomous driving application as it incurs low propagation delay and handling latency for autonomous driving traffic compared to best-effort traffic.

AB In the advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) and autonomous driving systems, accurate information on preceding vehicle motion states is vital for the path planning and control. To develop those intelligent driving systems, a modular integrated estimation algorithm for the preceding vehicle longitudinal and lateral states is proposed in this paper, the coupled nonlinear characteristics of vehicle dynamics are applied to improve state estimation accuracy. First, considering driver aggressiveness, a linear moving horizon estimator for the vehicle longitudinal speed is designed based on the car following model. Then, the estimated vehicle longitudinal speed is delivered to the lateral estimator module in real-time. For the arbitrary driving routes, the Serret-Frenet equations and nonlinear lateral dynamics are combined to describe the lateral motion of preceding vehicle. Furthermore, a nonlinear moving horizon estimator is constructed to estimate vehicle lateral states accurately. To reduce the computational burden, the multiple shooting (MS) method is introduced, then the objective function is divided into several segments to improve the strong nonlinearity produced by multiple iterations. The proposed estimation algorithm can effectively handle the initial biases, the additive biases and model error, which are common in the acquired signals, and provide an accurate estimate of preceding vehicle states.

AB The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an emerging paradigm, driven by recent advancements in vehicular communications and networking. Meanwhile, the capability and intelligence of vehicles are being rapidly enhanced, and this will have the potential of supporting a plethora of new exciting applications, which will integrate fully autonomous vehicles, the Internet of Things (IoT), and the environment. In view of the delay-sensitive property of these promising applications, as well as the high expense by using infrastructures and roadside units (RSU), the task offloading among vehicles has gained enormous popularity considering its free-of-charge and timely response. In this paper, by utilizing the gathering period of vehicles in urban environment due to stopped by traffic lights or Area of Interest (AOI), a task offloading scheme merely relying on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is proposed by fully exploring the idle resources of gathered vehicles for task execution. Through formulating the task execution as a Min-Max problem among one task and several cooperative vehicles, the task executing time is optimized with the Max-Min Fairness scheme, which is further solved by the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Algorithm. Extensive simulation demonstrate that our model could well meet the delay requirement of delay-sensitive application by cooperative computing among vehicles.

AB Using self-powered sensors, traffic data may be collected continuously, efficiently, and sustainably once connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are a part of metaverse technology. Metaverse self -powered sensors can capture uninterrupted data that allow for activities such as the management of the traffic network, the optimization of transportation facilities, and the management of urban and intercity journeys to be performed. In addition, metaverse technology creates a new field of study. Evaluating the systems involved in current transportation activities together with the metaverse can increase the efficiency and sustainability of transportation. The main purpose of this study is to prioritize four alternatives of CAVs in metaverse with self-powered sensors using a novel decision making model. The proposed hybrid decision making framework includes two stages. In the first stage the fuzzy full consistency method (fuzzy FUCOM) is applied to find the weighting coefficients of criteria. In the second stage, a fuzzy non-linear model based on fuzzy Aczel-Alsina functions (fuzzy Aczel-Alsina weighted assessment -ALWAS method) is defined to rank the alternatives. Four alternatives are defined and evaluated using twelve different criteria under four headings, namely, technical advancement, environmental, implementation, and financial aspects. A case study has been created for the experts to evaluate the alternatives most effectively. The results of the study indicate that using self-powered sensors for integrating real-time traffic management in the metaverse is the most advantageous alternative.

AB Because photovoltaic (PV) plants require periodic maintenance, using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for inspections can help reduce costs. Usually, the thermal and visual inspection of PV installations works as follows. A UAV equipped with a global positioning system (GPS) receiver is assigned a flight zone, which the UAV will cover back and forth to collect images to be subsequently composed in an orthomosaic. When doing this, the UAV typically flies at a height above the ground that is appropriate to ensure that images overlap even in the presence of GPS positioning errors. However, this approach has two limitations. First, it requires covering the whole flight zone, including "empty" areas between PV module rows. Second, flying high above the ground limits the resolution of the images to be subsequently inspected. The article proposes a novel approach using an autonomous UAV with an RGB and a thermal camera for PV module tracking through segmentation and visual servoing, which does not require a GPS except for measuring the "small" relative displacement between a PV module row and the next one. With this solution, the UAV moves along PV module rows at a lower height than usual and inspects them back and forth in a boustrophedon way by ignoring "empty" areas with no PV modules. Experimental tests performed in simulation and at an actual PV plant are reported, showing a tracking error lower than 0.2 m in most situations when moving at 1.2 m/s.

AB This study is the first in the literature to analytically investigate the traffic dynamics of the integrated morning and evening commutes when daily trips are completed with autonomous vehicles (AVs). Given the parking locations of AVs resulting from the morning commute, firstly we analyse the evening commuting pattern, at which no traveller can reduce the individual travel cost given other AVs' times of departures from the parking spaces. The equilibrium traffic pattern at the evening commute is then integrated with the morning commute, where equilibrium choices of departure time from home and parking location are derived and analysed. We then study the integrated morning-evening commuting pattern at the system optimum and develop the road tolling scheme to achieve the system optimum. Furthermore, this study analyses the optimal AV parking supply strategy to minimise the total system cost, which is comprised of the total social parking cost and the total daily travel cost under either user equilibrium or system optimum traffic pattern. We also illustrate the modelling insights through numerical studies regarding relationship among traffic efficiency, tolling schemes and AV parking supply plans. This study highlights the differences in daily commuting and parking patterns between the AV situation and the non-AV situation, and sheds light on how traffic and parking should be managed or planned in the future.

AB Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) have been studied through analytical dispatch methods and simulation. A common question of interest is how many customers can be served per SAV, which necessarily depends on the network characteristics, travel demand, and dispatch policy. We identify equations that describe the maximum set of demands that could be served if an appropriate dispatch policy were chosen. We then provide a dispatch policy that achieves the predicted level of passenger throughput. This is achieved for a general class of SAV behaviors which may include ridesharing, electric SAV recharging, integration with public transit, or combinations thereof. We accomplish this by defining a Markov chain queueing model which admits general SAV behaviors. We say the network is stable if the head-of-line waiting times remain bounded, which is equivalent to serving all customers at the same rate at which they request service. We give equations characterizing the stable region A - the set of demands that could be served by any dispatch policy. We prove that any demand outside A cannot be completely served. We further prove that our dispatch policy stabilizes the network for any demand in the stable region using Lyapunov drift, establishing A as the maximum set of demand that can be served. Numerical results validate our calculations using simulation, and we present initial results on calculating A for a large city network.

AB In this paper, new methods have been utilized to design and implement PD like fuzzy controllers for naval postgraduate school autonomous underwater vehicle. One of the main challenges for appropriate performance in the fuzzy controllers is to determine the optimal place for the membership functions for each inputs and outputs. Owing to the time variable dynamics, experimental knowledge or offline tuning with dynamic model cannot solve this problem correctly. The proposed method used H-infinity robust filter with optimized covariance matrices for optimization of the membership functions of the designed controllers for heading and depth channels for the first time. Advantages of new investigated method are great convergence velocity and robustness against uncertainties of model and surrounding environment. In simulation results, the proposed method has been compared with extended Kalman filter (EKF), as another optimization approach. Results demonstrate that proposed method has impressive effects on tracking the desired path with dramatical decline in control efforts, which have crucial role in reducing energy consumption in practice, whereas the EKF simply leave its optimality when applying the real world conditions. Also, practical way for implementing designed controllers, multivariable regression analysis has been used. Statistical survey shows, fuzzy controllers can be easily substituted with obtained multivariable polynomials to be implemented in typical microcontrollers or other non-fuzzy hardware. As regarding to stability, passivity approach has been used to proof asymptotic stability of new designed controllers.

AB Looking for parking spaces in crowded areas can be a stressful and time-consuming challenge. With the arrival of technologies like autonomous vehicles (AVs), users can park far away from their destinations. AVs can move from the city center, which has high congestion, into a parking spot outside the area, and thus have more flexibility in choosing the parking location. This study aims to provide a rent bid for the daytime parking of AVs that considers urban land use to evaluate parking strategies possibly chosen by AV users. We determine an actual parking demand function by integrating individual preferences into a p-median problem that controls user optimality. Combining all these together, a novel dynamic optimization formulation is proposed to design the location of parking facilities for AVs that examines the driver's parking preference including rent bid, waiting time for searching parking lots, and travel costs. A Lagrangian relaxation (LR) algorithm is presented to solve the stochastic parking location problem that integrates a reliability strategy to balance demand and supply for parking spaces. The average gap between the exact and the LR solution is about 6% which is very reasonable. We provide a detailed case study of our model with real data generated from daily household travel in New York City. The results show that the average parking price is reduced by 34%, and the average empty trips by AVs decrease by 22% using the proposed public parking strategy.

AB An evolutionary-based path planning is designed for an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) used in environmental monitoring tasks. The main objective is that the ASV covers the maximum area of a large mass of water such as the Ypacarai Lake while taking water samples for sensing pollution conditions. Such coverage problem is transformed into a path planning optimization problem through the placement of a set of data beacons located at the shore of the lake and considering the relationship between the distance traveled by the ASV and the area of the lake covered. The optimal set of beacons to be visited by the ASV has been modeled through two different approaches such as Hamiltonian and Eulerian circuits. When Hamiltonian circuits are used, all the beacons should be visited only once. In the case of Eulerian circuits, the only limitation is that repeated routes cannot exist between two beacons. Both models have important implications on the possible trajectories of ASV throughout the lake. In this paper, we compare the application of both models for the optimization of the proposed evolutionary-based path planning. Due to the complexity of the optimization problem, a metaheuristic technique like a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to obtain quasi-optimal solutions in both models. The models have been compared by simulation and the results reveal that the Eulerian circuit approach can achieve an improvement of 2% when comparing to the Hamiltonian circuit approach.

AB This paper describes a neural network (NN) model of a real vehicle and the associated hybrid learning scheme. The NN vehicle models the actual vehicle dynamic behavior with the architecture of a real-time recurrent network. The NN was trained to predict the next state of the vehicle, given the current vehicle state, the current input steering angle of the front wheel, and the vehicle's speed. A hybrid training scheme for the network has been proposed, which consists of two phases: open-loop training for stabilization of the NN weight learning and closed-loop training for long-term prediction of the vehicle behavior. The open-loop training is necessary to avoid learning instability at initial stages. The closed-loop training then follows in such a way that the NN correctly predicts the vehicle's next state in a recursive mode. The outcome is that the model can correctly generate the vehicle trajectory, given the initial state and the steering and speed sequence of the vehicle. Furthermore, after this training procedure, it not only learns the vehicle's lateral dynamics along the trained trajectories, but can also generalize to similar trajectories. This modeling technique has been successfully applied to model the actual dynamics of a Daewoo Leganza vehicle. It is an intelligent vehicle that is fully autonomous in that steering, braking, and accelerating were all done via computer control. The training data were taken from a four-vehicle platoon demonstration in which four vehicles were automatically controlled in a convoy mode.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) present enormous uncertainties and challenges for future urban transport and mobility. While urban and transportation planning have significant roles to play in shaping these futures, a critical challenge is identifying and reconciling divergent values and competing visions in relation to this potentially disruptive transport technology and the associated mobility services. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of a participatory multi-criteria visioning and appraisal framework and methodology to enable stakeholders to envision, identify and interrogate essential tensions between imagined AV futures and long-term transport and mobility imperatives. Based on workshops with stakeholders at the forefront of policy and practice, and academia in Greater Manchester (UK) and Melbourne (Australia), we reveal several insights. Regarding the prospects of AVs, our participants are neither 'opponents' nor 'evangelists', but instead, manifest the contrasting attitudes and perspectives of excitement, optimism, ambivalence, scepticism and uncertainty all at the same time. In the visions outlined and appraised, our stakeholders identify AVs prospects in various use cases, such as public transport, personal and shared-use and urban freight and delivery applications, while at the same time recognising the inherent contradictions between automated driving futures outlined and imperatives such as reversing auto-mobility and creating safe and inclusive urban environments. Finally, the study brings to the fore the significant role of governance in mediating the politics and resolving contestations in critical areas including data management and privacy, cybersecurity and implementing viable business models and ownership arrangements.

AB Integrating autonomous vehicles (AVs) into transit networks is a critical problem for metropolitan areas worldwide. This study investigates the preferences of urban rail/rapid transit users for firstand last-mile AV services, which are not well understood. First, it develops an access mode choice model incorporating on-demand transit access enabled by AVs. Second, the model is estimated with stated choice data obtained from a survey of 2,300 residents living within 1?5 km of their nearest rail stations in the Tokyo metropolitan area, in which choice tasks are based on recent access to home-end stations. Finally, estimated models are used to compute elasticities of demand for access modes with respect to AV cost and wait time. The results show that price sensitivities of demand for AV services lie within a reasonable range of transit fare elasticities. AVs have diverse substitution patterns with existing modes. Riding in AV services is more likely to be a substitute for riding on buses/in slower modes of transit for all travel purposes, and for driving cars, particularly for leisure trips, but less likely for cycling and walking, particularly for work trips. The AV wait time elasticities might vary according to the waiting environment and conditions. The results also suggest that AVs may particularly benefit those who currently have restrictions in accessing transit.

AB In this paper, simultaneous scheduling and routing problem for autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) is investigated. At the beginning of the planning horizon list of orders is processed in the manufacturing system. The produced or semi-produced products are carried among stations using AGVs according to the process plan and the earliest delivery time rule. Thus, a network of stations and AGV paths is configured. The guide path is bi-direction and AGVs can only stop at the end of a node. Two kinds of collisions exist namely: AGVs move directly to a same node and AGVs are on a same path. Delay is defined as an order is carried after the earliest delivery time. Therefore, the problem is defined to consider some AGVs and material handling orders available and assign orders to AGVs so that collision free paths as cost attribute and minimal waiting time as time attribute, are obtained. Solving this problem leads to determine: the number of required AGVs for orders fulfillment assign orders to AGVs schedule delivery and material handling and route different AGVs. The problem is formulated as a network mathematical model and optimized using a modified network simplex algorithm. The proposed mathematical formulation is first adapted to a minimum cost flow (MCF) model and then optimized using a modified network simplex algorithm (NSA). Numerical illustrations verify and validate the proposed modelling and optimization. Also, comparative studies guarantee superiority of the proposed MCF-NSA solution approach.

AB This paper considers the optimal trajectory tracking control problem for near-surface autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the presence of wave disturbances. An approximate optimal tracking control (AOTC) approach is proposed. Firstly, a six-degrees-of-freedom (six-DOF) AUV model with its body-fixed coordinate system is decoupled and simplified and then a nonlinear control model of AUVs in the vertical plane is given. Also, an exosystem model of wave disturbances is constructed based on Hirom approximation formula. Secondly, the time-parameterized desired trajectory which is tracked by the AUV's system is represented by the exosystem. Then, the coupled two-point boundary value (TPBV) problem of optimal tracking control for AUVs is derived from the theory of quadratic optimal control. By using a recently developed successive approximation approach to construct sequences, the coupled TPBV problem is transformed into a problem of solving two decoupled linear differential sequences of state vectors and adjoint vectors. By iteratively solving the two equation sequences, the AOTC law is obtained, which consists of a nonlinear optimal feedback item, an expected output tracking item, a feedforward disturbances rejection item, and a nonlinear compensatory term. Furthermore, a wave disturbances observer model is designed in order to solve the physically realizable problem. Simulation is carried out by using the Remote Environmental Unit (REMUS) AUV model to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB This paper addresses the problem of autonomous navigation of a micro air vehicle (MAV) in GPS-denied environments. We present experimental validation and analysis for our system that enables a quadrotor helicopter, equipped with a laser range finder sensor, to autonomously explore and map unstructured and unknown environments. The key challenge for enabling GPS-denied flight of a MAV is that the system must be able to estimate its position and velocity by sensing unknown environmental structure with sufficient accuracy and low enough latency to stably control the vehicle. Our solution overcomes this challenge in the face of MAV payload limitations imposed on sensing, computational, and communication resources. We first analyze the requirements to achieve fully autonomous quadrotor helicopter flight in GPS-denied areas, highlighting the differences between ground and air robots that make it difficult to use algorithms developed for ground robots. We report on experiments that validate our solutions to key challenges, namely a multilevel sensing and control hierarchy that incorporates a high-speed laser scan-matching algorithm, data fusion filter, high-level simultaneous localization and mapping, and a goal-directed exploration module. These experiments illustrate the quadrotor helicopter's ability to accurately and autonomously navigate in a number of large-scale unknown environments, both indoors and in the urban canyon. The system was further validated in the field by our winning entry in the 2009 International Aerial Robotics Competition, which required the quadrotor to autonomously enter a hazardous unknown environment through a window, explore the indoor structure without GPS, and search for a visual target.

TI Terrain mobility performance optimization: Fundamentals for autonomous

AB Based on an analysis of vehicle mobility performance indices in use, it is shown that an index for the opti-mization of autonomous vehicle mobility performance should be constituted as a set of technical param-eters that result directly from the interactive dynamics of tires and terrain and should be measurable and controllable in real-time. In addition, the combination of the parameters should characterize the vehicle's technical productivity/efficiency (not energy efficiency), and thus, enable the estimation and control of vehicle mobility performance. If such requirements are satisfied, the index can be optimized and opti-mization results can facilitate autonomous control design. This article provides results of a study to address the above-formulated requirements in the proposed mobility performance index.In Part I of this article, wheel mobility performance is characterized first by the wheel circumferential force and the actual linear velocity. The proposed wheel mobility performance (WMP) index mathemati-cally relates the wheel circumferential force and velocity to the theoretical maximum performance. Thus, the actual performance can be evaluated in terms of the theoretical maximum performance in a similar manner that the actual energy efficiency is compared to its theoretical maximum, i.e., to unity. The WMP-index is then extended to multi-wheel vehicles. The proposed vehicle mobility performance (VMP) index relates the traction and velocity characteristics of all wheels to a theoretical maximum per-formance.Founded on the circumferential force and velocity characteristics of the wheels, the VMP-index math-ematically reflects the influence of the power distribution among the wheels on the vehicle mobility per-formance. Hence, the VMP-optimization is formulated as an examination for the optimal tire slippages. Essentially, their combination characterizes the optimal wheel power split, and consequently, the best set of the wheel circumferential forces and the vehicle actual velocity for the maximum mobility perfor-mance in a given terrain condition. The tire slippages are subject to lower and upper bound constraints. The lower bound ensures positive tire slippages, and thus, positive traction of the wheels. The upper bound is imposed in the form of characteristic slippages such that exceeding them drives the wheels into an extremely nonlinear zone of the traction characteristic. In this zone, the wheel mobility margins drop significantly and some or all wheels can easily be immobilized. Further, the optimization is subject to the vehicle longitudinal dynamics, which sets the summation of the wheel circumferential forces equal to the motion resistance forces.By applying Lagrange Multipliers (LMs) to the objective function, a system of equations is arranged to compute the optimal tire slippages that correspond to the necessary conditions of an extremum of the objective function. The strict monotonicity property of the LM-based equations is then examined and the uniqueness of the solution is exhibited. Finally, the Hessian theory for a constrained optimal problem is used to prove that the solution is globally minimum.Part II discusses the computational results of mobility performance optimization for a 4x4 vehicle sim-ulated on three homogeneous terrains and split terrains on flat surface and on slopes, with and without drawbar pull.
   Additionally, the vehicle with three conventional driveline systems is simulated in the same terrain conditions, and a detailed analysis establishes dependences between the optimal tire slippages and optimal circumferential forces of the wheels and their correlation to those provided by the driveline systems. Advantages of the mobility optimization for control design are explained and discussed. It is also concluded that the use of energy efficiency indices in mobility performance assessment can be considered as a supplementary, but not the primary subject-heading of the vehicle mobility performance.The mobility performance optimization directly contributes to mobility design that is illustrated by con-ceptual implementation of the optimization results in two driveline systems of the 4x4 vehicle: a driveline with positive engagement of the power-dividing units and a virtual driveline that serves for fully electric vehicles with in-wheel motors.Finally, a verification of the mobility optimization results and validation of the proposed mobility perfor-mance index is conducted through statistics-based assessment against experimental wheel circumferen-tial forces and tire slippages.(c) 2022 ISTVS.

AB Generating the drive path for autonomous vehicles represents a significant challenge and requires the vehicle trajectory to be accurately predicted. This study proposes an algebraic analytical method for deriving the general trajectory formula (GTF) of a semitrailer truck. The GTF provides the means to accurately predict the trajectory of any point on the semitrailer truck and is a function of seven parameters: four parameters relating to the semitrailer truck dimensions and three parameters relating to the truck turning conditions. The validity of the proposed GTF is demonstrated by means of an illustrative example. The results confirm that the GTF provides a simple, effective, and accurate method for performing the trajectory prediction of semitrailer truck motion. Note to Practitioners-The inspiration of this article comes from the problem of the semitrailer truck vehicles' difference in the trajectories of the front and rear inner wheels as a vehicle turns, which is defined as the "difference of radius between inner wheels (DRIW)." It should be noted that, in order to determine the DRIW, the trajectory of the rear inner wheel (TRIW) must first be predicted, which is quite complicated. Existing predictions are mostly based on real vehicle testing or curve fitting. However, this study proposes an algebraic general trajectory formula (GTF) for semitrailer trucks based on seven parameters relating to the truck dimensions and truck turning conditions, respectively. The proposed GTF is computationally straightforward and is capable of predicting the trajectory of any point of the truck in real time under almost all realistic turning conditions. Preliminary motion simulation for the TRIW suggests that the GTF is correct, and this approach is feasible. However, the proposed method is only suitable for the truck with a single semitrailer. In future research, we will address the GTF of the truck with multiple semitrailers, and the results will be available for more types of trucks.

AB This paper studies the bearing-based prescribed-time formation keeping control problem of collaborative underactuated autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) systems subject to malicious attacks, model uncertainties and external disturbances. For the leader-follower formation control structure, the leaders usually serve as pace-makers and play dominating role in generating the reference trajectory. On this account, it is imperative to ensure the safety of the leaders when attacks occur. To prevent the breakdown of the formation system from attacks, our control strategy mainly focuses on the following two points: 1) assigning defenders from the collaborative underactuated ASVs system to intercept the oncoming attackers, and 2) ensuring the formation keeping maneuvers of the remaining ASVs to be isolated from the influence arising from the interception mission. With these in mind, a defender allocation algorithm is developed to switch the formation keeping control mode to the interception control mode smoothly when the attackers get close to the leaders. Meanwhile, a bearing -based formation interception control strategy is developed, in which a formation keeping control scheme and an interception control scheme are designed under a unified framework by sharing the same control form and different tracking objectives. Besides, for the sake of a faster convergence rate of the resulting closed-loop system, a dynamic control gain is introduced into the formation keeping control scheme to endow the formation keeping system with a prescribed-time convergence capability. Numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the efficacy of our approach.

AB This paper presents how a post-secondary institution like University of British Columbia's Okanagan (UBCO) campus can reduce its carbon footprint and be aligned with the government's target through promoting virtual campus and autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs). Different virtual campus scenarios are developed: online classes only, working-from-home only, and a hybrid of both. In the case of AEVs, alternative penetration rates for levels 2 and 5 are considered. A total of 50 scenarios are tested using a sub-area transport simulation model for UBCO, which is extracted from the regional travel demand forecasting model. The results suggest that a 40% AEV penetration rate coupled with fully in-person classes reduces GHG by similar to 36% compared to the 2018-level, which will help UBCO to achieve their 2030 emission reduction target and be aligned with the provincial target. The 50% AEV and 10% hybrid virtual campus reduces emissions by similar to 48%, which is aligned with the 2040 provincial target. A fully virtual campus will help to reach the 2050 provincial target by reducing GHG by similar to 76%. The results further demonstrate that level 5 AEVs produce lesser emissions than level 2 at a lower AEV penetration rate for the fully in-person campus scenario. At higher penetration rates, level 5 performs better only if it is coupled with 10% of students, faculties and staffs attending virtual campus scenario.

AB We address a comprehensive ride-hailing system taking into account many of the decisions required to operate it in reality. The ride-hailing system is formed of a centrally managed fleet of autonomous electric vehicles which is creating a transformative new technology with significant cost savings. This problem involves a dispatch problem for assigning riders to cars, a surge pricing problem for deciding on the price per trip and a planning problem for deciding on the fleet size. We use approximate dynamic programming to develop high-quality operational dispatch strategies to determine which car is best for a particular trip, when a car should be recharged, when it should be re-positioned to a different zone which offers a higher density of trips and when it should be parked. These decisions have to be made in the presence of a highly dynamic call-in process, and assignments have to take into consideration the spatial and temporal patterns in trip demand which are captured using value functions. We prove that the value functions are monotone in the battery and time dimensions and use hierarchical aggregation to get better estimates of the value functions with a small number of observations. Then, surge pricing is discussed using an adaptive learning approach to decide on the price for each trip. Finally, we discuss the fleet size problem. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates the distributed time-varying formation control for a swarm of under-actuated autonomous surface vehicles subject to unknown input gains, in addition to model uncertainties and ocean disturbances. The fleet is required to follow a parameterized path with a time-varying formation while avoiding collisions and maintaining connectivity at a complex sea environment. At the kinematic level, a distributed guidance control law is proposed based on a consensus approach, a path-following design, artificial potential functions, and an auxiliary variable approach. At the kinetic level, an adaptive kinetic control law is designed based on an indirect model reference adaptive control approach where a neural estimator is developed for identifying unknown input gains, model uncertainties and ocean disturbances. The stability of the closed-loop system is proven via cascade stability analysis. The advantage of the proposed method is three-folds. First, the developed time-varying formation controller is able to achieve various coordinated behaviors such as cooperative target tracking and target enclosing. Second, the proposed time-varying formation controller is robust against model uncertainties, ocean disturbances and unknown input gains. Third, the proposed distributed controller holds the capability of collision avoidance and connectivity preservation. Simulation results substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed path-guided time-varying formation controllers.

TI Adaptive Channel Estimation Scheme Based on LTE Uplink in V2V

AB Vehicle communication can facilitate efficient coordination among vehicles on the road and enable future vehicular applications such as vehicle safety enhancement, infotainment, or even autonomous driving. In the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), many studies focus on long term evolution (LTE)-based vehicle communication. Because vehicle communication is closely related to safety, it requires low latency and improved reliability. However, vehicle speed is high enough to cause severe channel distortion in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) environments. We can utilize channel estimation methods to approach a reliable vehicle communication systems. Conventional channel estimation schemes can be categorized as least-squares (LS), decision-directed channel estimation (DDCE), spectral temporal averaging (STA), and smoothing methods. In this study, we propose a smart channel estimation scheme in LTE-based V2V environments. The channel estimation scheme, based on an LTE uplink system, uses a demodulation reference signal (DMRS) as the pilot symbol. Unlike conventional channel estimation schemes, we propose an adaptive smoothing channel estimation scheme (ASCE) using quadratic smoothing (QS) of the pilot symbols, which estimates a channel with greater accuracy and adaptively estimates channels in data symbols. In simulation results, the proposed ASCE scheme shows improved overall performance in terms of the normalized mean square error (NMSE) and bit error rate (BER) relative to conventional schemes.

TI All work and no play? Autonomous vehicles and non-commuting journeys

   PRISMA review
ID AUTOMATED VEHICLES; MODE CHOICE; TRAVEL MODE; TIME; PREFERENCE
AB People travel by car for a wide variety of reasons. A large proportion of household travel is for non-commuting purposes, including social and recreational journeys. The emergence and (potential) diffusion of highly automated vehicles, also known as autonomous vehicles (AVs), could transform the way (some) people work and travel. Should they become mainstream, AVs could reshape patterns of leisure travel. To date, however, the impacts and implications of AVs beyond commuting trips have received minimal attention from transport scholarship. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of literatures on AVs. It follows PRISMA guidelines and synthesises 63 papers on AV travel focusing on non-commuting journeys, including travel for purposes of leisure, tourism, shopping and visiting friends and relatives. Given the economic importance of the tourism sector and its inherent focus on non-commuting journeys, this analysis is supplemented with a review of the extent to which national tourism strategies of countries leading AV deployment include reference to AVs. The paper reveals an overwhelming focus on commuting journeys in existing AV studies as less than one-fifth of the reviewed academic sources include non-commuting as part of their wider analysis. The review's further key findings are that the interest of publics in AVs for leisure journeys appears to exceed that for commuting, sharing vehicles will be less likely when AVs are used for leisure and there is an absence of recognition in the literature that certain non-commuting journeys will require a lower SAE level of automation. Surprisingly, analysis of the national tourism strategies of countries most prepared to meet the challenges of AVs shows that just three countries make specific reference to AVs within their national tourism strategies. The paper contributes to setting future AV policy agendas by concluding that two gaps must be narrowed: one, the distance between how academic studies predominantly conceive of AV use (commuting) and articulated public interest in AVs for non-commuting journeys; and two, the lack of readiness in certain national tourism strategies to accommodate AVs. As non-commuting journeys are likely to represent some of the earliest trip purposes for which AVs could be adopted, the paper points to the potential barriers to AV uptake by remaining focused on a limited set of trip purposes.

AB A system-level fault-tolerant design process of a dual-winding three-phase permanent magnet (PM) motor for overheat problem is introduced. Conventional dual-winding three-phase PM motors have been designed with a focus on the redundant system without considering the overheating. However, in the introduced design process, the overheating problem is considered of the motor that occurs in a faulty operation mode in an integrated electric brake (IEB) system. In the design process, the faulty operation mode is investigated in the system level. The design variables are selected as the main components of the IEB system such as the motor and pump piston. Then the selected design variables are optimized to operate without performance degradation even in the faulty operation mode. To analyze the coil temperature rise during the faulty operation mode of a dual winding motor by motor and pump piston size, a lumped-parameter thermal network with piecewise stator-housing modules (LPTN with PSMs) is utilized. In addition, to conduct the optimal design, latin hypercube sampling (LHS), kriging modeling, and a genetic algorithm (GA) are utilized. A prototype of the optimized model is manufactured and tested for verification of design results. It was confirmed that the dual-winding motor for autonomous vehicles, which is robust against overheating, even in faulty operation mode, is well designed.

AB Featured Application Th e study investigates the factors influencing the longitudinal driving distance during the lane-changing process to provide a theoretical basis for the set buffer zone length of future autonomous driving dedicated lanes. With the development of intelligent transportation, dedicated highway lanes for autonomous vehicles (AVs), necessary for ensuring their right of way, have emerged as critical issues in intelligent transportation research, which makes it necessary to set up specialized lane-changing buffer zones in the lane adjacent to the dedicated one. Restricted by the current situation of intelligent transportation systems, based on NGSIM data, this study filters out typical lane-changing description data featuring lane-changing behaviors and constructs a principal component analysis (PCA) model containing factors affecting the longitudinal driving distance during the whole lane-changing procedure. The validity of the model is evaluated with a significance test. Comparing the PCA model to a general linear regression model, suggestions on setting the length of lane-changing buffer zones are put forward. The length of the buffer zone mainly considers speed, acceleration, and the flow in the dedicated lane. In general, a shorter buffer zone length can be achieved by increasing the design speed of the buffer zone, raising the headway of AVs in the dedicated lane, reducing the acceleration rate of lane-changing vehicles, and reducing the time proportion of the lane change preparation stage, which occurs earlier in the procedure.

AB Tracking an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has been regarded as one of the most key applications for Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT). However, the strong mobility of AUV as well as asynchronous clock, stratification effect, and high energy consumption of acoustic communication make it challenging to achieve such a task. To handle the above issues, this article develops a ubiquitous tracking scheme for AUV. The tracking scheme is divided into two stages, i.e.: 1) motion prediction and 2) persistent tracking. In the first stage, an unscented transform-based localization estimator is utilized by sensor nodes to acquire the initial position of AUV, through which a terminal sliding-mode velocity observer is designed to predict the mobility trajectory of AUV. With the predicted mobility trajectory, a minimum rigid-graph-based tracking strategy is developed in the second stage to enable ubiquitously tracking. For the designed tracking strategy, the posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound is selected as the benchmark to optimize the network topology, such that a minimum rigid graph can be generated to balance the tradeoff between tracking accuracy and energy consumption. Particularly, the duty-cycle mechanism and the unscented Kalman filtering are jointly adopted to prolong the network lifetime and improve the tracking accuracy. Finally, simulation and experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of our approach.

AB Bayesian optimization is a sequential method that can optimize a single and costly objective function based on a surrogate model. In this work, we propose a Bayesian optimization system dedicated to monitoring and estimating multiple water quality parameters simultaneously using a single autonomous surface vehicle. The proposed work combines different strategies and methods for this monitoring task, evaluating two approaches for acquisition function fusion: the coupled and the decoupled techniques. We also consider dynamic parametrization of the maximum measurement distance traveled by the ASV so that the monitoring system balances the total number of measurements and the total distance, which is related to the energy required. To evaluate the proposed approach, the Ypacarai Lake (Paraguay) serves as the test scenario, where multiple maps of water quality parameters, such as pH and dissolved oxygen, need to be obtained efficiently. The proposed system is compared with the predictive entropy search for multi-objective optimization with constraints (PESMOC) algorithm and the genetic algorithm (GA) path planning for the Ypacarai Lake scenario. The obtained results show that the proposed approach is 10.82% better than other optimization methods in terms of R2 score with noiseless measurements and up to 17.23% better when the data are noisy. Additionally, the proposed approach achieves a good average computational time for the whole mission when compared with other methods, 3% better than the GA technique and 46.5% better than the PESMOC approach.

ID VISION
AB At present, the realization of autonomous valet parking (AVP) technology does not achieve information interaction between the parking spaces and vehicles, and accurate parking spaces information perception cannot be obtained when the accuracy of the search is not precise. In addition, when using the camera vision to identify the parking spaces, traditional parking space features such as parking lines and parking angles recognition are susceptible to light and environment. Especially when the vehicle nearby partially occupies the parking space to be parked, it is not easy to determine whether it is a valid empty parking space. This paper proposes a parking space recognition method based on parking space features in the scene of AVP. By constructing the multi-dimensional features containing the parking space information, the cameras are used to extract features' contour, locate features' position and recognize features. In this paper, a new similarity calculation formula is proposed to recognize the stained features through template matching algorithm. According to the relative position relationship between the feature and parking space, the identification of effective empty parking spaces and their boundaries is realized. The experimental results show that compared with the recognition of traditional parking lines and parking angles, this method can identify effective empty parking spaces even when the light conditions are complex and the parking spaces are partially occupied by adjacent vehicles, which simplifies the recognition algorithm and improves the reliability of the parking spaces identification.

AB Recently, skeleton-based gesture and action recognition have emerged thanks to the progress in human pose estimation. Gesture representation using skeletal data is robust since skeletal data are invariant to the individual's appearance. Among different approaches proposed for skeleton-based action/gesture recognition, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and its variations have obtained great attention thanks to its ability to capture the graph essence of the skeletal data. In this paper, we aim to design an efficient scheme using relative joints of skeleton sequences adapted in a GCN framework. Both spatial features (i.e., joint positions) and temporal ones (i.e., the velocity of joints) are combined to form the input of Attention-enhanced Adaptive GCN (AAGCN). The proposed framework deals with limitations of the original AAGCN when it works on challenging datasets with incomplete and noisy skeletal data. Extensive experiments are carried out on three datasets CMDFALL, MICA-Action3D, NTU-RGBD. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared with existing methods. Moreover, to illustrate the application of the proposed method in real-time traffic control gesture recognition for autonomous vehicles, we have evaluated the proposed method on the TCG dataset. The obtained results show that the proposed method offers real-time computation capability and good recognition results. These results suggest a promising solution to deploy a real-time and robust recognition technique for gesture-based traffic control in autonomous vehicles.

AB In an autonomous vehicle (AV), in order to efficiently exploit the acquired resources, big data analyses will be a reliable source for extracting valuable information from various sensors and actuators. The data extracted with the combined ability of telematics and real-time investigation forms the vibrant asset for self-driving cars. To demonstrate the significances of big data analysis, this study proposes a competent architecture for real-time big data analysis for an AV, which indeed keeps pace with the latest trends and advancement concerning an emerging paradigm. There are a massive amount of sensors and independent systems needed to be realised for better competence in an AV, and the proposed model focuses on independent sensors that distinguish objects and handles visual information to decide the path. In order to attain the objective as mentioned above, a sensor fusion mechanism is proposed, which combines 3D camera sensor data and Lidar sensor information to provide an optimised solution for path selection. Furthermore, three algorithms, namely overlapping algorithm, sequential adding algorithm, the distance-focused algorithm is designed for higher efficiency in sensor fusion mechanism. The proposed methodology is for the best exploitation of the enormous dataset, meant for real-time processing for an AV.

AB As a special case of multitasking, travel-based multitasking typically refers to conducting a set of in-vehicle activities while traveling. Travel-based multitasking has an indisputable influence on offering a pleasant travel experience to transit users during their rides, given that they can use their travel time to perform desirable activities and gain benefits in various form. For instance, the in-activities could help the rider free up time from his/her schedule for the day (i.e., a worthwhile use of travel time). In this study, we investigate how the worthwhileness of a travel-based multitasking could be under the influence of: (1) the transit user's lifestyle, and (2) sociodemographics, and (3) the characteristics of the transit trip. Towards this, we conducted an intercept survey focusing on the transit trips in the Chicago metropolitan area and analyzed it using latent class modeling approach. Per the results, two classes of transit users could be identified: (1) worthwhileness seekers, productively travelers and (2) leisure seekers, occasional worthwhile travelers. The results also suggest travel time, waiting time and walking distance to the transit station, and the set of in-vehicle activities as significant predictors of worthwhile use of travel time. The findings provide insights to policymakers for improving public transit systems in the current form, as well as designing an autonomous mobility system as the future form of public transit.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have the advantages of improving road safety, enhancing road utilization and reducing exhaust emissions. The CAVs will coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) on the road for a longer period of time. This paper proposes a novel model to mimic the mixed platoon on basic freeway sections. An adaptive control model based on multi-agent system is proposed to model CAVs using vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, and a similar form car-following model is utilized to describe HDVs. The adaptive consensus control and a more flexible, effective and practical spacing policy are embedded into the CAVs control model. Then a unified platoon model is established for the mixed platoon and a distributed cooperative approach is presented. We derive the stability conditions of the mixed platoon system. The performance of the mixed platoon model is numerically tested and verified under different scenarios such as different penetration rates of HDVs, different vehicle orders and different reaction-time delays of drivers.

AB For the battery pack's limited remaining power, two energy-aware ecological driving problems are discussed. A real-time energy-aware ecological driving control strategy is proposed to optimize energy consumption and meet the ECO driving demand. First, the vehicle longitudinal driving dynamics model and energy consumption model are established. Then, the optimal control problem is constructed with the maximum driving distance and the shortest driving time as the objective functions, respectively. With the multinomial Radau pseudo-spectral method, the optimization results of residual power, vehicle speed, and acceleration are obtained. The results show that in the case of in-vehicle driving the remaining power of the battery pack can be sensed in real-time, and the driving of intelligent electric vehicles can be planned in real-time to realize the most ecological driving with the largest driving distance and shortest driving time. The energy consumptions of vehicles, traveling at the same distance, are compared. The consumption obtained through optimization, is 26% less than the consumption of the vehicle that has not been optimized. The results show that the optimization process has certain advantages. In the future, as one of intelligent vehicles' autonomous driving control strategies, the results have guiding and practical significance.

AB This paper proposes a new optimal control method to solve traffic accidents such as vehicle collisions during driver's conscious lane changing under the dangerous state of highway driving and meet the requirements of safety and comfort during vehicle lane changes. First, by directly analyzing the interpolation error and slope of discrete nodes, a new mesh refinement method was used to solve the vehicle optimal lane-changing problem. Then, a simulation of vehicle emergency left and right lane changes was established to verify the proposed method based on a nonlinear 7-DOF vehicle model. Finally, a virtual test using the CarSim software was conducted to verify the feasibility of the simulated results. The simulation results show that the mesh generated by the method in this study is smaller and requires fewer grid iterations, which can quickly and accurately solve the vehicle optimal lane-changing problem with constant components of the optimal control variables and fewer mesh iteration times and node numbers with high accuracy. And also, compared with the traditional Gaussian pseudospectral method(GPM), the solution accuracy of the mesh refinement method is higher than that of the traditional Gaussian pseudospectral method, indicating the superiority of the proposed method.

AB To further enhance decision making in autonomous vehicles field, grant more safety, comfort, reduce traffic, and accidents, learning approaches were adopted, mainly reinforcement learning. However, possibility in upgrading these algorithms is still available due to many limitations including : convergence rate, stability, handling multiple dynamic environments, raw performance, robustness, and complexity of algorithms. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel extension of the well-known deep Q network called "alternative bidirectional Q network" that aims mainly to enhance stability and performance with improving exploration and Q values update policies, to overcome the literature gap that generally focuses on only one policy to handle decision making in multiple scenarios (avoiding obstacles, goal-oriented environments, etc.). In "alternative bidirectional Q network," data about previous, current, and upcoming states are used to update the Q values where the actions are selected according to the relation between these data to handle several scenarios: highways, merges, roundabouts, and parking. This concept provides reinforcement learning agents with more balance between exploration and exploitation and enhances stability during learning. A gym simulator was adopted for training and testing the proposed algorithm's outcome, while various state-of-the-art algorithms were used as benchmark models. The performance of the proposed extension was evaluated using several metrics being: loss, accuracy, speed, and reward values, where the results of comparison showed the superiority of the novel extension in all scenarios for most of the exploited metrics. The experiment results were confirmed using the complexity and the robustness aspects.

AB This paper presents a microscopic vehicle guidance model which adapts to different levels of vehicle automation. Independent of the vehicle, the driver model built is different from the common microscopic simulation models that regard the driver and the vehicle as a unit. The term "Vehicle Guidance Model" covers, here, both the human driver as well as a combination of human driver and driver assistance system up to fully autonomously operated vehicles without a (human) driver. Therefore, the vehicle guidance model can be combined with different kinds of vehicle models. As a result, the combination of different types of driver (human/machine) and different types of vehicle (internal combustion engine/electric) can be simulated. Mainly two parts constitute the vehicle guidance model in this paper: the first part is a traditional microscopic car-following model adjusted according to different degrees of automation level. The adjusted model represents the automation level for the present and the near and the more distant future. The second part is a fuzzy control model that describes how humans adjust the pedal position when they want to reach a target speed with their vehicle. An experiment with 34 subjects was carried out with a driving simulator based on the experimental data and the fuzzy control strategy was determined. Finally, when comparing the simulated model data and actual driving data, it is found that the fuzzy model for the human driver can reproduce the behavior of human participants almost accurately.

AB This study proposes a trajectory planning method for an automated lane change maneuver. We consider that the spatiotemporal trajectory of a controlled vehicle can be represented by a polynomial function and estimate the parameters of the polynomial function through nonlinear programming that does not rely on the assumed time horizon of lane change and the assumed final state of the controlled vehicle. When the controlled vehicle achieves its target lane, the state of this vehicle should be constrained by both the position and the speed of the forward vehicle. We integrate a car-following model into the nonlinear programming to constrain the state of the controlled vehicle at the end of the lane change. Notably, the interaction factors are taken into consideration: the motion of the vehicle that follows the controlled vehicle in the target lane can be influenced by the trajectory planning results of the controlled vehicle. The proposed trajectory planning method can simultaneously estimate the motion of the following vehicle and plan the trajectory for the controlled vehicle. Our proposed model can also work for curved road sections. We represent the curve information in the nonlinear programming by a regression model. We solve the nonlinear programming through the sequential quadratic program (SQP) algorithm and design a method to specify an initial guess for the algorithm. This paper finally demonstrates the effect of the proposed trajectory planning method under different scenarios.

   congestion
AB Congestion is an ongoing problem for many urban centres worldwide (such as London), leading to excessive delays, noise and air pollution, frustrated drivers, and high energy consumption. The carbon footprint of conventional transport systems can be high as a result and transport is among the highest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, with the growing interest in developing connected fully autonomous vehicles (ConFAVs), there is a pressing need to consider their effects within the congested urban setting. To address this, the current research study was designed to investigate the potential for ConFAVs in providing a sustainable transport solution. During this research, a simulation model was developed, calibrated, and validated using field data collected from several sites in East London, using the graphical user interface (GUI) simulation software PTV VISSIM to simulate the proposed driving and car following behaviour, which included the platooning of these ConFAVs, to assess how they could improve the level of service of the roads. Using the new model, this research addresses the shortcomings of two other adaptations of the Wiedemann 99 car-following models by changing the ConFAV's behaviour to be more cautious when travelling behind a human driven vehicle, and less cautious when behind another ConFAV. As little is known about the transitional period from zero autonomy to full autonomy on the already congested road network, due to the fact that these vehicles are typically tested in small numbers (often one at a time in a controlled environment), the present research study introduced ConFAVs to the simulated network gradually and in large numbers at 20% intervals (namely 0% where there are no ConFAVs, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and finally 100% where all vehicles within the network were ConFAVs). The average delays and subsequent level of service for the roads within the networks were then assessed against each ConFAV penetration level. This helped understand how the network's efficiency changes when the number of ConFAVs increases, and the potential benefits for these self-driving vehicles on congestion and the ensuing greenhouse gas emissions. The model showed that a reduction in delay of up to 100% can be achieved by introducing ConFAVs, which translates to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. This, coupled with the fact that ConFAVs are predominantly electric, points to a future sustainable road transport system. The primary purpose of this research would be to investigate the potential of ConFAVs in reducing traffic congestion and, as a result, greenhouse gas emissions.

AB With the recent advances and wide availability of heterogeneous wireless access technologies, inter vehicle communication systems are expected to culminate in the integration of different wireless networks based on such standards as 5G/6G, coupling with multimedia and sensor networks for the next generation of connected and autonomous vehicles. However, the high mobility nature of vehicles poses intrinsic research challenges on the mobility management and the integration of different wireless technologies. Towards this end, in this paper, we propose an ADaptive VehIcle-CEntric LOCation management protocol (ADVICE-LOC) that utilizes the individual mobility projection of each vehicle and estimates the vehicles' residual time within each access point. Its ultimate objective is to eliminate the network communication's overhead, while guaranteeing a high packet delivery ratio and low latency rates. The proposed protocol preemptively adjusts the vehicles' access registration and location updates based on its movement projections. We present our protocol, and we report on its performance evaluation using an extensive set of experiments using SUMO generated vehicles' mobility. Our results indicate that the proposed DEVICE-LOC protocol succeed significantly in reducing the communication overhead while sustaining high packet delivery ratio when compared to previous studies.

AB Ride-hailing services using shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEVs) are soon expected to serve a significant portion of the public transportation demands, especially in metropolitan cities. The transportation demands will arise randomly across all transportation nodes and during all hours of operation. This spatio-temporal nature of the transportation demand together with the constraints of trip length, battery size and consumption rate, and power network will guide the actions of the SAEVs. These actions are pair-with-demand, park, charge, and relocate, which in turn will determine the necessary infrastructure plan for ride-hailing services. The plan will comprise SAEV fleet size, charging hub locations across the nodes of the transportation network, and the number of charging stations in each hub. We formulate a profit-maximizing mixed integer linear model comprising a space-time-battery representation of the transportation network and a DC power flow representation of the power network. The model, intended for developing infrastructure plans for ride-hailing services, is robustified to accommodate randomness in travel and electric power demand. The model solution is demonstrated via an illustrative numerical case study representing the Tampa Bay region of Florida, USA. The results show how the infrastructure plans and their profitability depend on the demand fulfillment goal, battery size, battery consumption rate, and power network configurations. A linear relaxation of some of the integer variables of the model to reduce computational time is discussed.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based autonomous damage inspection has become a promising technique to replace certain human-performed inspections due to both safety and cost consid-erations. While current UAV-based damage inspection methods have been successful in mini-mizing the length of the flying path considering potential defect locations, the impact of flying path on the quality of structural health monitoring (SHM) has been overlooked. This paper proposes a novel Bayes risk-based mission planning method for UAV-based damage inspection by minimizing not only the UAV path length, but also the associated SHM costs. A functional rela-tionship is first established between the UAV flying path length and damage inspection param-eters, such as overlap ratio and inspection distance between the UAV and the target structure. The impact of UAV inspection parameters on associated SHM costs is then analyzed based on Bayes risk. Building upon the formulated functions, a multi-objective optimization model is developed to optimize the inspection parameters and thereby achieve a tradeoff between path length of UAV flight and associated SHM costs (e.g., consequence costs of SHM decisions resulting from the UAV inspection). An example of damage detection on a miter gate is employed to demonstrate the proposed method. The effect of different weighting factors on flying path and SHM costs is also evaluated. The results show that the proposed approach can effectively perform UAV mission planning while accounting for the impact of UAV flying path on SHM costs.

AB Recently, as UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) have become smaller and higher-performance, they play a very important role in the Internet of Things (IoT). Especially, UAVs are currently used not only in military fields but also in various private sectors such as IT, agriculture, logistics, construction, etc. The range is further expected to increase. Drone-related techniques need to evolve along with this change. In particular, there is a need for the development of an autonomous system in which a drone can determine and accomplish its mission even in the absence of remote control from a GCS (Ground Control Station). Responding to such requirements, there have been various studies and algorithms developed for autonomous flight systems. Especially, many ML-based (Machine-Learning-based) methods have been proposed for autonomous path finding. Unlike other studies, the proposed mechanism could enable autonomous drone path finding over a large target area without size limitations, one of the challenges of ML-based autonomous flight or driving in the real world. Specifically, we devised Multi-Layer HVIN (Hierarchical VIN) methods that increase the area applicable to autonomous flight by overlaying multiple layers. To further improve this, we developed Fisheye HVIN, which applied an adaptive map compression ratio according to the drone's location. We also built an autonomous flight training and verification platform. Through the proposed simulation platform, it is possible to train ML-based path planning algorithms in a realistic environment that takes into account the physical characteristics of UAV movements.

AB Autonomous cars are currently widely studied in the automotive and robotics industries because autonomous driving can satisfy the needs of human drivers regarding safety, efficiency, and comfortable driving. Behavior and motion planning for an autonomous car is one of the main requirements of autonomous driving. For autonomous cars, a local route along with its road geometry and attributes of the area is required. There are two ways to obtain the local route: perception-based local route (PBLR) and precise map-based local route (MBLR) methods. First, this paper analyzes the characteristic of both the PBLR and MBLR inference methods. Then based on this analysis, this paper proposes a hybrid local route generation algorithm that chooses the best local route between the PBLR and MBLR options, according to the perceived performance and the precise map availability. To effectively create an expensive precise map, a mapping region classification algorithm is presented to selectively choose the mapping area, where the precise map must be constructed for the MBLR inference. The hybrid local route generation algorithm with the mapping region classification allows the area used for autonomous driving to be extended while reducing the cost due to the precise map. The advantages of the proposed algorithm were verified with experiments in real traffic conditions.

AB Mobility is essential for maintaining human well-being, as it aids in accessing basic needs and engaging in social activities. For older adults who drive, driving provides a sense of independence and convenience, allowing them to go wherever and whenever necessary. However, the declining physical condition and cognitive functions of older adults may eventually hinder their ability to drive safely. In Japan, many older drivers prefer to continue driving unless they are officially deemed unfit, reach a certain age, or have someone drive for them. To shed light on the mobility challenges faced by Japan's older adults, we analyzed data from the Japanese Study of Aging and Retirement (JSTAR) survey using exploratory analysis methods such as multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and nonparametric tests. The results revealed relatively strong relationships be-tween car ownership and self-rated health status, the number of years lived in the current mu-nicipality, and the working status of older adults. Furthermore, we identified a higher level of independence, as well as a positive attitude and tendency to give and receive help running er -rands, among older adults who own at least one car. To assist older drivers in maintaining their mobility and the positive social effects associated with car ownership, this study discusses the potential role of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Specifically, we support the car-sharing business model to lower the financial commitment of older Japanese drivers while providing access to this technology.

ID NODE PLACEMENT; ALGORITHM; STRATEGIES
AB For efficient monitoring of marine environments using underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), a fundamental issue is to maximize network coverage as well as connectivity by appropriate deployment of the nodes within a given sensing area. Most of the existing node deployment schemes proposed for UWSNs, assume that sensor nodes are static and their location after deployment are fixed. However, due to ocean current and the contact of the underwater creatures, these deployed static sensor node moves from its original locations to other locations, which disrupts the network connectivity with the base stations as well as most of the targets remain uncovered. To find a solution to this issue, authors propose a coverage and connectivity aware deployment scheme for optimal placement of a set of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) within UWSNs. The proposed scheme uses an improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II based metaheuristic technique with a novel fitness function which contains three parameters namely coverage quality, connected cost and network lifetime. Further, proposed scheme applies an effective encoding scheme for the population representation and devises a novel fitness function for upgrading the quantity of the AUVs as well as their location. Performance estimation of the proposed scheme and its comparison with the existing schemes with respect to convergence rate, coverage quality, connected cost, average energy consumption and network lifetime are discussed in detail. The simulation outcome confirm that the proposed approach upgrades the coverage of the network.

AB Purpose
   With the continuous technological development of automated driving and expansion of its application scope, the types of on-board equipment continue to be enriched and the computing capabilities of on-board equipment continue to increase and corresponding applications become more diverse. As the applications need to run on on-board equipment, the requirements for the computing capabilities of on-board equipment become higher. Mobile edge computing is one of the effective methods to solve practical application problems in automated driving.
   Design/methodology/approach
   In this study, in accordance with practical requirements, this paper proposed an optimal resource management allocation method of autonomous-vehicle-infrastructure cooperation in a mobile edge computing environment and conducted an experiment in practical application.
   Findings
   The design of the road-side unit module and its corresponding real-time operating system task coordination in edge computing are proposed in the study, as well as the method for edge computing load integration and heterogeneous computing. Then, the real-time scheduling of highly concurrent computation tasks, adaptive computation task migration method and edge server collaborative resource allocation method is proposed. Test results indicate that the method proposed in this study can greatly reduce the task computing delay, and the power consumption generally increases with the increase of task size and task complexity.
   Originality/value
   The results showed that the proposed method can achieve lower power consumption and lower computational overhead while ensuring the quality of service for users, indicating a great application prospect of the method.

AB Pine Island Glacier Ice Shelf (PIGIS) has been thinning rapidly over recent decades, resulting in a progressive drawdown of the inland ice and an upstream migration of the grounding line. The resultant ice loss from Pine Island Glacier (PIG) and its neighboring ice streams presently contributes an estimated approximate to 10% to global sea level rise, motivating efforts to constrain better the rate of future ice retreat. One route toward gaining a better understanding of the processes required to underpin physically based projections is provided by examining assemblages of landforms and sediment exposed over recent decades by the ongoing ungrounding of PIG. Here we present high-resolution bathymetry and sub-bottom-profiler data acquired by autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) surveys beneath PIGIS in 2009 and 2014, respectively. We identify landforms and sediments associated with grounded ice flow, proglacial and subglacial sediment transport, overprinting of lightly grounded ice-shelf keels, and stepwise grounding line retreat. The location of a submarine ridge (Jenkins Ridge) coincides with a transition from exposed crystalline bedrock to abundant sediment cover potentially linked to a thick sedimentary basin extending upstream of the modern grounding line. The capability of acquiring high-resolution data from AUV platforms enables observations of landforms and understanding of processes on a scale that is not possible in standard offshore geophysical surveys.

AB Microscopic detail of complex vehicle interactions in mixed traffic, involving manual driving system (MDS) and automated driving system (ADS), is imperative in determining the extent of response by ADS vehicles in the connected automated vehicle (CAV) environment. In this context, this paper proposes a naive microscopic car-following strategy for a mixed traffic stream in CAV settings and specified shifts in traffic mobility, safety, and environmental features. Additionally, this study explores the influences of platoon properties (i.e., intra-platoon headway, inter-platoon headway, and maximum platoon length) on traffic stream characteristics. Different combinations of MDS and ADS vehicles are simulated in order to understand the variations of improvements induced by ADS vehicles in a traffic stream. Simulation results reveal that grouping ADS vehicles at the front of traffic stream to apply Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) based car-following model will generate maximum mobility benefits for upstream vehicles. Both mobility and environmental improvements can be realized by forming long, closely spaced ADS vehicles at the cost of reduced safety. To achieve balanced mobility, safety, and environmental advantages from mixed traffic environment, dynamically optimized platoon configurations should be determined at varying traffic conditions and ADS market penetrations.

AB The addition of manipulators to small autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can pose significant control challenges due to hydrodynamic interactions between the arm and the vehicle. Experiments conducted at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) using the OTTER vehicle have shown that dynamical interactions between an arm and a vehicle can be very significant. For the experiments reported in this paper, a single-link ''arm'' was mounted on OTTER. Tests showed that for 90-degree, two-second repetitive slews of the arm, the vehicle would move as much as 18 degrees in roll and 14 degrees in yaw when no vehicle control was applied.
   Using a new, highly accurate model of the arm/vehicle hydrodynamic interaction forces, which was developed as part of this research, a coordinated arm/vehicle control strategy was implemented. Under this model-based approach, interaction forces acting on the vehicle due to arm motion were predicted and fed into the vehicle controller. Using this method, station-keeping capability was greatly enhanced. Errors at the manipulator end point were reduced by over a factor of six when compared to results when no control was applied to the vehicle and by a factor of 2.5 when compared to results from a standard independent arm and vehicle feedback control approach. Using the coordinated-control strategy, arm end-point settling times were reduced by a factor three when compared to those obtained with arm and vehicle feedback control alone. These dramatic performance improvements were obtained with only a five-percent increase in total applied thrust.

AB Choosing appropriate scenarios is critical for autonomous vehicles (AVs) safety testing. Real-world crash scenarios can be used as critical scenarios to test the safety performance of AVs. As one of the dominant types of traffic crashes, the car to powered-two-wheelers (PTWs) crash results in a higher possibility of fatality than ordinary car-to-car crashes. Generally, typical testing scenarios are chosen according to the subjective understanding of the safety experts with limited static features of crashes (e.g., geometric features, weather). This study introduced a novel method to identify typical car-to-PTWs crash scenarios based on real-world crashes with dynamic pre-crash features investigated from the China In-depth Mobility Safety Study-Traffic Accident (CIMSSTA) database. First, we present crash data collection and construction methods of the CIMSS-TA database to construct testing scenarios. Second, the stacked autoencoder methods are used to learn and obtain embedded features from the high-dimensional data. Third, the extracted features are clustered using k-means clustering algorithm, and then the clustering results are interpreted. Six typical car-to-PTWs scenarios are obtained with the proposed processes. This study introduces a typical high-risk scenario construction method based on deep embedded clustering. Unlike existing researches, the proposed method eliminates the negative impacts of manually selecting clustering variables and provides a more detailed scenario description. As a result, the typical scenarios obtained from AV testing are more robust.

AB This paper is concerned with distributed coordinated control of networked autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) guided by multiple parameterized paths. The model of each ASV is subject to fully unknown kinetics, including environment disturbances, model uncertainties, and unknown input coefficients. A coordinated control method is presented for multiple ASVs to achieve a containment formation based on event-triggered mechanisms. Specifically, an event-triggered kinematic control law is firstly developed based on aperiodic communication. The desired path during the triggering interval is predicted by the last event-triggered velocity. Then, an eventtriggered kinetic control law is developed, a third-order linear tracking differentiator is introduced to take the derivative of the kinematic control law, and the control input is updated only if the predefined event is triggered. A concurrent-learning-based neural predictor is constructed by using historical data such that model uncertainties and unknown input coefficients are identified simultaneously. Next, an event-triggered path update law is constructed by using a path-maneuvering design and the aperiodic information received from the network. The proposed method ensures the input-to-state stability of the resulting closed-loop system. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed coordinated control for networked ASVs by using event-triggered mechanisms and concurrent-learning-based neural predictors.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have been designed to make changes in the travel behaviour of travellers. These changes can be interpreted using transport models and simulation tools. In this study, the daily activity plans were used to study the possibility of increasing the utility of travellers through minimizing the travel time by using AVs. Three groups of travellers were selected based on the benefits that they can obtain when A Vs are on the market. The groups are (a) long-trip travellers (b) public transport riders, and (c) travellers with specified characteristics. Each group is divided into one or more scenarios based on the definition of each group and the collected data. A total of seven scenarios were derived from the collected data and simulated twice to include the existing transport modes and the presence of AVs. The simulations were conducted using Multi-Agents Transport Simulation (MAT Sim) that applies the concept of a co-evolutionary algorithm. M4TSim simulates the current plans and the ones where AVs replace all or part of the existing conventional transport modes in the daily activity plans. The results have shown a reduction in the trip time: 13% to 42% for group (a), 33% for group (b), and 16% to 28% for group (c) compared with the original trip times. In conclusion, it can be claimed that A Vs could reduce the travel time in all cases, which provides benefits for people to increase their utilities.

AB With the wide bandwidths in millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band that results in unprecedented accuracy, mmWave sensing has become vital for many applications, especially in autonomous vehicles (AVs). In addition, mmWave sensing has superior reliability compared to other sensing counterparts such as camera and LiDAR, which is essential for safety-critical driving. Therefore, it is critical to understand the security vulnerabilities and improve the security and reliability of mmWave sensing in AVs. To this end, we perform the end-to-end security analysis of a mmWave-based sensing system in AVs, by designing and implementing practical physical layer attack and defense strategies in a state-of-the-art mmWave testbed and an AV testbed in real-world settings. Various strategies are developed to take control of the victim AV by spoofing its mmWave sensing module, including adding fake obstacles at arbitrary locations and faking the locations of existing obstacles. Five real-world attack scenarios are constructed to spoof the victim AV and force it to make dangerous driving decisions leading to a fatal crash. Field experiments are conducted to study the impact of the various attack scenarios using a Lincoln MKZ-based AV testbed, which validate that the attacker can indeed assume control of the victim AV to compromise its security and safety. To defend the attacks, we design and implement a challenge-response authentication scheme and a RF fingerprinting scheme to reliably detect aforementioned spoofing attacks.

ID PATH-FOLLOWING CONTROLLER; VESSELS
AB Navigation of autonomous surface vessels, less than 20 m in length, in large sea states is difficult and often precludes successful completion of the assigned mission or, in the worst case, survivability. Operation in high seas requires sensing of the local wave environment and determining a vessel trajectory that maximizes survivability based on knowledge of the vessel response functions and prediction of the incident wave field forward in time. To achieve this objective, new technologies are being developed and tested in full scale at the Marine Autonomy Research Site (MARS), located in central Lake Superior and operated by Michigan Technological University. In this initial set of experiments, a skilled human operator was used as a surrogate for an envisioned wave-adaptive autonomous control system. The test vehicle is a fully instrumented personal watercraft, operated by a U.S. Coast Guard-trained surf-boat operator in moderate sea states with Froude number (Fr) = 1.0 through a course consisting of upwave, cross-wave, and down-wave legs. Results dramatically document that the wave-dodging maneuvers employed are designed to minimize vessel pitch (preserve propulsor and rudder control) while allowing increased vessel roll. Comparisons of the straight line with wave-dodging circuits during constant sea state conditions show that vehicle roll is at times twice greater in wave-dodging runs while vehicle pitch averages half to one third of that in the straight-line course. These data suggest that optimum paths do exist through steep, evolving incident wave fields and these optimum paths can produce significant improvements in vessel survivability.

AB In the vehicular mixed reality (MR) Metaverse, the discrepancy between physical and virtual entities can be overcome by fusing the physical and virtual environments with multi-dimensional communications in autonomous driving systems. Assisted by digital twin (DT) technologies, connected autonomous vehicles (AVs), roadside units (RSUs), and virtual simulators can maintain the vehicular MR Metaverse via simulations for sharing data and making driving decisions collaboratively. However, it is challenging and costly to enable large-scale traffic and driving simulation via realistic data collection and fusion from the physical world for online prediction and offline training in autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we propose an autonomous driving architecture, where generative AI is leveraged to synthesize unlimited conditioned traffic and driving data via simulations for improving driving safety and traffic control efficiency. First, we propose a multi-task DT offloading model for the reliable execution of heterogeneous DT tasks with different requirements at RSUs. Then, based on the preferences of AV's DTs and real-world data, virtual simulators can synthesize unlimited conditioned driving and traffic datasets for improved robustness. Finally, we propose a multi-task enhanced auction-based mechanism to provide fine-grained incentives for RSUs on providing resources for autonomous driving. The property analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism and architecture are strategy-proof and effective.

AB Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) in Intelligent and Connected Vehicles (ICVs) has drawn great attention in recent years due to its potentially significant positive impacts on the automotive revolution and travel experience. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth review of HMI in ICVs. Firstly, research and application development status are pointed out through the discussion on the cutting-edge technology classification, achievements, and challenges of the HMI technologies in ICVs, including recognition technology, multi-dimensional human vehicle interface, and emerging in-vehicle intelligent units. Then, the human factors issues of ICVs are discussed from three aspects: ICV acceptance, interaction quality of ICVs, and user experience of ICVs. Besides, based on the interaction technology and the mapping of the above issues, we conducted a visual analysis of the literature to realize the reflective thinking of the current HMI in ICVs. Finally, the challenges of HMI technology in ICVs are summarized. Moreover, the promising future opportunities are proposed from three aspects: utility optimization, experience reconfiguration, and value acquisition, to gaining insight into advanced and pleasant HMI in ICVs.

AB Extended transit time and increased consumer expectations arouse an interest in passenger comfort research. Few studies have been conducted on passenger comfort of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV) traffic flow, thereby leaving a research gap. This paper focuses on filling this research gap and evaluating CAV impact on passenger comfort from the traffic flow perspective. Specifically, optimal stability of traffic flow mixed with Manual Driven Vehicles (MDV) and CAV is desired to improve passenger comfort. For describing stability condition of the mixed traffic flow, in which multiple connected feedbacks of CAV exist with Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications, local vehicular platoons with uniform structure are considered to be the optimization objective. Its stability charts with respect to equilibrium speeds and CAV feedback gains are calculated based on transfer function theory, thereby controlling CAV feedback gains for optimal stability. The CAV impact on the passenger comfort is evaluated under optimal control results of CAV feedback gains, by using numerical simulations under car-following models. It is indicated that stability optimization benefits passenger comfort of the mixed CAV traffic flow.

TI COVID-19 and public support for autonomous technologies-Did the pandemic
   catalyze a world of robots?
SO PLOS ONE

ID UNITED-STATES; SCIENCE; PEOPLE
AB By introducing a novel risk to human interaction, COVID-19 may have galvanized interest in uses of artificial intelligence (AI). But was the pandemic a large enough catalyst to change public attitudes about the costs and benefits of autonomous systems whose operations increasingly rely on AI? To answer this question, we use a preregistered research design that exploits variation across the 2018 and 2020 waves of the CCES/CES, a nationally representative survey of adults in the United States. We compare support for autonomous cars, autonomous surgeries, weapons, and cyber defense pre- and post-the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that, despite the incentives created by COVID-19, the pandemic did not increase support for most of these technologies, except in the case of autonomous surgery among those who know someone who died of COVID-19. The results hold even when controlling for a variety of relevant political and demographic factors. The pandemic did little to push potential autonomous vehicle users to support adoption. Further, American concerns about autonomous weapons, including cyber defense, remain sticky and perhaps exacerbated over the last two years. These findings suggest that the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and the adoption of many of these systems is far more nuanced and complex than headlines may suggest.

AB Presently, autonomous systems have gained considerable attention in several fields such as transportation, healthcare, autonomous driving, logistics, etc. It is highly needed to ensure the safe operations of the autonomous system before launching it to the general public. Since the design of a completely autonomous system is a challenging process, perception and decision-making act as vital parts. The effective detection of objects on the road under varying scenarios can considerably enhance the safety of autonomous driving. The recently developed computational intelligence (CI) and deep learning models help to effectively design the object detection algorithms for environment perception depending upon the camera system that exists in the autonomous driving systems. With this motivation, this study designed a novel computational intelligence with a wild horse optimization-based object recognition and classification (CIWHO-ORC) model for autonomous driving systems. The proposed CIWHO-ORC technique intends to effectively identify the presence of multiple static and dynamic objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, signboards, etc. Additionally, the CIWHO-ORC technique involves the design of a krill herd (KH) algorithm with a multi-scale Faster RCNN model for the detection of objects. In addition, a wild horse optimizer (WHO) with an online sequential ridge regression (OSRR) model was applied for the classification of recognized objects. The experimental analysis of the CIWHO-ORC technique is validated using benchmark datasets, and the obtained results demonstrate the promising outcome of the CIWHO-ORC technique in terms of several measures.

AB The increasing prevalence of cyber-attacks on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has led to research on effective detection methods. However, current approaches often lack transferability and interoperability, which limits their effectiveness. This study proposes a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention (CBA) model for efficient attack detection using real-time UAV sensor data. Additionally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method is used to improve the interpretability of the model. The proposed approach is tested on real attack scenarios, including denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and global positioning system (GPS) spoofing attacks, and demonstrates both effectiveness and interpretability.

AB This paper proposes an optimization-based planning framework for target tracking of a planar vehicle in the presence of some moving obstacles and uncertainty resources. The framework is modeled based on Linear-Time Varying Model Predictive Control (LTV-MPC). Moreover, a successive linearization approach is presented to formulate the obstacle avoidance mission as a set of linear constraints. Finally this LTV-MPC problem is translated to a close-form convex optimization problem by applying some mathematical and algebraic simplifications. Simulation results show beneficially of the proposed path planning method to navigate an autonomous vehicle successfully regardless of different uncertainty resources.

AB An overall framework of the virtual testing system has been established based on the analysis of the virtual testing requirements for autonomous navigation performance of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). This system consists of several modules, including the environment module, motion module, sensor module, and 3D visualization module. Firstly, within the robot operating system (ROS) environment, a three-dimensional navigation environment was generated by combining actual wave spectra with Gerstner waves. By designing a power plugin for USV navigation, the system was made to reflects the coupled motion model of USVs in wind, waves and currents, along with predictive results. Regarding the four typical sensor information on USVs, the actual sensors were virtualized, and a simulation approach for virtual sensor information is provided. The three-dimensional visualization of USV's motion enables the intuitive display and analysis of the virtual testing process. Based on the prediction of coupled motion characteristics in wind, waves and currents, the interaction between USVs and the virtual testing system has been realized. A platform for virtual testing experiments to determine the autonomous navigation performance of USVs was established, and the effectiveness of the platform was verified in terms of perception and environmental interference. In virtual environmental interference validation, the average amplitude deviation of the heave motion of USVs under sea state 3 reaches 0.74 m, and the average amplitude deviation of the pitch motion reaches 0.25 rad, showing the gradually increasing disturbance of the sea state. Finally, virtual testing experiments were conducted on a specific USV to evaluate its autonomous navigation perception performance, trajectory tracking performance, and autonomous obstacle avoidance. The evaluation results indicate that the platform can achieve the functionality of virtual testing for the autonomous navigation performance of USVs from the perspective of cost function, taking the reaction distance, regression distance, and obstacle avoidance time into consideration. A representative example is that the cost function deviation rates of overtaking obstacle avoidance between static and dynamic seas reach 5.11%, 8.98% and 18.43%, respectively. The gradually increasing data shows that the virtual simulating method matches the drifting-off-course tendency of boats in rough seas. This includes acquiring perception information of navigation and simulating the motion and navigation processes for visualization. The platform provides new means for testing and evaluating the autonomous navigation performance of USVs.

AB In this work, we present an attention-based encoder-decoder model to approximately solve the team orienteering problem with multiple depots (TOPMD). The TOPMD instance is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem that involves multiple agents (or autonomous vehicles) and not purely Euclidean (straight line distance) graph edge weights. In addition, to avoid tedious computations on dataset creation, we provide an approach to generate synthetic data on the fly for effectively training the model. Furthermore, to evaluate our proposed model, we conduct two experimental studies on the multi-agent reconnaissance mission planning problem formulated as TOPMD. First, we characterize the model based on the training configurations to understand the scalability of the proposed approach to unseen configurations. Second, we evaluate the solution quality of the model against several baselines--heuristics, competing machine learning (ML), and exact approaches, on several reconnaissance scenarios. The experimental results indicate that training the model with a maximum number of agents, a moderate number of targets (or nodes to visit), and moderate travel length, performs well across a variety of conditions. Furthermore, the results also reveal that the proposed approach offers a more tractable and higher quality (or competitive) solution in comparison with existing attention-based models, stochastic heuristic approach, and standard mixed-integer programming solver under the given experimental conditions. Finally, the different experimental evaluations reveal that the proposed data generation approach for training the model is highly effective.

AB This paper proposes three route control strategies for autonomous vehicles (AVs) exiting to off-ramps. First, two microscopic lane-changing models are developed to simulate the off-ramp behaviors for AVs. A risk factor A. is introduced in the discretionary lane-changing (DLC) model, and a five-step process is developed for the mandatory lane-changing (MLC) model. Second, three route control strategies are presented, i.e., grading strategy (GS), half-overlap strategy (HOS), and full-overlap strategy (FOS). Finally, the extensive numerical simulations are conducted to analyze the characteristics of each strategy based on the MATLAB platform. The results indicate that the studied area displays significant variability in spatiotemporal dynamics of average velocity and road capacity under different strategies. It is found that the GS is the mast effective control strategy for traffic congestion dissipation and travel delay reduction, followed by the HOS and, then, the FOS. The road capacity under the GS is increased by 19.1% and 7.8% compared to the FOS and the HOS, respectively. Furthermore, the GS consumes lower costs in terms of safety, travel efficiency, and route and lane switch frequency compared to the HOS and FOS, which is verified as the optimal strategy according to overall running cost. The findings of this paper can provide useful references for the design of AVs as well as the management of the automated highway systems.

AB This paper introduces current trends in the development of machinery automation, the approach of machinery control for autonomous platforms in the commercial sector, and the divergent requirements of naval autonomous vehicles (UxVs). The paper then provides a focused review of current specifications and design approaches for propulsion machinery (e.g., Prime Movers, Reduction Gears, and Shafting elements) and identifies gaps in the currently used instrumentations ability to provide adequate sensing capabilities to support operations ranging from reduced manning to fully autonomous operations, and also considers the advantages of new or improved instrumentation to enable Condition Based Maintenance (CBM).
   Many of the current propulsion machinery relate Military Specifications (MIL Spec) provide requirements for equipment that did not consider the increasing leve of automation of machinery systems and the desire to deliver platforms capable of operating autonomously. By considering common shipboard causalities against the capability of currently specified or installed machinery, this paper identifies current gaps and provides recommendations for improving sensing capability, increasing system reliability, and strengthening platform resiliency.

AB Autonomous Weapons Systems (AWS) have not gained a good reputation in the past. This attitude is odd if we look at the discussion of other - usually highly anticipated - AI-technologies, like autonomous vehicles (AVs); whereby even though these machines evoke very similar ethical issues, philosophers' attitudes towards them are constructive. In this article, I try to prove that there is an unjust bias against AWS because almost every argument against them is effective against AVs too. I start with the definition of "AWS." Then, I arrange my arguments by the Just War Theory (JWT), covering jus ad bellum, jus in hello and jus post bellum problems. Meanwhile, I draw attention to similar problems against other AI-technologies outside the JWT framework. Finally, I address an exception, as addressed by Duncan Purves, Ryan Jenkins and Bradley Strawser, who realized the unjustified double standard, and deliberately tried to construct a special argument which rules out only AWS.

AB With the evolution of autonomous distributed systems such as smart cities, autonomous vehicles, smart control and scheduling systems there is an increased need for approaches to manage the execution of services to deliver real-time performance. As Cloud-hosted services are increasingly used to provide intelligence and analytic functionality to Internet of Things (IoT) systems, Quality of Service (QoS) techniques must be used to guarantee the timely service delivery. This paper reviews state-of-the-art QoS and Cloud techniques for real-time service delivery and data analysis. A review of straggler mitigation and a classification of real-time QoS techniques is provided. Then a mathematical framework is presented capturing the relationship between the host execution environment and the executing service allowing the response-times to predicted throughout execution. The framework is shown experimentally to reduce the number of QoS violations by 21% and provides alerts during the first 14ms provide alerts for 94% of future violations.

AB The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has become an attractive research topic in the fields of communication networks and information processing due to its wide range of potential applications, including public transportation management, road traffic predication and control, environmental monitoring, and autonomous driving. Most research analyze the IoV's data collected by dedicated machine-to-machine (M2M)-based platforms. Moreover, due to the lack of field experimental data, data transmission mechanisms from mobile vehicle terminals to the M2M-based platform rarely consider the proper transmission timing according to network performance and traffic conditions. To solve these problems, we propose an open M2M-based framework of wireless monitoring system for IoV. In the proposed framework, we design and implement a prototype of the mobile vehicle terminal. We also define the procedure of data transmission between the mobile vehicle terminal and the M2M-based platform. To prolong the lifetime of the mobile vehicle terminal, energy-efficient data transmission schemes for stopped and running vehicles are proposed, respectively, which reduce the unnecessary data transmission by jointly considering the variation of vehicle speed and received signal strength. We conduct a field experiment to verify the basic functions of the pro- posed M2M-based IoV monitoring system and the mobile vehicle terminal. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the proposed M2M-based platform with the mobile vehicle terminal enables customized and energy-efficient data delivery.

AB How should we integrate representations from complementary sensors for autonomous driving? Geometry-based fusion has shown promise for perception (e.g., object detection, motion forecasting). However, in the context of end-to-end driving, we find that imitation learning based on existing sensor fusion methods underperforms in complex driving scenarios with a high density of dynamic agents. Therefore, we propose TransFuser, a mechanism to integrate image and LiDAR representations using self-attention. Our approach uses transformer modules at multiple resolutions to fuse perspective view and bird's eye view feature maps. We experimentally validate its efficacy on a challenging new benchmark with long routes and dense traffic, as well as the official leaderboard of the CARLA urban driving simulator. At the time of submission, TransFuser outperforms all prior work on the CARLA leaderboard in terms of driving score by a large margin. Compared to geometry-based fusion, TransFuser reduces the average collisions per kilometer by 48%.

AB Autonomous long-duration aerostats (LDA) are one of the most popular research directions of high-altitude platforms (HAPS) in recent years. Solar photovoltaic (PV) array is the energy source of autonomous long-duration aerostat, whose power generation predicting accuracy and speed affect the subsequent flight control strategy. Limited by incompleteness cognition of near space, current predicting results cannot meet the requirements of autonomous LDA. In this paper, a novel rapid prediction model of the PV array is proposed. Based on spatial position relation of PV cells, this model can predict the power of single PV cell in any state. The four influence factors including time difference, angle, efficiency loss and temperature are analyzed and optimized comprehensively and innovatively. The new model can be applied in both static state aerostat and dynamic state aerostat. Compared with the traditional model, the efficiency can be improved by 50% and the prediction accuracy can be improved by 10%.

AB Autonomous trajectory generation plays an essential role in the navigation of vehicles in space as well as in terrestrial scenarios, i.e. in the air, on solid ground, or water. For the latter, the navigation of ships in ports has specific challenges since ship dynamics are highly nonlinear with limited agility, while the manoeuvre space in ports is limited. Nevertheless, for providing support to humanly designed control strategies, autonomously generated trajectories have not only to be feasible, i.e. collision-free but shall also be optimal with respect to manoeuvre time and control effort. This article presents a novel approach to autonomous trajectory planning on the basis of precomputed and connectable trajectory segments, the so-called motion primitives, and an A*-search algorithm. Sequences of motion primitives provide an initial guess for a subsequent optimization by which optimal trajectories are found even in terrains with many obstacles. We illustrate the approach with different navigation scenarios.

AB Autonomous systems such as unmanned vehicles are beginning to operate within society. All participants in society are required to follow specific regulations and laws. An autonomous system cannot be an exception. Inevitably an autonomous system will find itself in a situation in which it needs to not only choose to obey a rule or not, but also make a complex ethical decision. However, there exists no obvious way to implement the human understanding of ethical behaviour in computers. Even if we enable autonomous systems to distinguish between more and less ethical alternatives, how can we be sure that they would choose right? We consider autonomous systems with a hybrid architecture in which the highest level of reasoning is executed by a rational (BDI) agent. For such a system, formal verification has been used successfully to prove that specific rules of behaviour are observed when making decisions. We propose a theoretical framework for ethical plan selection that can be formally verified. We implement a rational agent that incorporates a given ethical policy in its plan selection and show that we can formally verify that the agent chooses to execute, to the best of its beliefs, the most ethical available plan.

AB The paper focuses on developing a method that enables the unmanned surface vehicle (USV) to effectively track dynamic objects on the water surface. The integral line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law is improved by introducing the concept of vector field for curved paths and the time-varying lookahead distance with a smoothing control parameter for straight paths. These enhancements facilitate faster convergence to the desired path with reduced oscillations and allow for mitigating the impact of constant external disturbances. The research demonstrates that the proposed guidance law exhibits ������-exponential stability when converging towards a desired path composed of both straight lines and curves. The results presented in the paper demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves the accuracy of tracking dynamic targets for unmanned surface vehicles while ensuring the safety of docking operations.

AB This research addresses the problem of coordinating multiple autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) operations. An intelligent mission executive has been created that uses multiagent technology to control and coordinate multiple AUVs in communication-deficient environments. By incorporating real-time vehicle prediction, blackboard-based hierarchical mission plans, mission optimization, and a distributed multiagent based paradigm in conjunction with a simple broadcast communication system, this research aims to handle the limitations inherent in underwater operations, namely poor communication, and intelligently control multiple vehicles. In this research, efficiency is evaluated and then compared to the current state of the art in multiple AUV control. The research is then validated in real AUV coordination trials. Results will show that compared to the state of the art, the control system developed and implemented in this research coordinates multiple vehicles more efficiently and is able to function in a range of poor communication environments. These findings are supported by in-water validation trials with heterogeneous AUVs. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This paper proposes a novel hybrid underwater vehicle, the Smartfloat, which integrates the concept of buoyancy-driven underwater gliders and conventional profiling floats. The vehicle is presented to address the challenges in ocean monitoring, such as the multidisciplinary observations of long-range transport of the mesoscale features with high spatial-temporal resolution. The vehicle combines the mechanisms of Argo profiling float and the underwater glider, with the application of a special designed attitude control system and the ingenious general arrangement. The vehicle can switch the operating mode between drifting mode and gliding mode. Such a multimodal vehicle would merge the benefits of making measurements in a very energy-efficient way when drifting with the currents in Argo mode, and operating as an underwater glider in glider mode when it is needed to cross the ocean eddies, ocean fronts, filaments, or some stirring regions. In this paper, a proof-of-concept platform including its concept of operations, the main components and subsystems design, and the correlative mathematical analysis is introduced in detail. Experiments in field trials are presented to characterize and illustrate each mode of operation and repeated mode transitions. The results demonstrate the feasibility and the good performance of the proposed vehicle.

AB For Autonomous Driving (AD) system or vehicle behavior control, it is important to know the friction coefficient of the road surface accurately. It is because the lateral and the longitudinal force characteristics of the tire depend on the road surface condition largely. However, even today it is difficult to detect the tire-road friction coefficient before the deterioration of vehicle dynamics in real time. This is because the tire-road friction coefficient estimation is usually conducted by comparing the actual vehicle motion with the reference vehicle model motion. So, such conventional estimators do not perform well if there is no significant difference between the actual vehicle behavior and the model. This paper propose a method for real-time estimate tire-road friction coefficient that changes variously during driving. Using this method, the friction coefficient value for a real road can be determined from relatively simple calculations. Moreover, this method has the advantage of allowing the independent estimation of the friction coefficient value for both the front and rear wheels. In addition, this paper explain how to apply and the effect on the actual vehicle. Furthermore, we demonstrate its effectiveness via online estimation of the road surface friction coefficient based on actual vehicle experiments.

ID ACCEPTANCE; BEHAVIOR
AB This study aims to conduct a thorough assessment of pedestrian and cyclist safety in autonomous vehicle (AV) environments. To that end, the study utilized AV sensor data of over 1,500 driving hours from five sources in Canada, the United States, and Singapore. The sensor data were used to extract conflicts between AVs and active road users. The conflicts were then processed to develop accurate estimates of AV collisions involving pedestrians and cyclists based on the extreme value theory. Further in-depth assessments were conducted on the identified conflicts, by type and location, to highlight potential issues leading to risky conflicts. The results showed that the total number of predicted AV collisions involving active road users was 2.17 collisions per million AV kilometers travelled. Collisions involving pedestrians were slightly higher than those involving cyclists. Also, collisions in clear weather conditions slightly exceeded collisions in adverse weather conditions, although the difference was not statistically significant. The relative risk of collisions was developed for both pedestrian and cyclist conflicts per AV movement type. The results showed that for pedestrians, interactions with right-turning AVs are the riskiest, while interactions with left-turning AVs are the riskiest for cyclists. A thorough analysis of conflicts revealed many issues, including a higher tendency for pedestrian violations when interacting with AVs, aggressive AV behavior (particularly when interacting with pedestrians while making a right turn), AVs struggling to predict the path of cyclists (mainly because of cyclist violations), and AVs failing to interpret pedestrian intentions in some cases.

AB In the straight sections before and after headland turning in paddy fields, high lateral deviations and heading errors may occur due to changes in the path curvature and dynamic factors of the vehicle and path tracking algorithm. In the case of autonomous rice transplanters, such errors may lengthen the transitions between turning and straight sections and deteriorate working efficiency. In this study, headland turning path generation algorithms for rice transplanters were proposed to reduce the transition distances. Path models were defined considering the transition distances to move the vehicle such that the error was within the acceptable range. The transition distances were predicted by using a simulator that employed a kinematic vehicle model and a tracking algorithm with a model-based control system for generating steering angles. A look-ahead search method and tilt compensation for the Global Navigation Satellite System were applied as well. The developed method was validated in a paddy field by using a Daedong DRP60D rice transplanter. The transition distance decreased by 34.04% compared to that associated with the baseline path that did not consider the transitions. The overlap area decreased by an average of 55.51% within the straight lines. During straight operation, the maximum lateral deviation did not exceed 15 cm. These results confirmed that the proposed algorithms for autonomous rice transplanters can traverse a target path more accurately before and after turning and, consequently, increase work efficiency by avoiding non-planted areas.

AB The flexible transmission shaft and wheel propeller are combined as the kinetic source equipment, which realizes the multi-motion modes of the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) such as vectored thruster and wheeled movement. In order to study the interactional principle between the hull and the wheel propellers while the AUV navigating in water, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method is used to simulate numerically the unsteady viscous flow around AUV with propellers by using the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, shear-stress transport (SST) k-w model and pressure with splitting of operators (PISO) algorithm based on sliding mesh. The hydrodynamic parameters of AUV with propellers such as resistance, pressure and velocity are got, which reflect well the real ambient flow field of AUV with propellers. Then, the semi-implicit method for pressure-linked equations (SIMPLE) algorithm is used to compute the steady viscous flow field of AUV hull and propellers, respectively. The computational results agree well with the experimental data, which shows that the numerical method has good accuracy in the prediction of hydrodynamic performance. The interaction between AUV hull and wheel propellers is predicted qualitatively and quantitatively by comparing the hydrodynamic parameters such as resistance, pressure and velocity with those from integral computation and partial computation of the viscous flow around AUV with propellers, which provides an effective reference to the study on noise and vibration of AUV hull and propellers in real environment. It also provides technical support for the design of new AUVs.

AB The undersides of floating ice shelves and sea ice in the Antarctic and Arctic are among the least accessible environments on Earth. The interactions between ice shelves, sea ice, and the ocean are of considerable scientific interest. In order to fully understand the complex picture of sea ice, and not just its surface, it is quite necessary to map the underside to comprehend the full context of its growth and decay patterns. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are rapidly becoming the desired platform of choice for mapping the underside of sea ice to provide high-resolution 3D views of sea ice topography. To increase the efficiency and accuracy of AUV sampling behaviors is significant for the under-ice observation mission given its limited endurance. In this paper, we present a low-cost underwater ice mapping framework for small-sized AUVs using adaptive sampling and map reconstruction methods. A small-sized AUV is cost-effective and convenient for operation in polar regions; however, due to its limited loading capacity and energy, it is more applicable for the vehicle to carry single-beam sonar for ice bottom mapping but not multi-beam. Thus, the essential issue in this application is how to obtain the key information of ice topography and how to reconstruct the map of ice draft (namely underwater ice thickness) with AUV sparse mapping swathes. To address this, we propose a graphics-based adaptive mapping method to densify the measuring of ice bottom surface with 'noticeable' variations; moreover, we also present a sparse approximation method for ice draft map reconstruction using the sparse mapping swathes from a single-beam sonar. Our efforts are to introduce an effective and efficient approach for underwater ice mapping using low-cost small-sized AUVs. Our proposed adaptive mapping and reconstruction methods are validated in the under-ice scenario created using the field data.

AB The number of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) is increasing rapidly in various smart transportation services and applications, considering many benefits to society, people, and the environ-ment. Several research surveys for CAVs were conducted by primarily focusing on various security threats and vulnerabilities in the domain of CAVs to classify different types of attacks, impacts of attacks, attack features, cyber-risk, defense methodologies against attacks, and safety standards. However, the importance of attack detection and prevention approaches for CAVs has not been discussed extensively in the state-of-the-art surveys, and there is a clear gap in the existing literature on such methodologies to detect new and conventional threats and protect the CAV systems from unexpected hazards on the road. Some surveys have a limited discussion on Attacks Detection and Prevention Systems (ADPS), but such surveys provide only partial coverage of different types of ADPS for CAVs. Furthermore, there is a scope for discussing security, privacy, and efficiency challenges in ADPS that can give an overview of important security and performance attributes. This survey paper, therefore, presents the significance of CAVs in the market, potential challenges in CAVs, key requirements of essential security and privacy properties, various capabilities of adversaries, possible attacks in CAVs, and performance evaluation parameters for ADPS. An extensive analysis is discussed of different ADPS categories for CAVs and state-of-the-art research works based on each ADPS category that gives the latest findings in this research domain. This survey also discusses crucial and open security research problems that are required to be focused on the secure deployment of CAVs in the market. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   Extreme value theory
ID TRAFFIC CONFLICT INDICATORS; VALIDATION
AB With the increasing advancements in autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies, the forecasts of AV market shares seem to follow an ever-growing trend. This leads to the inherent need for proactive safety evaluations of AV impacts on other road users. To that end, this study proposes a modeling framework for the proactive assessment of pedestrian safety in AV environments. The proposed framework relies on the Extreme Value Theory (EVT), with the peak over threshold modeling technique, to develop an estimate of AV-pedestrian collisions using AV-pedestrian conflicts. The proposed framework was applied to two AV data sets, collected from three locations in the US and Singapore, using the operating AV fleets of two developers, Motional and Lyft. Both datasets included trajectory data for the subject AV, as well as LiDAR point clouds and annotated video data from AV cameras to capture the trajectories of surrounding road users. The datasets were processed to extract the AV-pedestrian conflicts along with the corresponding conflict indicators, mainly the post-encroachment time (PET) and time-to-collision (TTC). Relevant covariates were introduced to the proposed models to enhance their performance and prediction accuracy, including turning movements and conflict speeds. The results indicate an alarming risk to pedestrians when interacting with AVs, especially at the early stages of AV adoption. The expected number of collisions ranged from 4 to 5.5 per million vehicle kilometers travelled (VKT) of the AVs. With the addition of the covariates, the expected number of collisions went down to a range of 2.3-3.7 per million VKT, but with a narrower confidence interval of the resulting estimate and a better fit. The introduced approach shows promising prospects for the application of EVT methods to address AV safety impacts. It also invites future applications to address issues of concern for pedestrian safety in different conditions of urban traffic. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous driving is considered one of the killer technologies in the intelligent era. The information transmission between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians (V2P) is very important to reduce the number of road accidents. Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) technology can be used to increase the vehicle (or driver) awareness regarding the presence of pedestrians in a crosswalk to realize short-distance transmission of emergency messages. On the other hand, highly secure transmission in V2P networks is required to assure the broadcasting of emergency messages. However, the artificial noise scheme by an additional noise source to improve the physical layer security (PLS) is not suitable due to the dynamic vehicles. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a source-noise assisted AmBC transmission scheme in the V2P system, in which the noise is created by the ambient radio frequency (RF) source to improve the PLS performance. The closed-form expressions for the outage probability of the legitimate user and the intercept probability of eavesdropper are derived. Finally, the diversity gain performance of the system is studied by analyzing the asymptotic behaviors. The theoretical and simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves the system security performance at the expense of system reliability by utilizing the proposed source-noise aided scheme in the V2P network. Besides, the optimal reflection coefficient is related to the power allocation ratio for the signal of the reader and interference noise. The different reflection coefficient is required for achieving the best system performance under different power allocation ratios. Moreover, the results also show that there are error floors for the outage probability, depending on the reflection coefficient. Furthermore, the performance results show that the intercept probability will significantly decrease when the outage probability is fixed in the proposed scheme.

AB It is an important criterion for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to land on the runway safely. This paper concentrates on stereo vision localization of a fixed-wing UAV's autonomous landing within global navigation satellite system (GNSS) denied environments. A ground stereo vision guidance system imitating the human visual system (HVS) is presented for the autonomous landing of fixed-wing UAVs. A saliency-inspired algorithm is presented and developed to detect flying UAV targets in captured sequential images. Furthermore, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based state estimation is employed to reduce localization errors caused by measurement errors of object detection and pan-tilt unit (PTU) attitudes. Finally, stereovision-dataset-based experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed visual detection method and error correction algorithm. The compared results between the visual guidance approach and differential GPS-based approach indicate that the stereo vision system and detection method can achieve the better guiding effect.

AB Autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs) introduced into human-operated seagoing environments must incorporate collision avoidance capabilities currently used in human-operated vessels into their decision space. Collision avoidance is an area of increased focus for AMVs, especially compliance with the International Regulations for Prevention of Collisions at Sea (Collision Regulations or COLREGS). This research examines the relationship of key collision avoidance parameters to the resulting effects on both safety and mission efficiency by examining a COLREGS-based autonomous collision avoidance algorithm using Monte Carlo methods and regression analysis of statistical data from both simulation and on-water experimentation. By applying interval programming and a collision avoidance protocol such as the COLREGS to a fleet of AMVs operating in the same geographic area, the fleet achieves nearly identical efficiency concurrent with significant reductions in the collisions observed when compared to a non-protocol based autonomous collision avoidance algorithm. This work simultaneously tested five AMVs with in-water experimentation using COLREGS collision avoidance the largest simultaneous test known to date.

AB The autonomous vehicle (AV) is one of the emerging technologies of the new age that has the potential to restructure transportation infrastructure. AVs are able to sense their surroundings and move around with control and self-sufficiency. AVs can contribute towards reducing traffic congestion on the roads, improving the quality of life, and achieving the highest levels of traffic safety. Thus, this type of vehicle can be integrated into the logistics industry. Due to the presence of several AVs, selecting a standard and efficient AV for logistics planning is a great challenge. The selection of an AV depends on many conflicting and essential criteria. Given its efficiency and reliability in dealing with conflicting criteria, a comprehensive multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach was applied to solve the problem of selecting the optimal AV. However, the MCDM selection process is based on human judgment, which can be ambiguous. Accordingly, uncertainty was handled using type-2 neutrosophic numbers (T2NN). Initially, the method based on the removal effects of criteria (MEREC) was extended under T2NN and employed to assess and prioritize criteria. Then, the combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) method was extended under T2NN and applied to rank the candidate substitutions. To confirm the feasibility of the applied approach, an illustrative case study of four AVs was introduced. A sensitivity analysis was performed by changing the weights of the criteria and some other parameters to confirm the validity and stability of the proposed approach. In addition, a comparison analysis with other MCDM approaches was conducted to show the effectiveness and reliability of the applied approach. This research provides useful information for policymakers in the field of logistics. Finally, the results indicate that the velocity of AVs criterion is the most influential criterion in the selection of an intelligent AV.

AB We describe a mode-commanding computer, CC, for autonomous complex systems that was inspired by the neuroanatomy and hypothesized functions of vertebrate brainstem reticular formations. A ''mode'' is a total action pattern of an organism, such as fight, flee, etc. CC is composed of K simple modules, 3 < K < 30, where each module is sparsely connected to other modules as well as to CC's sensory input systems. Each module's operation involves only local actions: squaring input probability values; averaging; normalizing the component sum of output vectors; and randomly respecifying the module's connections to other modules every computation cycle. CC's output consists of bundles of module outputs. Lengthy simulations have shown beyond doubt that CC always converges robustly and satisfactorily to one of M possible output mode indications in less than 30 computation cycles. M values in the range 2<M<18 have been used so far. Many future CC applications to autonomous vehicle control, robotics, etc., are expected, and an example is discussed.

AB The maturing of autonomous driving technology in recent years has led to several pilot projects and the initial integration of autonomous pods and buses into the public transport (PT) system. An emerging field of interest is the design of public transport networks operating autonomous buses and the potential to attract higher levels of travel demand. In this work a multi-objective optimization and multi-agent simulation framework is developed to study potential changes in the network design and frequency settings compared to conventional PT systems when autonomous vehicles (AV) systems are deployed on fixed-route networks. During the optimization process multiple deployment scenarios (network configurations and service frequency) are evaluated and optimized considering the operator cost, user cost and infrastructure preparation costs of the system. User-focused network design and operator-focused network design are studied for a real-world urban area in Sweden. The results provide insights into the network design and level of service implications brought about by the deployment of autonomous bus (AB) when those are integrated in route-based PT systems. We show that the deployment of autonomous buses result with a network design that increases service ridership. In the context of our case study this increase is likely to primarily substitute walking.

AB Automated vehicles are becoming a reality. Many pilot projects have already begun demonstrating the technological capabilities, as public authorities now allow the testing of automated vehicles in real traffic. To smooth the transition from a conventional to an automated fleet, effective fiscal and regulatory policies must be developed by governmental agencies. But at what rate will automated vehicles actually be adopted, and what automation technology will be available for use in new cars joining the national fleet? A national vehicle stock model can be used to answer these questions and to observe the aggregate impact of governmental policies on individual vehicle purchase decisions. In this paper, we present a passenger car and heavy vehicle stock cohort model that forecasts the diffusion of automation technology in Germany. The model uses national data on vehicle stock and vehicle utilization patterns on German freeways and predicts market shares of generic automation levels in predefined instances of a trend scenario. Results point toward market saturation of automated vehicles beyond 2050, with almost 90% of the passenger car fleet being classified as at least partially automatized by this date. The results also suggest that technology diffusion will be faster in the heavy vehicle fleet than in the passenger car fleet. This implies a positive correlation between emission-linked road user charges for heavy vehicles on the freeway network and the renewal rate of the heavy vehicle fleet. The forecast shares of automated vehicles can be used as an input for traffic flow simulations or as a basis for those infrastructure measures and traffic policies that are sensitive to the share of automated vehicles.

AB A new vertical axis-symmetrical dish-shaped autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with excellent maneuverability, known as the autonomous underwater hovering vehicle (AUH), is proposed. This study investigates an important working model of the AUH approaching a host ship in waves. The working model of AUH-Ship interactions deals with hydrodynamic interaction, seakeeping performance for communication, launch, and recovery near a free surface. The AUH is able to navigate and implement homing automation through acoustic positioning equipment, a depth sensor, a heading compass, and a Doppler velocity log (DVL) in the working area based on numerical analysis of AUH-Ship hydrodynamic performance in this study. The hydrodynamic-interaction performance of the AUH and ship near free surfaces is analyzed in the frequency and time domains using a potential-based surface-panel method based on a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver (ANSYS-AQWA), i.e., a 3D panel code of seakeeping performance module in the ANSYS platform where the fluid is assumed to be irrotational, inviscid, and incompressible. The motion performance of the AUH approaching the host ship, with a dynamic positioning system in waves, is studied by estimating interactive response-amplitude operators (RAOs) of the AUH and host ship in 6-DOF that were estimated and analyzed at different wave amplitudes and frequencies. In the ship and AUH interaction simulations, the host ship is assumed to be a well-posed station keeping in waves with zero service speed. The AUH and ship interference effect is studied at different distances to appropriate recovery and launch positions for the AUH at the following sea and beam sea, i.e., wave-encounter angles 0 degrees and 90 degrees, respectively. In addition, the hydrodynamic interaction of the AUH and ship in yaw and roll at different AUH velocities is estimated. The AUH motion performance approaching the ship in long-crested irregular seas is analyzed in the time domain using the Pierson-Moskowitz wave spectrum model. Viscid hydrodynamic force on AUH motion in roll near a free surface was significant. A damping model was adopted to formulate the viscid effect to enhance the effectiveness of the ANSYS-AQWA inviscid potential-based solver. Numerical analysis of motion RAO of the AUH in roll with the damping effect was compared to the experimental data in wave-frequency range 0.2-1.0 Hz, resulting in the average error being reduced from 21.03% to 9.95% to verify the method's accuracy. The proposed method conveniently and accurately predicted hydrodynamic-interaction characteristics and motion RAO for a dish-type AUH and host ship for the precise use of mounted sensors in waves. The results of these simulations can be used to analyze the homing automation and adaptive controllability to advance the AUV development and design.

AB This paper develops an electric vehicle switched-reluctance motor (SRM) drive powered by a battery/supercapacitor having grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-home (V2H)/vehicle-to-grid (V2G) functions. The power circuit of the motor drive is formed by a bidirectional two-quadrant front-end dc/dc converter and an SRM asymmetric bridge converter. Through proper control and setting of key parameters, good acceleration/deceleration, reversible driving, and braking characteristics are obtained. In idle condition, the proposed motor drive schematic can be rearranged to construct the integrated power converter to perform the following functions: 1) G2V charging mode: a single-phase two-stage switch-mode rectifier based charger is formed with power factor correction capability; 2) autonomous V2H discharging mode: the 60-Hz 220-V/110-V ac sources are generated by the developed single-phase three-wire inverter to power home appliances. Through the developed differential mode and common mode control schemes, well-regulated output voltages are achieved; 3) grid-connected V2G discharging mode: the programmed real power can be sent back to the utility grid.

AB Airborne wind energy (AWE) is a fascinating technology to convert wind power into electricity with an autonomous tethered aircraft. Deemed a potentially game-changing solution, AWE is attracting the attention of policy makers and stakeholders with the promise of producing large amounts of cost-competitive electricity with wide applicability worldwide. Since the pioneering experimental endeavors in the years 2000-2010, there has been a clear technology convergence trend and steady progress in the field. Today, AWE systems can operate automatically with minimal supervision in all operational phases. A first product is also being commercialized. However, all-around fully autonomous operation still presents important fundamental challenges that are conceptually similar to those of other systems that promise to change our lives, such as fully autonomous passenger cars or service drones. At the same time, autonomous operation is necessary to enable large-scale AWE, thus combining challenging fundamental problems with high potential impact on society and the economy. This article describes the state of the art of this technology from a system perspective and with a critical view on some fundamental aspects, presents the latest automatic control results by prominent industrial players, and finally points out the most important challenges on the road to fully autonomous AWE systems.

AB Autonomous driving technology will bring revolutionary changes to the development of future cities and transportation. In order to study the impact of autonomous driving on urban transportation networks, this paper first summarizes the development status of autonomous driving technology, and then three space-traffic network coupling models are proposed based on the differences of speed and space, which are the traditional difference type, scale variation type, and slow-guided type. On this basis, a new 4 * 4 km grid city model is constructed. Based on the MATSim multi-agent simulation method, the traffic parameters of the three models are studied. The results show that under the same traffic demand, the service scale and level of the three traffic networks are significantly different. The optimal service level of the traditional differential type is 2.15 times the efficiency of the slow-guided type. Under the same demand and road network mode, the travel speed of the autonomous driving mode is 1.7-2.8 times that of the traditional mode. Under the same lane area ratio, the travel speed of traditional driving is much smaller than that of autonomous driving, which is about 2.6-3.6 times greater than the former. The research conclusion has certain reference significance for formulating urban spatial development strategies and policies under autonomous driving environments and for promoting the sustainable development of urban transportation.

AB Robotic unmanned aerial vehicles have an enormous potential as observation and data-gathering platforms for a wide variety of applications. These applications include environmental and biodiversity research and monitoring, urban planning and traffic control, inspection of man-made structures, mineral and archaeological prospecting, surveillance and law enforcement, communications, and many others. Robotic airships, in particular, are of great interest as observation platforms, due to their potential for extended mission times, low platform vibration characteristics, and hovering capability. In this paper we provide an overview of Project AURORA (Autonomous Unmanned Remote Monitoring Robotic Airship), a research effort that focusses on the development of the technologies required for substantially autonomous robotic airships. We discuss airship modelling and control, autonomous navigation, and sensor-based flight control. We also present the hardware and software architectures developed for the airship. Additionally, we discuss our current research in airborne perception and monitoring, including mission-specific target acquisition, discrimination and identification tasks. The paper also presents experimental results from our work.

AB Many studies have explored travelers' perceptions of self-driving cars (or autonomous vehicles, AVs) and their potential impacts. However, medium-term modifications in activity patterns (such as increasing trip frequencies and changing destinations) have been less explored. Using 2017-2018 survey data collected in the US state of Georgia, this paper (1) measures (at a general level) how people expect their activity patterns to change in a hypothetical all-AV era; (2) identifies population segments having similar profiles of expected changes; and (3) further profiles each segment on the basis of attitudinal, sociodemographic, and geographic characteristics. In the survey, respondents were asked to express their expectations regarding 16 potential activity modifications induced by AVs. We first conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to reduce the dimensionality of the activity-change vector characterizing each individual, and estimated non-mean-centered (NMC) factor scores (which have been rarely used in applied psychology). The EFA solution identified four dimensions of activity change: distance, time flexibility, frequency, and long distance/leisure. Next, we clustered Georgians with respect to these four-dimensional expectation vectors. The cluster solution uncovered six segments: no change, change unlikely, more leisure/long distance, longer trips, more travel, and time flexibility & more leisure/long distance. Using NMC factor scores identified considerably more inertia with respect to expectations for change than would have been apparent from the usual mean-centered scores. Finally, the various segments exhibit distinctive demographics and general attitudes. For example, those in the more leisure/long distance cluster tend to be higher income and are more likely to be Atlanta-region residents compared to other clusters, while those in the no change and change unlikely clusters tend to be older and are more likely to be rural residents.

AB We investigate how non-utilitarian car preferences and current perceptions of automated vehicles (AVs) affect commuters' openness to driverless car technology and perceptions of the driverless future. We identify four latent composite factors representing otherwise directly unobservable preference structures: psychological attachment to conventional cars; objective preference for traditional automotive safety; openness to perceived attributes of AVs; and willingness to embrace versus actively resist the driverless future. Conditional on commuters' psychological attachment to cars and their current perception of AVs, we investigate commuters' willingness to relinquish their traditional car in the hypothetical future to better understand the implications of future policy challenges.

AB The problem of decentralized control of vehicular platoon is addressed, subject to non-uniform time-varying delays in the communication links among the vehicles. Our control goal is to drive the vehicles to reach a specified line formation, while moving forward according to the platoon leader speed. The control law in each vehicle is computed only by local relative information regarding its neighboring vehicles. The first result shows that communication delays cause steady-state formation error, whose value can be analytically calculated from the system data, and may lead to instability, if the delays values surpass a threshold. Hence, in the light of this finding, we present a decentralized control law to compensate for the delay effect, providing zero steady-state formation error. The paper is concluded by showing simulated experiments over six different communication topologies illustrating the applicability of our proposal.

AB To improve the urban traffic condition and reduce accidents, we propose a platoon-driving model for autonomous vehicles in a free-flow traffic state in this article. This model allows vehicles with successful path matching to be grouped in a platoon and led by the platoon head (PH). In addition, a PH selection scheme is introduced to provide an incentive for vehicles to be PHs and maintain the dynamic update of platoons. Next, a smart contract is employed to enable the payment based on a blockchain between the PH and platoon members (PMs), avoiding the malicious and false payments. The numerical results show that the platoon model is superior to the individual driving model in terms of fuel consumption. The comparison between carpooling and noncarpooling modes within the platoon shows that our model has a better performance in terms of PH revenue and PM's service charge.

AB Complex and highly coupled dynamics, time-variance, unpredictable disturbances and lack of knowledge of hydrodynamic parameters, complicate the control of underwater vehicles. This paper deals with the adaptive disturbance observer design for the robust trajectory tracking problem for underwater vehicles in presence of unknown external disturbances and parametric uncertainties. First, the dynamics of the vehicle is transformed into the so-called regular form. Then, based on the Extended State Observer technique and High Order Sliding Modes Control, a disturbance observer is proposed. Furthermore, the gains of the observer are automatically adjusted by the introduction of an adaption law. The stability of the whole controller/observer scheme is proven using Lyapunov's arguments. The adaptive disturbance observer aims to improve the Backstepping and nonlinear PD controllers. Real-Time experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for the trajectory tracking task under several scenarios.

AB Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) have enormous potential in many fields of application, especially when used in combination with autonomous guidance. An open challenge for safe autonomous flight is to rely on a mapping system for local positioning and obstacle avoidance. In this article, the authors propose a radar-based mapping system both for obstacle detection and for path planning. The radar equipment used is a single-chip device originally developed for automotive applications that has good resolution in azimuth, but poor resolution in elevation. This limitation can be critical for UAS application, and it must be considered for obstacle-avoidance maneuvers and for autonomous path-planning selection. However, the radar-mapping system proposed in this paper was successfully tested in the following different scenarios: a single metallic target in grass, a vegetated scenario, and in the close proximity of a ruined building.

AB In this article, an autonomous carrier landing problem of an aircraft is addressed by developing an autonomous carrier landing system (ACLS) composed of previewable guidance and control systems. In the guidance system, an appropriate touchdown point is estimated by predicting the seakeeping motion of the deck by unscented Kalman filtering technique, which is then utilized to adjust the reference glide path and produce an effective deck motion compensation, indispensable for a safe landing. The adaptive preview control (APC) scheme is proposed, which utilizes future reference information. The feedback and feedforward adaptive gains are derived through the Lyapunov stability theorem ensuring better tracking response and disturbance rejection. Hence, the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed. The simulation results depict better performance of the proposed ACLS in the presence of deck fluctuations and airwake disturbance compared with PID and LMI based preview control schemes.

TI FINE GRAINED TDMA MAC DESIGN TOWARD ULTRA RELIABLE BROADCAST FOR

SO IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS

ID ARCHITECTURE; INTERNET
AB In the autonomous driving era, V2X communication is essential since it enables rapid message dissemination via periodical beacon exchange (broadcast communication), which contributes to better situation awareness and maneuvering cooperation. However, designing a MAC protocol for reliable V2X broadcasting is challenging, as minimal beacon delivery delay and collision avoidance should be achieved simultaneously. In this article, we design a fine-grained TDMA-based MAC protocol to support ultra-reliable broadcast for autonomous vehicles. Specifically, three critical issues are first identified: mobility-caused time slot collision, time slot shortage, and stiff beacon rate limitation. Accordingly, three fine-grained solutions are provided to tackle those issues: mobility-aware time slot assignment, beacon rate adaption with safety awareness, and flexible beacon rates support. Moreover, a case study on mobility-aware time slot assignment based on road topology and lane distribution is presented, with simulation results' verification. Finally, we elaborate the steps to implement the fine-grained MAC protocol in autonomous driving environments.

AB Millimeter-wave communications have been recently proposed as a promising candidate to fulfill the connectivity requisites imposed over autonomous driving. The need for transmission capabilities of multiple gigabits per second for autonomous vehicles is the main driving factor for millimeter-wave technology. However, there are other paramount requirements, such as short delays, high reliability, security, and support for both unicast and broadcast communications, which must be carefully addressed before this technology becomes a reality. In this article we first review the state-of-the art modeling frameworks that are being considered for vehicular communications. Then we explore the key technologies that will enhance the suitability of millimeter-wave communications for autonomous driving, and we investigate the main challenges that need to be overcome. Finally, we envision that a combination of analog/hybrid beamforming with a location-based beam search protocol, using full duplex radio and physical layer key generation, has the potential of fulfilling the requirements of autonomous driving technology.

AB The self-organizing map (SOM) is an unsupervised learning technique providing a transformation of a high-dimensional input space into a lower dimensional output space. In this paper, we utilize the SOM for the traveling salesman problem (TSP) to develop a solution to autonomous data collection. Autonomous data collection requires gathering data from predeployed sensors by moving within a limited communication radius. We propose a new growing SOM that adapts the number of neurons during learning, which also allows our approach to apply in cases where some sensors can be ignored due to a lower priority. Based on a comparison with available combinatorial heuristic algorithms for relevant variants of the TSP, the proposed approach demonstrates improved results, while also being less computationally demanding. Moreover, the proposed learning procedure can be extended to cases where particular sensors have varying communication radii, and it can also be extended to multivehicle planning.

AB The concept of autonomous farming concerns automatic agricultural machines operating safely and efficiently without human intervention. In order to ensure safe autonomous operation, real-time risk detection and avoidance must be undertaken. This paper presents a flexible vehicle-mounted sensor system for recording positional and imaging data with a total of six sensors, and a full procedure for calibrating and registering all sensors. Authentic data were recorded for a case study on grass-harvesting and human safety. The paper incorporates parts of ISO 18497 (an emerging standard for safety of highly automated machinery in agriculture) related to human detection and safety. The case study investigates four different sensing technologies and is intended as a dataset to validate human safety or a human detection system in grass-harvesting. The study presents common algorithms that are able to detect humans, but struggle to handle lying or occluded humans in high grass.

AB This paper proposes a semi-autonomous collision avoidance system for the prevention of collisions between vehicles and pedestrians and objects on a road. The system is designed to be compatible with the human-centered automation principle, i.e., the decision to perform a maneuver to avoid a collision is made by the driver. However, the system is partly autonomous in that it turns the steering wheel independently when the driver only applies the brake, indicating his or her intent to avoid the obstacle. With a medium-fidelity driving simulator, we conducted an experiment to investigate the effectiveness of this system for improving safety in emergency situations, as well as its acceptance by drivers. The results indicate that the system effectively improves safety in emergency situations, and the semi-autonomous characteristic of the system was found to be acceptable to drivers.

ID LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT
AB Autonomous bicycles have recently been proposed as a new and more efficient approach to bicycle-sharing systems (BSS), but their environmental impacts remain unresearched. Conduct-ing environmental impact assessments at an early technological stage is critical to influencing the design and, ultimately, environmental impacts of a system. Consequently, this paper aims to assess the environmental impact of autonomous shared bikes compared with current station-based and dockless systems under different sets of modeling hypotheses and mode-shift scenarios. The results indicate that autonomy could reduce the environmental impact per passenger kilometer traveled of current station-based and dockless BSS by 33.1 % and 58.0 %. The sensitivity analysis shows that the environmental impact of autonomous shared bicycles will mainly depend on vehicle usage rates and the need for infrastructure. Finally, this study highlights the importance of targeting the mode replacement from more polluting modes, especially as traditional mobility modes decarbonize and become more efficient.

AB The application of autonomous UAVs to infrastructure inspection tasks provides benefits in terms of operation time reduction, safety, and cost-effectiveness. This paper presents trajectory planning for three-dimensional autonomous multi-UAV volume coverage and visual inspection of infrastructure based on the Heat Equation Driven Area Coverage (HEDAC) algorithm. The method generates trajectories using a potential field and implements distance fields to prevent collisions and to determine UAVs' camera orientation. It successfully achieves coverage during the visual inspection of complex structures such as a wind turbine and a bridge, outperforming a state-of-the-art method by allowing more surface area to be inspected under the same conditions. The presented trajectory planning method offers flexibility in various setup parameters and is applicable to real-world inspection tasks. Conclusively, the proposed methodology could potentially be applied to different autonomous UAV tasks, or even utilized as a UAV motion control method if its computational efficiency is improved.

AB At present, electric vehicles (EV) have entered a stage of rapid development. Meanwhile, with artificial intelligence (AI) technology fast improving and implementing many inventions in electric vehicles (EV), almost all EV sold in China are equipped with automatic driving technology to achieve safer and more energy-saving driving. In order to solve the problem of anti-collision in self-driving Smart EV under complex traffic, especially at intersections, most of the existing methods make sequential predictions for the driving level of vehicles, and it becomes difficult to deal with sudden changes in intentions of other vehicles. Therefore, a collision risk assessment framework based on other vehicles' trajectory prediction is proposed. The framework integrates the solutions of other vehicles' expected path planning, uncertainty description of driving process, trajectory change caused by obstacle intrusion, etc., as well as adopts the Gaussian mixture model to evaluate the risk according to the probability of collision. It realizes the real-time evaluation of the probability of collision and makes safe decisions and trajectory planning of the vehicles. After simulation and verification, it effectively solves the decision-making planning problem of autonomous vehicles under complicated traffic flow and demonstrates that the method is better than the current sequential prediction method (SORT\Karlman filter, etc.).

AB The technology that allows fully automated driving already exists and it may gradually enter the market over the forthcoming decades. Technology assimilation and automated vehicle acceptance in different countries is of high interest to many scholars, manufacturers, and policymakers worldwide. We model the mode choice between automated vehicles and conventional cars using a mixed multinomial logit heteroskedastic error component type model. Specifically, we capture preference heterogeneity assuming a continuous distribution across individuals. Different choice scenarios, based on respondents' reported trip, were presented to respondents from six European countries: Cyprus, Hungary, Iceland, Montenegro, Slovenia, and the UK. We found that large reservations towards automated vehicles exist in all countries with 70% conventional private car choices, and 30% automated vehicles choices. We found that men, under the age of 60, with a high income who currently use private car, are more likely to be early adopters of automated vehicles. We found significant differences in automated vehicles acceptance in different countries. Individuals from Slovenia and Cyprus show higher automated vehicles acceptance while individuals from wealthier countries, UK, and Iceland, show more reservations towards them. Nontrading mode choice behaviors, value of travel time, and differences in model parameters among the different countries are discussed.

AB The home lift, position, and rehabilitation (HLPR) chair has a unique design and novel capabilities when compared with conventional powered wheelchairs. In addition to mobility, it provides lift and can transfer patients. Even though medical devices are developing at a rapid pace today, an aspect that is often overlooked in these developments is adherence to "rider safety standards." The contributions of this paper are threefold: (i) novel design of a lift and transfer system, (ii) experiments and results toward improved stability test designs that include HLPR-type devices to meet rider safety standards, and (iii) autonomous navigation and control based on nonlinear system theory of dynamic feedback linearization. Stability experimental results show promise for multipurpose patient mobility, lift, and transfer devices such as HLPR. A method for autonomous maneuvers was tested in simulation and experiments. We also expect the autonomous or semi-autonomous mobility mode of the vehicle to be useful for riders who have potential neural and cognitive impairments: [DOI: 10.1115/1.4001255]

AB Given the rapid growth of autonomous technologies it is important to understand how consumers attribute value to them. Such technologies require consumers to give up control to a machine by delegating decision-making power. To better understand value perceptions, and ultimately adoption, this paper proposes a conceptual model that explains the value attributed to autonomous cars as an archetypal consumer autonomous technology. The model is developed from literature around the theme of autonomy and two qualitative studies, which identify consumers' perceived individual benefits (Freeing Time, Overcoming Human Weaknesses, Outperforming Human Capacities), risks (Loss of Competencies, Security and Privacy risk, Performance risk) and their proximal antecedents (Perceived Expertise, Attitude toward the Delegated Task, Previous Engagement in Delegation). The model is tested on a national sample of French drivers using a quantitative methodology and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). This research contributes to literature on technological forecasting of autonomous technologies by developing and testing a conceptual model, which includes salient predictors of perceived value and highlights the mediating role of improvement in subjective well-being that consumers anticipate from adoption. The model can be used by managers to predict how users are likely to react to their products and communications about them.

AB Purpose: Automotive trends and the strategies of automotive OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) indicate that advanced and fully autonomous vehicles will appear in the market soon. In parallel with these progresses, customers' needs and expectations for automotive parts will evolve accordingly. Particularly, since the seat is in physical contact with the user, it requires major improvements by employing novel functions to meet these evolved needs and expectations. This study addresses these novel front seat functions and provides a real case of development of an innovative front seat for autonomous driving. Theory and Methods: In this study, initially, new design ideas were generated regarding the front seats to meet changing customer needs. Generated ideas were evaluated through the QFD methodology. And, in line with these selected ideas, the style design, CAD design, and finite element analysis and testing activities were carried out. Results: As a result of this study, an innovative front seat for autonomous driving has been developed, by taking the evolved customer expectations into account, and by verifying the design through finite element analysis and tests. Conclusion: Evolving customer needs for front seat by autonomous driving are assessed and a real innovative product development case is presented in this study. Future work can address other relevant interior parts of the automotive as to be appropriate for autonomous driving.

AB While autonomous mobility technology is developing, comparatively less is known about how a sociotechnical system of autonomous mobility may impact our urban living conditions. Using Finland as a case study, this research aims to identify the possible implications of changing power relations created by autonomous mobility technology. This study uses a theoretical and conceptual approach grounded in the planning research tradition of Aristotelian practical judgement (phronesis). Drawing from political theory of technology, it investigates the social relations that may be afforded by autonomous mobility technology. Adapting a concept drawn from geography of power, it examines how power is expressed in terms of transcripts of dominant technological agency and hidden social context. 31 interviews of extended users in the transition (intermediaries) revealed three dominant transcripts of technological agency associated with the philosophy of cyberlibertarianism (liberation of the driver, safety of the driver and customer accessibility), and four hidden transcripts of social context (restrictions on sharing street space, loss of social safety, vulnerability of passengers, and loss of privacy). The phronetic research tradition that was used in the study revealed several things. The impact of autonomous mobility technology goes beyond the purely systemic, affecting the very fabric of our connection with place and society. Failure to consider autonomous mobility technology as a sociotechnical system that will restructure society unperceptively (technological somnambulism) may bring profound societal changes.

AB Ensuring safety and achieving human-level driving performance remain challenges for autonomous vehicles, especially in safety-critical situations. As a key component of artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning is promising and has shown great potential in many complex tasks; however, its lack of safety guarantees limits its real-world applicability. Hence, further advancing reinforcement learning, especially from the safety perspective, is of great importance for autonomous driving. As revealed by cognitive neuroscientists, the amygdala of the brain can elicit defensive responses against threats or hazards, which is crucial for survival in and adaptation to risky environments. Drawing inspiration from this scientific discovery, we present a fear-neuro-inspired reinforcement learning framework to realize safe autonomous driving through modeling the amygdala functionality. This new technique facilitates an agent to learn defensive behaviors and achieve safe decision making with fewer safety violations. Through experimental tests, we show that the proposed approach enables the autonomous driving agent to attain state-of-the-art performance compared to the baseline agents and perform comparably to 30 certified human drivers, across various safety-critical scenarios. The results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our framework while also shedding light on the crucial role of simulating the amygdala function in the application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical autonomous driving domains.

AB Legged machines designed to walk on flat or irregular terrain do not need to possess great foot positioning accuracy in order to perform stable motion. However, the propulsion of the body-which normally follows a straight line-, requires feet to follow perfect straight lines-in the body's reference frame-, which must be parallel to each other; otherwise internal foot forces will arise. When this occurs, mainly due to mechanical imperfections and kinematic inaccuracies, foot slippage and changes in the attitude/altitude of the vehicle appear. In the case of legged robots that need to move on rigid structures to achieve stable locomotion, precise foot positioning is required to reduce the foot force interaction. Examples of such robots are legged robots that move by grasping structures or climbing robots that clasp their feet to a wall. Kinematic calibration is a traditional method of improving the accuracy of robot manipulators. These techniques, especially those based on kinematic closed chains, can also be applied to legged robots. This article introduces a method for calibrating legged machines autonomously. The theory has been developed to control a special four-legged robot, and for calibrating purposes each leg has been considered as a 2-DOF leg. Nevertheless, the theory can be easily extended to 3-DOF-leg machines as well as to six-legged machines. The method is of particular interest for industrial machines that walk on rigid structures so that the feet clasp firmly and cannot slip. The method is evaluated through simulation and tested in an industrial four-legged machine developed to walk in a double bottom cell of a ship's hull. Some experiments have been conducted using the calibrated kinematic model to validate the usefulness of the calibration method.

AB Motivated by the growth of ridesourcing services and the expected advent of fully-autonomous vehicles (AVs), this paper defines, models, and compares assignment strategies for a shared-use AV mobility service (SAMS). Specifically, the paper presents the on-demand SAMS with no shared rides, defined as a fleet of AVs, controlled by a central operator, that provides direct origin-to-destination service to travelers who request rides via a mobile application and expect to be picked up within a few minutes. The underlying operational problem associated with the on-demand SAMS with no shared rides is a sequential (i.e. dynamic or time-dependent) stochastic control problem. The AV fleet operator must assign AVs to open traveler requests in real-time as traveler requests enter the system dynamically and stochastically. As there is likely no optimal policy for this sequential stochastic control problem, this paper presents and compares six AV-traveler assignment strategies (i.e. control policies). An agent-based simulation tool is employed to model the dynamic system of AVs, travelers, and the intelligent SAMS fleet operator, as well as, to compare assignment strategies across various scenarios. The results show that optimization-based AV-traveler assignment strategies, strategies that allow en-route pickup AVs to be diverted to new traveler requests, and strategies that incorporate en-route drop-off AVs in the assignment problem, reduce fleet miles and decrease traveler wait times. The more-sophisticated AV-traveler assignment strategies significantly improve operational efficiency when fleet utilization is high (e.g. during the morning or evening peak); conversely, when fleet utilization is low, simply assigning traveler requests sequentially to the nearest idle AV is comparable to more-advanced strategies. Simulation results also indicate that the spatial distribution of traveler requests significantly impacts the empty fleet miles generated by the on-demand SAMS.

ID VEHICLE OVERTAKING; DESIGN; SYSTEM
AB Autonomous driving holds great promise for easing the driver shortage issue that has occurred in many countries. In this paper, we consider a semi-autonomous transit system where (1) individual buses could form platoons to increase bus capacity during peak hours and operate separately during off-peak hours; and (2) buses may drive autonomously in certain geofenced areas yet need to be guided by human drivers elsewhere (e.g., SAE level 4, semi-autonomous). We model buses driving autonomously within the geofenced area as short-turn bus service, and jointly optimize bus dispatch headway, platoon size and service type through an integer programming model to address the driver shortage issue. The proposed model considers real-world and micro-level bus operation processes for mixed traffic of short-turn and full route buses, with bus fleet and driver workforce constraints being modeled endogenously. Since the model is non-linear, we further develop a radial basis function-based surrogate framework to solve the model efficiently. Experimental results show that, compared to the conven-tional bus service that uses fixed bus capacity only, semi-autonomous bus platooning service reduces operation cost significantly while reducing passenger wait time. System performance variations of the proposed model under different driver availabilities are also examined.

AB This paper describes the design, development, and experiments of an autonomous wave-powered boat with a wave devouring propulsion system (WDPS). The WDPS consists of two fins (hydrofoils) below the bow of the boat. They generate thrust force directly from wave power and reduce roll and pitch motion of the boat in the waves. As described herein, first we performed numerical analysis and a preliminary experiment to design the hull form and the WDPS. Based on the analysis and experimentally obtained results, we designed and developed a prototype autonomous wave-powered boat. We also developed electrically powered systems such as a navigation, control, and wireless communication system for the boat. Moreover, we experimentally tested the performance of the developed boat in a test tank and in a coastal sea area. The experimentally obtained results indicate that the developed wave-powered boat can be a useful tool for ocean observation.

AB Visual sensor-based human-computer interaction can provide environmental perception data of traffic road scenes for mechatronic intelligent vehicles. The existing three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction visualization schemes are mainly based on structured scene reconstruction with multiview geometry and are offline operations. It is difficult for large-scale autonomous driving scenes with wide baselines to ensure consistent reconstruction results in the wide field-of-view area and the center of the light-of-sight area. It is also difficult to achieve uniform reconstruction results for regions with drastic depth changes and inconsistent texture fineness. Therefore, we propose a 3D reconstruction-based visualization pipeline for autonomous driving scenes of wide baseline. First, the stereo geometric model is initialized. The parameters of distortion correction and polar calibration are calibrated. Second, the proposed feature chain code resampling (FCCR) is used to uniformly extract the features for regions with inconsistent texture fineness and depth variation. The filtered 3D data are obtained based on the stereo geometric model. Finally, the texture mapping of the mesh skeleton of 3D data is carried out by the bilinear combination of surrounding multilevel gradual textures. The visualization results of scene rendering and scene roaming are realized. The pipeline has been effectively verified on the simulated experimental platform, real vehicle test, and public dataset. It can meet the real-time 3D reconstruction visualization of wide-baseline scenes. The reconstruction texture is uniform, and the detail response is rich. We can present the intuitive, 3D, real-time, graphical physical quantities of scene data for drivers, intelligent vehicles, AR-HUD, and control systems. The method we present has research value and application significance for the practical engineering of electronic images. (C) 2022 SPIE and IS&T

This set contains the estimates of lateral and longitudinal forces as well as the torque. The paper proposes a novel robust VSs design scheme which yields such estimates taking into account inevitable disturbances/noise and modelling uncertainty without any knowledge about tire models used in the AGV. The obtained estimates are used to generate the residuals and to diagnose the current status of the vehicle. Finally, the paper shows the experimental results concerning the application of the developed methods to fault detection of the self-designed and constructed AGV. (C) 2020 ISA.

AB One of the most important issues currently facing the oil and gas industries is the safety and security of pipelines which deliver crude oil from the reservoir to the refineries. Many complications such as waxing, slugging, rusting, theft, etc. obstruct the regular supply of fuel to the refineries. Continuous monitoring of pipelines is a major hurdle because of climatic conditions, length of the pipelines, identification of leakage, etc. Here we showcase an unmanned autonomous powered parachute aerial vehicle designed for monitoring such pipelines, thereby paving a way to solve this problem. The vehicle would follow a planned trajectory for following the pipeline effectively. We present here guidance, navigation and control of a powered parachute aerial vehicle. A nine degree of freedom mathematical model has been presented in detail. Lateral heading and longitudinal altitude hold controller was designed for this purpose. A path planning algorithm verified by actual flight parameters has been designed for following a trajectory using way point navigation.

AB For the time in its 45-year history the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) reached beyond its standard defense contractors and out to the public, and in 2004 held the DARPA Grand Challenge in an effort to attract innovation in order to achieve a military mandate of having one-third of America's ground combat vehicles unmanned by the year 2015. DARPA offered a cash prize of US$1 million to an automonous robotic vehicle that could navigate a 142 mile course in the Mojave desert in less than 10 h. Over 100 applications were submitted, and after further evaluations, DARPA narrowed the field to 25 finalists. After qualifying trials, 15 vehicles confronted the starting line on 13 March 2004. Though the farthest a vehicle got was 7.4 miles, the event was viewed as a technological breakthrough. This paper describes the systems that were set-up to monitor and control the event, and features of the various robots.

AB Mutual exchange of status data between vehicles in close proximity is the basis for safe vehicle operation. Application areas range from driver assistance/warning to fully autonomous driving. To enable this data exchange we need an intervehicle communication (IVC) system. Vehicles involved in mutual data exchange form a kind of local area network, however, the characteristics of this network are quite different from those of conventional networks. The configuration of this kind of network changes from time to time, in terms of organization, proximity group, group position, and relative position; therefore, it is very challenging to establish. The authors have been working on this problem from the point of view of communication media and protocol. In this article the characteristics and requirements of IVC are discussed, and several preliminary communication protocols are proposed. The authors also present some experimental results from the implementation of a function integrating communication by infrared ray with a gap-measuring technique by the vision system.

ID WAVE-FORM DESIGN; FILTER BANK; RECOGNITION
AB The authors present cognitive automotive radar (CARr) as a significant capability to the sensing technology suite of autonomous driving vehicles. CARr is a closed-loop intelligent radar system utilising the automotive frequency bands of 24-25 and 76-77 GHz for the purposes of ground vehicle target signature identification. The authors consider specific cases of ground vehicle recognition and ground vehicle class identification in the presence of aspect angle uncertainty using forward-looking automotive radar. The transmit-adaptive waveforms are based from signal-to-noise ratio and mutual information optimisation metrics. In this study, two new adaptive waveform techniques with the flexibility to accommodate angular uncertainty probability distributions are introduced. The classification performance of these new waveforms is compared against the receive-adaptive wideband pulsed and other transmit-adaptive waveforms in the presence of angular uncertainties characterised by the uniform and truncated normal distributions. To ensure the validity of results, high-fidelity electromagnetic simulated radar cross-section signatures generated from scaled-to-true-physical-size ground vehicle computer-aided design models are utilised.

AB Trajectory prediction in autonomous driving system is an important aspect for preventing for instance the multi-vehicle collision. However, predicting accurately the future location of a vehicle is still a delicate task especially in intelligent transport systems. This paper proposes a hybrid approach of solving the position prediction problem of vehicle in multi-GPS outage conditions such as free and partial as well as short and long complete GPS outages. The proposed approach aggregates the advantages of both fuzzy inference system (FIS) and sparse random Gaussian (SRG) models, consequently named FIS-SRG, leading to a significant decrease in position prediction error of vehicle. The aforementioned outages are defined by adjusting the GPS propagation weight monitored by the Gaussian model and updated by fuzzy logic system. Experimental results based on data from GPS and INS and the comparison study with the existing prediction methods illustrate the good performance of the proposed approach, in all considered GPS outage conditions.

AB A procedure to control all six DOF (degrees of freedom) of a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) without an external reference system and to enable fully autonomous flight is presented here. For 2D positioning the principle of optical flow is used. Together with the output of height estimation, fusing ultrasonic, infrared and inertial and pressure sensor data, the 3D position of the UAV can be computed, controlled and steered. All data processing is done on the UAV. An external computer with a pathway planning interface is for commanding purposes only. The presented system is part of the AQopterI8 project, which aims to develop an autonomous flying quadrocopter for indoor application. The focus of this paper is 2D positioning using an optical flow sensor. As a result of the performed evaluation, it can be concluded that for position hold, the standard deviation of the position error is 10cm and after landing the position error is about 30cm.

AB Traffic accidents caused by drivers' over-reliance on SAE L2 advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) have become a new type of accident worthy of attention. There is growing concern that the "over-hype" about automation technology produced by manufacturers or the media might affect the formation of public misconceptions about autonomous vehicles (AVs), further influencing their unsafe interaction behaviors with the system. The purpose of our study was to explore whether and how "over-hype" in various contexts affects public misconceptions about AVs from the view of causality. We conducted a randomized controlled trial with a control group of 396 participants and a treatment group of 545 participants drawn from Zhenjiang, China. We applied Double Machine Learning (DML), ordered logit models, and significant difference tests to estimate the impact of "over-hype" in various contexts. The results found that the statement that "over-hype" caused public misconceptions was less rigorous. Significant causality varies among contexts of "over-hype" and aspects of misconceptions. Specifically, "over-hype" in fatal accident reports will lead to availability misconception about AVs, but not safety misconception, suggesting that participants believed AVs were available nowadays but not safe as human drivers. "Over-hype" that exaggerates ADAS capabilities has the greatest average treatment effect on public misconceptions, especially the safety misconception. We found that the young and the more educated are more likely to have safety and availability misconceptions under the "over hype" of some contexts. However, the effects of "over-hype" varied less among groups with different socio-economic factors on the whole, which revealed the universality of the influence of "over-hype." The results provided empirical evidence for regulating propaganda about AV technology and provided practical insights on how to introduce AV technology to the general public properly.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE; SURFACE
AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) docking technique attracts attention which leverages the long-term, on-station vehicle launch and recovery for the underwater missions. In this paper, an acoustic communication and imaging sonar guided docking method is proposed to improve the docking accuracy for AUV. In docking system, multibeam forward looking sonar (MFLS) is deployed on the submerged docking station to reduce the noise in acoustic images rather than being fixed on AUV, and the ultra short base line (USBL) transceiver with acoustic communication modules is used to achieve positioning while AUV is out of the view of MFLS. For the docking methodology, a dedicated three-stage docking strategy is presented to guide AUV to the docking station. In the homing stage, AUV navigates to a preset homing place not very far from the docking station via the way-point guidance and self-positioning of the on-board inertial navigation system (INS). In the next stage, USBL provides the relative position for AUV controller via acoustic channel. Moreover, an exponential decay model based filtering algorithm is proposed to eliminate the positioning outliers of USBL. It is expected that AUV will be guided into the perceptual field of MFLS in this stage. In the final stage, the docking accuracy in short range should be improved while USBL may generate outliers due to the louder noise. In this case, the relative positioning is implemented by using kernelized correlation filter (KCF), which is a fast objective tracking algorithm to keep track of the AUV feature in acoustic image until AUV navigates into the docking station or out of the view of sensor. To validate feasibility and performance of the proposed system infrastructure and docking methodology, the docking results are analyzed by contrast with the experiments only use USBL during lake trials.

AB Due to the ongoing enormous infrastructural developments and car ownership culture in Qatar, it could be one of those countries to introduce Autonomous Vehicles (AV) technology at the early stages. Therefore, this study surveyed a number of residents at the State of Qatar to improve our understandings of their perceptions regarding overall safety of AV (General_safety), safety due to the fact that AV could eliminate human errors (Human_errors), safety due to the interactions between Human-Driven Vehicles (HDV) and AV (HDV-AV_in-teractions), performance in harsh environmental conditions, security, comfort level, travel time, congestion and operational costs. In addition, the study uncovered the relationships of public perceptions towards AV and some other contextual factors with the willingness to adopt it in the future. To study these relations, we relied on a Structural Equation Modeling. Overall, the results showed that respondents had higher and positive perceptions regarding "General_safety" and "Human_errors", however, they were more concerned about "HDV-AV_inter-actions" and its security. In addition, individuals' preference to shift to AV in the future was positively correlated with their perception level of "General_safety", "Human_errors", Comfort and Travel_time. Regarding ethnicity of the respondents, non-Arabs reported higher concerns regarding AV security, compared to Arabs. Furthermore, interestingly the results revealed that individuals having higher knowledge about AV technology had more concerns on "General_safety" and "HDV-AV_interactions", while they had positive perceptions that AV could eliminate human errors. The findings from this study are anticipated to allow AV manufacturers and other relevant authorities to enhance public confidence towards AV technology by targeting different sub-groups through particular safety or security awareness campaigns.

ID ELECTRIC VEHICLES
AB An Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) under cold conditions experiences increased friction losses due to a high viscosity of the lubricant. With the additional control freedom present in hybrid electric vehicles, the losses during warmup can be minimized and fuel can be saved.
   In this paper, firstly, a control-oriented model of the ICE, describing the warmup behavior, is developed and validated on measured vehicle data. Secondly, the two-state, non-autonomous fuel optimization, for a parallel hybrid electric vehicle with stop-start functionality, is solved using optimal control theory. The principal behavior of the Lagrange multipliers is explicitly derived, including the discontinuities (jumps) that are caused by the constraints on the lubricant temperature and the energy in the battery system. The minimization of the Hamiltonian for this two-state problem is also explicitly solved, resulting in a computationally efficient algorithm. The optimal controller shows the fuel benefit, as a function of the initial temperature, for a long-haul truck simulated on the FTP-75.

AB Passive safety has for many years reduced the number of fatalities on the roads. However, its effect on occupants' safety has now stabilised, meaning that new active safety features are needed to reduce further the number of casualties. These active safety features, like autonomous emergency braking (AEB), aim to prevent vehicle collisions and reduce the vehicle kinetic energy on impact. A previous study has shown that unbelted occupants kinematics are affected by the pre-braking phase, suggesting that the occupant's hand positions on the steering wheel, combined with a bracing behaviour, could cause the occupant to miss the deploying airbag in the case of a secondary rigid wall impact. This paper will investigate the variations of the secondary vehicle impact crash patterns by calculating crash pulses based on typical vehicle frontal accident scenarios and conclude on these effects on the human occupant's neck, head and thorax injuries.

AB This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the propensity toward autonomous vehicles (AVs). The main hypothesis of this study is that individuals' decisions toward AVs vary by their modality style, and it is possible to identify a distinct set of attitudes toward AVs among people with distinct mobility profiles. A latent class clustering analysis model was applied to the survey data, and three distinct user classes (sub-datasets) were identified, including auto-dependent users, all-mode users, and non-drivers (passengers and transit users). Separate structural equation models were developed to identify a distinct set of attitudes for each user class and estimate their propensity toward AV technology. The results showed that attitudes play a critical role in users' behavior toward AV adoption and WTP. Moreover, the identified attitudes for each class and their contribution to the decisions were different among the three classes, confirming the necessity to develop separate models to account for the heterogeneity in their choice behavior. In view of attitudes, pro-technology showed significant positive impacts on both AV adoption and WTP for auto-dependent users and non-drivers. While self-driving features might motivate auto dependent users to adopt AV technologies, driving assistance features seemed to be more important for all-mode users in their adoption and WTP decisions. Trip privacy and data privacy concerns presented potential barriers for auto users and all-mode users but did not show significant impacts for non-drivers, who were more likely to be discouraged from adopting AVs by the joy of driving. The findings contribute to the current literature by providing more in-depth insights into users' attitudes toward AV technologies and a better understanding of their decisions to adopt and pay for AV technologies.

AB Robust and reliable vehicle detection from images acquired by a moving vehicle (i.e., on-road vehicle detection) is an important problem with applications to driver assistance systems and autonomous, self-guided vehicles. The focus of this work is on the issues of feature extraction and classification for rear-view vehicle detection. Specifically, by treating the problem of vehicle detection as a two-class classification problem, we have investigated several different feature extraction methods such as principal component analysis, wavelets, and Gabor filters. To evaluate the extracted features, we have experimented with two popular classifiers, neural networks and support vector machines (SVMs). Based on our evaluation results, we have developed an on-board real-time monocular vehicle detection system that is capable of acquiring grey-scale images, using Ford's proprietary low-light camera, achieving an average detection rate of 10 Hz. Our vehicle detection algorithm consists of two main steps: a multiscale driven hypothesis generation step and an appearance-based hypothesis verification step. During the hypothesis generation step, image locations where vehicles might be present are extracted. This step uses multiscale techniques not only to speed up detection, but also to improve system robustness. The appearance-based hypothesis verification step verifies the hypotheses using Gabor features and SVMs. The system has been tested in Ford's concept vehicle under different traffic conditions (e.g., structured highway, complex urban streets, and varying weather conditions), illustrating good performance.

AB This paper addresses vehicle positioning, a topic whose importance has risen dramatically in the context of future autonomous driving systems. While classical methods that use GPS and/or beacon signals from network infrastructure for triangulation tend to be sensitive to multi-paths and signal obstruction, our method exhibits robustness with respect to such phenomena. Our approach builds on the recently proposed Channel-SLAM method which first enabled leveraging of multi-path so as to improve (single) vehicle positioning. Here, we propose a cooperative mapping approach which builds upon the Channel-SLAM concept, referred to here as Team Channel-SLAM. Team Channel-SLAM not only exploits the stationary nature of many reflecting objects around the vehicle, but also capitalizes on the multi-vehicle nature of road traffic. The key intuition behind our method is the exploitation for the first time of the correlation between reflectors around multiple neighboring vehicles. An algorithm is derived for reflector selection and estimation, combined with a team particle filter (TPF) so as to achieve high precision simultaneous multiple vehicle positioning. We obtain large improvement over the single-vehicle positioning scenario, with gains being already noticeable for moderate vehicle densities, such as over 40% improvement for a vehicle density as low as 4 vehicles in 132 meters' length road.

AB This paper presents a system for the execution of autonomous cinematography missions with a team of drones. The system allows media directors to design missions involving different types of shots with one or multiple cameras, running sequentially or concurrently. We introduce the complete architecture, which includes components for mission design, planning and execution. Then, we focus on the components related to autonomous mission execution. First, we propose a novel parametric description for shots, considering different types of camera motion and tracked targets; and we use it to implement a set of canonical shots. Second, for multi-drone shot execution, we propose distributed schedulers that activate different shot controllers on board the drones. Moreover, an event-based mechanism is used to synchronize shot execution among the drones and to account for inaccuracies during shot planning. Finally, we showcase the system with field experiments filming sport activities, including a real regatta event. We report on system integration and lessons learnt during our experimental campaigns.

AB The next wave in smart transportation is directed towards the design of renewable energy sources that can fuel automobile sector to shift towards the autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs). AEVs are sensor-driven and driverless that uses artificial intelligence (AI)-based interactions in Internet-of-vehicles (IoV) ecosystems. AEVs can reduce carbon footprints and trade energy with peer AEVs, smart grids (SG), and roadside units (RSUs). It supports green transportation vision. However, the sensor information, energy units, and user data are exchanged through open channels, and thus, are susceptible to various security and privacy attacks. Thus, AEVs can be remotely operated and directed by malicious entities that can propagate false updates to the peer nodes in IoV environment. This can cause the failure of components, congestion, as well as the entire disruption of IoV network. Globally researchers and security analysts have addressed solutions that pertain to specific security requirements, but still, the detection and classification of malicious AEVs is a widely studied topic. Malicious AEVs exhibit an anomaly behavior that differentiates them from normal AEVs, and thereby, the detection of anomalous AEVs and classification of anomaly type is required. Motivated from the aforementioned facts, the survey presents a systematic outlook of AI techniques in anomaly detection of AEVs. A solution taxonomy is proposed based on research gaps in the existing surveys, and the evaluation metrics for AI-based anomaly detection are discussed. The open challenges and issues in AI deployments are discussed and a case study is presented on anomaly classification through a weighted ensemble technique. Thus, the proposed survey is designed to guide the manufacturing industry, AI practitioners, and researchers worldwide to formulate and design accurate and precise mechanisms to detect anomalies.

AB Due to the unavailability of prototypes, the early adopters of novel products actively seek information from multiple sources (e.g., media and social networks) to minimize the potential risk. The existing behavior models not only fail to capture the information propagation within the individual's social network, but also they do not incorporate the impact of such word-of-mouth (WOM) dissemination on the consumer's risk preferences. Moreover, even cutting-edge forecasting models rely on crude/synthetic consumer behavior models. We propose a general framework to forecast the adoption of novel products by developing a new consumer behavior model and integrating it into a population-level agent-based model. Specifically, we extend the hybrid choice model to estimate consumer behavior, which incorporates social network effects and interplay between WOM and risk aversion. The calibrated consumer behavior model and synthetic population are passed through the agent-based model for forecasting the product market share. We apply the proposed framework to forecast the adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in Nashville, USA. The consumer behavior model is calibrated with a stated preference survey data of 1,495 Nashville residents. The output of the agent-based model provides the effect of the purchase price, post-purchase satisfaction, and safety measures/regulations on the forecasted AV market share. With an annual AV price reduction of 5% at the initial purchase price of $60,000 and 90% of satisfied adopters, AVs are forecasted to attain around 80% market share in thirty-one years. These findings are crucial for policymakers to develop infrastructure plans and manufacturers to conduct an after-sales cost-benefit analysis.

AB The desire to conduct research in the Arctic on an ever-larger spatiotemporal scale has led to the development of long-range autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), such as the Autosub Long-Range 1500 (ALR1500). While these platforms open up a world of new applications, their actual use is limited in GPS-denied environments since self-contained navigation remains yet unavailable. In response, this study evaluates whether terrain-aided navigation (TAN) can enable multimonth deployments using basic navigation sensors and sparse bathymetric maps. To evaluate the potential, ALR1500 undertakes a hypothetical science-driven mission from Svalbard (Norway) to Point Barrow (Alaska, USA) under the sea ice (a mission over 3200 km). Therefore, a simulated environment is developed, which integrates a state-of-the-art model of water circulation, error models for heading estimation at high latitudes, and an Arctic bathymetric map. Recognizing that this map is constructed based on sparse depth measurements and interpolation techniques, a bathymetric uncertainty model is developed. The performance of the TAN algorithm is examined with respect to the type of the heading sensor utilized and a range of vertical map distortions, calculated using the developed bathymetric uncertainty model. Simulations show that unaided navigation experiences an error of hundreds of kilometers, whereas TAN provides acceptable accuracy given a moderate map distortion. By degrading the quality of the map further, it appears that the navigation filter may diverge when traversing large regions subject to interpolation. Therefore, a rapidly-exploring random tree star algorithm is used to design a new path such that the AUV traverses reliable and rich in topographic information areas.

AB This paper considers the problem of a small, fixed-wing UAV equipped with a gimbaled camera autonomously tracking an unpredictable moving ground vehicle. Thus, the UAV must maintain close proximity to the ground target and simultaneously keep the target in its camera's visibility region. To achieve this objective robustly, two novel optimization-based control strategies are developed. The first assumes an evasive target motion while the second assumes a stochastic target motion. The resulting optimal control policies have been successfully flight tested, thereby demonstrating the efficacy of both approaches in a real-world implementation and highlighting the advantages of one approach over the other.

AB Underwater vehicles' coordination and formation have attracted increasing attention since they have great potential for real-world applications. However, such vehicles are usually under-actuated and with very limited communication capabilities. On the basis of the multibody system concept, a multiple autonomous underwater vehicle formation and communication link framework has been established with an adaptive and radial basis function (RBF) strategy. For acoustic communication, a packets transmission scheme with topology and protocol has been investigated on the basis of an acoustic communication framework and transmission model. Moreover, the cooperative localization errors caused by packet loss are estimated through reinforcement learning radial basis function neural networks. Furthermore, in order to realize formation cruising, an adaptive RBF formation scheme with magnitude reduced multi-layered potential energy functions has been designed on the basis of a time-delayed network framework. Finally, simulations and experiments have been extensively performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

AB This paper presents a solution for the formation flight problem for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) cooperating to execute a required mission. Learning Based Model Predictive Control (LBMPC) is implemented on the team of UAVs in order to accomplish the required formation. All flight simulations respect Reynold's rules of flocking to avoid UAV collisions with nearby flockmates, match the team members velocity and stay close to each other during the formation. The main contribution of this paper lies in the application of LBMPC to solve the problem of formation for an autonomous team of UAVs. The proposed solution is theoretically, by the application of analysis to the problem, demonstrated to be stable. Moreover, simulations support the findings of the paper. The main contributions of this paper are the proposed LBMPC formulation for formation of vehicles with uncertainty in their models, and the theoretical analysis of the solution.

AB A modified PD (proportional-derivative) controller for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is presented in this paper. The controller is expressed in terms of first-order equations of motion with a unit inertia matrix. The main difference between the proposed controller and the classical one relies on that the dynamics of the system is taken into account. This property ensures fast error and force convergence to the end-value. The PD controller can be applied for fully actuated AUVs. It is worth noting that the regulator gain matrices are selected based on parameters of the tested vehicle. The stability of the presented control law is proved in the sense of Lyapunov. Moreover, some advantages and observations resulting from the use of the controller are given. The performance of the controller is shown via simulations on a 6-DOF underwater vehicle.

AB The "last-mile problem" of public transportation is one of the main obstacles affecting travelers who choose to utilize public transport. Although autonomous vehicles (AVs) have made much progress, they have not been officially put into commercial use. This paper adopts stated preference experiments to explore the impact of shared AVs on the last-mile travel behavior of metro users and takes Wuhan as an example for case analysis. First of all, this paper establishes a structural equation model (SEM) based on the theory of planned behavior to explore latent psychological variables, including travelers' attitudes (ATTs), subjective norms (SNs), perceived behavior control (PBC), and behavioral intention of use (BIU) toward AVs. These latent psychological variables are incorporated into the latent class (LC) logit model to establish a hybrid model with which to study the factors and degree of influence on the travel mode choices of travelers for the last mile of their metro trips. The results show that travelers have preference heterogeneity for the travel mode choices for the last mile of metro trips. Through the analysis of LCs, education, career, and income significantly impact the classification of LCs. The latent psychological variables towards AVs have a significant impact on the travel behavior of respondents, but the impacts vary among different segments. Elastic analysis results illustrate that a 1% increase in the travel cost for shared AVs in segment 1 leads to a 7.598% decrease in the choice probability of using a shared AV. Respondents from different segments vary significantly in their willingness to pay for their usage, and the value of travel time for high-income groups is relatively higher.

AB Erosional and depositional bedforms have been imaged at outcrop scale in the upper Redondo Fan, in the San Pedro Basin of offshore Southern California in >= 600 m water depths, using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle developed by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. The Autonomous Underwater Vehicle is equipped with multibeam and chirp sub-bottom sonars. Sampling and photographic images using the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute Remotely Operated Vehicle Tiburon provide groundtruth for the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle survey. The 0 center dot 3 m vertical and 1 center dot 5 m lateral bathymetric resolution and 0 center dot 1 m sub-bottom profile resolution provide unprecedented detail of bedform morphology and structure. Multiple channels within the Redondo Fan have been active at different times during the Late Holocene (0 to 3000 yr bp). The currently active channel extending from Redondo Canyon makes an abrupt 90 degrees turn at the canyon mouth before resuming a south-easterly course along the east side of the Redondo Fan. This channel is floored by sand and characterized by small steps generally < 1 m in relief, spaced 10 to 80 m in the down-channel direction. A broader channel complex lies along the western side of the fan valley that was last active more than 850 years ago. Two distinct trains of large scours, with widths ranging from tens to a few hundred metres and depths of 20 m, occur on the floor of the western channel complex, which has a thin mud drape. If observed in cross-section only, these large scours would probably be misidentified as the thalweg of an active channel.

AB This study aimed to identify the key factors associated with Australian parents' willingness to use an automated vehicle to transport their unaccompanied child(ren). Seven hundred and seventy-five participants completed the online survey (M = 40.7 years, SD = 8.9 years, Range = 18.0-65.0 years; Female: 56.4%). Most participants reported that they would 'never' use an automated vehicle to transport their unaccompanied child(ren) (43.5%). The results of a logistic regression model showed that participants' age, gender, level of education, propensity for technology adoption, aberrant driving behaviours, awareness of advanced driver assistance safety (ADAS) technologies, perceived knowledge regarding automated vehicles, as well their requirements for assurance-related vehicle features were significantly associated with their willingness to use an automated vehicle to transport their unaccompanied child(ren), chi(2)(12) = 137.41, p < 0.001). Overall, the findings suggest that Australian parents are mostly unwilling to use an automated vehicle to transport their unaccompanied child(ren) unless various reassurance features and technologies (i.e., microphones, camera, ability to summon assistance if the vehicle breaks down) are embedded in the vehicle. Therefore, automated vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to consider these requirements when prototyping their designs so that all user groups, including child occupants, can benefit from the impending arrival of automated technologies.

AB The detection of the maneuvers of the surrounding vehicles is important for autonomous vehicles to act accordingly to avoid possible accidents. This study proposes a framework based on contrastive representation learning to detect potentially dangerous cut-in maneuvers that can happen in front of the ego vehicle. First, the encoder network is trained in a self supervised fashion with contrastive loss where two augmented videos of the same video clip stay close to each other in the embedding space, while augmentations from different videos stay far apart. Since no maneuver labeling is required in this step, a relatively large dataset can be used. After this self-supervised training, the encoder is fine-tuned with our cut-in/lane-pass labeled datasets. Instead of using original video frames, we simplified the scene by highlighting surrounding vehicles and ego lane. We have investigated the use of several classification heads, augmentation types, and scene simplification alternatives. The most successful model outperforms the best fully supervised model by similar to 2% with an accuracy of 92.52%.

ID MODEL
AB Predicting object motion behaviour is a challenging but crucial task for safe decision making and path planning for autonomous vehicles. It is challenging in large part due to the uncertain, multi-modal, and practically intractable set of possible agent-agent and agent-space interactions, especially in urban driving settings. Models solely based on constant velocity or social force have an inherent bias and may lead to inaccurate predictions across the prediction horizon whereas purely data driven approaches suffer from a lack of holistic set of rules governing predictions. We tackle this problem by introducing MPC-PF: a novel potential field-based trajectory predictor that incorporates social interaction via agent-agent and agent-space considerations and is able to tradeoff between inherent model biases across the prediction horizon. Through evaluation on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset and a variety of other common urban driving scenarios, we show that our model is capable of achieving state-of-the-art performance while producing accurate predictions for both short and long term timesteps.

AB This paper proposes a multi-objective cooperative control method for a ship-towing system in congested water traffic environments. The control objectives are to coordinate multiple autonomous tugboats for transporting a ship to: (i) follow the waypoints, (ii) adjust the heading, (iii) track the speed profile, and (iv) resolve collisions. The problem is tackled by the design of multiple control agents distributed in two control layers. Based on the strategy of model predictive control (MPC), the supervisory controller in the higher layer calculates the towing angles and forces of the ship, the tug controller in the lower layer computes the tug thruster forces and moment. The consensus between the lower and higher layer control is achieved by using the altering direction method of multipliers (ADMM) that makes the predicted tug position and heading approach to the desired tug trajectory. Simulation experiments indicate that the proposed method coordinates multiple autonomous tugboats to transport a ship smoothly and effectively and succeeds in multiple control objectives, in the meantime, the avoidance operation complies with COLREGS rules.

AB Self-driving technology has made great advancements with the help of artificial intelligence and intelligent transportation system. Recent studies have shown that traffic efficiency and safety of autonomous vehicles can be further improved by autonomous platooning based on vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). However, hybrid traffic where autonomous platoons (APs) and individual human driven-vehicles (HDVs) co-exists is seldom considered. Wireless Access in the Vehicular Environment (WAVE) is the de facto wireless protocol for VANETs. WAVE has provided one control channel (CCH) and six service channels (SCHs). The multi-channel access scheme should be jointly designed along with the CCH communication protocol. To design a reliable and efficient communication protocol for hybrid traffic, we propose a platoon-centric multi-channel access scheme based on the reliable broadcast. The reliable broadcast scheme utilizes an enhanced RTS/CTS mechanism designed for multicast communications. A broadcast frequency control mechanism is proposed to balance CCH access intervals. Our scheme can improve the reliability of CCH communication and increase SCH utilization with minimal overhead. Analysis and simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed mechanism.

ID TRACKING
AB Maritime collision avoidance systems rely on accurate state estimates of other objects in the environment from a tracking system. Traditionally, this understanding is generated using one or more active sensors such as radars and lidars. Imaging sensors such as daylight cameras have recently become a popular addition to these sensor suites due to their low cost and high resolution. However, most tracking systems still rely exclusively on active sensors or a fusion of active and passive sensors. In this work, we present a complete collision avoidance system relying solely on camera tracking. The viability of this autonomous navigation system is verified through a real-world, closed-loop collision avoidance experiment with a single target in Trondheim, Norway in December 2022. Accurate tracking was established in all scenarios and the collision avoidance system took appropriate actions to avoid collisions.

ID CITY LOGISTICS; VEHICLES; INNOVATION
AB Autonomous deliveries are being tested on university campuses around the world, but the impact of such technology on the business models of freight service providers is poorly understood. Through interviews, workshops and site visits, this paper explores the potential impact of autonomous deliveries on the business model of a campus-based freight services provider and what potential general lessons can be learned. The results identify costs and benefits that are contingent on the type of resources and activities that the provider of the autonomous system incorporates in their service. While door-to-door deliveries of intermittent and low-volume batches to and from the depot or between local receivers were identified as attractive and feasible service segments, the realisation of a more valuable high-volume room-to-room service would require considerable investments at both the depot and the delivery points. To improve the quality of autonomous deliveries the investments need to target three principal barriers: access, capability, and acceptance. Willingness to make investments depend on the freight service provider's ability to present tangible benefits to stakeholders and generate sustainable customer value. To support a scalable business model, autonomous delivery services must be designed to minimise interference with stakeholders encountered in public spaces and at delivery spots.

AB The evaluation for autonomous capability of ground-attack unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) comes from the demand of reality, which determines the operational use of airborne equipment authority. It essentially entails a multicriteria decision-making process accounting for evaluation model and uncertainties. Firstly, as for the construction of evaluation model, the index model is proposed from four aspects of observation capability, decision capability, action capability, and security capability, namely, ODAS, which analogizes cognitive behavior mechanism of human based on airborne equipment; then, to solve uncertainties of randomness and fuzziness in the process of autonomous capability evaluation, a cloud model approach is proposed, which expresses uncertainties by the certainty degree distribution. Finally, the cloud model-based approach is tested by evaluating typical UAVs and comparing with Hopfield neural network method. The results show that the evaluation of the autonomous capability based on the cloud model is accurate and more representative than the Hopfield neural network method.

We introduce a concrete simulation model of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). We then show how the probabilistic model checker PRISM is used for optimal strategy synthesis for a sequence of scenarios relevant to UAVs and potentially other autonomous agent systems. For each scenario we demonstrate how it can be modelled using PRISM, give model checking statistics and present the synthesised optimal strategies. We then show how our strategies can be returned to the controller for the simulation model and provide experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of one such strategy. Finally we explain how our models can be adapted, using symmetry, for use on larger search areas, and demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are pointed out as the technology that will reshape the concept of mobility, with significant implications for the economy, the environment, and society. This fact will bring new challenge to cities urban planning. Research to anticipate the AVs impacts, maximizing their benefits and reduce trade-offs are currently crucial. This work investigates the potential challenges and benefits of gradually replace internal combustion engine human driven vehicles with different penetration rates of AVs -10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, and 100% -in urban roads of different characteristics, either in terms of traffic singularities or volumes, and its related implications on air quality. For that purpose, two urban areas with distinct features, Porto and Aveiro, were selected as case studies, and a modelling setup composed of a traffic model, an emission model, and a local air quality model was applied. The results revealed that the AVs benefits are directly linked with the urban design and the road characteristics. In the Aveiro case study, the AVs promoted positive changes with average reductions in daily NOx emissions (compared with the baseline scenario, without AVs) ranging between-2.1% (for C10%) and -7.7% (for C100%). In line with the emissions impacts, positive effects were found on air quality, with average reductions of NO2 concentrations up to-4% (for C100%). In Porto urban area, slight differences in NOx emissions were obtained (< 2%), which implied no changes in the air quality levels. The distinct impact of AVs in the study areas is mostly explained by the traffic light coordination system and directional split distributions in the main roads. These results provide valuable insights to support decision-makers in the definition of strategies that allow the integration of these new emerging technologies in the road infrastructure, considering the features of the urban design, traffic profile and road characteristics.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are increasingly common, although there remain a number of limitations that need to be addressed in order for their deployment to be more widespread. For example, to mitigate the failure of self-driving functions in AVs, introducing the remote control capability (which allows a human driver to operate the vehicle remotely in certain circumferences) is one of several countermeasures proposed. However, the remote control capability breaks the isolation of onboard driving systems and can be potentially exploited by malicious actors to take over control of the AVs; thus, risking the safety of the passengers and pedestrians (e.g., AVs are remotely taken over by terrorist groups to carry out coordinated attacks in places of mass gatherings). Therefore, security is a key, mandatory feature in the design of AVs. In this paper, we propose a cloud-centric three-factor authentication and key agreement protocol (CT-AKA) integrating passwords, biometrics and smart cards to ensure secure access to both cloud and AVs. Three typical biometric encryption approaches, including fuzzy vault, fuzzy commitment, and fuzzy extractor, are unified to achieve three-factor authentication without leaking the biometric privacy of users. Moreover, two session keys are negotiated in our protocol, namely: one between the user and AV to support secure remote control of the AV, and the other is negotiated between the mobile device and the cloud to introduce resilience to the compromise of ephemeral security parameters to ensure cloud data access security with a high security guarantee. Finally, we formally verify the security properties and evaluate the efficiency of CT-AKA, whose findings demonstrate that the protocol achieves high security strength with reasonable computation and communication costs.

ID DESIGN; DEPARTURE; MODEL
AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), particularly those with a hybrid electric powertrain, have the potential to significantly improve vehicle energy savings in real-world driving conditions. In particular, the ecodriving problem seeks to design optimal speed and power usage profiles based on available information from connectivity and advanced mapping features to minimize the fuel consumption over an itinerary. This paper presents a hierarchical multilayer model predictive control (MPC) approach for improving the fuel economy of a 48 V mild-hybrid powertrain in a connected vehicle environment. Approximate dynamic programing (DP) is used to solve the receding horizon optimal control problem, whose terminal cost is approximated with the base policy obtained from the long-term optimization. The controller was tested virtually (with deterministic and Monte Carlo simulation) across multiple real-world routes, demonstrating energy savings of more than 20%. The controller was then deployed on a test vehicle equipped with a rapid prototyping embedded controller. In-vehicle testing confirm the energy savings obtained in simulation and demonstrate the real-time ability of the controller.

AB Semantic understanding of multi-vehicle interaction patterns at intersections play a pivotal role in proper decision-making of autonomous vehicles. This paper presents a flexible framework to automatically extract these interaction patterns from observed temporal sequences based on driving primitives. A Bayesian nonparametric approach is developed to segment vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) sequential observations into small analytically interpretable components (called driving primitives) without using prior knowledge. Then, an unsupervised clustering method is developed to gather these driving primitives into groups (called driving patterns) by integrating with dynamic time warping. In addition, the extracted driving primitives are used to quantitatively analyze the similarities between behaviors at different intersections using a relative entropy metric, i.e., KullbackLeibler (KL) divergence. Finally, 706 naturalistic V2V events from eight typical urban signalized intersections are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed primitive-based framework. Experimental results demonstrate that there exist 15 types of interactive driving patterns for V2V behaviors at intersections in our database. Moreover, the distribution of interactive driving patterns could characterize the types of intersections.

AB Buoyancy-driven underwater vehicles are key tools for obtaining data from the ocean. Underwater gliders and profiling floats, equipped with sensors, provide crucial information on ocean processes and climate changes. The Variable Buoyancy System (VBS) is a key element of these vehicles, and is in many cases the most complex and highest energy-consuming subsystem. Energy consumption directly determines a vehicle's endurance and mission duration. This paper presents the design and testing of a miniature hydraulic VBS suitable for integration into small underwater vehicles and platforms. Previous VBS are reviewed, existing principles such as hydraulics and pneumatics are described, and an overview of their strengths and weaknesses is provided. The paper explains the concept and the components of the micro-hydraulic VBS, and provides experimental results from its testing in a pressure vessel up to 1000 m equivalent depth. All the components of the system were designed to be of low weight and small size in order to be used in small underwater vehicles such as gliders and profiling floats. The efficiency of the system is characterized for different operating conditions, and provides the basis for vehicle energy system design and endurance characterizations.

AB Underwater vehicles are being emphasized as highly integrated and intelligent devices for a significant number of oceanic operations. However, their precise operation is usually hindered by disturbances from a tether or manipulator because their propellers are unable to realize a stable suspension. A dynamic multi-body model-based adaptive controller was designed to allow the controller of the vehicle to observe and compensate for disturbances from a tether or manipulator. Disturbances, including those from a tether or manipulator, are deduced for the observation of the controller. An analysis of a tether disturbance covers the conditions of the surface, the underwater area, and the vehicle end point. Interactions between the vehicle and manipulator are mainly composed of coupling forces and restoring moments. To verify the robustness of the controller, path-following experiments on a streamlined autonomous underwater vehicle experiencing various disturbances were conducted in Song Hua Lake in China. Furthermore, path-following experiments for a tethered open frame remote operated vehicle were verified for accurate cruising with a controller and an observer, and vehicle and manipulator coordinate motion control during the simulation and experiments verified the effectiveness of the controller and observer for underwater operation. This study provides instructions for the control of an underwater vehicle experiencing disturbances from a tether or manipulator.

AB A neural computer is helpful to automation of motor vehicle driving. In the present paper, a motor vehicle which can be automatically driven by a learning neural computer is called a learning motor vehicle, and as a basic element for the neural computer, a continuous-time Folthret is newly proposed. It was embodied as an electronic circuit, and two of the continuous-time Folthret-embodying electronic circuits were used to constitute a simple neural computer which was mounted on an electric motor vehicle, to make a learning motor vehicle. Finally, to automate regular driving operation, the manufactured learning motor vehicle was used for a driving experiment, in which the neural computer was made to learn the relation between the steering operation of a driver and the surrounding scenes, for examining its autonomous driving performance in reference to the traveling course. As a result, it was confirmed that the computer could learn the steering operation of the driver after about ten trials even though the conditions were limited to constant driving speed, simple scenes, relatively narrow room, static environment, less input information and a learning motor vehicle very simple in neural computer structure, and it was demonstrated that a neural computer was effective to some extent for automation of motor vehicle driving.

By analyzing the practical significance of digital twin technology in automobile field, the framework of vehicle stability monitoring system is proposed, which includes vehicle physical system, virtual vehicle model system, vehicle twin data platform and comprehensive monitoring system. Firstly, a virtual vehicle model is established, and its accuracy and real-time performance are verified by real vehicle test. The PSOLSTM (Particle Swarm Optimization Long and Short-Term Memory) algorithm relied on the improved LSTM (Long and Short-Term Memory) is designed in the cause of construct automobile side slip angle state estimator model, which has better accuracy and followability. Secondly, a simulation experiment platform and a real vehicle test platform are built based on the comprehensive monitoring system to verify the accuracy and real-time performance of the designed vehicle side slip angle state estimator model. The experiments show that the maximum estimation error of automobile side slip angle is only 0.634deg under four different working conditions. Finally, a digital twin vehicle stability monitoring platform based on side slip angle is designed. The new intelligent vehicle active safety control mode of "data-driven, virtual-real combination, accurate estimation, autonomous decision-making, shared autonomy" is realized under the drive of digital twin.

The vehicle dynamics is subjected to a non-holonomic velocity constraint arising due to fluid interactions, resulting in a differential algebraic equation (DAE) formulation for the equations of motion. A reduced order state-space model in a chained form is derived after solving the constraint force. A hierarchical geometric control law is designed for tracking the position of the centre of mass, via this chained form so that the tracking error is almost globally exponentially stable. Simulations on a planar AUV model have been presented to illustrate the performance of the control law.

AB This article describes a remote experimentation environment for marine vehicles (Hardware and Software) and its application in engineering education. The laboratory has an in-scale model of a turbo-ferry tf-120 which keeps all the hydrodynamic characteristics of the full-scale vessel. The physical model was developed to be autonomous and is controlled remotely from a PC using Wi-Fi communications. It has the instruments commonly used in vessels such as: GPS, UMI, accelerometers and gyrocompass. A simulation of a manoeuvring model has been developed based on geometrical definitions and compared to a heading identified model. The possibilities of the remote laboratory for engineering education are discussed. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Comput Appl Eng Educ 20: 728740, 2012

AB In order to improve the persistent operation capacity of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), autonomous recovery system draws more and more attention in recent years. A hybrid scheme combined with navigation, guidance and control is proposed to complete the function of autonomous recovery of AUV in the paper. Based on the hybrid scheme, the autonomous recovery is firstly transformed into the trajectory tracking problem, and the Dubins path planning method is adopted to build the three-dimensional(3D) motion path of AUV. Secondly, the virtual target guidance strategy is introduced to guide the AUV to track the desired path. Finally, a non-singular terminal sliding mode controller is designed to control the AUV. Due to the existence of model inaccuracy of AUV and external disturbances from the environment, a finite-time disturbance observer is adopted to estimate the disturbance and uncertainty in the system. Numerical simulation is conducted to verify its performance. The simulation results show that a 3D motion path can be planed and the AUV can track the motion path well.

TI Generalized Ising model for dynamic adaptation in autonomous systems
SO EPL
LA English
DT Article
ID STATISTICAL-MECHANICS; TIME-SERIES; COVERAGE
AB The paper presents a concept of Statistical Mechanics for observation-based adaptation in autonomous systems, which is typically exhibited by simple biological systems. Time-critical operations of autonomous systems (e. g., unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs)), require in situ adaptation in the original plan of action and rapid response to evolving contextual changes and situation awareness for enhanced autonomy. In this regard, a concept of dynamic plan adaptation (DPA) is formulated in the setting of a generalized Ising model (e. g., the Potts model) over a discretized configuration space, where the targets (e. g., undersea mines) are distributed. An exogenous time-dependent potential field is defined that controls the movements of the autonomous system in the configuration space, while the decision-theoretic tool for dynamic plan adaptation is built upon local neighborhood interactions. The efficacy of the DPA algorithm has been evaluated by simulation experiments that demonstrate early detection of localized neighborhood targets as compared to a conventional search method involving back and forth motions.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE; FUZZY CONTROL; PITCH
AB This paper considers the control of one unmanned semi-submersible vehicle (USV), named BQ-01, where the submersible depth cannot exceed a few meters in the presence of environmental disturbances. Consequently, the depth control performance measures and the rejection of disturbances, such as those due to sea waves, must be within pre-determined ranges to ensure maximum use of such vehicles. This paper develops a control scheme that combines the state feedback control and rule-based supervision for depth control, where the entries in the feedback control matrix are adjusted by rules formulated from the state errors in the USV diving plane. Surge speed also plays an important role in adjusting control parameters because of its coupled relationship with the state depth of the diving plane. The results from sea trials are given and confirm the potential of the design.

AB This study considers a downlink power consumption problem for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted wireless communications, in which UAVs are used as aerial base stations to provide service for the ground users and equipped with a directional antenna of fixed beamwidth. Moreover, the on-board circuit power of UAV is taking into consideration. The authors derive a closed-form expression for the optimal flying altitude and number of UAVs by minimising the total power consumption under the users' rate requirements in the given coverage area. The numerical simulation and theoretical results show that the optimal flying altitude of UAVs depends on the beamwidth of the directional antenna at UAVs, the on-board circuit power of UAVs, and the rate constraint of each user.

AB This paper reports the formulation and evaluation of a centralized extended Kalman filter designed for a novel navigation system for underwater vehicles. The navigation system employs Doppler sonar, depth sensors, synchronous clocks, and acoustic modems to achieve simultaneous acoustic communication and navigation. The use of a single moving reference beacon eliminates the requirement for the underwater vehicle to remain in a bounded navigable area; the use of underwater modems and synchronous clocks enables range measurements based on one-way time-of-flight information from acoustic data-packet broadcasts. The acoustic data packets are broadcast from a single, moving reference beacon and can be received simultaneously by multiple vehicles within acoustic range. We report results from a simulated deep-water survey and real field data collected from an autonomous underwater vehicle survey in 4000 m of water on the southern Mid-Atlantic Ridge with an independent long-baseline navigation system for ground truth.

AB A new sensor-based homing integrated guidance and control law is presented to drive an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) toward a fixed target, in three dimensions, using the information provided by an ultrashort baseline (USBL) positioning system. The guidance and control law is first derived using quaternions to express the vehicle's attitude kinematics, which are directly obtained from the time differences of arrival (TDOA) measured by the USBL sensor. The dynamics are then included resorting to backstepping techniques. The proposed Lyapunov-based control law yields global asymptotic stability in the absence of external disturbances and is further extended, keeping the same properties, to the case where constant known ocean currents affect the dynamics of the vehicle. Finally, a globally exponentially stable nonlinear TDOA and range-based observer is introduced to estimate the ocean current and uniform asymptotic stability is obtained for the overall closed-loop system. Simulations are presented illustrating the performance of the proposed solutions.

AB One of the main challenges autonomous vehicles (AVs) will face is interacting with pedestrians, especially at unmarked midblock locations where the right-of-way is unspecified. This study investigates pedestrians' crossing behavior given different roadway centerline features (i.e., undivided, two-way left-turn lane, and median) and various AV operational schemes portrayed to pedestrians through on-vehicle signals (i.e., no signal, yellow negotiating indication, and yellow/ blue negotiating/no-yield indications). This study employs virtual reality (VR) to simulate an urban unmarked midblock environment where pedestrians interact with AVs as they cross a fourlane arterial roadway. Results demonstrate that both roadway centerline design features and AV operations and signaling significantly impact pedestrians' unmarked midblock crossing behavior, including the waiting time at the curb, waiting time in the middle of the road, and the total crossing time. But only the roadway centerline design features significantly impact the walking time. Participants in the undivided scene spent a longer time waiting at the curb and walking on the road than in the median and TWLTL scenes, but they spent a shorter time waiting in the middle of the road. Compared to the AV without a signal, the design of yellow signal significantly reduced pedestrian waiting time at the curb and in the middle. But yellow/blue signals significantly increased the pedestrian waiting time. Interaction effects between roadway centerline design features and AV operations and signaling are significant only for waiting time in the middle of the road. Other factors, such as demographics, past behaviors, and walking exposure of pedestrians, are also explored. Results indicate that older individuals tend to wait longer before making crossing decisions, and pedestrians' past crossing behaviors and past walking exposures do not significantly impact pedestrian walking behavior interacting with AV.

AB Traffic accidents have become a major issue for researchers, academia, government and vehicle manufacturers over the last few years. Many accidents and emergency situations frequently occur on the road. Unfortunately, accidents lead to health injuries, destruction of some infrastructure, bad traffic flow, and more importantly these events cause deaths of hundreds of thousands of people due to not getting treatment in time. Thus, we need to develop an efficient and smart emergency system to ensure the timely arrival of an ambulance service to the place of the accident in order to provide timely medical help to those injured. In addition, we also need to communicate promptly with other entities such as hospitals so that they can make appropriate arrangements and provide timely medical information to emergency personnel on the scene including alerting those related to the injured person(s). In this paper, we have developed an intelligent protocol that uses connected and autonomous vehicles' scenarios in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) so that prompt emergency services can be provided to reduce the death rate caused. The proposed protocol smartly connects with all the relevant entitles during the emergency while maintaining a smooth traffic flow for the arrival of the ambulance service. Moreover, our protocol also mitigates the broadcasting of messages circulating over the network for delay sensitive tasks. The evaluation results, based on the performance metrics such as channel collision, average packet delay, packet loss, and routing-overhead demonstrate that our proposed protocol outperforms previously proposed protocols such as Emergency Message Dissemination for Vehicular (EMDV), Contention Based Broadcasting (CBB), and Particle Swarm Optimization Contention-based Broadcast (PCBB) protocols. Finally, we discuss several issues and challenges that need to be addressed in the network in order to achieve more a reliable, efficient, connected, and autonomous vehicular network.

AB We use data from an originally designed survey instrument administered in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area to gauge general attitudes and design preferences for a hypothetical shared automated vehicle (SAV) system. Design considerations include seating, payment and booking logistics, security, and extra space and amenities. We pay particular attention to the role of gender, race, health, and income in shaping these attitudes and preferences. Specifically, we use multiple regression models to uncover general willingness-to-use SAV technology, finding that women are overall less comfortable with the technology, Black and Hispanic participants are more willing to pay for SAV technology and generally display lower magnitude preferences for design considerations. Although results are mixed in both sets of analysis for health status, higher income individuals display higher willingness to pay and higher magnitude preferences for design considerations.

AB Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a machine learning method based on rewards, which can be extended to solve some complex and realistic decision-making problems. Autonomous driving needs to deal with a variety of complex and changeable traffic scenarios, so the application of DRL in autonomous driving presents a broad application prospect. In this article, an end-to-end autonomous driving policy learning method based on DRL is proposed. On the basis of proximal policy optimization (PPO), we combine a curiosity-driven method called recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate an intrinsic reward signal to encounter the agent to explore its environment, which improves the efficiency of exploration. We introduce an auxiliary critic network on the original actor-critic framework and choose the lower estimate which is predicted by the dual critic network when the network update to avoid the overestimation bias. We test our method on the lane- keeping task and overtaking task in the open racing car simulator (TORCS) driving simulator and compare with other DRL methods, experimental results show that our proposed method can improve the training efficiency and control performance in driving tasks.

AB Integrating advantages of automated driving and mass transport, autonomous buses have broad development prospects. The research on the public acceptance of autonomous buses will help to provide a basis for formulating policies and measures, and thus have important theoretical and practical significance. In this paper, an initial theoretical model of acceptance of autonomous buses was established. An on-line survey was conducted with a total of 401 valid samples collected. The reliability and validity tests of the data showed that the internal consistency of the questionnaire was high, and the reliability and validity all met the requirements. Based on the results of structural equation modelling, the proposed model was validated and all the hypotheses were confirmed. Attitude would positively affect behavioural intention, and trust and perceived usefulness would positively affect attitudes. Moreover, both perceived ease of use and perceived comfort would have positive effects on perceived usefulness as well as on trust. Perceived risk would be negatively associated with trust. Multi-group analyses were conducted to test the moderating effects of the individual's education and knowledge of autonomous buses, and the two factors showed significant effects. Based on the results, corresponding measures can be taken to increase the acceptance of autonomous buses.

DT Article
DE extreme environments; marine robotics; planning; underwater robotics
AB This paper presents a teach-and-repeat path-following method for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigating long distances in environments where external navigation aides are denied. This method utilizes sonar images to construct a series of reference views along a path, stored as a topological map. The AUV can then renavigate along this path, either to return to the start location or to repeat the route. Utilizing unique assumptions about the sonar image-generation process, this system exhibits robust image-matching capabilities, providing observations to a discrete Bayesian filter that maintains an estimate of progress along the path. Image-matching also provides an estimate of offset from the path, allowing the AUV to correct its heading and effectively close the gap. Over a series of field trials, this system demonstrated online control of an AUV in the ocean environment of Holyrood Arm, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The system was implemented on an International Submarine Engineering Ltd. Explorer AUV and performed multiple path completions over both a 1 and 5 km track. These trials illustrated an AUV operating in a fully autonomous mode, in which navigation was driven solely by sensor feedback and adaptive control. Path-following performance was as desired, with the AUV maintaining close offset to the path.

AB This study investigates the control problem of connected vehicles in urban roads where autonomous intersection manager (AIM) platforms are involved to manage the network traffic flow. A hierarchical framework for integrated vehicular platoon-road control is established to guarantee plant stability and string stable platoons and coordinate traffic flow. At the first layer, the intersection manager plays the role of regulating the velocity of the leader of approaching vehicular platoons based on a road traffic density model, which aims to fairly balance the traffic flow among the connected intersections. At the second layer, an integral sliding mode (ISM) controller is introduced to maintain platoon velocity consistency with its leader and the desired inter-vehicle distance. The presented ISM controller is capable of rejecting the inter-vehicle communication delay and the leader's acceleration disturbance, which is illustrated by numerical simulations.

AB In this paper, we consider a kinetic description of follow-the-leader traffic models, which we use to study the effect of vehicle-wise driver-assist control strategies at various scales, from that of the local traffic up to that of the macroscopic stream of vehicles. We provide theoretical evidence of the fact that some typical control strategies, such as the alignment of the speeds and the optimisation of the time headways, impact on the local traffic features (for instance, the speed and headway dispersion responsible for local traffic instabilities) but have virtually no effect on the observable macroscopic traffic trends (for instance, the flux/throughput of vehicles). This unobvious conclusion, which is in very nice agreement with recent field studies on autonomous vehicles, suggests that the kinetic approach may be a valid tool for an organic multiscale investigation and possibly the design of driver-assist algorithms.

AB Currently, "connected cars" are being actively designed over smart cars and autonomous cars, to establish a two-way communication network between the vehicle and all infrastructure. Additionally, because vehicle black boxes are becoming more common, specific processes for secure and efficient data sharing and transaction via vehicle networks must be developed. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based vehicle data marketplace platform model, along with a data sharing scheme, using Blockchain-based data-owner-based attribute-based encryption (DO-ABE). The proposed model achieves the basic requirements such as data confidentiality, integrity, and privacy. The proposed system securely and effectively handles large-capacity and privacy-sensitive black box video data by storing the metadata on Blockchain (on-chain) and encrypted raw data on off-chain (external) storage, and adopting consortium Blockchain. Furthermore, the data owners of the proposed model can control their own data by applying the Blockchain-based DO-ABE and owner-defined access control lists.

AB The introduction of autonomous delivery systems is expected to improve productivity in numerous application fields. Since such systems comprise both unmanned and manned units, it is important to control the whole system using appropriate behavioral models of manned vehicles or humans. This work builds on the results of a previous study, where a velocity vector field was used to model human movement, and extends the use of velocity vector fields to the simulation of vehicle behavior by modeling variance in given trajectories. This extension enables the velocity vector field to regenerate an average trajectory with a band and consequently allows one to calculate the vehicle's predicted region in arbitrary future time steps and anomaly detection. These applications are expected to facilitate collision avoidance and should help one to control other applications of unmanned vehicles.

AB An opinion dynamics approach is proposed to enhance the reliability of the vehicle velocity estimators, which are required for autonomous driving as well as advanced vehicle active safety systems, such as traction and stability control. The corners' estimates of a velocity observer, which is formed by combining the kinematic and model-based estimation schemes. are used as opinions with different levels of confidence in the developed algorithm. This is to find more reliable estimates robust to disturbances and time delay via solving a convex optimization problem. To bypass the effect of failure in velocity estimation, a fault rejection policy is used concurrently with the opinion dynamics. Road tests confirm the validity and robustness of the algorithm on slippery and dry roads independent of the powertrain configuration in different driving scenarios, especially for combined-slip and low-excitation maneuvers, which are demanding for the current vehicle state estimators.

The results are collected on designed and built test stands and used in three alternative models of the platform suspension system. The first one is based on the existing construction of the platform. The other two have been modernized by using new solutions in the tracked vehicles suspension technology associated with a torsional spring element. The authors assumed simulation conditions for straight line driving while the model overcomes an obstacle in one track. The results of simulations are compared and analyzed to improve parameters of the vehicle suspension.

AB Unmanned Aerial Underwater Vehicles (UAUVs) with multiple propellers can operate in two distinct mediums, air and underwater, and the system modeling of the autonomous vehicles is a key issue to adapt to these different external environments. In this paper, only a single set of aerial rotors with switching propulsion abilities are designed as driving components, and then a compound multi-model method is investigated to achieve good performance of the cross-medium motion. Furthermore, some additional variables, such as water resistance, buoyancy and their corresponding moments are considered for the underwater case. In particular, a critical coefficient for air-to-water switching is presented to express these gradually changing additional variables in the cross-medium motion process. Finally, the sliding mode control method is used to reduce the altitude error and attitude error of the vehicles with external environmental disturbances. The proposed scheme is tested and the model is verified on the simulation platform.

The proposed schemes are based on a threshold received signal strength and an average threshold D2D distance to select the D2D mode. The focus of the two schemes is either to enhance the quality of the signal or the connectivity in case of emergency situations. To evaluate the performances of the schemes, they derive the corresponding expressions of the probability of using D2D mode and ergodic capacity. Numerical results show the advantage of the presented schemes in off-loading traffic from aerial platforms and shed lights on the effect of the environment on the performance of D2D enabled aerial networks.

AB Real-time and high-performance semantic segmentation is a crucial task in the scene understanding of autonomous vehicles. This paper focuses on this issue and proposes a transformer and convolutional neural networks (CNN) hybrid encoder-decoder structure SegTransConv. Firstly, we present a four-stage hierarchical encoder, and the feature extractor in each stage is composed of two transformer layers and CNN modules in series. In this way, the encoder better exploits the global contexts of the input and expands the receptive fields. In the U-shape decoder, the feature maps are upsampled through the proposed feature enhancement upsampling module (FE_Up). Then the knowledge distillation strategy is leveraged to improve the model performance under the guidance of the teacher network STDCNet. Finally, a novel evaluation metric is designed to comprehensively assess the accuracy, speed, floating-point operations (FLOPs), and parameters of real-time segmentation methods. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and self-collected images have evaluated the effectiveness of our method. SegTransConv-A and SegTransConv-B obtain 72.8% and 73.0% mIoU, respectively, at the inference speed of 68.0 FPS with an input resolution of 1024 x 512.

AB With the development of autonomous driving technologies, robo-taxis (shared autonomous vehicles) are being tested on real roads. In China, in particular, people in some cities such as Beijing and Shanghai can book a robo-taxi online and experience the service. To examine the influential factors on user acceptance of robo-taxi services, this study proposes and employs an extended technology acceptance model (TAM) with four external factors: perceived trust, government support, social influence, and perceived enjoyment. Data were collected through an online questionnaire in China, and responses from 403 respondents were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Both typical TAM factors-including perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and attitude-and external factors were found to play significant roles in predicting users' intention to use robo-taxis. The four external factors influenced the user acceptance indirectly via typical TAM factors. Improving users' perceived trust is important for increasing public adoption. A greater emphasis by manufacturers on safety concerns, wider dissemination of information on data protection and safety systems, and government support through incentives for manufacturers and users can help improve public adoption of robo-taxi services.

AB To evaluate the aquatic ecosystem's quality and ensure the sustainable management of fisheries, it is important to monitor fish populations. Hydroacoustics uses sound waves to noninvasively scan and gather information on waterbodies including fish abundance and distribution. Unmanned surface vehicles (USV) have been increasingly used in marine and freshwater environments to enable data collection. We provide a detailed description of a new USV called Hydroacoustic Autonomous boat for Remote fish detection in LakE (HARLE), which is devoted to hydroacoustic studies in freshwater. The USV is electrically powered and equipped with the most modern fishery scientific echosounder, suitable for broadband applications, the EK80 (SIMRAD). The USV was used for a conventional hydroacoustic survey in a peri-alpine lake to investigate its potential to monitor fish populations in lakes. In the lower layer of the lake where there were numerous targets and comparisons were possible, hydroacoustic metrics and fish biomass values (kg ha(-1)) from the SIMRAD EK80 on board the USV and EK60 on board the research vessel were similar. We showed that the HARLE has great potential to be used as a tool for fish monitoring and hydroacoustic survey in freshwater.

ID SYSTEMS
AB This paper presents the concept of a social autonomous agent to conceptualize such Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), which interacts with other AVs using social manners similar to human behavior. The presented AVs also have the capability of predicting intentions, i.e. mentalizing and copying the actions of each other, i.e. mirroring. Exploratory Agent Based Modeling (EABM) level of the Cognitive Agent Based Computing (CABC) framework has been utilized to design the proposed social agent. Furthermore, to emulate the functionality of mentalizing and mirroring modules of proposed social agent, a tailored mathematical model of the Richardson's arms race model has also been presented. The performance of the proposed social agent has been validated at two levels-firstly it has been simulated using NetLogo, a standard agent-based modeling tool and also, at a practical level using a prototype AV. The simulation results have confirmed that the proposed social agent-based collision avoidance strategy is 78.52% more efficient than Random walk based collision avoidance strategy in congested flock-like topologies. Whereas practical results have confirmed that the proposed scheme can avoid rear end and lateral collisions with the efficiency of 99.876% as compared with the IEEE 802.11n-based existing state of the art mirroring neuron-based collision avoidance scheme.

ID SIMULATION; BUOYANCY; VEHICLES; DESIGN
AB An autonomous hybrid-driven glider is a new class of autonomous underwater glider that integrates the concept of a buoyancy-driven underwater glider and a conventional autonomous. underwater vehicle (AUV). This glider has multi-functionality that enables it to overcome the speed and maneuverability limitations of buoyancy-driven gliders. Thus, this paper presents a mathematical model of the hybrid-driven glider, an estimation of the hydrodynamics and an analysis of the motion control. A Newtonian approach has been used to model the glider under the influence of water current. In addition, the hydrodynamics were estimated by using a Strip theory and a computational fluid dynamic (CFD). In order to analyze the motion of the glider, a Neural Network Predictive Control (NNPC) has been designed and its performance has been compared with the Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). The simulation results demonstrated that the Neural Network Predictive Control (NNPC) produced better control performance than the performance of the MPC and LQR when dealing with disturbances. In addition, the results also demonstrate the hydrodynamic response of the glider over the velocity, angle of attack and sideslip angle. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Emerging autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) developments across the oil and gas industry now include pipeline inspection; structural survey; deepwater inspection, repair and maintenance (IRM); and field resident systems for remote/harsh environments. As these capabilities mature, AUVs will become an increasingly important tool for deepwater field operations. Early adoption of AUV standards will facilitate more rapid deployment of AUV technologies and enable the industry to reap a wide range of safety, environmental perational, and economic benefits for its deepwater fields. The development of inductry standards ofr AUV interfaces will facilitate more rapid implementation of AUV vendors and field hardware manufacturers. The development of regulatory standards for the imterpretation and acceptance fo autonomous inspection results is aslo an essential step toward the achievement of more cost-effective operations and regulatory oversight of deepwater subsea fields. This paper describes a future vision for the use of AUVs in deepwater field operations, the benefits to be realized, and the future capabilities of AUVs that must be anticipated and facilitated within AUV standards to achieve that vision. Additionally, this paper describes the goals and objectives of DeepStar Porject 11304, which is laying the groundworkd to acheve accelerated standardization of AUV interfaces and the develoepemtn of regulatory standards for AUV inspections.

AB Predicting when and where key oceanic processes will be encountered is problematic in dynamic coastal waters where diverse physical, chemical, and biological factors interact in varied and rapidly changing combinations. Defining key processes often requires efficient sampling of specific water masses and prompt sample return for subsequent analyses. This compound challenge motivated our efforts to develop mobile autonomous process sampling (MAPS) for use with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). With this system, features are recognized by artificial intelligence that integrates AUV sensor data to estimate probabilistic states for adaptive control of survey navigation and triggering of targeted water samplers. To demonstrate the utility of the MAPS/AUV system, we focused on intermediate nepheloid layers (INLs), episodic transport events that may play a role in zooplankton ecology. During multiple field tests in Monterey Bay, California, the MAPS/AUV system recognized, mapped, and sampled INLs. Invertebrate larvae contained in the water samples were subsequently characterized with molecular probes developed for high-throughput screening. Preliminary results support the hypothesis that INLs function as vehicles for episodic larval transport. Applying MAPS within a greater coastal ocean observing system permitted description of regional oceanographic dynamics that influenced the patterns and scales of INL and larval transport.

AB This paper deals with position estimation and path control for Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGV). To enable a vehicle, or a mobile robot in following a continuous ''virtual'' path without human control, these techniques play an important role. The relationship between the vehicle's motion in 3-dimensional space and the shape of a curved surface is described. In particular, the introduction of a digital terrain model in dead reckoning is considered. Moreover, a possible nonlinear control is developed based on curvilinear path coordinates, and the proof for global stability is given. To achieve general validity, these topics are treated here independently of the cart's special mechanization (the configuration of steered wheels and driven wheels). Simulation studies are presented to illustrate the investigations.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming popular in various applications. However, there are still challenging issues to be tackled, such as effective obstacle avoidance, target identification within a crowd, and specific target tracking. This paper focuses on dynamic target following and obstacle avoidance to realize a prototype of a quadcopter drone to serve as an autonomous object follower. An adaptive target identification system is proposed to recognize the specific target in the complicated background. For obstacle avoidance during flight, we introduce an idea of space detection and use it to develop a so-called contour and spiral convolution space detection (CASCSD) algorithm to evade obstacles. Thanks to the low architecture complexity, it is appropriate for implementation on onboard flight control systems. The target prediction is integrated with fuzzified flight control to fulfill an autonomous target tracker. When this series of technical research and development is completed, this system can be used for applications such as personal security guard and criminal detection systems.

While ethnographers have qualitatively described regional differences in driving style, data-driven statistical models might help computer-driven cars drive like locals and recognize how local drivers might be signaling through hand/body movement and motion of their vehicles. To this end, we have created an experimental system and method to profile driving behavior and interaction using a multi-participant virtual reality (VR) driving simulation environment. The system was designed to be portable and to support cross-cultural experimental deployments. We aim to make sure the system is operational and functional, can model diverse scenarios, generates data fit for analysis, and captures expected behaviors. We describe the system, test scenarios, and findings of the proof-of-concept study conducted in the U.S. and Israel.

AB Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) is an autonomous vehicle-following technology that allows groups of vehicles on the highway to form in tightly-coupled platoons. This is accomplished by exchanging inter-vehicle data through Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) wireless communication networks. CACC increases traffic throughput and safety, and decreases energy consumption. However, the surge of vehicle connectivity has brought new security challenges as vehicular networks increasingly serve as new access points for adversaries trying to deteriorate the platooning performance or even cause collisions. In this manuscript, we propose a novel anomaly detection scheme that leverage real-time sensor/network data and physics-based mathematical models of vehicles in the platoon. Nevertheless, even the best detection scheme could lead to conservative detection results because of unavoidable modelling uncertainties, network effects (delays, quantization, communication dropouts), and noise. It is hard (often impossible) for any detector to distinguish between these different perturbation sources and actual attack signals. This enables adversaries to launch a range of attack strategies that can surpass the detection scheme by hiding within the system uncertainty. Here, we provide risk assessment tools (in terms of semi-definite programs) for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) to quantify the potential effect of attacks that remain hidden from the detector (referred here as stealthy attacks). A numerical case-study is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our methods.

AB Connected and automated vehicle technologies have the potential to significantly improve transportation system performance. In particular, advanced driver-assistance systems, such as adaptive cruise control (ACC) and cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC), may lead to substantial improvements in performance by decreasing driver inputs and taking over control of the vehicle. However, the impacts of these technologies on the vehicle- and system-level energy consumption, emissions, and safety have not been quantified in field tests. The goal of this paper is to study the impacts of automated and cooperative systems in mixed traffic containing conventional, ACC, and CACC vehicles. To reach this goal, experimental data based on real-world conditions are collected (in tests conducted by the Federal Highway Administration and the U.S. Department of Transportation) with presence of ACC, CACC, and conventional vehicles in a vehicle platoon scenario and a cooperative merging scenario. Specifically, a platoon of five vehicles with different vehicle type combinations is analyzed to generate new knowledge about potential safety, energy efficiency, and emission improvement from vehicle automation and cooperation. Results show that adopting the CACC system in a five-vehicle platoon substantially reduces the driving volatility and reduces the risk of rear-end collision which consequently improves safety. Furthermore, it decreases fuel consumption and emissions compared with the ACC system and manually-driven vehicles. Results of the merging scenario show that while the cooperative merging system slightly reduces the driving volatility, the fuel consumption and emissions can increase because of sharper accelerations of CACC vehicles compared with manually-driven vehicles.

AB Efficient thermal management of lithium battery modules has become a thorny problem in the development of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), especially under high current discharge. In this article, the fin/phase change material (PCM) composite structure was proposed for AUV's battery thermal management with consideration of natural convection. The temperature behavior of the battery and the melting behavior of PCM were investigated under different key parameters. In addition, the heat transfer mechanism of the melting process of the PCM was revealed. More importantly, the dimensionless temperature control performance (TCP) factor and the dimensionless heat storage performance (HSP) factor were introduced as new criteria to quantitatively evaluate the impact of different design parameters on the battery thermal management performance. The results showed that utilizing fins can significantly accelerate the melting of the PCM. Increasing the number of fins can reduce the temperature of the battery and improve the uniformity of the battery temperature distribution. Compared with the pure PCM, the total time required for PCM melting in the fin/PCM battery thermal management unit with different numbers of fins is reduced by at least 11.5%. The decrease of the time of complete PCM melting is not linearly correlated with the length ratio of fins. The fin number of N = 6, length ratio of R = 0.8, and angle between fins of phi = 36 degrees were identified as the optimal parameters of fin/PCM composite structures. The TCP and HSP were enhanced by 38.1% and 4.54%, respectively. The conclusions of this work can provide reference for the accurate design of fin/PCM composite structures for the thermal management of AUV batteries. Highlights The fin/phase change material composite structure was introduced for autonomous underwater vehicles' battery thermal management. The temperature and melting behavior were investigated with natural convection. The temperature control performance factor and heat storage performance factor were proposed as new evaluation criteria. Temperature deviation index was used to measure the battery temperature uniformity. The performance was enhanced by optimizing the design parameters of fin.

AB In this paper, we propose an adaptive path tracking algorithm based on the BP (back propagation) neural network to increase the performance of vehicle path tracking in different paths. Specifically, based on the kinematic model of the vehicle, the front wheel steering angle of the vehicle was derived with the PP (Pure Pursuit) algorithm, and related parameters affecting path tracking accuracy were analyzed. In the next step, BP neural networks were introduced and vehicle speed, radius of path curvature, and lateral error were used as inputs to train models. The output of the model was used as the control coefficient of the PP algorithm to improve the accuracy of the calculation of the front wheel steering angle, which is referred to as the BP-PP algorithm in this paper. As a final step, simulation experiments and real vehicle experiments are performed to verify the algorithm's performance. Simulation experiments show that compared with the traditional path tracking algorithm, the average tracking error of BP-PP algorithm is reduced by 0.025 m when traveling at a speed of 3 m/s on a straight path, and the average tracking error is reduced by 0.27 m, 0.42 m, and 0.67 m, respectively, at a speed of 1.5 m/s with a curvature radius of 6.8 m, 5.5 m, and 4.5 m, respectively. In the real vehicle experiment, an electric patrol vehicle with an autonomous tracking function was used as the experimental platform. The average tracking error was reduced by 0.1 m and 0.086 m on a rectangular road and a large curvature road, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs well in both simulation and actual scenarios, improves the accuracy of path tracking, and enhances the robustness of the system. Moreover, facing paths with changes in road curvature, the BP-PP algorithm achieved significant improvement and demonstrated great robustness. In conclusion, the proposed BP-PP algorithm reduced the interference of nonlinear factors on the system and did not require complex calculations. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm has been applied to the autonomous driving patrol vehicle in the park and achieved good results.

AB High-quality CPNT is a key technology for deep-sea vehicles that dive into the deep sea and for detecting and developing the deep sea. At present, however, CPNT services for deep-sea vehicles are provided by separate communication, positioning, and navigation systems as well as separate synchronous clocks (atomic clocks). This directly affects the operational efficiency, for example, update rates of up to 0.125 Hz, of deep-sea vehicles engaged in deep-sea scientific research, environmental investigation, and resource development. Therefore, a new design method and operating mode of CPNT is proposed herein to overcome the inherent flaws of the current communication/positioning/navigation modes of deep-sea vehicles; meet the actual demands of deep-sea vehicles in real time; achieve high update rates, low power consumption, and high precision positioning and navigation; and to be combined with the current development trends. The integration of CPNT can both unify time and space references, and reduce the difficulty of multi-sensor information fusion. Thus, the problems of poor navigation and the non-timing functions of deep-sea vehicles can be solved fundamentally. The integration of CPNT will improve the navigation and positioning accuracy as well as the information update rate (up to 1 Hz) of large deep-sea vehicles, such as deepsea human-occupied vehicles, deep-sea remotely operated underwater vehicles, and deep-sea autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB Stereo cameras are widely used in autonomous vehicles as environmental perception sensors because of their availability and low cost. However, efficiently utilizing the obtained disparity images to generate a desirable local path for the vehicle still remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we present a novel navigation framework for autonomous vehicles equipped with stereo cameras, featuring finishing all of the perception and path planning tasks directly within the disparity space. Comparing with the popular 3-D counterpart, disparity is a projected geometric space that contains more primitive information directly computed from the stereo images. Furthermore, disparity image is a more compact representation for large field of 3-D Cartesian space, which makes perception and path finding in longer distance possible. The proposed framework is composed of three modules, namely, local disparity map building, slope analysis and obstacle detection, and path planning. Two important properties concerning the motion and slope in disparity space are presented for the first time, i.e., the motion model and the slope model in disparity space. With the motion model, the framework first fuses consecutive disparity maps to construct a more reliable and complete local map. Then, a novel slope analysis method called V-Intercept is developed based on the slope model. It can efficiently analyze slopes and obstacles, generating a reasonable cost map directly from the disparity image. Finally, the obstacles in the cost map are expanded properly, and a customized A* search algorithm is performed to find a reasonable path in disparity space. The experimental results show that our framework works well under various kinds of environments. The resulting system can efficiently perceive and plan on a much larger range and react to obstacles further beyond the traditional Cartesian-based method.

AB Compared to autonomous ground vehicles, UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) have significant mobility advantages and the potential to operate in otherwise unreachable locations. Micro UAVs still suffer from one major drawback: they do not have the necessary payload capabilities to support high performance arms. This paper, however, investigates the key challenges in controlling a mobile manipulating UAV using a commercially available aircraft and a light-weight prototype 3-arm manipulator. Because of the overall instability of rotorcraft, we use a motion capture system to build an efficient autopilot. Our results indicate that we can accurately model and control our prototype system given significant disturbances when both moving the manipulators and interacting with the ground.

AB Arguably the most representative application of artificial intelligence, autonomous driving systems usually rely on computer vision techniques to detect the situations of the external environment. Object detection underpins the ability of scene understanding in such systems. However, existing object detection algorithms often behave as a black box, so when a model fails, no information is available on When, Where and How the failure happened. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics approach to help model developers interpret the model failures. The system includes the micro- and macro-interpreting modules to address the interpretability problem of object detection in autonomous driving. The micro-interpreting module extracts and visualizes the features of a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm with density maps, while the macro-interpreting module provides spatial-temporal information of an autonomous driving vehicle and its environment. With the situation awareness of the spatial, temporal and neural network information, our system facilitates the understanding of the results of object detection algorithms, and helps the model developers better understand, tune and develop the models. We use real-world autonomous driving data to perform case studies by involving domain experts in computer vision and autonomous driving to evaluate our system. The results from our interviews with them show the effectiveness of our approach.

AB This paper studies the stability and scalability of the platoon where multiple vehicles move in a closed roadway and are coupled in a bidirectional ring. Each vehicle regulates its longitudinal motion based on bidirectional asymmetric control with triple asymmetry factors. By exploiting Hermite stability criterion, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions of stability for the n-vehicle platoon. Based on parametric robustness analysis, necessary and sufficient conditions of scalably asymptotic stability are further obtained, meaning that the stability is independent of the number of vehicles in the platoon. It is proved that symmetric spacing feedback is necessary for scalably asymptotic stability and the first spatial mode is the least stable among all the non-zero modes. Numerical computations show that the stability region in the space of feedback gains is favourable when the asymmetry level on speed gain is small and the asymmetry level on acceleration gain is large, whereas it may deteriorate rapidly when these two asymmetry factors have different signs.

AB In this paper, a hydroacoustic system designed for a biomimetic underwater vehicle (BUV) is presented. The Biomimetic Underwater Vehicle No. 2 (BUV2) is a next-generation BUV built within the ambit of SABUVIS, a European Defense Agency project (category B). Our main efforts were devoted to designing the system so that it will avoid collisions with vessels with low-speed propellers, e.g., submarines. Verification measurements were taken in a lake using a propeller-driven pontoon with a spectrum similar to that produced by a submarine propulsion system. Here, we describe the hydroacoustic signal used, with careful consideration of the filter and method of estimation for the bearings of the moving obstacle. Two algorithms for passive obstacle detection were used, and the results are discussed herein.

AB The large-scale application of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) provides new opportunities and challenges for the optimization and management of traffic conflict zones. To improve the traffic efficiency of conflict zones and reduce the travel delay and fuel consumption of CAVs, this paper presents a two-level optimization method of scheduling and trajectory planning for CAVs. At the first level, a 0-1 mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is proposed for vehicles entering scheduling. At the second level, a multi-vehicle optimal trajectory control model is developed based on the optimal vehicle schedule from the first level. Then, to reduce the complexity of solving the multi-vehicle optimal trajectory control model, we transform this model into non-linear programming (NLP) based on the infinitesimal method. Moreover, a rolling optimization strategy is developed to facilitate field application. Numerical simulation experiments of different traffic scenarios are conducted, and the results show that the proposed method can effectively reduce vehicle delays and fuel consumption, compared with the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method. The numerical results show that the vehicle delay can be reduced by up to 54% and fuel consumption by up to 34% under different traffic demands. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the performance of the proposed method is mainly determined by the minimum safety time interval of vehicles entering the conflict zone.

ID TIME WINDOWS
AB The Conflict-Free Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (CF-EVRP) is a combinatorial optimization problem of designing routes for vehicles to execute tasks such that a cost function, typically the number of vehicles or the total travelled distance, is minimized. The CF-EVRP involves constraints such as time windows on the tasks' execution, limited operating range of the vehicles, and limited capacity on the number of vehicles that a road segment can simultaneously accommodate. In previous work, the compositional algorithm ComSat was introduced to solve the CF-EVRP by breaking it down into sub-problems and iteratively solve them to build an overall solution. Though ComSat showed good performance in general, some problem instances took significant time to solve due to the high number of iterations required to find solutions for two sub-problems, namely the Routing Problem, and the Paths Changing Problem. This paper addresses the bottlenecks of ComSat and presents new formulations for both sub-problems in order to reduce the number of iterations required to find feasible solutions to the CF-EVRP. Experiments on sets of benchmark instances show the effectiveness of the presented improvements.

AB Vehicle automation is one of the most researched topics in transport studies but much remains uncertain about the speed of adoption and potential impacts, including if and how it can contribute to greater environmental sustainability. This study adopts a Delphi approach to examine the speed with which 15% of new vehicles will be automated (SAE-3, SAE-4 or SAE-5) and what impacts automation may have on motility, mobility, resource use and externalities in both passenger and freight transport. Although challenges with recruitment mean that all findings must be caveated and seen as exploratory, the analysis demonstrates considerable dissensus regarding the expected speed and impacts of vehicle automation in both passenger and freight transport among the participants. For both aspects, a diversity of views remains once participants were informed about the expectations of other panellists. The range of views is organised around the axes of optimism and certainty about what may happen. Considerable differences between passenger and freight transport can be identified for potential impacts of vehicle automation but not for speed of adoption.

AB As one of the core functions of the autonomous driving of vehicles under special roads, the intelligent barrier avoidance function plays an important role in improving traffic efficiency and ensuring driving safety. Scientific, reasonable, and comprehensive evaluation methods can provide the basis for intelligent vehicles before their use. The comprehensive evaluation index system is constructed for the avoidance ability and avoidance mode of intelligent vehicles against different barriers. The weights of qualitative indicators that are difficult to quantify are determined based on the order relation analysis (G1) method, and the weights of quantitative indicators are determined based on the CRITIC (criteria importance though intercriteria correlation) method. The overall system is comprehensively and quantitatively evaluated through the grey correlation degree method. The correctness of the evaluation method is verified via testing. According to the comprehensive evaluation method studied, the comprehensive evaluation result of the test vehicle is obtained. The intelligent barrier avoidance function of negative barriers is superior to that of positive barriers. The integrated evaluation method can obtain evaluation results of vehicle performance in different test scenarios.

AB In this paper, a new robust controller is proposed to improve the motion control performance of an autonomous four-wheel steering vehicle. The vehicle is subject to time-varying uncertainties caused by parameter perturbation and unmodeled disturbance. First of all, the vehicle motion control problem is modeled as a constraint-following problem with the goal to drive the vehicle system to follow the given constraints. For safety reasons, inequality constraints are imposed on the lateral displacement of the vehicle. Next, the diffeomorphism mapping method is used to deal with the inequality constraints in the vehicle motion control, and the constrained lateral displacement space is mapped to an unbounded space. On this basis, a new multi-parameter robust constraint-following control is designed. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, the approximate constraint tracking performance of the path tracking system is proved. In order to make a trade-off between the system performance and control cost, a multi-parameter optimization problem is established, and the optimal robust controller is obtained. Last, the main theoretical results are verified by the Carsim-Simulink co-simulations.

TI ERROR ANALYSIS OF CAMERA MOVEMENTS IN STEREO VEHICLE TRACKING-SYSTEMS
SO COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING
LA English
DT Article
AB In an outdoor navigational environment, cameras of an autonomous vehicle or robot are subjected to uncontrollable movements relative to the vehicle or robot body, In this paper, the effect of such camera movements in stereo vision-based vehicle tracking systems is analyzed. In other words, it is shown how the computation of the range and heading angle of a lead vehicle is affected as a result of camera movements, The parameter space of the stereo system is divided into a controllable subspace consisting of the baseline and an uncontrollable subspace consisting of relative camera movements and the coordinates of a tracked point on the lead vehicle. The optimal baseline value with respect to the uncontrollable subspace is found by employing the mini-max and minimum mean-squared error estimators. The mini-max estimator is used to obtain the worst case performance while the minimum mean-squared estimator is used to obtain the average performance, Based on this analysis, it is shown how an optimal imaging geometry for a stereo vision-based vehicle tracking system can be designed in order to have the least amount of range and heading angle errors.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB This study designs a navigation and landing scheme for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to autonomously land on an arbitrarily moving unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) in GPS-denied environments based on vision, ultra-wideband (UWB) and system information. In the approaching phase, an effective multi-innovation forgetting gradient (MIFG) algorithm is proposed to estimate the position of the UAV relative to the target using historical data (estimated distance and relative displacement measurements). Using these estimates, a saturated proportional navigation controller is developed, by which the UAV can approach the target, making the UGV enter the field of view (FOV) of the camera deployed in the UAV. Then, a sensor fusion estimation algorithm based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is proposed to achieve accurate landing. Finally, a numerical example and a real experiment are used to support the theoretical results.

AB This paper describes a modeling approach to compute the lumped parameter hydrodynamic derivative matrices of an underwater multi-hull vehicle. The vehicle, modeled as a multi-body underwater system and denoted as cluster, can be composed by heterogeneous bodies with known dynamic parameters, rigidly connected. The nonlinear dynamic equations of the cluster and its parameters are derived by means of a modular approach, based on the composition of single basic elements. The ultimate objective is to derive a mathematical description of the multi-hull system that captures its most significant dynamics allowing to design model-based motion controllers and navigation filters. The modular nature of the resulting model can be exploited, by example, when control reconfiguration is to be dealt with in the presence of (possibly multiple) failures. The numerical simulation of a hypothetical cluster is presented and discussed.

DE public health; roads & highways; transport planning
AB This opinion paper, building on discussions about total mobility within the Transport & Health Study Group, challenges the idea that driverless cars will be used as cars are now. Shared use opens wider opportunities than merely safety, roadspace and parking. It is healthy to walk and cycle for short journeys and to the station for longer journeys. Driverless vehicles could promote or undermine this. The paper discusses the following: when people still need to own their own cars; when door-to-door transport might be needed; how to use driverless vehicles in a system that encourages walking to the station; dichotomy between individual and mass transport; balance between highly autonomous vehicles and existing technologies for tracked systems; spatial planning; loss aversion as an explanation of reluctance to change; guided hotlanes as a first step; and shared road/rail infrastructure from variable block communicating with vehicles.

It is a key element in determining the precision of the INS. This paper presents an algorithm for reducing the error in the DVL as a way of improving the navigation of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). We also investigate and analyze the effect that the seafloors deviations have on DVL measurement error. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is examined through both AUV simulation and experimentally. The results show that the proposed technique can indeed effectively correct DVL errors.

Through the analysis of the unmanned vehicle formation problem, formation principles, formation scale, unmanned vehicle formation safety distance, and formation evaluation indicators are taken into consideration. The application of the IoT enables the optimization of distributed computing. To ensure the reliability of the formation algorithm, the convergence of MAHSCO has been proved. Finally, computer simulation and actual unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formation generation flight generating four typical formations are carried out. The result of the actual UAV formation generation flight is consistent with the simulation experiment, and the algorithm performs well. The MAHSCO algorithm based on the IoT is proved to be able to generate formations that meet the mission requirements quickly and accurately.

AB This study presents a novel multimodal heterogeneous perception cross-fusion framework for intelligent vehicles that combines data from millimeter-wave radar and camera to enhance target tracking accuracy and handle system uncertainties. The framework employs a multimodal interaction strategy to predict target motion more accurately and an improved joint probability data association method to match measurement data with targets. An adaptive root-mean-square cubature Kalman filter is used to estimate the statistical characteristics of noise under complex traffic scenarios with varying process and measurement noise. Experiments conducted on a real vehicle platform demonstrate that the proposed framework improves reliability and robustness in challenging environments. It overcomes the challenges of insufficient data fusion utilization, frequent leakage, and misjudgment of dangerous obstructions around vehicles, and inaccurate prediction of collision risks. The proposed framework has the potential to advance the state of the art in target tracking and perception for intelligent vehicles.

AB In this article, an optimal robust constraint-following control is proposed for the underactuated vehicle path tracking problem. First, an underactuated dynamic model is established according to Udwadia-Kalaba (UK) equation, and the system uncertainty is decomposed into matching and mismatching portions based on the system geometric characteristics. The mismatching uncertainty is orthogonal to task space; thus, its influence on system stability is eliminated. Second, the diffeomorphism method is used to creatively set inequality and equality constraints into new equality constraints, and a robust control method for front steering vehicles with parameter-tunable is proposed. Third, an optimal design scheme is proposed for the tunable parameters to minimize the comprehensive index of system performance and control cost. Carsim-Simulink co-simulation shows the effectiveness of the proposed optimal robust control. This article creatively solves the problem of optimal robust control for path tracking of multi-constrained underactuated vehicles.

ID PREDICTIVE CONTROL
AB Motion planning under uncertainty is critical for safe self-driving. This paper proposes a unified obstacle avoidance framework that deals with 1) uncertainty in ego-vehicle motion; and 2) prediction uncertainty of dynamic obstacles from the environment. A two-stage traffic participant trajectory predictor comprising short-term and long-term prediction is used in the planning layer to generate safe but not over-conservative trajectories for the ego-vehicle. The prediction module cooperates well with existing planning approaches. Our work showcases its effectiveness in a Frenet frame planner. A robust controller using tube MPC guarantees safe execution of the trajectory in the presence of state noise and dynamic model uncertainty. A Gaussian process regression model is used for on-line identification of the uncertainty's bound. We demonstrate the effectiveness, safety, and real-time performance of our framework in the CARLA simulator.

AB Short-term travel time prediction on freeways is the most valuable information for drivers when selecting their routes and departure times. Furthermore, this information is also essential at traffic management centers in order to monitor the network performance and anticipate the activation of traffic management strategies. The importance of reliable short-term travel time predictions will even increase with the advent of autonomous vehicles, when vehicle routing will strongly rely on this information. In this context, it is important to develop a real-time method to accurately predict travel times. The present paper uses vehicle accumulation, obtained from input-output diagrams constructed from loop detector data, to predict travel times on freeway sections. Loop detector count drift, which typically invalidates vehicle accumulation measurements, is corrected by means of a data fusion algorithm using GPS measurements. The goodness of the methodology has been proven under different boundary conditions using simulated data.

AB The future of transportation systems is going towards autonomous and assisted driving, aiming to reach full automation. There is huge focus on communication technologies expected to offer vehicular application services, of which most are location-based services. This paper provides a study on localization accuracy limits using vehicle-to-infrastructure communication channels provided by IEEE 802.11p and LTE-V, considering two different vehicular network designs. Real data measurements obtained on our highway testbed are used to model and simulate propagation channels, the position of base stations, and the route followed by the vehicle. Cramer-Rao lower bound, geometric dilution of precision, and least square error for time difference of arrival localization technique are investigated. Based on our analyses and findings, LTE-V outperforms IEEE 802.11p. However, it is apparent that providing larger signal bandwidth dedicated to localization, with network sites positioned at both sides of the highway, and considering the geometry between vehicle and network sites, improve vehicle localization accuracy.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and regular human-piloted vehicles (RVs) will coexist in the near future. Research has indicated the feasibility of using CAVs to stabilize traffic flow and eliminate stop-and-go waves. In light of this, we develop distributed control schemes to stabilize mixed vehicular platoons by using CAV as the leading vehicle. We address several challenges, such as limited information perception capabilities of RVs, the uncertain actuation of human drivers, and external disturbances. Only local information from the preceding vehicle is used in the controllers. Modifications of the input-to-state string stability (ISSS) are established to cope with the uncertainty and disturbance characteristics while conditions for stability are derived. The proposed control schemes can attenuate the effect of disturbances while maintaining the ISSS property. The relationships between ISSS and other string stability concepts are clarified. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed platoon control schemes.

AB This paper presents a hierarchical and game-theoretic decision-making strategy for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). A CAV can receive preview information using vehicle-to -everything (V2X) communication systems, and the optimal short-and long-term trajectory can be planned using this information. Specifically, in this study, the aggressiveness of all preceding vehicles in the car-following scenario can be estimated globally by monitoring the history of their time-series behaviors, before the CAV initiates a particular action, which is performed at the upper layer of the proposed decision-making structure. If it is determined that initiating a specific action is advantageous, the action is initiated, and the CAV then interacts with the vehicles locally to achieve its driving goal in a game-theoretical manner at the lower layer. In multiple test scenarios, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach compared to the conventional decision-making approaches, and it shows a significant improvement in terms of success rates.

AB The platooning of autonomous smart vehicles in a high-speed driving environment is a technology that can be achieved in the near future, and some similar driving-assistive technologies have already been put in practice. There are a variety of advantages to platooning, and one of them is the environmental aspect. This study endeavored to perform a mathematical analysis of the environmental aspect of forming a platoon of smart vehicles. For that, a mathematical experiment was designed with four kinds of scenarios, and each scenario had a different operation profile in terms of the velocity and acceleration of each smart vehicle. The power consumption and both forming distance and time were derived variously according to each scenario through mathematical experiments, and it was observed that the length of the acceleration period and the average operation velocity of the smart vehicles had a significant impact on the environmental effect of platoon formation. It is hoped that this study will be a touchstone for various kinds of platooning algorithm research considering the environment.

AB This paper introduces an image-based visual servoing (IBVS) target-tracking strategy for an underwater vehicle to track a moving target beneath the vehicle using a downward-facing camera. The relative position, orientation, and velocity of the moving target were estimated using a nonlinear unscented Kalman filter (UKF). Based on these estimated values, image Jacobian matrices with respect to the velocities of the vehicle and target were constructed. A nonlinear model predictive controller (MPC) was employed to generate the velocity commands for underwater vehicles by optimising the visual target trajectories predicted by the estimated image Jacobian matrix and the target velocity. To track the velocity commands, an adaptive neural network controller was employed considering the system uncertainties. Simulation tests were performed with a fully actuated underwater robot to verify the efficiency of the designed IBVS target-tracking strategy.

AB A novel real-time road bank estimation method is proposed and experimentally verified by using a state-constrained Kalman-based disturbance observer on the combined lateral and roll dynamics of the vehicle. Road-body kinematics, which relates road angle rates and vehicle pitch/roll rates, is also implemented to improve the accuracy of vehicle angle estimates. The stability of the disturbance observer with known and stochastic initial conditions is investigated. The developed estimator uses data from inertial sensors available in driver-assistance and automated driving systems and does not require additional measurements. The main advantages of the proposed method are road angle estimation in maneuvers on pure and combined banked/graded roads and robustness against road disturbances. Several experimental tests include lane change on roads with different bank angles, with dry and slippery surface conditions, to thoroughly validate the algorithm and demonstrate its performance.

AB This article presents an autonomous recovery system for fixed wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) which is using a line suspended between two multirotor UAVs to catch a line with a hook hanging from a fixed-wing UAV. This method of recovery is particularly suitable for recovery in space constrained areas such as on small ships. A control system is presented for the proposed recovery concept and the concept is validated through experiments. The results include 17 test runs to characterize control accuracy, followed by three successful recoveries. With the selected equipment and tuning values, the multirotors were able to track the fixed-wing UAV with a mean error of 0.8 m at the moment the catch would have happened in the 17 test runs. The margins for missing for the three recoveries were 1.0-2.1 m showing that this recovery method is robust.

AB This paper proposes an improved Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach including a fuzzy compensator in order to track desired trajectories of autonomous Underwater Vehicle Manipulator Systems (UVMS). The tracking performance can be affected by robot dynamical model uncertainties and applied external disturbances. Nevertheless, the MPC as a known proficient nonlinear control approach should be improved by the uncertainty estimator and disturbance compensator particularly in high nonlinear circumstances such as underwater environment in which operation of the UVMS is extremely impressed by added nonlinear terms to its model. In this research, a new methodology is proposed to promote robustness virtue of MPC that is done by designing a fuzzy compensator based on the uncertainty and disturbance estimation in order to reduce or even omit undesired effects of these perturbations. The proposed control design is compared with conventional MPC control approach to confirm the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of robustness against uncertainties, guaranteed stability and precision.

AB In this paper, we propose a distributed data-gathering scheme using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) working as a mobile sink to gather data from a randomly distributed underwater sensor network where sensor nodes are clustered around several cluster headers. Unlike conventional data-gathering schemes where the AUV visits either every node or every cluster header, the proposed scheme allows the AUV to visit some selected nodes named path-nodes in a way that reduces the overall transmission power of the sensor nodes. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to investigate the performance of the proposed scheme compared with several preexisting techniques employing the AUV in terms of total amount of energy consumption, standard deviation of each node's energy consumption, latency to gather data at a sink, and controlling overhead. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme not only reduces the total energy consumption but also distributes the energy consumption more uniformly over the network, thereby increasing the lifetime of the network.

AB Currently, electric mobility and autonomous vehicles are of top priority from safety, environmental and economic points of view. In the automotive industry, monitoring and processing accurate and plausible sensor signals is a crucial safety-critical task. The vehicle's yaw rate is one of the most important state descriptors of vehicle dynamics, and its prediction can significantly contribute to choosing the correct intervention strategy. In this article, a Long Short-Term Memory network-based neural network model is proposed for predicting the future values of the yaw rate. The training, validating and testing of the neural network was conducted based on experimental data gathered from three different driving scenarios. The proposed model can predict the yaw rate value in 0.2 s in the future with high accuracy, using sensor signals of the vehicle from the last 0.3 s in the past. The R2 values of the proposed network range between 0.8938 and 0.9719 in the different scenarios, and in a mixed driving scenario, it is 0.9624.

AB We consider the problem of characterizing a generalized Voronoi diagram/partition of a convex polygon in a two-dimensional Euclidean space that encodes information about the proximity relations between a team of aerial/marine vehicles and arbitrary points in the partition space. These proximity relations are determined by the time required for each vehicle to reach an arbitrary point (time-to-go) in the partition space when driven by a locally optimal feedback control law in the presence of a spatiotemporal drift field. The main contribution of this work is the presentation of a partitioning algorithm, which is decentralized, in the sense that each vehicle can independently compute its corresponding cell from the generalized Voronoi partition without computing or receiving information about the cells of the other vehicles. Finally, we present numerical simulations using data from real drift fields to illustrate the key features of the decentralized solution to the proposed class of spatial partitioning problems.

DE Cubic splines; probabilistic curvemap (PCM); simultaneous localization
   and mapping (SLAM)
AB Accurate localization is a fundamental component of driver-assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. For path-constrained motion, a map offers significant information and assists localization with valuable information about the evolution of the kinematic vehicle states. We propose natural parameterized cubic spline curves to approximate true motion constraints, particularly the centerline of individual road lanes or rail tracks. Vehicle kinematics is modeled in 1-D curve coordinates. Since map information is subject to uncertainties, a probabilistic treatment is a prerequisite to obtaining consistent localization results. The proposed probabilistic curvemap (PCM) and the close map-to-vehicle relation enable a straightforward derivation of measurement update equations without additional map-matching steps and offer themselves to classical filter techniques. Incoming sensor measurements are used for simultaneous vehicle localization and local PCM update around the current vehicle position. Thus, every revisit of a location reduces uncertainty in the local PCM. Moreover, when no prior information is provided in the PCM, extrapolation is carried out to handle these situations with incomplete maps. The proposed filter is validated through simulations and real-world railway experiments.

AB Connected vehicles (CVs) are considered to have the potential to significantly improve traffic flow stability. Although several studies have been devoted to modelling car-following behaviour in a connected environment, most model formulations are based on assumptions without empirical observations. Therefore, this paper utilizes data from field experiments to explore the dynamics of CVs. Data mining analysis shows that the driver is more responsive to velocity differences with safety messages. According to the data analysis results, we present a modified car-following model based on the intelligent driver model (IDM). Then, the parameters of our modified IDM are calibrated. It is shown that the modified IDM is able to reproduce the observed experimental data better than the original IDM. Next, we conduct a linear stability analysis of the modified IDM to explore the properties of the model. Finally, simulation experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical analysis.

AB Vehicle mass and road grade are important to traction control and safety control of electric mining haul trucks (EMHTs), especially to autonomous EMHTs. This paper proposes a base-vector based cross iteration estimator (BVCIE) to simultaneously estimate the vehicle mass and the road grade for EMHTs. To develop the estimator, the dynamics model for EMHTs is first built and the unknown parameters are identified by the recursive least square. Then the estimator is proposed by selecting a base vector from the parameters to be estimated, and by using a cross iteration strategy to update older information. This estimator is based on the ideology that the total mass of EMHT is a constant in every travelling trip. The estimator is finally validated on different loads under different road conditions with 930E. The experimental results show that both the vehicle mass and the road grade can be estimated with good accuracy.

AB This paper presents a strategy for real-time generation of formation trajectories using a leader follower approach. A trajectory generator prescribes the motion of a group of virtual vehicles, using a Lyapunov-based nonlinear controller that stabilizes the position of the leader in the reference frame of the virtual vehicles at a predefined distance vector. This strategy differs from the standard approach of defining the desired distance vector in an inertial frame and can be used to obtain rich formation trajectories with varying curvatures between vehicles. By imposing adequate constraints on the motion of the virtual vehicles, the generation of valid formation trajectories is naturally guaranteed, bypassing the demanding task of obtaining complete path descriptions. The trajectories are generated online and provided to a trajectory tracking controller specifically designed for quadrotor vehicles. Simulation and experimental flight tests are presented to evaluate the performance of the solution proposed, applied to formation control of quadrotors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, the prescribed-time leader-follower formation control problem is solved for surface vehicles (SVs) suffering from input saturation and unknowns including uncertain dynamics and external disturbances. Based on the information of neighboring vehicles, a distributed prescribed-time observer for estimating states of the leader is proposed. By virtue of input saturation, the saturation errors and system unknowns are observed by a reduced-order prescribed-time estimator. Moreover, to realize the satisfactory formation error constraints, a time scale transformation function based prescribed-time prescribed performance function is proposed, together with error transformations, the transient performance of formation errors is improved. Lyapunov stability theorem and backstepping method prove that the closed-loop system is prescribed-time stable. Simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of proposed theoretical results.

AB This paper presents a model predictive trajectory optimization and tracking framework to avoid collisions for autonomous vehicles in highly constrained environments. Firstly, a vehicle model is established in road coordinate system to describe the relationship between the vehicle and the reference road. Secondly, a numerical optimization method is applied to smoothen the reference path generated by waypoints. Then, a multilayer searched method is used to establish a safe driving corridor in highly constrained environments. In addition, an optimal path optimization and tracking framework based on model predictive control is formulated to improve the driving safety and comfort. The proposed framework considers the constraints of path boundaries and vehicle dynamics to provide the optimal control command. Furthermore, the speed profile is optimized based on the longitudinal motion model in space domain to ensure the constraints of speed limits and vehicle acceleration. Finally, the proposed algorithms are evaluated through experiments in various scenarios to demonstrate the effectiveness.

AB Connected vehicles (CV) comprise a broad class of capabilities enabled by automobiles, other vehicles, and components of the roadway system communicating with each other. A fast growing commercial market, CV has the potential for significant, but heretofore under-explored societal benefits. This study employs a scenario analysis to estimate environmental, health, access, and equity outcomes from widespread deployment of CV in the United States by 2035. A Mobility for All scenario, envisioning favorable policy and optimistic assumptions about technology progress, provides significant societal benefits. Two alternative scenarios, Mobility in Transition and Fragmented Mobility, provide environmental benefits similar to one another, but the latter degrades health, access, and equity for most of the population. The scenarios suggest that CV?s most significant societal benefits arise from its interactions with automation and electrification and that enhancing equity in any push towards CV represent a low-regrets option for public, private, and civil society actors.

AB With the development of autonomous vehicles, advanced driver-assistance systems, and vehicular social networks, the requirement for vehicle trajectory prediction in lane changing is higher. Here, we propose a neural-network-based operational level lane-changing model using data-driven methods. First, we determine the inputs of the lane-changing model by analyzing the influence factors of the lane-changing behavioral model under the framework of the social force theory. The main influencing factors include the temporal destination, the historical trajectories of the lane-changing vehicle, and the relative distance between the surrounding vehicles in our lane-changing model. Our lane-changing model is built by deep neural networks (DNNs). Then, we determine the suitable network structure and other parameters by empirical data for the DNN. Finally, tests on empirical lane-changing trajectory data sets show that the operational level lane-changing model built by DNN is promising.

AB Ship hulls, as well as bridges, port dock pilings, dams, and various underwater structures need to be inspected for periodic maintenance. Additionally, there is a critical need to provide protection against sabotage activities, and to establish effective countermeasures against illegal smuggling activities. Unmanned underwater vehicles are suitable platforms for the development of automated inspection systems, but require integration with appropriate sensor technologies. This paper describes a vision system for automated ship-hull inspection, based on computing the necessary information for positioning, navigation, and mapping of the hull from stereo images. Binocular cues are critical in resolving a number of complex visual artifacts that hamper monocular vision in shallow-water conditions. Furthermore, they simplify the estimation of vehicle pose and motion, which is fundamental for successful automatic operation. The system has been implemented on a commercial remotely operated vehicle (ROV), and tested in pool and dock tests. Results from various trials are presented to demonstrate the system capabilities.

AB Unmanned underwater vehicles perform inspection and maintenance tasks in complex and changing environments. Some of these tasks require synchronous navigation of multiple vehicles, which is challenging. This paper proposes a synchronous navigation scheme for two BlueROV2 underwater vehicles for a coordinated multi-vehicle task. In the proposed scheme, the vehicles perform the collaborative task of grasping, transporting, and releasing an object. In this scheme, no vehicle-to-vehicle communication is required. A model-free second-order sliding mode controller with finite-time convergence is used to accomplish this task. The controller's convergence time is user-defined and does not depend on the physical or hydrodynamic parameters of the vehicle, unlike the other finite-time controllers found in the literature. Simulation experiments were conducted to verify the controller's performance, including high ocean currents as external disturbances. Comparisons were made with two state-of-the-art controllers with finite-time convergence. The results showed that the proposed controller achieved the best results, as the user-defined convergence time was achieved for both vehicles and the collaborative task was completed, no ripples, deviations, or oscillations were observed, and no chattering occurred. The results proved the robustness of the controller in the presence of high ocean currents without the need to readjust the parameters.

AB The connected autonomous vehicle is considered an effective way to improve transport safety and efficiency. To overcome the limited sensing and computing capabilities of individual vehicles, we design a digital twin assisted decision-making framework for Internet of Vehicles, by leveraging the integration of communication, sensing and computing. In this framework, the digital twin entities residing on edge can effectively communicate and cooperate with each other to plan sub-targets for their respective vehicles, while the vehicles only need to achieve the sub-targets by generating a sequence of atomic actions. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to implement the framework, which can be trained in an end-to-end way. In the proposed approach, the communication interval of digital twin entities could adapt to time-varying environment. Extensive experiments on driving decision-making have been performed in traffic junction scenarios of different difficulties. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can largely improve collaboration efficiency while reducing communication overhead.

AB The expansion on the use of Electric Vehicles demands new mechanisms to ease the charging process, making it autonomous and with a reduced user intervention. This paper reviews the technologies applied to the wireless charge of Electric Vehicles. In particular, it focuses on the technologies based on the induction principle, the capacitive-based techniques, those that use radiofrequency waves and the laser powering. As described, the convenience of each technique depends on the requirements imposed on the wireless power transfer. Specifically, we can state that the power level, the distance between the power source and the electric vehicle or whether the transfer is executed with the vehicle on the move or not or the cost are critical parameters that need to be taken into account to decide which technology to use. In addition, each technique requires some complementary electronics. This paper reviews the main components that are incorporated into these systems and it provides a review of their most relevant configurations.

AB Traffic oscillation, a traffic phenomenon that generates many carbon emissions, originates from the amplification of traffic disturbance. The connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technology may help to weaken oscillations and reduce carbon emissions from mixed traffic. This paper explores the effects of various characteristics of disturbances and mixed platoons on CO2 emissions under different disturbance types. The results indicate that the addition of even only one CAV reduces carbon emissions under some disturbances. The disturbance types that make mixed traffic increase carbon emissions have also been identified. Diverse disturbance characteristics play different essential roles in ecological impacts of CAVs. The platoon characteristics such as CAV's position in a platoon and the heterogeneity of human factors, affect the extent of carbon emission reduction. Based on these findings, this paper proposes optimization recommendations for CAV cooperative eco-driving and green traffic management.

ID FEATURES; VISION
AB In recent years, the deep learning object detection algorithms using 2D images have become the powerful tools for road object detection in autonomous driving. In fact, the deep learning methods for road vehicle detection have achieved the remarkable results. Although there have been a large number of studies that thoroughly explored various types of deep learning methods for vehicle detection, there are a few studies that compare and evaluate the detection time and detection accuracy of the mainstream deep learning object detection algorithms for vehicle detection. Here, this article compares five mainstream deep learning object detection algorithms in vehicle detection, namely the faster RCNN, R-FCN, SSD, RetinaNet, and YOLOv3 on the KITTI data and analyze the obtained results. The detection time and detection accuracy of the five object-detection algorithms on the KITTI test set are compared and analyzed; the PR curve and AP value are used to evaluate the detection accuracy.

AB This paper focuses on the design and construction of an optimization charging system for Li-Po batteries by means of tracked solar panels. Thus, the implementation of a complete energy management system applied to a robotic exploration vehicle is put forward. The proposed system was tested on the VANTER robotic platform-an autonomous unmanned exploration vehicle specialized in recognition. The interest of this robotic system lies in the design concept, based on a smart host microcontroller. On this basis, our proposal makes a twofold significant contribution. On the one hand, it presents the construction of a solar tracking mechanism aimed at increasing the rover's power regardless of its mobility. On the other hand, it proposes an alternative design of power system performance based on a pack of two batteries. The aim is completing the process of charging a battery independently while the other battery provides all the energy consumed by the robotic vehicle.

ID NAVIGATION
AB While classical approaches to autonomous robot navigation currently enable operation in certain environments, they break down in tightly constrained spaces, e.g., where the robot needs to engage in agile maneuvers to squeeze between obstacles. Recent machine learning techniques have the potential to address this shortcoming, but existing approaches require vast amounts of navigation experience for training, during which the robot must operate in close proximity to obstacles and risk collision. In this letter, we propose to side-step this requirement by introducing a new machine learning paradigm for autonomous navigation called learning from hallucination (LfH), which can use training data collected in completely safe environments to compute navigation controllers that result in fast, smooth, and safe navigation in highly constrained environments. Our experimental results show that the proposed LfH system outperforms three autonomous navigation baselines on a real robot and generalizes well to unseen environments, including those based on both classical and machine learning techniques.

AB In this paper, a constrained lateral dynamics model of articulated vehicles and an algorithm for estimating sideslip angle and cornering stiffness are proposed. The articulated vehicle was modeled using the bicycle model, linear tire model, and modified Dug-off model. The normal force of each axle included in the model was estimated based on the longitudinal load transfer model. Physical constraints were applied to reduce model states. Accurate sideslip angle and cornering stiffness are essential for vehicle control safety and autonomous driving performance. The sideslip angle and cornering stiffness were simultaneously estimated using a dual linear time-varying (LTV) Kalman filter. The observability matrix guaranteed the convergence of the proposed estimation algorithm. The estimation performance was verified by simulation with TruckSim and an experiment using an articulated bus.

The parameter estimation methods for all navigation system components are described. The results of simulation modeling with corresponding quality metrics are presented. The outcomes were supported by conducted field experiments. The results obtained allowed us to obtain a position determination model for the underwater vehicle, which is still a relevant and complex task for seabed explorers.

However, accurate dynamic models for deriving controllers for moderate to high speeds have been lacking. This work presents theoretical models of quadrotor aerodynamics with non-zero free-stream velocities based on helicopter momentum and blade element theory, validated with static tests and flight data. Controllers are derived using these models and implemented on the Stanford Testbed of Autonomous Rotorcraft for Multi-Agent Control (STARMAC), demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods. The design of the STARMAC platform is described, and flight results are presented demonstrating improved accuracy over commercially available quadrotors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have a wide range of applications in marine geoscience, and are increasingly being used in the scientific, military, commercial, and policy sectors. Their ability to operate autonomously of a host vessel makes them well suited to exploration of extreme environments, from the world's deepest hydrothermal vents to beneath polar ice sheets. They have revolutionised our ability to image the seafloor, providing higher resolution seafloor mapping data than can be achieved from surface vessels, particularly in deep water. This contribution focuses on the major advances in marine geoscience that have resulted from AUV data. The primary applications are i) submarine volcanism and hydrothermal vent studies, ii) mapping and monitoring of low-temperature fluid escape features and chemosynthetic ecosystems, iii) benthic habitat mapping in shallow- and deep-water environments, and iv) mapping of seafloor morphological features (e.g. bedforms generated beneath ice or sediment-gravity flows). A series of new datasets is presented that highlight the growing versatility of AUVs for marine geoscience studies, including i) multi-frequency acoustic imaging of trawling impacts on deep-water coral mounds, iii) collection of high-resolution seafloor photomosaics at abyssal depths, and iii) velocity measurements of active submarine density flows. Future developments in AUV technology of potential relevance to marine geoscience include new vehicles with enhanced hovering, long endurance, extreme depth, or rapid response capabilities, while development of new sensors will further expand the range of geochemical parameters that can be measured.

AB A vision-aided terrain referenced navigation (VATRN) approach is addressed for autonomous navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under GPS-denied conditions. A typical terrain referenced navigation (TRN) algorithm blends inertial navigation data with measured terrain information to estimate vehicle's position. In this paper, a low-cost inertial navigation system (INS) for UAVs is supplemented with a monocular vision-aided navigation system and terrain height measurements. A point mass filter based on Bayesian estimation is employed as a TRN algorithm. Homograpies are established to estimate the vehicle's relative translational motion using ground features with simple assumptions. And the error analysis in homography estimation is explored to estimate the error covariance matrix associated with the visual odometry data. The estimated error covariance is delivered to the TRN algorithm for robust estimation. Furthermore, multiple ground features tracked by image observations are utilized as multiple height measurements to improve the performance of the VATRN algorithm.

AB In this article, we assess the string stability of seven 2018 model year adaptive cruise control (ACC) equipped vehicles that are widely available in the US market. Seven distinct vehicle models from two different vehicle makes are analyzed using data collected from more than 1,200 miles of driving in car-following experiments with ACC engaged by the follower vehicle. The resulting dataset is used to identify the parameters of a linear second order delay differential equation model that approximates the behavior of the black box ACC systems. The string stability of the data-fitted model associated with each vehicle is assessed, and the main finding is that all seven vehicle models have string unstable ACC systems. For one commonly available vehicle model that offers ACC as a standard feature on all trim levels, we validate the string stability finding with a multi-vehicle homogeneousplatoon experiment in which all vehicles are the same year, make, and model. In this test, an initial disturbance of 6 mph is amplified to a 25 mph disturbance, at which point the last vehicle in the platoon is observed to disengage the ACC. The data collected in the driving experiments is made available, representing the largest publicly available comparative driving dataset on ACC equipped vehicles.

AB In a platoon communication scenario, the Platoon Leader (PL) vehicle interacts with the gNodeB (gNB) to obtain some assigned radio resources and then the obtained radio resources are allocated to the PL vehicle and its Platoon Member (PM) vehicles. The high transmission delay in the platoon network affects the quality of vehicles' connectivity. Therefore, the issues of improving radio resource's spectral efficiency and stability of the vehicle platooning with limited radio resources need to be tackled. This work proposes the 2-STage Resource Allocation (2-STRA) method for multi-platoon communication to reduce the transmission latency of platoon vehicles, i.e., it can improve the data transmission rates of platoon vehicles for the conditions of various speeds and various numbers of subchannels. In the 1(st) stage, a greedy algorithm that jointly considers subchannel allocation and power control for PL vehicles' resource allocation is devised. In the 2(nd) stage, the resource allocation for PM vehicles, which is based on the subchannels that are not allocated to PL vehicles, is resolved. A tripartite hypergraph, in which a tripartite hyperedge links:I 1) cluster of PM vehicles that use the same subchannel; 2) individual cellular user; and 3) subchannel, is adopted to devise the PM vehicles' resource allocation algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed 2-STRA method can have better performance in terms of spectral efficiency and the sum of data transmission rate comparing with the other methods.

AB This paper presents a distributed cascade Proportional Integral Derivate (DCPID) control algorithm for the connected and automated vehicle (CAV) platoon considering the heterogeneity of CAVs. Furthermore, a real-time cooperative lane-changing model for CAVs, which can seamlessly combine the DCPID algorithm and sine function is developed. The DCPID algorithm determines the appropriate longitudinal acceleration and speed of the lane-changing vehicle considering the speed fluctuations of the front vehicle on the target lane (TFV). In the meantime, the sine function plans a reference trajectory which is further updated in real time using the model predictive control (MPC) to avoid potential collisions. Simulation results indicate that the DCPID algorithm can provide robust control for tracking and adjusting the desired spacing and velocity for all 400 scenarios. Besides, the proposed cooperative lane-changing model can guarantee effective and safe lane changing with different speeds and even in emergency situations.

ID MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS
AB This paper addresses the problem of synchronized path following of multiple homogenous underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (A-UNTs). The dedicated control laws are categorized into two envelopes: One is steering individual underwater vehicle to track along predefined path, and the other is ensuring tracked paths of multiple vehicles to be synchronized, by means of decentralized speed adoption under the constraints of multi-vehicle coniumnication topology. With these two tasks formulation, geometric path following is built on Lyaptinov theory and backstepping techniques, while injecting helmsman behavior into classic individual path following control. Synchronization of path parameters are reached by using a mixture of tools from linear algebra, graph theory and nonlinear control theory. A simple but effective control design on direct inter-vehicle speed adoption with minimized communication variables, enables the multi-AIN systems to be synchronized and stabilized into an invariant manifold, and all speeds converge to desired assignments as a byproduct. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the synchronized path following control laws proposed.

AB In this article, the position sensor deception attack detection and estimation problem is investigated for a local vehicle in a vehicle platoon. In a platoon system, the position measurement is critical as the distances between neighboring vehicles are relatively small. However, the position measurement of vehicles is usually vulnerable to deception attacks as it relies on external information, such as GPS and environment information from cameras. Therefore, position sensor deception attack detection and estimation should be addressed for local vehicles in a platoon. To deal with this problem, a linearized model is presented to describe the longitudinal dynamics of a local vehicle. Moreover, modeling uncertainties, measurement noises, and piecewise constant deception attacks injected in position measurement are specified along with this model. Based on this model, a scheme based on a modified unbiased finite impulse response (UFIR) estimator is proposed to generate an intermediate estimated value related only to the attack. Then, the deception attack is recovered based on this value through a function fitting strategy. Based on analysis results, simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed attack detection and estimation scheme.

ID LANE DETECTION; SHAPE
AB Obstacle detection is a crucial issue for driver assistance systems as well as for autonomous vehicle guidance function and it has to be performed with high reliability to avoid any potential collision with the front vehicle. The vision-based obstacle detection systems are regarded promising for this purpose because they require little infrastructure on a highway. However, the feasibility of these systems in passenger car requires accurate and robust sensing performance. In this paper, an obstacle detection system using stereo vision sensors is developed. This system utilizes feature matching, epipoplar constraint and feature aggregation in order to robustly detect the initial corresponding pairs. After the initial detection, the system executes the tracking algorithm for the obstacles. The proposed system can detect a front obstacle, a leading vehicle and a vehicle cutting into the lane. Then, the position parameters of the obstacles and leading vehicles can be obtained. The proposed obstacle detection system is implemented on a passenger car and its performance is verified experimentally. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Agriculture 3.0 and 4.0 have gradually introduced service robotics and automation into several agricultural processes, mostly improving crops quality and seasonal yield. Row-based crops are the perfect settings to test and deploy smart machines capable of monitoring and manage the harvest. In this context, global path generation is essential either for ground or aerial vehicles, and it is the starting point for every type of mission plan. Nevertheless, little attention has been currently given to this problem by the research community and global path generation automation is still far to be solved. In order to generate a viable path for an autonomous machine, the presented research proposes a feature learning fully convolutional model capable of estimating waypoints given an occupancy grid map. In particular, we apply the proposed data-driven methodology to the specific case of row-based crops with the general objective to generate a global path able to cover the extension of the crop completely. Extensive experimentation with a custom made synthetic dataset and real satellite-derived images of different scenarios have proved the effectiveness of our methodology and demonstrated the feasibility of an endto-end and completely autonomous global path planner.

DT Article
AB This paper will study a trajectory tracking control algorithm for electric vehicles based on a terminal sliding mode controller. First, a 3 degrees of freedom nonlinear vehicle model and a controller-oriented 2 degrees of freedom vehicle model are established. The preview time is adaptively adjusted based on the preview model. Then, the vehicle trajectory tracking controller, which uses the terminal sliding mode algorithm, is designed. The radial basis function (RBF) neural network algorithm is used to approximate the system variable parameters in the control model online. At the same time, fuzzy logic is used to control the gain parameters of the controller to reduce the chattering of the control system. Finally, the designed controller is verified by simulation. The maximum deviation of path tracking under different speeds is 0.6 m, and the target path can also be well followed under different road friction coefficients. The simulation results show that the controller designed in this paper can effectively carry out the vehicle trajectory tracking and lateral control and reduce the chattering to a certain extent.

AB Contemporary systems of mobility are undergoing a transition towards automation. In the UK, this transition is being led by (often new) partnerships between incumbent manufacturers and new entrants, in collaboration with national governments, local/regional councils, and research institutions. This paper first offers a framework for analyzing the governance of the transition, adapting ideas from the Transition Management (TM) perspective, and then applies the framework to ongoing automated vehicle transition dynamics in the UK. The empirical analysis suggests that the UK has adopted a reasonably comprehensive approach to the governing of automated vehicle innovation but that this approach cannot be characterized as sufficiently inclusive, democratic, diverse and open. The lack of inclusivity, democracy, diversity and openness is symptomatic of the post-political character of how the UK's automated mobility transition is being governed. The paper ends with a call for a reconfiguration of the automated vehicle transition in the UK and beyond, so that much more space is created for dissent and for reflexive and comprehensive big picture thinking on (automated) mobility futures.

AB This paper addresses the problem of adaptive memory-event-triggered control for intelligent vehicle transportation systems (IVTSs). Unlike the existing methods for modeling IVTSs, the acceleration information is introduced in the desired distance to achieve better distance control performance of IVTSs. The information between vehicles interacts over a wireless network. In order to further reduce the amount of data transmission, a novel adaptive memory-event-triggered mechanism (METM) is developed, in which historical information is utilized. In addition, the proposed METM threshold is designed to vary with the system state of each autonomous vehicle to adjust the data-releasing rate adaptively. Under the adaptive METM, a distributed tracking controller with historical information is put forward to guarantee uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) stability using the Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique. Finally, simulation results are given to verify the superiority of the proposed method.

AB In this paper, we study the chain stability of vehicles under bilateral control (BCM), and prove that vehicles under bilateral control are chain stable, i.e., all input perturbations to the chain decay exponentially (with the length of the chain). Chain stability analysis tells us how vehicles under bilateral control will act in traffic when mixed with cars driven by human drivers. It shows that self-driving cars using bilateral control can reduce traffic flow instabilities in mixed traffic. Indeed, chains of BCM vehicles become perturbation-consuming dampers when inserted in traffic, since they split chains of human-driven vehicles and prevent perturbations from being transmitted from one chain of car-following cars to the next. Thus, today's traffic can be improved greatly by the insertion of BCM vehicles. The simulation results validate the theoretical analysis.

AB In this paper, a prototype cybernetic transportation system called cybernetic technologies for cars in Chinese cities (CyberC3) is introduced. This system contains as many modules as necessary to evaluate the feasibility for its potential mass application in cities, including a central control room, five stations, three on-road monitoring cameras, three intelligent vehicles, and a green-energy power system. The entire system is centrally controlled and runs in two different modes-the "shuttle mode" and the "on-demand mode." The control algorithm is divided into three logical layers: scheduling, planning, and executing. The scheduling layer manages the entire system, the planning layer navigates the vehicle, and the executing layer controls the vehicle in real time. The vehicle is powered by supercapacitor batteries. This system is a demonstration system, as well as a research platform, and has been open to the public in Shanghai, China, since May 2007, which has helped to evaluate the entire system and spread the concept of "cybernetic transportation systems" in China.

AB Automated steering control is essential for an autonomous off-road vehicle. Many off-road vehicles use an electrohydraulic (E/H) actuator to implement the steering control. This paper reports the design and validation of an electrohydraulic steering controller through a combination of system identification, model simulation, and field tests. A kinematic model of the steering linkage geometry provided the gain between the hydraulic actuator and the front wheels. The system model was used to close the steering control loop based on the feedback signal from the hydraulic steering actuator rather than from the front wheels. Test results were used to identify the non-linear and dynamic characteristics of the original electrohydraulic steering system. The system identification model was used to develop a preliminary controller, which was simulated under Matlab before beginning full-scale vehicle testing. The simulation and vehicle test results indicated that the steering controller developed was capable of efficiently handling the non-linearity and dynamic asymmetry of the electrohydraulic steering system.

AB The interaction between ramp and mainline vehicles plays a crucial role in merging areas, especially in the mixed-traffic environment. The driving behaviours of human drivers are uncertain and diverse, and the uncertainty makes it more complex for connected automated vehicles (CAV) to plan trajectories and merge into the mainline. To overcome this problem, a interactive merging strategy based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) is designed, enabling the ramp vehicle (CAV) to consider the dynamic reaction of mainline vehicles. There are two agents in our interactive strategy, one of which is to predict and analyse the behaviour of mainline vehicles (human-driven vehicles, HDV, or non-connected vehicles). The other is created for exploring optimal merging actions of ramp vehicles. Firstly, game theory is used to model the competitive behaviours between ramp and mainline vehicles, and the Nash equilibrium of joint actions guides the ramp vehicle to learn best response to the mainline vehicle. Secondly, the Nash double Q algorithm is developed to ensure the outputs of Q networks are trained to efficiently converge to the Nash equilibrium point. The trained Q networks are then used for online control. Finally, our strategy is compared with single RL and existing MADRL algorithms in real on-ramp scenarios. Simulations show our strategy to be successful in coordinating both vehicles via analysis of human drivers, resulting in improved driving performance in terms of global safety, efficiency, and comfort.

AB Capturing uncertainty in object detection is indispensable for safe autonomous driving. In recent years, deep learning has become the de-facto approach for object detection, and many probabilistic object detectors have been proposed. However, there is no summary on uncertainty estimation in deep object detection, and existing methods are either built with different network architectures and uncertainty estimation methods, or evaluated on different datasets with a wide range of evaluation metrics. As a result, a comparison among methods remains challenging, as does the selection of a model that best suits a particular application. This paper aims to alleviate this problem by providing a review and comparative study on existing probabilistic object detection methods for autonomous driving applications. First, we provide an overview of practical uncertainty estimation methods in deep learning, and then systematically survey existing methods and evaluation metrics for probabilistic object detection. Next, we present a strict comparative study for probabilistic object detection based on an image detector and three public autonomous driving datasets. Finally, we present a discussion of the remaining challenges and future works. Code has been made available at https://github.com/asharakeh/pod_compare.git.

AB Digital software has been proliferating in the classroom, frequently replacing students' hands on experiences. This article reports on a study that tested how hands on experiences with physical emerging technology, namely personal robots, drones, cameras, and echo dots, may improve or impair student learning and enhance or diminish the classroom experience. This study examines the potential impact of hands on experiences on student knowledge, skills, and values regarding emerging technology in the context of a course that employed traditional learning, defined as theoretical applications of next generation technology, namely autonomous vehicles during the first half, and hands on experiences with physical emerging technologies related to domotics, during the second half. Using three diagnostics, tweets, reflections, and discussion posts, we suggest that hands on experiences allowed students to more easily identify potential challenges with, and reduced their fears regarding, emerging technology. Additionally, our findings suggest that traditional learning methods may decrease familiarity with most technologies, whereas hands on experiences increased familiarity. Hands on experiences also appear to reverse several other trends associated with traditional learning. Ultimately, given the proliferation of technologies in the modern world and the impacts of automation, hands on experiences may be even more valuable than expected to students as they enter the workforce.

ID VISION
AB Traffic light detection is a key module in the autonomous driving system to enhance the interactions between drivers and unmanned vehicles. In recent studies, deep neural networks are widely used for traffic light detection and resource/power consumption is a major concern for model deployment in vehicular edge devices. This paper proposes a novel light-weight deep CNN model that integrates the multi-backbone of state-of-the-art architectures for the self-driving traffic light detection. The MBBNet (Multi-BackBone Network) consists of three common convolutional backbones, i.e., the normal, residual and highway (DenseNet) convolutional modules. Simple ensemble of those backbones may incur high computational load. Therefore, channel compression is adopted to control the model parameters, while guaranteeing the accuracy for mobile and embedded hardware. Evaluation of a dataset collected from real road conditions demonstrate the robustness of our detection system, and it achieves higher accuracy (accuracy> 0.94 and Average_IOU > 74.05%) for self-driving buses. In terms of resource consumption, the trained model size is 1.35 MB, and can process high-resolution images (1280 x 960) at 14 FPS (frames per second) on low-power edge devices.

AB This paper proposes a novel complete navigation system for autonomous flight of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in GPS-denied environments. The hardware platform used to test the proposed algorithm is a small, custom-built UAV platform equipped with an onboard computer, RGB-D camera, 2D light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and altimeter. The error-state Kalman filter (ESKF) based on the dynamic model for low-cost IMU-driven systems is proposed, and visual odometry from the RGB-D camera and height measurement from the altimeter are fed into the measurement update process of the ESKF. The pose output of the ESKF is then integrated into the open-source simultaneous location and mapping (SLAM) algorithm for pose-graph optimization and loop closing. In addition, the computationally efficient collision-free path planning algorithm is proposed and verified through simulations. The software modules run onboard in real time with limited onboard computational capability. The indoor flight experiment demonstrates that the proposed system for small UAVs with low-cost devices can navigate without collision in fully autonomous missions while establishing accurate surrounding maps.

AB This paper proposes heuristic methods to optimize the trajectories of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) along an arterial assuming fully automated traffic condition. CAV trajectories are adjusted to form platoons at the saturation headway, guaranteeing the arrival of vehicles at the downstream intersection during the green interval. On the arrival of CAVs, an algorithm enables a smooth transition to the system target speed. The CAVs' trajectories are then adjusted by an algorithm according to the vehicles' positions (leader/follower). Simulation parameters that consider human driving are selected to avoid overestimating the benefits of the proposed strategy. A simulation algorithm is developed to evaluate the performance of the proposed heuristic. The proposed method is compared with a pre-timed coordinated signal control scheme. Seven demand scenarios corresponding to undersaturated conditions are evaluated. The proposed method reduced travel time by 7% to 16% and delay by 23% to 43%. Its computational efficiency makes the proposed method suitable for real-world tests.

AB Pedestrian and vehicle detection plays a key role in the safe driving of autonomous vehicles. Although transformer-based object detection algorithms have made great progress, the accuracy of detection in rainy scenarios is still challenging. Based on the Swin Transformer, this paper proposes an end-to-end pedestrian and vehicle detection algorithm (PVformer) with deraining module, which improves the image quality and detection accuracy in rainy scenes. Based on Transformer blocks, a four-branch feature mapping model was introduced to achieve deraining from a single image, thereby mitigating the influence of rain streak occlusion on the detector performance. According to the trouble of small object detection only by visual transformer, we designed a local enhancement perception block based on CNN and Transformer. In addition, the deraining module and the detection module were combined to train the PVformer model through transfer learning. The experimental results show that the algorithm performed well on rainy days and significantly improved the accuracy of pedestrian and vehicle detection.

ID VEHICLE FUEL CONSUMPTION; TRAFFIC-FLOW; AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; STABILITY;
   VICINITY; IMPACT
AB Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) organizes connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in platoons to improve traffic flow and reduce fuel consumption. Platoon formation involves a very complex process, however, because lateral and longitudinal misbehavior of CAVs results in greater fuel consumption and risk of collision. This study aims to design optimal vehicle trajectories of CAVs during CACC platoon formation. First, a basic scenario and a destination-based protocol are described to determine vehicle sequence in the platoon. A space-time lattice based model is then formulated to construct vehicle trajectories considering boundary conditions of kinematic limits, vehicle-following safety, and lane-changing rules. The objective is to optimize the vehicle sequence and fuel consumption simultaneously. A two-phase algorithm is proposed to solve this model, where the first phase is a heuristic algorithm that determines vehicle sequence and in the second phase dynamic programming is adapted to optimize fuel consumption based on the determined sequence. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model in designing CAV trajectories, extensive experimental tests have been conducted in this study. Results show that the proposed model and algorithm can effectively optimize CAV sequence in the platoon based on their destinations. After optimization, CAV fuel consumption was reduced by 42%, 46%, and 43%, respectively, in three different tested scenarios.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are poised to reshape transportation and mobility by replacing humans as the driver and service provider. While the primary stated motivation for vehicle automation is to improve safety and convenience of road mobility, this transformation also provides a valuable opportunity to improve vehicle energy efficiency and reduce emissions in the transportation sector. Progress in vehicle efficiency and functionality, however, does not necessarily translate to net positive environmental outcomes. Here, we examine the interactions between CAV technology and the environment at four levels of increasing complexity: vehicle, transportation system, urban system, and society. We find that environmental impacts come from CAV-facilitated transformations at all four levels, rather than from CAV technology directly. We anticipate net positive environmental impacts at the vehicle, transportation system, and urban system levels, but expect greater vehicle utilization and shifts in travel patterns at the society level to offset some of these benefits. Focusing on the vehicle-level improvements associated with CAV technology is likely to yield excessively optimistic estimates of environmental benefits. Future research and policy efforts should strive to clarify the extent and possible synergetic effects from a systems level to envisage and address concerns regarding the short- and long-term sustainable adoption of CAV technology.

AB This study proposes and implements an intelligent transportation system (ITS)-based system that collects road event information via a vehicle's on-board unit (OBU) and roadside unit (RSU), integrates and processes information based on the database and the road network, and provides information to vehicles. This system enables the collection of road unit information without calculating the exact location of event information recognized by the vehicle and facilitates duplicate processing of information recognized from multiple sources. This information can then be provided to other vehicles or road operators via apps or the web, enabling immediate response to emergency situations or changes in road conditions. To verify the practical applicability of this system, we developed a prototype and validated its functions through experiments. Using this system and methods, general drivers, autonomous vehicles, and infrastructure can cooperate in an ITS environment to recognize and propagate various road situations, contributing to the creation of safer and more efficient roads.

AB Traffic bottleneck is frequently generated near the freeway on-ramp due to the merging behaviour of vehicles. Given the technology advance of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), this study aims to investigate the performance of CAVs on reducing the merging time at real-world freeway on-ramp via a comparison study based on both empirical and simulation data. First, real merging scenarios composed of empirical trajectory data were extracted from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset. Each merging scenario contains three manually driven vehicles (MDVs): the leading MDV and following MDV on the mainline, and the merging MDV from the on-ramp. Then the merging MDV is replaced by a CAV whose trajectory is optimised by a proposed optimisation model to minimise its merging time. The results indicate that under the same merging scenarios, CAVs can merge more efficiently and smoothly than MDVs while ensuring safety. Finally, sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness and transferability of the proposed model.

AB This paper presents an improved extended state observer-based line-of-sight (ELOS) guidance law for robust path following of underactuated surface vehicles without linear velocity measurement. First, two extended state observers are resorted to separately estimate the surge and sway linear velocities, such that the unmeasured side-slip angle can be indirectly calculated and accurately compensated in the line-of-sight guidance law. Especially, in this improved ELOS design no assumptions on constant or small side-slip angle are made. Second, a more high-order sliding mode surface is defined for the input of third-order heading tracking subsystem due to actuator dynamics. Subsequently, an adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control (AFSMC)-based tracking law is designed to robustly track the heading guidance angle without a prior on the vehicle's complex hydrodynamics parameters. Finally, comparative simulation results are provided to show the performance of the designed path following controller, composed of ELOS and AFSMC for underactuated surface vehicles with actuator dynamics.

TI A transfer-learning-based energy-conservation model for adaptive guided
   routes in autonomous vehicles
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL

DE AV; Energy-Efficiency; Navigation Decision; Transfer Learning
AB Autonomous vehicles (AV) are expected to improve road safety and reduce traffic congestion by optimizing routes and reducing human errors. AVs have the potential to increase accessibility for people with disabilities and reduce the environmental impact of transportation. AVs require radio transmitters to communicate with other vehicles and infrastructure, external charging to power their electric motors, and communication equipment to receive real-time data about traffic and road conditions. Additionally, these requirements must be met for AVs to operate efficiently and conserve energy. Therefore, this work introduces a novel technique called energyconservation guided route adaptation (EC-GRA) that aims to enhance the energy efficiency of connected vehicles. With the balance in energy adaptation for distinct purposes, the utilization rate is adjusted for communication and navigation. The complex decisions are confined to the energy availability and conservation factors required in an adaptive driving condition. This technique employs transfer learning to update the available and adaptable energy ratios under displacement-based route adaptations. In the learning process, the transfer and update states for displacement-aware decisions under varying scenarios are modeled. This study validates the state transitions involved in recommending energy utilization during both autonomous and guided driving scenarios. The results show that the proposed methodology exhibits superior performance compared to the currently available techniques. The EC-GRA under consideration has demonstrated an average energy conservation ratio of 45.58. The decision rate for this method is 0.63/navigation, while its energy utilization is 126.37 Joules. The number of failures observed in the proposed EC-GRA is 6/navigation, which represents an improvement over the existing approach. & COPY; 2023 THE AUTHORS.

ID SYSTEMS
AB Problem definition: We develop a crossdisciplinary analytics framework to understand citywide mobility-energy synergy. In particular, we investigate the potential of shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEVs) for improving the self-sufficiency and resilience of solar-powered urban microgrids. Academic/practical relevance: Our work is motivated by the ever-increasing interconnection of energy and mobility service systems at the urban scale. We propose models and analytics to characterize the dynamics of the SAEV-microgrid service systems, which were largely overlooked by the literature on service operations and vehicle-grid integration (VGI) analysis. Methodology: We develop a space-time-energy network representation of SAEVs. Then, we formulate linear program models to incorporate an array of major operational decisions interconnecting the mobility and energy systems. To preventatively ensure microgrid resilience, we also propose an "N-1" resilience-constrained fleet dispatch problem to cope with microgrid outages. Results: Combining eight data sources of New York City, our results show that 80,000 SAEVs in place of the current ride-sharing mobility assets can improve the microgrid self-sufficiency by 1.45% (benchmarked against the case without grid support) mainly via the spatial transfer of electricity, which complements conventional VGI. Scaling up the SAEV fleet size to 500,000 increases the microgrid self-sufficiency by 8.85% mainly through temporal energy transfer, which substitutes conventional VGI. We also quantify the potential and trade-offs of SAEVs for peak electricity import reduction and ramping mitigation. In addition, microgrid resilience can be enhanced by SAEVs, but the actual resilience level varies by microgrids and by the hour when grid contingency occurs. The SAEV fleet operator can further maintain the resilience of pivotal microgrid areas at their maximum achievable level with no more than a 1% increase in the fleet repositioning trip length. Managerial implications: Our models and findings demonstrate the potential in deepening the integration of urban mobility and energy service systems toward a smart-city future.

AB With the emerging interest of autonomous vehicles (AV), the performance and reliability of the land vehicle navigation are also becoming important. Generally, the navigation system for passenger car has been heavily relied on the existing Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in recent decades. However, there are many cases in real world driving where the satellite signals are challenged; for example, urban streets with buildings, tunnels, or even underpasses. In this paper, we propose a novel method for simultaneous vehicle dead reckoning, based on the lane detection model in GNSS-denied situations. The proposed method fuses the Inertial Navigation System (INS) with learning-based lane detection model to estimate the global position of vehicle, and effectively bounds the error drift compared to standalone INS. The integration of INS and lane model is accomplished by UKF to minimize linearization errors and computing time. The proposed method is evaluated through the real-vehicle experiments on highway driving, and the comparative discussions for other dead-reckoning algorithms with the same system configuration are presented.</p>

AB We address the problem of making nonholonomic vehicles, with second-order dynamics and interconnected over a bidirectional network, converge to a formation centered at a nonprespecified point on the plane with a nonprespecified common orientation. We assume that only the Cartesian position of the center of mass of each vehicle and its orientation are available for measurement, but not the velocities. In addition, we assume that the interconnections are affected by time-varying delays. Our control method consists in designing a set of second-order systems that are interconnected with the robots' dynamics through virtual springs and transmit their own coordinates to achieve consensus. This and the virtual elastic couplings with the vehicles make the latter achieve consensus too. To the best of our knowledge, output-feedback consensus control of underactuated nonholonomic vehicles has been little studied, all the less in the presence of delays.

AB A new type of underwater thruster was designed to provide high-accuracy, low-speed maneuvering to underwater robots. Located internal to the vehicle surface, these thrusters have a minimal effect on the forward-drag profile of the vehicle. These thrusters, whose inspiration comes from the natural propulsion of cephalopods and jellyfish, generate control forces by successive ingestion and expulsion of jets of water from a cavity mounted in the hull of the vehicle. The jetting process has no net mass flux but results in a positive momentum flux. A time-dependent thrust model was developed, which predicted the thruster dynamics as a function of time, actuation frequency, and thruster-driving parameters. A linear transfer-function model was developed to approximate both the thruster and vehicle dynamics, which led to maneuver categorization into three regimes: Cruising, Docking, and Transition. The predicted frequency response was verified through hybrid simulation to be accurate for predicting general trends and cutoff frequency.

AB New autonomous driving technologies are emerging every day and some of them have been commercially applied in the real world. While benefiting from these technologies, autonomous trucks are facing new challenges in short-term maintenance planning, which directly influences the truck operator's profit. In this paper, we implement a vehicle health management system by addressing the maintenance planning issues of autonomous trucks on a transport mission. We also present a maintenance planning model using a risk-based decision-making method, which identifies the maintenance decision with minimal economic risk of the truck company. Both availability losses and maintenance costs are considered when evaluating the economic risk. We demonstrate the proposed model by numerical experiments illustrating real-world scenarios. In the experiments, compared to three baseline methods, the expected economic risk of the proposed method is reduced by up to 47%. We also conduct sensitivity analyses of different model parameters. The analyses show that the economic risk significantly decreases when the estimation accuracy of remaining useful life, the maximal allowed time of delivery delay before order cancellation, or the number of workshops increases. The experiment results contribute to identifying future research and development attentions of autonomous trucks from an economic perspective.

AB The situation of interest is where a vehicle is equipped with multiple sensors to measure the distance to the leading vehicle but does not need to obtain data from speed and acceleration sensors. The distance measurements are susceptible to asynchronous sampling and noise, nearly half of which may be manipulated by malicious attackers. In this situation, the event-triggered vehicle-following control problem of nonlinear autonomous vehicles with unknown parameters is studied. First, a secure event-triggered mechanism that can resist manipulation is devised to alleviate the burden of data transmission and processing caused by multiple sensors. Then, a novel adaptive sensor fusion algorithm is developed to estimate the actual distance. Subsequently, an improved adaptive observer is designed based on the event-triggered estimated distance to estimate continuous-time distance, velocity, acceleration, and system parameters. Finally, the following controller is designed using the estimated states and parameters with the help of Levant differentiators. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is validated through simulation studies. Note to Practitioners-This work aims to develop a secure following control method for nonlinear automated vehicles with unknown states and parameters, which can effectively handle sparse sensor problems caused by attacks, faults, saturation, etc. To address practical issues such as sampling intervals and limited computing and transmission resources, we propose a discrete sampling-event-triggered transmission-continuous estimation and control framework for continuous-time systems. Despite the presence of measurement interferences and potential corruption, the designed event-triggered mechanism and sensor fusion algorithm can be used to reduce data transmission and estimate the actual output, respectively. The designed adaptive observer can estimate continuous-time system states and parameters whether the output is obtained in a continuous, short-interval discrete or suitable event-triggered manner. This capability facilitates control design and real-time monitoring of vehicle states. Additionally, the presented backstepping control design and analysis method utilizing Levant differentiators can be applied in situations where the controlled system's states possess at least first-order differentiability.

AB Autonomous exploration in unknown environments is a fundamental task of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). To choose exploration goals wisely, we propose an information-driven exploration strategy by applying the fast marching method to exploration of UAVs. A frontier point detection algorithm is designed to obtain Candidate Goals (CGs) by utilizing the structural characteristics of the octree-based map. With the sum of the information gain during the exploration journey as an evaluation indicator, we present a novel utility function to evaluate CGs by considering the trade-off between information gain and travel consumption. Given the effect of the environment on UAVs, UAVs are required to march aggressively in the Euclidean Symbol Distance Field (ESDF) to calculate the flight time, which is defined as the travel consumption. The uncertainty of the environment is minimized gradually by maximizing the utility function during each exploration journey. To take full advantage of the mobility of UAVs, we perform B-spline trajectory optimization and yaw angle planning based on the fast marching paths. We conduct sufficient comparison and evaluation experiments in simulation environments. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed exploration strategy. The code related to the experiments will be published at https://github.com/BoLeiChen/fastmarching-exploration.

AB This paper proposes a real time control algorithm for autonomous operation of a quadrotor unmanned air vehicle. The quadrotor is a small agile vehicle, which as well as being a excellent test bed for advanced control techniques could also be suitable for internal surveillance, search and rescue and remote inspection. The proposed control scheme incorporates two key aspects of autonomy; trajectory planning and trajectory following. Using the differentially-flat dynamics property of the system, the trajectory optimization is posed as a non-linear constrained optimization within the output space in the virtual domain, not explicitly related to the time domain. A suitable parameterization using a virtual argument as opposed to time is applied, which ensures initial and terminal constraint satisfaction. The speed profile is optimized independently, followed by the mapping to the time domain achieved using a speed factor. Trajectory following is achieved with a standard multi-variable control technique and a digital switch is used to re-optimize the reference trajectory in the event of infeasibility or mission change. The paper includes simulations using a full dynamic model of the quadrotor demonstrating the suitability of the proposed control scheme.

AB Automated guided vehicle is the most important research issues for mobile robot development. The important research issue of the automated guided vehicle (AGV) is navigation system in recent years. Navigation system can be divided into self-localization, path planning and obstacle avoidance for indoor service execution. The application fields have security patrol or package delivery. Furthermore, recharging is necessary before the battery power has exhausted. The paper develops the automated guided vehicle that is designed and built with a 4WD mecanum wheel platform. Due to the laser ranger's high precision, we applied the laser range finder to achieve the environment map construction, so the self-localization via particles filter (PF) and the path planning algorithms can be utilized with the map. The practical motion and safety avoidance strategies are also proposed for robot motion control. Finally, the sensory fusion methods are also integrated with the laser ranger and RGB-D camera for automated guided vehicle while performing the docking process. The experimental results show the successful demonstrations of autonomous patrol and docking for self-recharging.

AB One of the primary challenges for autonomous robotics in uncertain and dynamic environments is planning and executing a collision-free path. Hybrid dynamic obstacles present an even greater challenge as the obstacles can change dynamics without warning and potentially invalidate paths. Artificial potential field (APF)-based techniques have shown great promise in successful path planning in highly dynamic environments due to their low cost at runtime. We utilize the APF framework for runtime planning but leverage a formal validation method, Stochastic Reachable (SR) sets, to generate accurate potential fields for moving obstacles. A small number of SR sets are computed a priori, then used to generate a potential field that represents the obstacle's stochastic motion for online path planning. Our method is novel and scales well with the number of obstacles, maintaining a relatively high probability of reaching the goal without collision, as compared to other traditional Gaussian APF methods. Here, we demonstrate our method with up to 900 hybrid dynamic obstacles and showthat it outperforms the traditional Gaussian APF method by up to 60% in the holonomic case and up to 20% in the unicycle case.

AB Automotive Ethernet enables high-bandwidth in-vehicle networking, facilitating the transmission of sensor data among electronic control units. However, the increasing connectivity and potential vulnerability inheritance in connected and autonomous vehicles expose them to security risks. To address this challenge, an intrusion detection system (IDS) capable of analyzing automotive Ethernet traffic and detecting anomalies is essential. In thisarticle, we propose automotive Ethernet real-time observer (AERO), an unsupervised network IDS designed to protect in-vehicle networks. AERO consists of three components: a feature extractor that constructs three multimodal features, a neural network for processing the extracted features, and an online anomaly detector that calculates outlier scores in real time. We evaluate the performance of AERO using the TOW-IDS automotive Ethernet intrusion dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that AERO achieves high detection performance across five different attack types and is highly applicable to automotive-grade devices for real-time anomaly detection.

AB Ethical thought experiments such as the trolley dilemma have been investigated extensively in the past, showing that humans act in utilitarian ways, trying to cause as little overall damage as possible. These trolley dilemmas have gained renewed attention over the past few years, especially due to the necessity of implementing moral decisions in autonomous driving vehicles (ADVs). We conducted a set of experiments in which participants experienced modified trolley dilemmas as drivers in virtual reality environments. Participants had to make decisions between driving in one of two lanes where different obstacles came into view. Eventually, the participants had to decide which of the objects they would crash into. Obstacles included a variety of human-like avatars of different ages and group sizes. Furthermore, the influence of sidewalks as potential safe harbors and a condition implicating self-sacrifice were tested. Results showed that participants, in general, decided in a utilitarian manner, sparing the highest number of avatars possible with a limited influence by the other variables. Derived from these findings, which are in line with the utilitarian approach in moral decision making, it will be argued for an obligatory ethics setting implemented in ADVs.

AB Vehicular networks have evolved from traditional vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications to the so-called Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which encompasses cloud computing and the Internet of Things. Thus, IoV creates novel scenarios and applications such as autonomous driving, as well as research challenges regarding the requirements for connected cars such as ultra-reliable low-latency, communications and the need for high processing power closer to vehicles. In order to address the above issues for IoV, this article proposes integrating state-of-the-art technology pillars that are well accepted by both industry and academia as building blocks for future 5G networks. We propose a flexible, hierarchical, and scalable IoV architecture that integrates software-defined networking, edge/fog computing, network function virtualization, and containers. We evaluate the proposal in both infrastructure-based and peer-to-peer content distribution scenarios. The results are promising and point out that the architecture can cope with the stringent requirements that need to be met in terms of latency for 5G-based IoV applications.

AB A novel conceptual design of hybrid-driven autonomous underwater glider (AUG) is proposed to help the AUG increase gliding speed. The twin hydrofoils of AUG will undergoes flapping motion, just like the fish fins or bird wings, when the AUG encounter severe sea conditions while remain stationary at other times. The motion parameters of flapping foil needs to be adjusted to satisfy the force balance condition thus the AUG may achieve cruise status under constant moving velocity. The numerical simulation has been conducted to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of current AUG by using of the immersed boundary method under different incoming velocities. The numerical result shows that there exists optimum dimensionless St number, as a combination of heaving amplitude, flapping frequency and incoming velocity, resulting in highest propulsive efficiency and there exists mutual linear relationship between three motion parameters. The vortex ring structures at the rear part of the AUG under three typical St numbers are also presented and discussed, proving qualitative explanation for the numerical results. The conclusion acquired in this study may provide technical guidance for the development of hybrid-driven unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV).

AB CAV (connected and autonomous vehicle) is a crucial part of intelligent transportation systems. CAVs utilize both sensors and communication components to make driving decisions. A large number of companies, research organizations, and governments have researched extensively on the development of CAVs. The increasing number of autonomous and connected functions however means that CAVs are exposed to more cyber security vulnerabilities. Unlike computer cyber security attacks, cyber attacks to CAVs could lead to not only information leakage but also physical damage. According to the UK CAV Cyber Security Principles, preventing CAVs from cyber security attacks need to be considered at the beginning of CAV development. In this paper, a large set of potential cyber attacks are collected and investigated from the aspects of target assets, risks, and consequences. Severity of each type of attacks is then analysed based on clearly defined new set of criteria. The levels of severity for the attacks can be categorized as critical, important, moderate, and minor. Mitigation methods including prevention, reduction, transference, acceptance, and contingency are then suggested. It is found that remote control, fake vision on cameras, hidden objects to LiDAR and Radar, spoofing attack to GNSS, and fake identity in cloud authority are the most dangerous and of the highest vulnerabilities in CAV cyber security.

AB In this paper, a large-scale dataset called the Iran Autonomous Driving Dataset (IADD) is presented, aiming to improve the generalization capability of the deep networks outside of their training domains. The IADD focuses on 2D object detection and contains more than 97,000 annotated images, covering six common object classes in the field of autonomous vehicles. To improve the generalization of the models, a wide variety of driving conditions and domains, including the city and suburban road settings, adverse weather conditions, and various traffic flows, are presented in the IADD images. The results of exhaustive evaluations conducted on several state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks reveal that not only the trained architectures have performed successfully on test data of the IADD, but also they have upheld high precision in the assessments of generalization capability. In order to challenge the models, broad range of simulations have been performed in the CARLA software environment; which due to the synthetic nature of the simulated images, severe domain shifts have been observed between the CARLA and the IADD. Also, the cross-domain evaluation results have confirmed the efficacy of the IADD in enhancing the generalization ability of the deep learning models. The dataset is available in: .

AB Objective: This study examined the impact of increasing automation replanning rates on operator performance and workload when supervising a decentralized network of heterogeneous unmanned vehicles. Background: Futuristic unmanned vehicles systems will invert the operator-to-vehicle ratio so that one operator can control multiple dissimilar vehicles connected through a decentralized network. Significant human-automation collaboration will be needed because of automation brittleness, but such collaboration could cause high workload. Method: Three increasing levels of replanning were tested on an existing multiple unmanned vehicle simulation environment that leverages decentralized algorithms for vehicle routing and task allocation in conjunction with human supervision. Results: Rapid replanning can cause high operator workload, ultimately resulting in poorer overall system performance. Poor performance was associated with a lack of operator consensus for when to accept the automation's suggested prompts for new plan consideration as well as negative attitudes toward unmanned aerial vehicles in general. Participants with video game experience tended to collaborate more with the automation, which resulted in better performance. Conclusion: In decentralized unmanned vehicle networks, operators who ignore the automation's requests for new plan consideration and impose rapid replans both increase their own workload and reduce the ability of the vehicle network to operate at its maximum capacity. Application: These findings have implications for personnel selection and training for futuristic systems involving human collaboration with decentralized algorithms embedded in networks of autonomous systems.

AB This study's objective was to design an intelligent underwater recognition system and apply it in an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for the recognition and tracking of underwater objects. The intelligent underwater recognition system predicted the depth map with the stereo matching algorithm based on semi-global block matching (SGBM) through the images of voyage records. It used the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning so that the agent may focus on the localization area of objects on the disparity map. Next, the intelligent underwater recognition system performed depth estimation according to the disparity map to obtain the stereo point clouds of the underwater object. After obtaining the depth information, the intelligent underwater recognition system constructed a deep network based on Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) to detect the underwater object. Eventually, the system was successfully verified by a series of diving-depth tracking experiments.

AB In the underwater environment, the ocean current will have a great influence on the anti-misalignment performance of the wireless power transfer (WPT) system for the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In this letter, a free-rotation WPT system with a new magnetic coupler for AUVs is proposed to improve the rotational and axial misalignment tolerance. The magnetic coupler has two decoupled transmitters and one segmented arc solenoid receiver with reversely wound adjacent receiver coils. The mutual inductances between the receiver and the two transmitters can compensate each other. Moreover, cooperated with the phase control between the two transmitters, the system can achieve more stable output power under the rotational and axial misalignment. A free-rotation WPT prototype was set up and the experimental results showed that the output power can reach 700 W and the output power fluctuation is below 5% based on the proposed anti-misalignment method.

AB This article explores the tension between the freedom a self-driving car offers and privacy considerations. Studies of the automobile's impact on the environment, public health, noise, planning, and development, as well as its appearance in, and inspiration of, popular culture are easy to find. In the field of communication, research on cars as a medium or as a site of communication often falls into the domain of mobilities, as defined by John Urry (2007). Mobilities consider not just the travel of people and objects through space, but also the imaginative, virtual, and communicative travel of messages between people and things. Julia Hildebrand (2017) notes the relationship of mobilities to media ecology and argues that we can understand the exploration of converging media and mobility entities as transportation-information-communication technologies. Furthermore, imaginaries of the autonomous car promote greater freedom for drivers while raising concerns with the necessity of increased connectivity. The automobile is a case for concern in communication studies, particularly around mobilities, privacy, autonomous vehicles, affordances issues of control, freedom, and privacy.

AB Owing to the hierarchical architecture of the derived model of the omni-direction autonomous ground vehicle (OD-AGV), the virtual desired trajectory (VDT) is first designed by the first switching surface, which is set as the linear dynamic pose error of the OD-AGV. In sequence, the trajectory tracking control (TTC) is designed by the second switching surface, which is the linear dynamic tracking error of the VDT. To deal with nonlinear time-varying uncertainties including system disturbance and different ground conditions, enhanced fuzzy second-order variable structure control (EF2VSC) is designed into both VDT and TTC. Finally, the experiments for tracking the circular trajectories with different curvatures, traveling velocities, and poses of the OD-AGV are presented to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed hierarchical enhancement using fuzzy second-order variable structure control (HEF2VSC).

AB Underwater object detection and recognition using computer vision are challenging tasks due to the poor light condition of submerged environments. For intervention missions requiring grasping and manipulation of submerged objects, a vision system must provide an Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) with object detection, localization and tracking capabilities. In this paper, we describe the integration of a vision system in the MARIS intervention AUV and its configuration for detecting cylindrical pipes, a typical artifact of interest in underwater operations. Pipe edges are tracked using an alpha-beta filter to achieve robustness and return a reliable pose estimation even in case of partial pipe visibility. Experiments in an outdoor water pool in different light conditions show that the adopted algorithmic approach allows detection of target pipes and provides a sufficiently accurate estimation of their pose even when they become partially visible, thereby supporting the AUV in several successful pipe grasping operations.

AB Before the task of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) was implemented actually, its semi-physical simulation system of pipeline tracking had been designed. This semi-physical simulation system was used to test the software logic, hardware architecture, data interface and reliability of the control system. To implement this system, the whole system plan, including interface computer and the methods of pipeline tracking, was described. Compared to numerical simulation, the semi-physical simulation was used to test the real software and hardware more veritably. In the semi-physical simulation system, tracking experiments of both straight lines and polygonal lines were carried out, considering the influence of ocean current and the situation of buried pipeline. The experimental results indicate that the AUV can do pipeline tracking task, when angles of pipeline are 15A degrees, 30A degrees, 45A degrees and 60A degrees. In the ocean current of 2 knots, AUV could track buried pipeline.

AB Underwater abnormal object detection is a current need for the navigation security of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In this paper, an automated gravity gradient tensor inversion algorithm is proposed for the purpose of passive underwater object detection. Full-tensor gravity gradient anomalies induced by an object in the partial area can be measured with the technique of gravity gradiometry on an AUV. Then the automated algorithm utilizes the anomalies, using the inverse method to estimate the mass and barycentre location of the arbitrary-shaped object. A few tests on simple synthetic models will be illustrated, in order to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of the new algorithm. Moreover, the method is applied to a complicated model of an abnormal object with gradiometer and AUV noise, and interference from a neighbouring illusive smaller object. In all cases tested, the estimated mass and barycentre location parameters are found to be in good agreement with the actual values.

AB In this paper, a time-delayed fractional order adaptive sliding mode control algorithm is proposed for a two-wheel self-balancing vehicle system. The closed-loop system is proved based on the Lyapunov-Razumikhin function. The switching function is designed to make the system robust when facing uncertainties and external disturbances. It is designed to avoid monotonically increasing gains and can handle state-dependent uncertainties without a prior bound. The two-wheel self-balancing vehicle used in the experiment consists of a gyroscope MPU-6050 and accelerometer, a motor driving circuit composed of a motor driving chip TB6612FNG, and STM32F103x8B that is selected as the control core. The experimental results show that the time-delayed fractional order adaptive sliding mode control algorithm can make the vehicle achieve autonomous balance and quickly restore its stable state while appropriate disturbance is introduced.

AB This paper presents the design of a new adaptive optimization-based second-order sliding mode control algorithm for uncertain nonlinear systems. It is designed on the basis of a second-order sliding mode control with optimal reaching, with the aim of reducing the control effort while maintaining all the positive aspects in terms of finite-time convergence and robustness in front of matched uncertainties. These features are beneficial to guarantee good performance in case of vehicle dynamics control, a crucial topic in the light of the increasing demand of semiautonomous and autonomous driving capabilities in commercial vehicles. The new proposal is theoretically analyzed, as well as verified relying on an extensive comparative study, carried out on a realistic simulator of a 4-wheeled vehicle, in the case of a lateral stability control system.

AB This study investigates the aerodynamic effects and the tracking control problem of quadrotor-type unmanned aerial vehicles. The authors first present the on-line identification of the aerodynamic parameters by using the recursive least squares algorithm based on the measurement outputs of the accelerometer. Then, the non-linear discrete-time trajectory tracking controllers with aerodynamic compensation have been designed. Through identifying and compensating the external aerodynamics on line, the simulation results show that the tracking performance has been enhanced, especially when the vehicle is in some flight envelopes where the aerodynamics have significant effects on the quadrotor dynamics, such as the large-acceleration flight regime.

This artificial lateral line system provides sensory information to be used in vehicle control algorithms, both to reduce model complexity and to measure hydrodynamic disturbances. The system presented in this paper is a modular implementation that can fit around a vehicle without requiring modifications to the hull. The design and manufacturing processes are presented in detail along with considerations for sensor placement and port spacing. An algorithm for calculating the hydrodynamic forces acting on the surface of a vehicle is derived and experimentally validated. An underwater motion capture system and strain sensors are used to calculate a reference hydrodynamic force that compares favorably with the hydrodynamic force calculated by the lateral line system.

AB To enhance the active safety and realize the autonomy of intelligent vehicle on highway curved road, a lane changing trajectory is planned and tracked for lane changing maneuver on curved road. The kinematics model of the intelligent vehicle with nonholonomic constraint feature and the tracking error model are established firstly. The longitudinal and lateral coupling and the difference of curvature radius between the outside and inside lane are taken into account, which is helpful to enhance the authenticity of desired lane changing trajectory on curved road. Then the trajectory tracking controller of closed-loop control structure is derived using integral backstepping method to construct a new virtual variable. The Lyapunov theory is applied to analyze the stability of the proposed tracking controller. Simulation results demonstrate that this controller can guarantee the convergences of both the relative position tracking errors and the position tracking synchronization.

ID CYCLIC PURSUIT
AB in cyclic pursuit a platoon of vehicles are coupled in a unidirectional ring at the interaction level according to some control scheme. In the paper, a new cyclic pursuit control law is proposed, where each vehicle's linear speed and angular speed are proportional to the projection of its prey's position on its forward direction and lateral direction respectively. Through these interactions a cooperative behavior emerges and vehicles in the platoon eventually move at a constant speed on a circle with constant inter-vehicle spacings. The control scheme ensures ultimate boundedness and leads to only two stable equilibrium polygons. This contrasts with other cyclic pursuit control schemes, where vehicles may diverge to infinity and there are more stable equilibrium polygons as the total number of vehicles increases. For this control scheme, ultimate boundedness is proved using the pseudo-linearization technique. Possible equilibrium polygons are analyzed and stability and convergence properties are established through root locus analysis of a complex characteristic polynomial. Design rules are discussed, showing how the radius of the circle they converge to is controlled by an appropriate choice of control parameters. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE localization; sensor fusion; autonomous driving
AB Localization is an important technology for autonomous driving. Map-matching using road surface pattern features gives accurate position estimation and has been used in autonomous driving tests on public roads. To provide highly safe autonomous driving, localization technology that is not affected by the environment is required. In particular, in snowy environments, the features of the road surface pattern may not be used for matching because the road surface is hidden. In such cases, it is necessary to construct a robust system by rejecting the matching results or making up for them with other sensors. On the other hand, millimeter-wave radar-based localization methods are not as accurate as LiDAR-based methods due to their ranging accuracy, but it has successfully achieved autonomous driving in snowy environments. Therefore, this paper proposes a localization method that combines LiDAR and millimeter-wave radar. We constructed a system that emphasizes LiDAR-based matching results during normal conditions when the road surface pattern is visible and emphasizes radar matching results when the road surface is not visible due to snow cover or other factors. This method achieves an accuracy that allows autonomous driving to continue regardless of normal or snowy conditions and more robust position estimation.

AB Automated vehicles require a comprehensive understanding of traffic situations to ensure safe and anticipatory driving. In this context, the prediction of pedestrians is particularly challenging as pedestrian behavior can be influenced by multiple factors. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze the requirements on pedestrian behavior prediction for automated driving via a system-level approach. To this end we investigate real-world pedestrian-vehicle interactions with human drivers. Based on human driving behavior we then derive appropriate reaction patterns of an automated vehicle and determine requirements for the prediction of pedestrians. This includes a novel metric tailored to measure prediction performance from a system-level perspective. The proposed metric is evaluated on a large-scale dataset comprising thousands of real-world pedestrian-vehicle interactions. We furthermore conduct an ablation study to evaluate the importance of different contextual cues and compare these results to ones obtained using established performance metrics for pedestrian prediction. Our results highlight the importance of a system-level approach to pedestrian behavior prediction.

AB This paper focuses on modeling mixed traffic flow that comprises human-driven vehicles (HV), adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles, and cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) vehicles in the off-ramp diverging area. The car-following behaviors of HVs, ACC vehicles, and CACC vehicles are modeled using an intelligent driver model (IDM), ACC car-following model, and CACC car-following model, respectively. The lane-changing behaviors of different types of vehicles in off-ramp diverging areas are modeled using the anticipatory lane change (ALC) model and the mandatory lane change (MLC) model. These models are important for describing the interaction among different types of vehicles in mixed traffic. The safety and efficiency of mixed traffic flow are analyzed by integrating the developed car-following models and lane-changing models in numerical simulation. A one-way, two-lane scenario is established for the simulation. The results reveal that when the proportion of CACC vehicles is about 0.6, the safety and general operating efficiency of mixed traffic flow in the off-ramp area deteriorate significantly. Increasing the conservative MLC zone length can improve the average speed of traffic flow. Guiding drivers in changing lanes is one way to improve the efficiency of traffic flow.

AB The article describes a method for automatically recognizing the target points of the trajectories of unmanned vehicles moving underwater, such as autonomous submarines and flying underwater vehicles of aircraft-like structures. The coordinate of the center of an object with radial symmetry properties is considered a terminal control point. A method for constructing a multiscale weighted image model based on the developed fast radial symmetry transformation and the Hough method is proposed, which ensures noise stability and high speed of calculating the coordinates of the desired point. When the object of interest has a contour of a specific color, a model is based on our proposed chromatic and weight components. As an example of detection, we have given an algorithm for detecting a base underwater station with light markers as a signal luminous ring.

AB We examined the acceptable risk of self-driving vehicles (SDVs) compared with that of human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and the psychological mechanisms influencing the decision-making regarding acceptable risk through 4 studies conducted in China and South Korea. Participants from both countries required SDVs to be 4-5 times as safe as HDVs (Studies 1 and 4). When an SDV and an HDV were manipulated to exhibit equivalent safety performance, participants' lower trust in the SDV, rather than the higher negative affect evoked by the SDV, accounted for their lower risk acceptance of the SDV (Studies 2 and 3). Both lower trust and higher negative affect accounted for why participants were less willing to ride in the SDV (Study 3). These reproducible findings improve the understanding of public assessment of acceptable risk of SDVs and offer insights for regulating SDVs.

AB We present a novel planning strategy which is applicable to high performance unmanned aerial vehicles. The proposed approach takes as input a 3-D sequence of way-points connected by straight flight trim conditions, and "smooths" it in an optimal way with the goal of making it compatible with the vehicle dynamics. The smoothing step is achieved by selecting appropriate sequences of alternating trims and maneuvers from within a precomputed library of motion primitives. The resulting extremal trajectory is compatible with the vehicle and therefore trackable with small errors; furthermore, it is guaranteed to stay within the flight envelope boundary, alleviating the need for flight envelope protection systems. Yet it can be computed in real-time using closed-form expressions, all nonlinearities due to the vehicle model being confined to the stored library of motion primitives. The new method is demonstrated for the aggressive maneuvering of a helicopter.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB The spread of smartphone applications, the negative social impacts of the private car or the potentially revolutionary effect of future autonomous vehicles, are contributing to the emergence of other hybrid mobility systems. Notably, companies like Uber or Lyft have successfully applied the classical dial-a-ride method, in which users are assigned to vehicles in such a way as to minimise the cost function under a set of constraints. In this paper, we construct an agent-based model based on vehicles where demand is assigned through aggregation by origin-destination pair. Two operating strategies are described: in the first, the pickup strategy is applied at vehicle level, in the second it is applied at global service level, with vehicles being shared dynamically and making extra stops to collect travellers with different destinations. At each iteration time, the set of possible options depending on itinerary and demand are tested first for already assigned vehicles then for free vehicles. The option associated with the maximum utility is selected to set the vehicle or service strategy. A case study illustrates a comparison between both strategies and evaluates the efficiency of several service choices. A service where vehicles are managed by a dispatcher is more efficient for both users and operator.

AB Vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has been indispensable for autonomous vehicles. However, in challenging environments, such as sparsely textured parking lots, the state-of-the-art methods often fail to obtain sufficiently reliable features for robust localization and consistent mapping. This paper proposes a multi-level visual information hierarchical fusion SLAM framework based on a multi-camera system. High-level features like object edges are extracted by different segmentation methods. With the guidance of high-level information, low-level key points are selected. The hierarchical fusion structure consists of two parts. High-level visual information is loosely fused with the wheel encoder to estimate initial data association. Then, low-level feature points of multiple views are tightly fused to facilitate robust localization. With such a structure, a consistent map can be built even under the condition that one view is lost. In addition, the lost view can be reinitialized in the single map with other information instead of waiting for re-localization or creating additional maps. Real-time experiments in autonomous parking scenario validate the robustness and consistency of the proposed method.

AB Accurate estimation of water quality is significant for ocean resource development. The autonomous discovery and intensive sampling of high chlorophyll-a concentration area is meaningful for early warning of algal blooms. In this article, an online path planning method with heterogeneous strategies and low-communication cooperation is proposed, and it is used for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) adaptive sampling. The environmental scalar field is modeled as a Gaussian process (GP), which is learned from the accumulated measurements gathered by the multi-AUV system equipped with sensors. The heterogeneous strategy cooperative sampling (HSCS) method is proposed, so that every AUV can plan its own path based on the newly designed differential evolution (DE)-based path planner. Meanwhile, the sparse variation GP (SVGP) is introduced to summarize local measurements, which endows AUVs to share information effectively with weak communication environment. Simulation experiments are carried out to test the performance of the proposed algorithms, and the simulation result shows that the proposed method can reduce the estimate error by at least 15.6% with limited communication, and the coverage integrity of the interesting region is guaranteed.

AB The goal of the present study is to examine the cognitive/affective physiological correlates of passenger travel experience in autonomously driven transportation systems. We investigated the social acceptance and cognitive aspects of self-driving technology by measuring physiological responses in real-world experimental settings using eye-tracking and EEG measures simultaneously on 38 volunteers. A typical test run included human-driven (Human) and Autonomous conditions in the same vehicle, in a safe environment. In the spectrum analysis of the eye-tracking data we found significant differences in the complex patterns of eye movements: the structure of movements of different magnitudes were less variable in the Autonomous drive condition. EEG data revealed less positive affectivity in the Autonomous condition compared to the human-driven condition while arousal did not differ between the two conditions. These preliminary findings reinforced our initial hypothesis that passenger experience in human and machine navigated conditions entail different physiological and psychological correlates, and those differences are accessible using state of the art in-world measurements. These useful dimensions of passenger experience may serve as a source of information both for the improvement and design of self-navigating technology and for market-related concerns.

AB This paper studies the willingness among Russia's population to try out three new transport technologies: electric cars, car-sharing, and autonomous driving. The assumption is that these three offerings will in the near future appear as autonomously driving vehicles booked on a subscription basis. Next to socio-economic parameters such as age, gender, place of living or holding a driver's licence, we introduce three measures: values of self-expression, attitudes to-wards science and technology and attitudes towards novelties in general to explain the likelihood to try out these transport innovations. Thereby, this paper increases the understanding of the preconditions that lead to wide-spread acceptance of transport innovations. An analysis of the psychological set-up of the respondents allowed for the identification of a group of enthusiasts that are excited to try out these new transportation offerings. We argue that application of such an approach deepens the understanding of social mechanisms behind technology adoption and can be useful for the identification of social groups that support related processes.

AB Autonomous multiagent systems can be used in different domains such as agriculture, search and rescue, and fire protection because they can accomplish large missions more quickly and robustly by dividing them into separate tasks. Using multiple agents introduces additional complexity, which makes autonomous reasoning and decision making more challenging, however. Because agents such as ground robots, unmanned air vehicles, and autonomous underwater vehicles may have limited computational resources, they may need computationally efficient yet powerful reasoning algorithms (decision-making processes that perform deliberation and means-end reasoning). Metareasoning, which is reasoning about these reasoning algorithms, offers a way to tackle these challenges by monitoring and controlling reasoning algorithms to improve agent and system performance. Although metareasoning approaches for individual computational agents have been studied, no survey of metareasoning in multiagent systems (MAS) has yet appeared. This survey fills the existing gap by discussing the multiagent metareasoning approaches that have been studied in the literature. It identifies metareasoning structures, applications of metareasoning to reasoning problems, and the modes (techniques) used to control reasoning processes. This survey contributes to the study of MAS by providing a framework for discussing multiagent metareasoning, highlighting successful approaches, and indicating areas where future work may be fruitful.

AB The data computing process is utilized in various areas such as autonomous driving. Autonomous vehicles are intended to detect and track nearby moving objects avoiding collisions and to navigate in complex situations, such as heavy traffic and dense pedestrian areas. Therefore, object tracking is the core technology in the environment perception systems of autonomous vehicles and requires the monitoring of surrounding objects and the prediction of the moving states of objects in real time. In this paper, a multiple object tracking method based on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data is proposed by using a Kalman filter and data computing process. We suppose that the movements of the tracking objects are captured consecutively as frames; thus, model-based detection and tracking of dynamic objects are possible. A Kalman filter is applied for predicting posterior state of tracking object based on anterior state of the tracking object. State denotes the positions, shapes, and sizes of objects. By computing the likelihood probability between predicted tracking objects and clusters which registered from tracking objects, the data association process of the tracking objects can be generated. Experimental results showed enhanced object tracking performance in a dynamic environment. The average matching probability of the tracking object was greater than 92.9%.

AB In this paper, a state-constrained optimal solution based real-time vehicle path planning strategy, which aids the vehicle to avoid collision by the lane change maneuver, is presented. More specifically, depending on the driving conditions, the path is generated by considering the elapsed time and the driver's ride quality. Especially, the path is planned based on the trajectory optimization theory (i.e., Pontryagin maximum principle), resulting in the analytical optimal solutions. Furthermore, to handle the state-constrained optimization problem that is considered to ensure the vehicle lateral stability, we include the punctual and isolated equality constraints in the formulated optimization problem, which can designate the state variables as the desired value at the intermediate time instants. Through the numerical examples on various driving conditions and high-fidelity model-based verification, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed path planner, and our approach can effectively generate a safe vehicle path rapidly, depending on the road surfaces and vehicle speeds.

AB Terrestrial infrastructure-based wireless networks do not always guarantee their resources will be shared uniformly by nodes in vehicular networks. This is due mainly to the uneven and dynamic geographical distribution of vehicles and path loss effects. In this paper, we leverage multiple fifth-generation (5G) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to enhance fairness in network resource allocation among vehicles by positioning UAVs on-demand as "flying communication infrastructure". We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to determine UAVs' position to improve network resource allocation fairness and efficiency while considering the UAVs' flying range, communication range, and energy constraints. We use a parametric fairness function to attain a number of resource allocation objectives ranging from maximizing the total throughput of vehicles, maximizing minimum throughput, and achieving proportional bandwidth allocation. Simulation results show that the proposed DRL approach to UAV positioning can improve network resource allocation according to the targeted fairness objective.

AB Currently, one of the trends in the automotive industry is to make vehicles as autonomous as possible. In particular, this concerns the implementation of complex and innovative self-diagnostic systems for cars. This paper proposes a new diagnostic algorithm that evaluates the performance of the drive shaft bearings of a road vehicle during use. The diagnostic parameter was selected based on vibration measurements and machine learning analysis results. The analyses included the use of more than a dozen time domain features of vibration signal in different frequency ranges. Upper limit values and down limit values of the diagnostic parameter were determined, based on which the vehicle user will receive information about impending wear and total bearing damage. Additionally, statistical verification of the developed model and validation of the results were performed.

AB Autonomous vehicles, AVs, as an emerging technology will contribute to fundamental changes in the transportation of cities. Medium-sized academic-dominated U.S. towns with cold winters and a large proportion of college students and employees are some of the regions with special travel patterns that may potentially contribute to a different perception of AVs. Using a stated preference survey in the two main universities in the Fargo-Moorhead area, perceived usefulness, perceived risk, and a winter-related variable defined as transportation safety improvement by AVs in inclement weather were simultaneously modeled. Given that the respondents agreed with the stated usefulness and risks of AVs, not being single was associated with an increased likelihood of agreeing with the winter-related variable for the respondents above 25. Low income households were associated with a 25% increase in the likelihood of agreeing with the winter-related variable for the respondents in the non-student model.

AB In this paper, a composite learning tracking control scheme is developed for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the presence of unknown dynamics and time-varying disturbances. Line-of-sight (LOS) tracking control is employed to handle the underactuation of AUVs. The unknown dynamics of the AUVs are approximated by adaptive neural networks (NNs). The serial-parallel estimation models are built to obtain the prediction errors. Both the prediction errors and the tracking errors are employed to design the composite weights updating law. Nonlinear disturbance observers based on composite learning control are constructed to estimate time-varying disturbances. The stability analysis via the Lyapunov method indicates that the uniformly ultimate boundedness of all signals of the AUV trajectory tracking close-loop control system. The simulation results on an AUV verify the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed composite learning tracking control scheme.

AB We report experimental observations of precipitable water vapor (PWV) derived using Global Positioning System/Global Navigation Satellite System (GPS/GNSS) receivers mounted on autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs), which were deployed in the tropical Pacific Ocean from July to September 2018. The GPS atmospheric delay was estimated by precise point positioning and converted to PWV with ASV surface meteorological data. The GPS-PWV was in agreement with the PWV obtained from radiosondes, with a root mean square error of 3.02 mm and a mean difference of 0.16 mm. A similar accuracy was found in a comparison of GPS-PWV with satellite-based microwave measurements. In anticipation of real-time monitoring applications, PWV was also estimated using real-time clock and orbit data. These estimates were in agreement with the post-processing values. High-resolution temporal observations of PWV over the open ocean made possible by ASV technology could greatly improve our understanding of the rapid variations of developing convective systems.

AB A tracking and positioning method achieved by integration of the super short baseline (SSBL) and inertial navigation system (INS) data for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is introduced. The proposed method uses a continuous acoustic signal as the response signal from the target AUV. The INS data obtained in the AUV is transmitted with the acoustic signal by the direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) technique and the SSBL estimation is achieved using the same signal. The error of the SSBL, particularly the influence of a multipath, was analyzed. The use of a continuous signal showed that the multipath is influential even if its level is small relative to the direct wave. This influence was observed under actual conditions in an ocean experiment in a deep-water area. The proposed method was confirmed to be available and useful by simulations and experimental results.

AB A control strategy for an autonomous pursuer is proposed in the reachability-based framework by using forward reachable sets (FRSs) to capture an evader vehicle time optimally. The FRS, which is a geometric representation of a vehicle's dynamic capability, allows the pursuers to determine if a single pursuer can capture the evader time optimally as well as to coordinate and maximize the chance of capturing the evader through the FRS coverage of multiple pursuers. The proposed strategy is then tested against the generic point-tracking (PT) algorithm in three different examples: (1) a single pursuer with sufficient manoeuvrability to capture an evader, (2) a single pursuer with significantly lower lateral manoeuvrability than the evader, and (3) multiple pursuers of the same manoeuvrability as in the second example. The numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed strategy over the PT algorithm when the pursuer has lower lateral manoeuvrability.

AB The hydrodynamic performance and the way to reduce the drag and increase the motion stability for a newly developed hovering autonomous underwater vehicle, a disk-shaped AUH (autonomous underwater helicopter), are investigated by computational fluid dynamics as well as pool and water-channel validation experiments. The hydrodynamic property is improved through local modification at the rear part of the original hull geometry (HG1), which results in a fore-aft asymmetric geometry (HG3). From the numerical simulation, it is found that with proper extension and sharpening at the rear part, separation of the boundary layer is delayed and the secondary flow area is effectively suppressed, which results in a remarkable reduction of the hydrodynamic drag as well as the drag and side force fluctuation. For the basic AUH hull, the temporal average drag of HG3 (65.3 N) is 26.5% lower than that of HG1 (88.9 N) at u = 2 m/s. The HG3 geometry also shows good stability against disturbance by the aquatic cabin attached at the central bottom, as well as propellers imbedded in the hull in a realistic working condition compared to the original geometry.

AB Numerous researches have been done to develop ASV (Autonomous Surface Vessel) collision avoidance systems. Most of the systems used static methods but did not apply a knowledge base where solutions can be reused and adapted to solve a new case. In this paper, an algorithm of autonomous collision avoidance is proposed considering steering dynamic for ASV. The process of this learning method is to recall the FCBR (Fuzzy Case Base Reasoning) containing basic expert knowledge in the form of stored cases. The solutions will be retrieved from the knowledge base to find a NH (New Heading) command for collision avoidance. Moreover, to execute the NH, a design of adaptive fuzzy ASV heading control system based on command filter is conducted considering the input saturation constraints and external disturbances. T-S fuzzy logic is employed to approximate nonlinear uncertainties existing in the heading control system adopting the MLP (Minimal Learning Parameter) technique. Finally, simulations prove that the method is effective to retrieve the past similar cases for the new collision avoidance situation and give its solution for ASV to track adjusted heading.

ID CYCLIC PURSUIT; MOBILE ROBOTS
AB In this paper, we examine the problem of how to achieve certain geometric formations among a group of identical mobile autonomous agents. Our particular view is that the subject of cooperative control involves: multiple autonomous agents, such as wheeled robot vehicles; a locally shared information structure; a control strategy that is somehow distributed among the agents; and a global task or desired goal for the group.
   Our specific approach is motivated by the historical development of cyclic pursuit problems in mathematics. We begin by examining a system of identical linear agents in the plane, a setup that was first proposed circa 1732. The pursuit strategy is particularly simple in that our n agents are ordered such that agent i pursues agent i + 1 modulo n. In the case of linear agents, we characterize the achievable formations and discuss whether collisions might occur between agents during reconfiguration. Next, we extend this notion to a system of wheeled vehicles, for which we use the unicycle as an example.
   The intention here is to illustrate how these ideas might work through descriptive arguments and simulation examples, without employing a rigorous theorem-proof format. For a more mathematically precise view, the reader is referred to related works by the authors [13, 14, 15, 16].

AB This study proposes an algorithm to save driving energy in an autonomous vehicle based on vehicle-to-vehicle technology. Saving the vehicular driving energy can be realized by reducing unnecessary deceleration and acceleration occurred in road congestion and by reducing the resistance caused by the internal factors of the vehicle. The algorithm proposed in this study defines cornering resistance, one of the internal resistance factors of a vehicle while driving, in terms of steering angle. Thereafter, the control inputs of a vehicle are adjusted to reduce the cornering resistance. In particular, because the target vehicle is to be a four-wheel independent drive vehicle, there are many control input values such as steering angle and yaw moment. To simultaneously obtain the desired driving performance and the minimized driving energy in such a vehicle environment, the control input values are optimally distributed by leveraging model predictive control (MPC). Moreover, a weighting factor for the MPC to yield appropriate control inputs is selected by considering the predefined cornering resistance. A simulation setup linked with CarSim-Simulink is established to verify the reduction of driving energy through the proposed algorithm. The simulation results evaluate the driving performance, driving safety, and energy-efficient driving in various driving scenarios.

ID ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; UNDERWATER VEHICLES; AUTOMATION
AB After the Cold War, the defense industries found themselves at a crossroads. However, it seems that they are gaining new momentum, as new technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence are enabling the development of autonomous, highly innovative and disruptive intelligent systems. Despite this new impetus, there are still doubts about where to invest limited financial resources to boost high-tech defense industries. In order to shed some light on the topic, we decided to conduct a systematic literature review by using the PRISMA protocol and content analysis. The results indicate that autonomous intelligent systems are being developed by the defense industry and categorized into three different modes-fully autonomous operations, partially autonomous operations, and smart autonomous decision-making. In addition, it is also important to note that, at a strategic level of war, there is limited room for automation given the need for human intervention. However, at the tactical level of war, there is a high probability of growth in industrial defense, since, at this level, structured decisions and complex analytical-cognitive tasks are carried out. In the light of carrying out those decisions and tasks, robotics and artificial intelligence can make a contribution far superior to that of human beings.

AB Robotics and autonomous systems are reshaping the world, changing healthcare, food production and biodiversity management. While they will play a fundamental role in delivering the UN Sustainable Development Goals, associated opportunities and threats are yet to be considered systematically. We report on a horizon scan evaluating robotics and autonomous systems impact on all Sustainable Development Goals, involving 102 experts from around the world. Robotics and autonomous systems are likely to transform how the Sustainable Development Goals are achieved, through replacing and supporting human activities, fostering innovation, enhancing remote access and improving monitoring. Emerging threats relate to reinforcing inequalities, exacerbating environmental change, diverting resources from tried-and-tested solutions and reducing freedom and privacy through inadequate governance. Although predicting future impacts of robotics and autonomous systems on the Sustainable Development Goals is difficult, thoroughly examining technological developments early is essential to prevent unintended detrimental consequences. Additionally, robotics and autonomous systems should be considered explicitly when developing future iterations of the Sustainable Development Goals to avoid reversing progress or exacerbating inequalities.
   A horizon scan was used to explore possible impacts of robotics and automated systems on achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Positive effects are likely. Iterative regulatory processes and continued dialogue could help avoid environmental damages and increases in inequality.

ID ALLOCATION
AB Safe and accurate landing is crucial for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, it is a challenging task, especially when the altitude of the landing target is different from the ground and when the UAV is working in adverse environments, such as coasts where winds are usually strong and changing rapidly. UAVs controlled by traditional landing algorithms are unable to deal with sudden large disturbances, such as gusts, during the landing process. In this paper, a reliable vision-based landing strategy is proposed for UAV autonomous landing on a multi-level platform mounted on an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV). With the proposed landing strategy, visual detection can be retrieved even with strong gusts and the UAV is able to achieve robust landing accuracy in a challenging platform with complex ground effects. The effectiveness of the landing algorithm is verified through real-world flight tests. Experimental results in farm fields demonstrate the proposed method's accuracy and robustness to external disturbances (e.g., wind gusts).

ID VALIDATION
AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are a key transportation technology of the future and will be integral to smart cities. An increased understanding of user adoption is necessary to promote AV usage. This study applied an integrated model based on innovation diffusion theory (IDT) and the technology acceptance model (TAM) to examine the factors influencing a user's behavioural intention to use AVs. Then, a questionnaire was designed, and structural equation analysis was conducted on the 274 collected survey results. Results confirmed previous research findings that perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) positively influence users' behavioural intention to use AVs. Moreover, the results revealed new findings that both PU and PEOU were influenced by the perceived characteristics of innovation (PCIs, i.e. relative advantage, compatibility, image, result demonstrability, visibility, and trialability). These findings contribute to theory building concerning human-computer interactions and guide policy and strategy formulation for promoting AVs.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MARITIME ENGINEERING

DT Article
ID BOUNDARY-LAYER; BODY
AB Design of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) met the opposite challenges. Their achievable route can be enhanced with drag reduction due to an increase of AUV slenderness. However, blunt short AUV have others operational advantages. The possibility to design low-drag bodies for Reynolds numbers employed by contemporary AUV (2X10(6)<Re<10(7)) is based on a combination of known facts. First, blunt bodies experience a drag crisis associated with laminar-turbulent transition in their boundary layers and some boundary layer suction additionally reduces their drag. Second, the transition can be delayed till much higher Re for bodies without adverse pressure gradients over their forward and medium parts. Suction on sterns of such bodies allows for the very substantial drag reduction. Several body shapes with distributed suction with extremely low slenderness (L/B<1.5) are presented. Their drag coefficients are between 0.007 and 0.02, whereas for ellipsoid of the same slenderness it exceeds 0.08.

AB Based on the study of decoupled dynamics characteristics of the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), A Distributed Parallel Motion Control system (DPMC) merged with distributed control and field bus technology for multi-thruster AUV was presented in this paper. It acts based on the distributed parallel hardware architecture and decoupled control algorithm for easy implementation, and then the sliding-mode control (SMC) had been presented for system control due to its robustness. Simulation experiments were conducted to verify the proposed control algorithms. Compared with the PID controllers, the system performances, including the stability and robustness, had been improved obviously by the SMC. It's suitable for such high nonlinear, dynamics and disturbed systems as AUVs. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the whole control system, sea tests had been carried out also; both simulation and experimental results show the proposed system and controller can work effectively and efficiently.

AB Determining the trajectories of all vehicles on freeways is a challenging yet critical topic as trajectories reflect the characteristics of traffic flow and serve as a good basis for traffic management and control. With the advances of mobile sensing technology, connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) as a new source of probe car can provide high-resolution sampled trajectory data. Furthermore, as CAVs sense the surrounding traffic situation, they can offer information to understand the vehicle motions around them. Utilizing the data from CAVs thus supports the trajectory reconstruction of fully-sampled traffic flow and enables sophisticated evaluation of traffic states. This study develops a CAV detection data-based trajectory reconstruction method for freeway traffic. First, the intelligent driver model (IDM) is used to judge the motion of undetected human-driven vehicles (HV) between trajectories. The undetected vehicles will be inserted in traffic flow with the position and speed estimated by a modified IDM model. Subsequently, the complete trajectories of the inserted HVs will be reconstructed by IDM. Last, the validity of the method is verified by both simulation and empirical experiments. The results demonstrate the proposed method enables sufficient reconstruction of vehicle trajectories under different traffic densities and penetration rates of CAVs.

AB Wireless power transfer technology is essential for autonomous electric vehicles. Electric vehicles demand increasingly higher power outputs. Therefore, it is necessary to study the harmfulness of human body exposure to electromagnetic waves generated in a wireless power transfer system. This study provides exposure assessment for a 20-kW wireless power transfer for electric vehicles. The electromagnetic field distribution of a 20-kW wireless power transfer system is analyzed for the two cases where the transmitting and receiving pads are aligned with the small gap and not aligned with the large gap, and compared with the results of the experimental measurements. Moreover, when the system (not aligned with the large gap) is installed in an electric vehicle, analysis of the exposure is carried out. Finally, dosimetry is performed on the exposure scenario in which the human body is placed around the vehicle, and the induced values inside the human body are compared with the internation guidelines. As a result, the induced values exceed the basic restrictions for the fat and the muscle of the human body, but not for the central nervous system.

AB Connected vehicle (CV) technologies are changing the form of traditional traffic models. In the CV driving environment, abundant and accurate information is available to vehicles, promoting the development of control strategies and models. Under these circumstances, this paper proposes a bidirectional vehicles information structure (BDVIS) by making use of the acceleration information of one preceding vehicle and one following vehicle to improve the car-following models. Then, we deduced the derived multiple vehicles information structure (DMVIS), including historical movement information of multiple vehicles, without the acceleration information. Next, the paper embeds the four kinds of basic car-following models into the framework to investigate the stability condition of two structures under the small perturbation of traffic flow and explored traffic response properties with different proportions of forward-looking or backward-looking terms. Under the open boundary condition, simulations on a single lane are conducted to validate the theoretical analysis. The results indicated that BDVIS and the DMVIS perform better than the original car-following model in improving the traffic flow stability, but that they have their own advantages for differently positioned vehicles in the platoon. Moreover, increasing the proportions of the preceding and following vehicles presents a benefit to stability, but if traffic is stable, an increase in any of the parameters would extend the influence time, which reveals that neither beta(1) or beta(2) is the biggest the best for the traffic.

AB Ship autonomous navigation constitutes the most critical step in intelligent ships and is the major prerequisite for the all task completion of the marine autonomous surface ship (MASS). Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely used in unmanned transport vehicles because of its excellent performance in solving continuous handling problems. This study proposes a MASS autonomous navigation system using dueling deep Q networks prioritized replay (Dueling-DQNPR) based on the ship automatic identification system (AIS) big data. A navigation environment with three difficulty levels were established to train the Dueling-DQNPR network in sequence by setting a reward mechanism. Moreover, the Dueling-DQNPR was improved by combining the prioritized experience replay, dueling structure and long-short-term memory unit to increase the network depth and ability to process continuous data. Finally, simulation training for the AIS trajectory data was carried out in waters near Zhoushan port. The results demonstrated that, through trial and error, the MASS could be controlled to arrive at its destination without collision. As a result, the proposed method may be applicable to MASS on-duty technology and intelligent ships.

AB In recent years, unmanned surface vehicles have been widely used in various applications from military to civil domains. Seaports are crowded and ship accidents have increased. Thus, collision accidents occur frequently mainly due to human errors even though international regulations for preventing collisions at seas (COLREGs) have been established. In this paper, we propose a real-time obstacle avoidance algorithm for multiple autonomous surface vehicles based on constrained convex optimization. The proposed method is simple and fast in its implementation, and the solution converges to the optimal decision. The algorithm is combined with the PD-feedback linearization controller to track the generated path and to reach the target safely. Forces and azimuth angles are efficiently distributed using a control allocation technique. To show the effectiveness of the proposed collision-free path-planning algorithm, numerical simulations are performed.

ID ENVIRONMENTS; SIMULATION
AB Compared with open waters, congested inland waters have narrow waterways, many river-crossing bridges, a high density of navigation, and high current velocity in some sections. In this study, an improved collision avoidance algorithm based on model predictive control (MPC) is proposed to solve the problem of collision avoidance for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) in congested inland waters. First, considering the influence of current, the collision avoidance problem of ASVs is transformed into a nonlinear programming problem, and the kinematics of ASVs and the boundary of the channel are regarded as its inequality constraints. Next, since ASVs cannot perform large-scale collision avoidance in congested inland waters, the strategy of reducing the speed and slightly changing the yaw angle is adopted to realize collision avoidance. Then, an improved dynamic bumper model is used to model the safe zone of ASVs and dynamic obstacles, which improves the efficiency of the algorithm and the safety of ASVs. Finally, the collision avoidance rules and the evaluation function of the collision avoidance maneuver are constructed in the cost function of the algorithm. The simulation experiments in different encounter scenarios show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the rationality and compliance of ASVs' autonomous collision avoidance in congested inland waters.

AB Combined Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV) and remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROV) inspection and intervention systems can contribute to future asset management of offshore renewable energy. This paper presents the design and performance of the winch system which couples the ASV and ROV and deploys/recovers the ROV. The hydrodynamic models and control algorithms are developed and solved with analytical and numerical approaches. The winch performance needs to meet a range of operational profiles, including i) ASV following/ not following the ROV ii) winch operating in speed control iii) winch operating in tension control iv) varying ROV distance and depths targets. For a representative ASV/ROV configuration, the work determines the required umbilical length for different ROV targets and suitable winch speeds. The results show that the strategy where the ASV follows the ROV can reduce the umbilical tension, but conditions of compression should be carefully managed. The umbilical tension can also be decreased by tension control and shows to be very effective in larger sea states. This study also models the accidental limit case, where a malfunctioning ROV is recovered. The estimated increase of umbilical tension during the recovery stage of a malfunctioning ROV can thus be incorporated into the design calculations.

ID SOUND SOURCES; NOISE; ALGORITHM
AB Ears are responsible for the sense of hearing, which is indispensable for a human to understand the environment. It is similar to an intelligent vehicle where acoustical data contains useful and valuable information to comprehend the environment to enable autonomous driving. One important application of acoustical data processing is to localize sound sources. However, due to the complexity of microphone array setup and the unstable localization performance against noises, few research articles tried to localize surrounding vehicles based on on-board microphone arrays. The main contribution is the first implementation to combine roof-mounted microphones and high definition maps as vehicle' s ears for online 3D localization of surround vehicles. This article designed a six-microphones sensor array dedicated to the on-board application and improved sound source localization algorithms using the observer technique to adapt to dynamic driving scenarios. A map-based localization enhancement method is also proposed to make the system more robust to noises and model errors. Feasibility tests are conducted with real vehicles in the scenarios of pass-by and overtaking. Experimental results validate the feasibility of using microphones to localize surrounding vehicles with lane-level accuracy.

ID TIME
AB The robustness of signal temporal logic not only assesses whether a signal adheres to a specification but also provides a measure of how much a formula is fulfilled or violated. The calculation of robustness is based on evaluating the robustness of underlying predicates. However, the robustness of predicates is usually defined in a model-free way, i.e., without including the system dynamics. Moreover, it is often nontrivial to define the robustness of complicated predicates precisely. To address these issues, we propose a notion of model predictive robustness, which provides a more systematic way of evaluating robustness compared to previous approaches by considering model-based predictions. In particular, we use Gaussian process regression to learn the robustness based on precomputed predictions so that robustness values can be efficiently computed online. We evaluate our approach for the use case of autonomous driving with predicates used in formalized traffic rules on a recorded dataset, which highlights the advantage of our approach compared to traditional approaches in terms of precision. By incorporating our robustness definitions into a trajectory planner, autonomous vehicles obey traffic rules more robustly than human drivers in the dataset.

ID DOCKING
AB Autonomous docking guidance is one of the key technologies to achieve the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) docking with the sub-sea docking station (DS) to realize long-term resident operation. In the process of AUV docking, the combination of long-distance acoustic guidance based on acoustic sensor and terminal visual guidance based on camera is often adopted. However, affected by the accuracy of the navigation sensor and acoustic positioning sensor carried by AUV, as well as the ocean current, AUV cannot accurately know its own position and the position of the DS, resulting in a large acoustic guidance error and the inability to enter the visual guidance stage with a reasonable deviation, thus leading to the docking failure. In this article, an improved FastSLAM algorithm is proposed to estimate the position of AUV and DS simultaneously. The positioning accuracy of traditional FastSLAM algorithm is affected by such factors as the estimation accuracy of the statistical characteristics of process noise. An improved algorithm for FastSLAM based on fuzzy Q-learning is proposed. The homing path is planned based on the Dubins theory. The path is tracked by line-of-sight guidance. The results of matlab simulation and experimental data analyzing of the portable AUV are applied to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

DE Occupancy grids; Probabilistic model; Lane changing assistance; TP391
AB Lane changing assistance in autonomous vehicles is a popular research topic. Scene modeling of the driving area is a prerequisite for lane changing decision problems. A road environment representation method based on a dynamic occupancy grid is proposed in this study. The model encapsulates the data such as vehicle speed, obstacles, lane lines, and traffic rules into a form of spatial drivability probability. This information is compiled into a hash table, and the grid map is mapped into a hash map by means of hash function. A vehicle behavior decision cost equation is established with the model to help drivers make accurate vehicle lane changing decisions based on the principle of least cost, while considering influencing factors such as vehicle drivability, safety, and power. The feasibility of the lane changing assistance strategy is verified through vehicle tests, and the results show that the lane changing assistance system based on a probabilistic model of dynamic occupancy grids can provide lane changing assistance to drivers taking into consideration the dynamics and safety.

DE Automated vehicles; liability; ADAS; foreseeability
AB Recently, many scholars have explored the legal challenges likely to be posed by introduction of automated and autonomous vehicles. Minimal attention has focused on the legal implications of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in vehicles already currently available. These can warn of external dangers, monitor driver behavior and control how a vehicle brakes, accelerates, maintains speed or position on the road. The dynamic driving task is no longer reliant simply on the physical interaction of human driver with that vehicle. Instead, the vehicle may act apart from human direction as it senses other objects in the immediate environment or monitors the human driver's behavior or biometrics. These technological tools, which reduce the opportunity for human error, can be described as augmenting human driving capacity. Increases in safety promised by ADAS, arguably already evidenced by data, may require a reassessment of the risks posed by 'un-augmented' human drivers, what is now foreseeable given the data generated by ADAS and wearable driver-monitoring technology, and whether 'un-augmented' driving is any longer a reasonable response to that risk.

AB This paper proposes a new angle on the relationship between ownership models of automated vehicles and implications for travel. Specifically, the paper speculates on the potential negative externalities of corporate ownership. It argues that corporate ownership may prolong trips in order to maximise returns on capital and to take advantage of passengers' in-vehicle attention. Corporate owners are expected to generate revenue from providing passengers with personalised content, by providing car-immersive entertainment services and prolonging trips. The paper argues that corporate owners will have important stakes in the "attention economy": a fast-growing industry with an explicit interest in harvesting persons' attention through digital content, and repurposing it for financial gain. One of the consequences of corporate ownership introducing such incentives into transport schemes is that congestion may worsen, because the corporate owner can generate potential revenue from prolonging travel time. This would work against the goals of reducing travel time for passengers and engendering more sustainable transport. In addition, there may be other negative externalities from corporate ownership with stakes in the attention economy: a reduction in positive utility due to reduction in the ability to convert travel time to productive time; a reduction in human well-being, and widening of social injustice. Given that the attention economy is in the business of capturing persons' attention, this will make it difficult to convert travel time into productive time, since it will become harder for the passenger to disengage from tailored digital targeting. In addition, in-vehicle experience, combined with the hold that the attention economy will have on passengers, reduces the potential of developing and exercising our human capacities, which is crucial for well-being. Finally, subscription plans that will offer the ability to opt-out from personalised targeting may create social injustice insofar as some people will be able to afford opting-out, while others will not. The upshot is that corporate interests need to be taken into account in assessing the implications of automated vehicles on travel, and regulatory mechanisms to anticipate and correct for these externalities are timely.

ID SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS; TRAFFIC FLOW; SAFETY
AB In order to further study the expansion characteristics of left-turning non-motorized vehicles at intersections and the relationship between expansion characteristics and vehicle-bicycle conflicts, the trajectory point data of left-turning non-motorized vehicles are extracted using video trajectory tracking technology, and construct the cubic curve expansion envelope equation with the highest fitting degree. For the purpose of quantifying the expansion degree of non-motor vehicles after starting, two intersections in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region were selected for case analysis, and the numerical range of expansion degree of the intersection with a left-turn waiting area and the intersection without a left-turn waiting area was obtained. Study the mathematical relationship between the expansion degree and its influencing factors, and establish the multivariate nonlinear regression equation between the expansion degree and the left-turn non-motorized vehicle flow, the number of parallel non-motorized vehicles, and the left-turn green light time. Analyze the vehicle-bicycle conflicts caused by the expansion of left-turning non-motorized vehicles, determine the essential factors affecting the number of non-motorized vehicles, and establish the multiple linear regression equation between the number of non-motorized vehicles and the number of left-turning non-motorized vehicles, the expansion degree, and the number of parallel non-motorized vehicles, the results show that the model has high accuracy. By analyzing the expansion characteristics of left-turning non-motorized vehicles at intersections, the relationship between different influencing factors and the expansion degree is obtained. Then the vehicle-bicycle conflicts under the influence of expansion characteristics is analyzed, providing theoretical ideas for improving traffic efficiency and optimizing traffic organization at intersections.

AB As an autonomous mobile robot, the unmanned intelligent vehicle is often installed with sensors to collect the road environment information, and then process the information and control the speed and steering. In this study, vehicle-mounted camera, laser scanning radar and other sensors were equipped to collect real-time environmental information to efficiently process and accurately detect the specific location and shape of the obstacle. This study then investigated the impact of two In-Vehicle Information Systems (IVISS) on both usability and driving safety. Besides, the laser perception sensing technology was applied to transmit the information of the surrounding around the real-time driving area to the vehicle system. Simulating vehicle checkerboard and hierarchical IVIS interface layouts, we also examined their usability based on task completion time, error rate, NASA-TLX, and System Usability Scale (SUS). It was suggested that the results offer a supporting evidence for further design of IVIS interface.

ID NAVIGATION SYSTEM
AB This paper proposes a novel design for the localization system of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) using acoustic signals. The solution presented exploits models based on kernel functions with two main purposes: 1) to reject outliers; and 2) to correct or improve accuracy of measurements. The localization system discussed is based on well-established techniques such as support vector data description (SVDD) and autoassociative kernel regression (AAKR) derived from machine learning theory that utilizes heuristic models for classification and regression tasks, respectively. By coupling the algorithm to the navigation system, we seek to reduce the sensitivity of the localization scheme to the reflected acoustic waves or fluctuations of underwater channel properties without modifying the solution used for data fusion or overloading the algorithm embedded in the vehicle. Data collected in the field with a light underwater vehicle (LAUV) were used to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach.

AB The Draper Laboratory Vorticity Control Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (VCUUV) is the first mission-scale, autonomous underwater vehicle that uses vorticity control propulsion and maneuvering. Built as a research platform with which to study the energetics and maneuvering performance of fish-swimming propulsion, the VCUUV is a self-contained free swimming research vehicle which follows the morphology and kinematics of a yellowfin tuna. The forward half of the vehicle is comprised of a rigid hull which houses batteries, electronics, ballast and hydraulic power unit. The aft section is a freely flooded articulated robot tail which is terminated with a Innate caudal fin. Utilizing experimentally optimized body and tail kinematics from the MIT RoboTuna, the VCUUV has demonstrated stable steady swimming speeds up to 1.2 m/sec and aggressive maneuvering trajectories with turning rates up to 75 degrees per second. This paper summarizes the vehicle maneuvering and stability performance observed in field trials. and compares the results to predicted performance using theoretical and empirical techniques.

AB Connectionist artificial intelligence (AI) can power many critical tasks for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). However, connectionist AI lacks interpretability and usually needs large amount of data for learning. A Markov logic network (MLN), which combines first-order logic (FOL) with statistical learning, learns weighted FOL formulas for inference. MLNs can incorporate domain expert knowledge in the form of FOL formulas to achieve data-efficient learning and transparent decision process. In this paper, we propose a hybrid driving decision-making system, which integrates a MLN module and a deep Q-network (DQN) for enhanced driving safety. The MLN module evaluates the safety of ranked actions from DQN to reduce potential collisions. A collective MLN (Co-MLN) learning algorithm is proposed and it enables CAVs collectively learn a global MLN model for safe state transitions, given distributed small amount of noisy data. A hybrid DQN-MLN learning algorithm is also developed for CAVs to collectively learn to drive in new driving environments. Simulations performed using a highway driving simulator show that the proposed Co-MLN algorithm is highly data-efficient and the learned hybrid driving system can effectively reduce collisions. In addition, the learned MLN module provides transparency for safety-critical driving decisions.

AB The development of light detection and ranging (lidar) technology began in the 1960s, following the invention of the laser, which represents the central component of this system, integrating laser scanning with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and Global Positioning System (GPS). Lidar technology is spreading to many different areas of application, from those in autonomous vehicles for road detection and object recognition, to those in the maritime sector, including object detection for autonomous navigation, monitoring ocean ecosystems, mapping coastal areas, and other diverse applications. This paper presents lidar system technology and reviews its application in the modern road transportation and maritime sector. Some of the better-known lidar systems for practical applications, on which current commercial models are based, are presented, and their advantages and disadvantages are described and analyzed. Moreover, current challenges and future trends of application are discussed. This paper also provides a systematic review of recent scientific research on the application of lidar system technology and the corresponding computational algorithms for data analysis, mainly focusing on deep learning algorithms, in the modern road transportation and maritime sector, based on an extensive analysis of the available scientific literature.

AB Autonomous Driving Vehicle (ADV) services have become a prominent motif in intelligent vehicle technology by adapting deep learning features. Automated driverless services are a hercules task due to the dynamic driving environment and the performance is deliberately reliant on the quality of data fusion from sensors. Therefore, considering advanced 3D LiDAR sensors is essential to measure the surrounding with 360 degrees coverage. However, accomplishing maximum autonomy is the main challenge because of debilitated and complex driving environmenst. Deep Learning (DL) based models potentially impact surrounding measures for object detection, classification, and tracking. This study describes the importance of DL-LiDAR strategies to formulate ADV research challenges followed by a comprehensive analysis of Semantic Segmentation, Data Fusion, Data Representation, Feature Extraction, Dynamic Object Detection, and Autonomous Driving-Multi-Objective Tracking mechanisms. Unlike existing review papers, we examine various deep learning influenced approaches and describe their precarious measurements. Also, we analyze the impact of systematic methods based on open-source data sets for objectx (x=classification, localization, tracking) consolidation. Most of the summaries confine scalability, and feasibility of DL techniques in ADV to accomplish an intelligent driving system without human interference. Open research problems are discussed in the last section of the article.

AB Agreement technologies refer to a novel paradigm for the construction of distributed intelligent systems, where autonomous software agents negotiate to reach agreements on behalf of their human users. Smart Cities are a key application domain for agreement technologies. While several proofs of concept and prototypes exist, such systems are still far from ready for being deployed in the real-world. In this paper we focus on a novel method for managing elements of smart road infrastructures of the future, namely the case of auction-based road intersections. We show that, even though the key technological elements for such methods are already available, there are multiple non-technical issues that need to be tackled before they can be applied in practice. For this purpose, we analyse legal and ethical implications of auction-based road intersections in the context of international regulations and from the standpoint of the Spanish legislation. From this exercise, we extract a set of required modifications, of both technical and legal nature, which need to be addressed so as to pave the way for the potential real-world deployment of such systems in a future that may not be too far away.

AB Profiting from its remarkable maneuverability and efficiency, the four-wheeled autonomous mobile robot (FAMR) is appealing for intelligent manufacturing and automation applications. However, the suppression of unknown disturbances and system uncertainties remains a challenge for formulating a precise trajectory-tracking control scheme. This paper achieves the anti-disturbance direct yaw moment control of a developed FAMR by proposing a robust super-twisting sliding mode controller (RSSMC) to enhance the dynamic tracking and disturbance rejection property simultaneously. One of the major contributions is that the presented RSSMC method is constructed with a novel reaching law to eliminate the matched perturbations and time-varying lumped disturbances. As another distinguishing feature, this method is capable of driving the resultant FAMR trajectory into a bounded switching region and maintaining it therein for subsequent periods in finite time. To guarantee the closed-loop stability and finite-time convergence, new sufficient conditions for specifying the variable gains are determined utilizing Lyapunov functions. Finally, under the direct yaw moment control framework, simulation experiments of a developed FAMR system are offered to verify the practicability of the RSSMC scheme.

AB Online multi-object tracking (MOT) has broad applications in time-critical video analysis scenarios such as advanced driver-assistance systems (ADASs) and autonomous driving. In this paper, the proposed system aims at tracking multiple vehicles in the front view of an onboard monocular camera. The vehicle detection probes are customized to generate high precision detection, which plays a basic role in the following tracking-by-detection method. A novel Siamese network with a spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) layer is applied to calculate pairwise appearance similarity. The motion model captured from the refined bounding box provides the relative movements and aspects. The online-learned policy treats each tracking period as a Markov decision process (MDP) to maintain long-term, robust tracking. The proposed method is validated in a moving vehicle with an onboard NVIDIA Jetson TX2 and returns real-time speeds. Compared with other methods on KITTI and self-collected datasets, our method achieves significant performance in terms of the Mostly-tracked, Fragmentation, and ID switch variables.

ID BUOYANCY
AB HAISHEN is a long-ranged and highly maneuverable AUV which has two operating modes: glider mode and flapping-foil propulsion mode. As part of the vehicle development, a three-dimensional mathematical model of the conceptual vehicle was developed on the assumption that HAISHEN has a rigid body with two independently controlled oscillating hydrofoils. A flapping-foil model was developed based on the work done by Georgiades et al. (2009). Effect of controllable hydrofoils on the vehicle stable motion performance was studied theoretically. Finally, a dynamics simulation of the vehicle in both operating modes is created in this paper. The simulation demonstrates that: (1) in the glider mode, owing to the independent control of the pitch angle of each hydrofoil, HAISHEN travels faster and more efficiently and has a smaller turning radius than conventional fix-winged gliders; (2) in the flapping-foil propulsion mode, HAISHEN has a high maneuverability with a turning radius smaller than 15 m and a forward motion velocity about 1.8 m/s; (3) the vehicle is stable under all expected operating conditions.

AB Vehicle tailgating or simply tailgating is a hazardous driving habit. Tailgating occurs when a vehicle moves very close behind another one while not leaving adequate separation distance in case the vehicle in front stops unexpectedly; this separation distance is technically called "Assured Clear Distance Ahead" (ACDA) or Safe Driving Distance. Advancements in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) have made it of tremendous significance to have an intelligent approach for connected vehicles to avoid tailgating; this paper proposes a new Internet of Vehicles (IoV) based technique that enables connected vehicles to determine ACDA or Safe Driving Distance and Safe Driving Speed to avoid a forward collision. The technique assumes two cases: In the first case, the vehicle has Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) system, while in the second case, the vehicle has no AEB. Safe Driving Distance and Safe Driving Speed are calculated under several variables. Experimental results show that Safe Driving Distance and Safe Driving Speed depend on several parameters such as weight of the vehicle, tires status, length of the vehicle, speed of the vehicle, type of road (snowy asphalt, wet asphalt, or dry asphalt or icy road) and the weather condition (clear or foggy). The study found that the technique is effective in calculating Safe Driving Distance, thereby resulting in forward collision avoidance by connected vehicles and maximizing road utilization by dynamically enforcing the minimum required safe separating gap as a function of the current values of the affecting parameters, including the speed of the surrounding vehicles, the road condition, and the weather condition.

AB This study examines the willingness of a sample of 526 current UK non-drivers to travel in driverless vehicles (DVs). Road traffic is predicted to increase between 10%-40% consequent to current non-drivers taking to the road; the new market including individuals who are unable or unwilling to drive: the aged, people with physical and/or mental impairments, and those who possess phobias about driving. Behavioural Reasoning Theory is employed to explore explicit and implicit attitudes of non-drivers towards DVs. Implicit attitudes towards this 'really new' product are measured via an Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP). Sample members completed an online questionnaire containing the AMP plus items on reasons for and against DVs, beliefs and values concerning new technologies, and covariates suggested by literature in the transport marketing field.

This article expands this panorama by focusing on a, stable by construction, unmanned aerial system. Thanks to its design, the reported system dissipates the energy received by the action of external disturbances. The proposed vehicle has a unique rotor in order to perform different flight modes. This article reports the design concept of the aerial system, the mathematical structure of its nine degrees of freedom dynamic model, a set of numerical simulations allowing the analysis of the behavior of the developed model and the first experimental results that validate the stability, by construction, of the aerial vehicle. The two most significant and innovative aspects reported in this article are the use of a single orientable rotor to perform different flight modes and the inherent property of the system that makes it stable by construction.

AB In this paper, finite-time fault-tolerant control (FTC) for trajectory tracking of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) is solved. Main contributions are summarized as follows: (1) a finite-time passive FTC (F-PFTC) scheme using integral sliding mode (ISM) manifold is developed by exploiting partial knowledge on faults and disturbances, and achieves fast and accurate tracking with passive fault tolerance; (2) an online finite-time fault estimator (FFE) is devised to detect, isolate, and accommodate unknown faults and disturbances, and thereby eventually contributing to the finite-time active FTC (F-AFTC) scheme without using a priori knowledge; (3) suffering from both unknown faults and disturbances, the proposed F-PFTC and F-AFTC schemes can track exactly an ASV to the desired trajectory. Comprehensive simulations and comparisons conducted on CyberShip II demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed schemes. (C) 2019 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB A motivational driver model is developed to design a rear-end crash avoidance system. Current driver assistance systems use engineering methods without considering psychological human aspects, which leads to false activation of assistance systems and complicated control algorithms. The presented driver model estimates driver's psychological motivations using the combined longitudinal and lateral time to collision, the vehicle kinematics, and the vehicle dynamics. These motivations simplify both autonomous driving algorithms and human-machine interactions. The optimal point of a motivational multi-objective cost function defines the decision for the autonomous driving. Moreover, the motivations are used as risk assessment factors for driver-machine interaction in dangerous situations. The system is evaluated on 10 human subjects in a driving simulator. The assistance system had no false activation during the tests. It avoided collisions in all the rear-end crash avoidance scenarios, while 90% of human subjects did not.

AB We analyse people's attitudes to autonomous vehicles (AVs), i.e. driverless cars and trucks, using Eurobarometer data relating to November/December 2014 on approximately 1000 people in each EU country. People tend to be lukewarm to AVs, particularly driverless cars. However, a simple average hides the fact that many people, young and old, are totally hostile to the concept and a smaller number totally in favour. AVs are part of a technological development linked in general to robots, and regression analysis finds attitudes tend to be linked to both general attitudes to robots and individual self-interest relating specifically to AVs. Consistent with the literature, we find the young to be more in favour than the elderly. There are other differences, with males, those in cities and the more educated being more in favour, as well as differences between countries. There is also some evidence that support for AVs is greater in countries with high accident rates.

AB In this letter, a positioning method for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the Arctic that uses an electromagnetic field is studied. The method uses the direction-of-arrival (DOA) triangulation based on the polarization of the near field of three positioning nodes. The positioning nodes each transmit a monochromatic wave with a different frequency. The AUV can obtain the polarized field, and then estimate its position through a comparison of the different components of the field. The positioning error caused by the measurement error of the different components of the field has been analyzed, and numerical simulations are in an agreement with the analysis. The positioning error caused by the fluctuation of the sea surface has also been analyzed. The results show that triangulation with a polarization-based DOA can be used for the positioning of an AUV in the Arctic seawater.

TI Mid-water current aided localization for autonomous underwater vehicles

AB Survey-class autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) typically rely on Doppler Velocity Logs (DVL) for precision localization near the seafloor. In cases where the seafloor depth is greater than the DVL bottom-lock range, localizing between the surface and the seafloor presents a localization problem since both GPS and DVL observations are unavailable in the mid-water column. This work proposes a solution to this problem that exploits the fact that current profile layers of the water column are near constant over short time scales (in the scale of minutes). Using observations of these currents obtained with the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler mode of the DVL during descent, along with data from other sensors, the method discussed herein constrains position error. The method is validated using field data from the Sirius AUV coupled with view-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and on descents up to 3km deep with the Sentry AUV.

   ASSIGNMENT
AB As the future of autonomous vehicles (AVs) becomes more certain, transport network managers may seek ways to reinvent elements of the traffic network to improve efficiency. One possibility is dynamic lane reversal, in which the network operator makes use of AV communications and behavior to change the direction of flow on a road link at smaller time intervals than would be possible with human drivers. Although there is much research into the mechanical details of AVs, this study motivates the need for future research by focusing on a planning application in which AVs are already present. A novel extension to an established system optimal dynamic traffic assignment model based on the cell transmission model was examined. The model determined the optimal lane configuration at small space time intervals. Results demonstrate the model on a single link and a grid network and explore the dynamic demand scenarios that are most conducive to increasing system efficiency with dynamic lane reversal.

AB Advanced driver assistance system such as adaptive cruise control, traffic jam assistance, and collision warning has been developed to reduce the driving burden and increase driving comfort in the car-following situation. These systems provide automated longitudinal driving to ensure safety and driving performance to satisfy unspecified individuals. However, drivers can feel a sense of heterogeneity when autonomous longitudinal control is performed by a general speed planning algorithm. In order to solve heterogeneity, a speed planning algorithm that reflects individual driving behavior is required to guarantee harmony with the intention of the driver. In this paper, we proposed a personalized longitudinal driving system in a car-following situation, which mimics personal driving behavior. The system is structured by a multi-layer framework composed of a speed planner and driver parameter manager. The speed planner generates an optimal speed profile by parametric cost function and constraints that imply driver characteristics. Furthermore, driver parameters are determined by the driver parameter manager according to individual driving behavior based on real driving data. The proposed algorithm was validated through driving simulation. The results show that the proposed algorithm mimics the driving style of an actual driver while maintaining safety against collisions with the preceding vehicle.

AB This paper presents a high-accuracy, multirate inertial navigation system (INS) integrating global positioning system (GPS) measurements and advanced vector aiding techniques for precise position and attitude estimation of autonomous surface crafts (ASCs). Designed to be implemented and tested in the DELFIMx catamaran developed at ISR/IST, the navigation system comprises an advanced inertial integration algorithm to account for coning and sculling motions, combined with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for inertial sensor error compensation. Aiding gravitational observations are optimally exploited in the EKF, by deriving a sensor integration technique that takes into account the vehicle's dynamics bandwidth information to properly trace measurement disturbances and extract the relevant sensor information. The proposed aiding technique and the performance of the navigation system are assessed using experimental data obtained at seatrials with a low-cost hardware architecture installed on-board the DELFIMx platform. It is shown that the low frequency information embodied in pendular measurements improves the compensation of inertial sensor bias and noise, and consequently enhances the performance of position and attitude estimation. The overall improvements obtained with the vector aiding observations are also illustrated for the case of GPS signal outage, emphasizing the extended autonomy of the navigation system with respect to position aiding.

AB As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming more accessible and easier to use, the need for a reliable and easy to deploy monitoring solution has become the subject of great importance in defence, security, and commercial sectors. In this work, a novel passive bistatic radar is proposed to facilitate UAV detection and localisation by exploiting global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) as illuminators of opportunity. The result of a feasibility study conducted to determine the maximum operational range of the system under different configurations as well as its parameter estimation capabilities was evaluated through simulations. To facilitate multiple satellite signals, a multiple-input single-output approach is adapted to estimate the target's location and velocity.

However, the UAV performance and autonomy may vary due to external factors when it is operated outdoors. In some cases, an emergency landing maneuver is necessary to avoid an accident, since in fluvial environments, the UAV control landing becomes a difficult operation. Therefore, it is important to have a backup platform on the water to fix this problem. This paper presents the design and development of a custom-built unmanned surface vehicle using open-source tools and with two types of operation-remotely piloted and autonomous-to support remote sensing practices with UAVs in fluvial environments. Finally, part of the software developed within this project was released in an open-source repository.

TI Lane-Changing Trajectory Planning Model for Automated Vehicles Driving
   on a Curved Road
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article; Early Access
DE operations; lane changing; automated; autonomous vehicles
AB This paper attempts to study the lane-changing trajectory planning problem of automated vehicles driving on a curved road. The existing models have the following shortcomings. First, the curvature of the curved road is assumed as a constant, while the curvature is a gradient in the real world. Second, the existing studies either do not consider the speed variations of the surrounding vehicles in lane changing or ignore the curvature difference between the target and current lanes. To overcome the shortcomings, this study puts forward a novel trajectory planning model for curved-road lane changing of automated vehicles. In the model, a new strategy of planning a straight-road lane-changing trajectory first and then modifying it to adapt the curvature variation of the curved road is adopted, and a new collision-avoidance model for curved-road lane changing is developed. The proposed model is evaluated by comparing with the existing models and CarSim simulation platform. The results indicate that the proposed model can enhance the curved-road lane-changing safety of automated vehicles, and the lane-changing trajectory planned by the proposed model can be well tracked by automated vehicles.

AB An Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System (UVMS) can be applied to pick up and carry objects for autonomous manipulation in the water However; it is difficult to control the motion of the whole system because the movement of a manipulator affects the motion of the vehicle and vice versa. Additionally, a lack of information about the object, such as the shape and inertia, makes motion control even more difficult. In the current paper, a motion control algorithm of the UVMS with redundancy was developed to guarantee the stability robustness when the mass information of the objects is not available. In order to generate the joint trajectories of the manipulator, a redundancy resolution was performed to minimize the restoring moments acting on the vehicle. This means the propulsion energy for controlling the vehicle's motion can be reduced. To control the motion of the system with an unknown parameter, a controller based on the sliding mode theory has been designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified through a series of simulation for a 3DOF vehicle-3DOF manipulator system.

AB This paper presents an improved theoretical damped single-axle vehicle-bridge dynamic interaction model to consider the effect of the contact patch size and motor-induced vehicle excitation. The contact patch issue is critical as it determines the minimum time step for simulation and maximum identifiable frequency, while the inclusion of the motor-induced vehicle excitation benefits the design of autonomous self-driven rather than towed vehicles. Estimations of the contact patch size for both the pneumatic tire and solid wheel scenarios are discussed. The contact patch responses, which degenerate into contact point responses when the contact patch size is assumed to be infinitely small, were derived for the first time both from the vehicle and bridge responses to confirm their equivalence. The minimum time step, which determines maximum identifiable frequency but is arbitrarily chosen in literature, is proposed to be determined by the vehicle speed and contact patch length. The procedures to extract multiple bridge triad information including natural frequencies, mode shapes, and damping ratios from the vehicle responses are also presented. Based on extensive parametric analyses, the sinusoidal vehicle excitation becomes more prominent as its amplitude and/or frequency increase and may overshadow the analysis of bridge frequencies of interest. The vehicle acceleration leads to a more accurate extraction of bridge mode shapes and damping ratios than the vehicle displacement since the displacement is dominated by the fundamental mode of bridge vibration. The damping ratio extraction shows an average error of 0.28% from the instantaneous amplitude of the vehicle acceleration signal.

ID DESIGN
AB With the growth in the vehicle industry, autonomous driving has become a hot topic worldwide and has attracted increasing attention from both industrial and academic sectors. Maps, as pivotal geospatial information carriers, play a vital role in route planning and navigation service. Compared with conventional maps, high-definition (HD) maps possesses higher precision, richer information, and various services and are regarded as critical infrastructure for autonomous driving. However, heterogeneous HD map data standards and models have different characteristics and advantages, and thus they rarely meet all autonomous driving requirements for different driving objectives. This research presents an interoperable map data model, the Open HD Map Service Model (OHDMSM), to provide a reference for HD map development. The designed OHDMSM, which contains three data layers and a set of corresponding interfaces, demonstrates high interoperability for HD map data fusion and application. As a proof of concept, an HD map data system is implemented with all functions following the designed data model and interfaces of OHDMSM. The design and development of OHDMSM data structures, interfaces and systems will benefit data requesting, updating, and interoperation for HD map data worldwide, which can be helpful for developing autonomous driving and intelligent transportation in the Digital Earth.

AB Sea ice algae represent a key energy source for many organisms in polar food webs, but estimating their biomass at ecologically appropriate spatiotemporal scales remains a challenge. Attempts to extend ice-core derived biomass to broader scales using remote sensing approaches has largely focused on the use of under-ice spectral irradiance. Normalized difference index (NDI) based algorithms that relate the attenuation of irradiance by the snow-ice-algal ensemble at specific wavelengths to biomass have been used to explain up to 79% of the biomass of algae in limited areas. Application of these algorithms to datasets collected using tethered remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) has begun, generating methods for spatial sampling at scales and spatial resolution not achievable with ice-core sampling. Successful integration of radiometers with untethered autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) offers even greater capability to survey broader regions to explore the spatial heterogeneity of sea ice algal communities. This work describes the pilot use of an AUV fitted with a multispectral irradiance sensor to estimate ice-algal biomass along transects beneath land-fast sea ice (similar to 2 m thick with minimal snow cover) in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. The AUV obtained continuous, repeatable, multi-band irradiance data, suitable for NDI-type approaches, over transects of 500 m, with an instrument footprint of 4 m in diameter. Algorithms were developed using local measurements of ice algae biomass and spectral attenuation of sea ice and were able to explain 40% of biomass variability. Relatively poor performance of the algorithms in predicting biomass limited the confidence that could be placed in biomass estimates from AUV data. This was attributed to the larger footprint size of the optical sensors integrating small-scale biomass variability more effectively than the ice core in the platelet-dominated ice algal habitat. Our results support continued development of remote-sensing of sea ice algal biomass at m-km spatial scales using optical methods, but caution that footprint sizes of calibration data (e.g., coring) must be compatible with optical sensors used. AUVs offer autonomous survey techniques that could be applied to better understand the horizontal variability of sea ice algae from nearshore ice out to the marginal ice zone.

AB In order to improve the path tracking performance and stability of intelligent vehicles during steering and collision avoidance working condition, an integrated control method combining four-wheel steering, active suspension and direct yaw-moment is proposed. Firstly, a unified chassis dynamics model with 18 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) is established, which includes steering, braking and suspension subsystems. Phase plane analysis results for both traditional 2-DOF bicycle model and the 18-DOF model are compared. The results show that although the uneven road has a certain influence on the phase portraits of sideslip angle and sideslip angular velocity of the 18-DOF model, the overall trend is consistent with those of the 2-DOF model. Secondly, a general control framework for steering and collision avoidance of autonomous vehicle is put forward, consisting of the steering control for path tracking, and active suspension and direct yaw-moment control for stability. The collision avoidance reference path is planned by the fifth-degree polynomial, and three types of steering control methods including optimal control front wheel steering, optimal control four-wheel steering and front wheel steering combined with feedforward and feedback control, are adopted for comparison. The main contribution of this paper is that the role of active suspension is considered in the path tracking and stability integrated control of intelligent vehicles under steering collision avoidance. The active suspension subsystem uses optimal control method by two different kinds of weight coefficients, which can be switched between "comfort mode" and "sport mode" based on the vehicle lateral acceleration. According to the phase portraits of vehicle center of gravity sideslip angle and sideslip angular velocity, the direct-yaw moment control system adopts proportional differential control method based on the distance from the state point to the stability boundary. Finally, simulations and comparative analysis are compared among four different control systems on high and low adhesion roads. The research results indicate that the integrated control system can improve the vehicle path tracking performance and stability significantly.

AB The key to the docking phase of autonomous aerial refueling missions is the relative pose measurement between the drogue and unmanned aerial vehicles. A novel measurement method for drogue-UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) relative poses based on monocular vision is proposed in this paper. An adaptive arc-level structural feature extraction algorithm is applied to obtain the features that can be used for the measurements. In this algorithm, the projection of the end plane of the drogue in the image plane is accurately extracted based on an extraction quality metric. The projection contour and centroid of the internal black part of the drogue form the structural feature for the measurements. A robust pose estimation algorithm is presented to estimate the relative pose between the drogue and the UAV. The pose can be solved using a cone that is composed of the optical center of the camera and the structural feature. A Kalman filter is then applied to robustly estimate the pose of the drogue. A simulation and ground experiment are used to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves good performance compared with other methods.

AB Agricultural ground vehicles often have to traverse unstructured terrain, i.e., terrain whose conditions cannot be precisely predicted during its displacement. Such characteristics restrict the use of robots in the agricultural field because their stability could be compromised by their interaction with the terrain. As it does not have a human operator capable of observing, predicting, and controlling the interaction of the vehicle with the terrain. Therefore, a robot must deal with the unpredictability caused by this interaction, a task that was previously performed by the human operator. Given the relevance of the topic, this study investigates the literature on agricultural unmanned ground vehicles from the stability point of view, and also presents relevant criteria for dealing with the stability of agricultural robots in terms of their design and selection.

AB Nowadays, the surveillance and inspection of underwater installations, such as power or telecommunication cables and pipelines, are carried out by trained operators who, from the surface, control a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) with cameras mounted over it. This is a tedious, time-consuming, and expensive task, prone to errors mainly because of loss of attention or fatigue of the operator and also due to the typical low quality of seabed images. In this article, a reactive control architecture for visually guiding an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to detect and track a cable, or pipeline, laid on the seabed is presented together with a set of experimental results. Such results were obtained by using a three-dimensional simulation environment that incorporates the hydrodynamic model of a real underwater vehicle called GARBI. Additionally, a rapidly convergent off-line tuning method based on evolutionary theory is proposed and discussed. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are widely used for ocean exploration; however, the way they are replenished becomes the biggest issue limiting their range and efficiency. A dual transmission coil wireless power transfer (DTCWPT) system based on parity-time (PT) symmetry is proposed in this paper to realize an autoadaptive constant power transmission. A shielded housing structure for coils is equipped to realize WPT in the ocean. In the offset experiments, the proposed dual transmitting coil structure was able to achieve a stable power transmission of 39 W within an offset range of 8.1 cm. It is obvious that the DTCWPT system based on PT symmetry could charge an AUV in the ocean with high robustness. This paper provides a novel solution based on DTCWPT for AUV energy supply. The proposed DTCWPT system could offer remarkable improvements in the navigation performance of AUVs.

AB The encroachment of Eastern redcedar (ERC) (Juniperus virginiana L.) onto Great Plains prairies has become a serious threat to ecosystem functioning and grazing productivity. The uncontrolled spread of this invasive tree species has been called a >> green glacier << converting grasslands into closed canopy woodlands. A pasture tree cutting robot was developed using a tracked Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) equipped with a chainsaw bar to mitigate this green glacier dilemma. The prototype was fitted with amperage and voltage sensors to measure average power consumption and peak power requirements of tree cutting. It was evaluated on ERC and Honeylocust trees up to 20 cm in diameter. Cutting energy and time were determined to evaluate energy optimization and cutting time estimates. A pasture tree clearing energy consumption of the developed prototype was estimated for selected tree density/hectare. The prototype robot was successful in cutting down the intended size trees at a manageable power usage.

DE rotational misalignment; wireless power transfer; coil
AB A coil structure that is compatible with the structure of the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and preventing the rotational misalignment is proposed for stabilizing the output power of a wireless power transfer (WPT) system. The transmitting coil and the receiving coil are wound on the structure of the energy base station and the AUV in a spiral tube type, respectively. This arrangement not only guarantees a constant mutual inductance when the AUV rotates, but it also maintains the efficient transmission of energy when the receiving coil is conformal with the AUV by optimizing the size of the magnetic core and the distance between the coil and the metal structure. The performance of the proposed coil structure is experimentally evaluated by building an inductor-capacitor-capacitor series (LCC-S)-compensated WPT prototype. It was found that the system can stably deliver a 2 kW power with a dc-dc efficiency of 92.7%.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle networks is a significant resource for aquatic life maintenance and monitoring underwater pollution. It is necessary to study the underwater localization algorithms which self-localize themselves. The proposed work concentrates only on the range-free localization model with a goal is to use only very few sensing nodes in the network with low cost and high battery power to self-localize themselves. Few beacon nodes have been used to localize the sensor nodes in the definite position of the network. Compressive sensing theory based on hop count information for localizing the sensor nodes has also been used for localization. This research aims to collect the connectivity information of all the nodes in the network with compressive sensing theory and improve the localization accuracy. The analysis presents that the proposed method works well with location accuracy. Compressive Sensing Node Localization reduces cost and enhances sensors' energy efficiency compared to other underwater localization algorithms.

AB Ranking data provide important additional information related to valuation because of the implied preference sequence among all alternatives, rather than just the top choice preference. This additional information from a preference ranking can be exploited to achieve a certain desired precision in choice model estimation with a much smaller sample size, making ranked data surveys much more cost-effective than first-choice surveys. In this paper, we propose a spatial rank-ordered probit (SROP) model that accommodates both spatial lag effects as well as spatial drift effects. To our knowledge, this is the first such formulation and application of an SROP model in the econometric and transportation literature. An application of the proposed model is demonstrated in a travel mode choice ranking experiment among seven alternatives, including autonomous vehicle (AV) private ride-hailing and AV pooled ride-hailing.

AB An important aspect of interaction among groups of humans and software agents is supporting collaboration among these heterogeneous agents while they operate remotely and communicate asynchronously. We are developing an architecture that supports multiple humans interacting with multiple automated control agents in such a manner. We are evaluating this architecture with a group consisting of the crew of a space-based vehicle and the automated software agents controlling the vehicle systems. Such agent interaction is modelled as a loosely co-ordinated group because this model minimizes agent commitment to group goals and constraints while addressing a significant portion of crew and control agent group behaviours. In this paper, we give background on human interaction with space-based automation. We identify related research in multi-agent autonomous architectures and single agent human-computer interaction systems, we describe our architecture design for human-software agent groups and we identify research issues in loosely co-ordinated human-software groups.

   ANALYSIS
AB Automated vehicles (AVs) are widely considered to play a crucial role in future transportation systems because of their speculated capabilities in improving road safety, saving energy consumption, reducing vehicle emissions, increasing road capacity, and stabilizing traffic. To materialize these widely expected potentials of AVs, a sound understanding of AVs' impacts on traffic flow is essential. Not surprisingly, despite the relatively short history of AVs, there have been numerous studies in the literature focusing on understanding and modeling various aspects of AV-involved traffic flow and significant progresses have already been made. To understand the recent development and ultimately inspire new research ideas on this important topic, this survey systematically and comprehensively reviews the existing AV-involved traffic flow models with different levels of details, and examines the relationship among the design of AV-based driving strategies, the management of transportation systems, and the resulting traffic dynamics. The pros and cons of the existing models and approaches are critically discussed, and future research directions are also provided.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; FATIGUE
AB Uncertainty of how fully automated vehicles (AVs) will interact with other road users, including vulnerable road users and other manual automated operated vehicles in towns is one major concern with introducing these vehicles. Based on Walker, Rahman, and Caves (2001) adaptive policymaking model, this paper illustrates how the adaptive approach can be applied to trial fully automated private vehicles. Specifically, the focus is on policy elements which surround consumer acceptance and other road users' acceptability of private AVs. The State of Queensland, Australia was selected as the focus of this paper given that there are no current policies for fully AVs in this country. It is acknowledged, however, that similar frameworks may also be applied outside of Australia. This paper will also briefly discuss legislation barriers for trialling private AVs in Australia, whilst reviewing the regulations which have been introduced to overcome these barriers at an international level. It was concluded that private AV policymaking is required to be flexible in order to keep up with continued advancements in technology, both in Australia and beyond.

AB Advanced technology has ushered in the urge to enhance the travel experience. Besides the consistent desire to travel faster and more comfortably, the need to ensure transportation sustainability has remained constant. Smart cities employ top-grade technological applications to facilitate operations. Intelligent transportation systems involve the use of advanced transportation technologies. Through the integration of the Internet of Vehicles, cars in traffic can send and receive data between themselves and other vehicles and the environment. This data is processed to ensure efficient transportation by controlling traffic flows and preventing accidents. In this study, a literature review is conducted on how intelligent transportation systems contribute to environmental sustainability in smart cities. With technologies such as electricity-driven cars and autonomous vehicles, the systems minimize the emission of toxic substances to the environment while enhancing the interaction of the car with its surroundings to avoid accidents.

AB Effective trajectory planning and feedback control are important for an autonomous micro air vehicle (MAV) to accomplish a flight task of going across several target points. This paper presents a novel method to generate an optimal trajectory for a MAV based on criteria of minimum energy consumptions and lowest difficulties in reorienting the vehicle, via designing feasible turning rates and heading angles in consideration of the MAV dynamics. A switching PID feedback control is proposed and utilized in the lateral control of the MAV to accomplish the trajectory tracking. Examples of two-waypoint and multi-waypoint missions, using the proposed trajectory planning and tracking scheme based on a developed control system of a MAV, are presented, with the simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Numerous studies have studied the impacts of automated driving (AD) technology on e.g. accident rates or CO2 emissions using various frameworks. In this paper we present an overview of previous frameworks used for societal impacts and review their advantages and limitations. Additionally, we introduce the Total Impact Assessment (TIA) framework developed by the Swedish Transport Administration and use this framework to evaluate three scenarios for AD bus services in Stockholm. We conclude that the reviewed frameworks cover different aspects of AD technology, and that e.g. cybersecurity and biodiversity are areas largely neglected. Furthermore, most frameworks assume effects to be homogenous, when there may be large variation in e.g. perceived security. The TIA framework does not manage to include all societal aspects of AD technology, but has great benefits and manages to provide important insights of the societal impacts of AD technology, especially how effects may wary for different actors.

AB The deep-sea cable system, attached with an 11,000 m depth Autonomous Remotely Vehicle (ARV), is composed of two types of cables: Fiber Optical Micro-Cable (FOMC) and umbilical cable. The FOMC can be automatically released from a canister according to the tension of the cable. In the motion of ARV, the length, velocity, and tension of the FOMC are uncertain, which increases the complexity of dynamics calculation of the cable system. The nonlinear governing equations are set upon the basis of mechanical equilibrium. Owing to the complexity of the cable system, we employed the hybrid optimization method to search the best solution to the nonlinear equations, which makes full use of the globalization of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) searching and the rapidness of Newton-Raphson (NR) iteration. Numerical results of dynamics calculation verify the robustness of the hybrid optimization method and the feasibility of the ARV cable system.

AB Hybrid underwater glider combines motion modes of traditional autonomous underwater glider and those of autonomous underwater vehicles. Different motion modes need different flight performance, including flight efficiency, static stability, and maneuverability. Conventional hybrid underwater glider with fixed wings can't achieve optimal flight performance in one flight mission demanding various motion modes. In this article, controllable wings for hybrid underwater glider Petrel II are designed. Angle of attack, sweep angle, and aspect ratio of controllable wings can be changed to adapt to different motion modes. Kinematics and dynamics models of Petrel II are established based on multibody theory. Motion simulations of Petrel II with different wing configurations are conducted in three motion modes, including glide motion, spiral motion, and horizontal turning motion. The simulation results show the impact of wing parameters on flight performance. Field trials demonstrate that the controllable wings can improve the flight performance.

TI Sloped Terrain Segmentation for Autonomous Drive Using Sparse 3D Point

SO SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB A ubiquitous environment for road travel that uses wireless networks requires the minimization of data exchange between vehicles. An algorithm that can segment the ground in real time is necessary to obtain location data between vehicles simultaneously executing autonomous drive. This paper proposes a framework for segmenting the ground in real time using a sparse three-dimensional (3D) point cloud acquired from undulating terrain. A sparse 3D point cloud can be acquired by scanning the geography using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors. For efficient ground segmentation, 3D point clouds are quantized in units of volume pixels (voxels) and overlapping data is eliminated. We reduce nonoverlapping voxels to two dimensions by implementing a lowermost heightmap. The ground area is determined on the basis of the number of voxels in each voxel group. We execute ground segmentation in real time by proposing an approach to minimize the comparison between neighboring voxels. Furthermore, we experimentally verify that ground segmentation can be executed at about 19.31 ms per frame.

AB In this study, a hierarchical chassis control strategy is designed to enhance vehicle economy and safety for four-wheel independent-drive electric vehicles (FWID-EVs). In the upper-level, a vehicle dynamics model based on multiple agents is proposed, and a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) method is designed to dimensionally solve the problem of tracking the center-of-mass torque of the demanded velocity trajectory and stability parameters. In the bottom-level, a multi-objective torque distribution strategy that weighs safety, dynamics and economy based on multi-agent theory is designed by comprehensively considering the motor efficiency and tire energy loss. Finally, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation platform is built to verify the method formulated in this paper. The results show that the method in this paper is effective in tracking the desired trajectory and further enhancing the stability of the vehicle under various conditions. Compared with other algorithms, while guaranteeing safety and dynamics, the energy consumption of the powertrain is reduced by 9.51%.

AB In this letter, we present a framework for combining deep learning-based road detection, particle filters, and model predictive control (MPC) to drive aggressively using only amonocular camera, IMU, and wheel speed sensors. This framework uses deep convolutional neural networks combined with LSTMs to learn a local cost map representation of the track in front of the vehicle. A particle filter uses this dynamic observation model to localize in a schematic map, and MPC is used to drive aggressively using this particle filter based state estimate. We show extensive real world testing results and demonstrate reliable operation of the vehicle at the friction limits on a complex dirt track. We reach speeds above 27 m/h (12 m/s) on a dirt track with a 105 ft (32 m) long straight using our 1: 5 scale test vehicle.

AB The study aims at determining geo-reference locations for dynamic cooperative communications to be established, allowing the generation of dynamic vehicular gaps between the Dangerous Goods Vehicles and their surrounding vehicles, such that they could travel via a tunnel as a platoon and in isolation. This will ensure the safety of other road users in line with check-and-allow procedures at the road tunnel on Trans-European Transport Network, as per ADR regulations. The model is verified for different road layouts approaching a road tunnel in the UK, using varying traffic scenarios to determine if the identified geo-referenced location by the model is at suitable distances for gap generation. The results are compared against the simulated real-world tunnel traffic flow with conventional vehicles involving escorting of Dangerous Goods Vehicles via human operators. The mixed traffic and connected vehicles traffic flow scenarios are simulated for dynamic gap generation and compared against real-world tunnel scenario to analyse the improvements in travel time, queues and congestion.

TI Enhanced Android App-Repackaging Attack on In-Vehicle Network

DT Article
AB The convergence of automobiles and ICT (information and communication technology) has become a new paradigm for the development of next-generation vehicles. In particular, connected cars represent the most in-demand automobile-ICT convergence technology. With the development of 5G technology, communication between vehicle and external device using autonomous driving and Internet of things (IoT) technology has been remarkably developed. Control of vehicles using smart phones has become a routine feature, and over 200 Android apps are in use. However, Android apps are easy to tamper by repackaging and allowing hackers to attack vehicles with using this vulnerability, which can lead to life-critical accidents. In this study, we analyze the vulnerabilities of connected car environments when connecting with IoT technologies and demonstrate the possibility of cyberattack by performing attack experiments using real cars and repackaging for commercial apps. Furthermore, we propose a realistic security technology as a countermeasure to attain safety against cyberattacks. To evaluate the safety of the proposed method, a security module is developed and a performance evaluation is conducted on an actual vehicle.

ID ADAPTIVE-CONTROL
AB Despite major advances in Autonomous Underwater Vehicle design, the manually operated Underwater Vehicle (ROV) is still very much the industry workhorse. Current technologies are being used to reduce the stress of direct task operations by providing autonomy and to improve efficiency. This paper presents a design of a control module subsystem for a VE tele-operated ROV system. It discusses the design and implementation of the control module, Using modelling, simulation and experiments, the vehicle model and its parameters have been identified. These are used in the analysis and design of closed loop stabilising controllers for station keeping. As the vehicle has fewer actuators than possible degrees of freedom, it is necessary to limit the controllable degrees of freedom. These variables are eventually selected based on the inherent vehicle dynamics. Using the Lyapunov direct method, appropriate stabilising controllers have been designed. The station-keeping mode controller has PID structure and its gain values are designed using a non-linear optimising approach. Simulation and swimming pool tests for the heave and yaw directions have shown that the control module is able to provide reasonable depth and heading station keeping.

A systematic literature review was performed to capture the dynamics surrounding drones and to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of what has been studied so far and what needs to be investigated in the future. 55 publications were selected and thoroughly analysed. The findings of this study illustrate that the potential strengths of applying drones in SCM and logistics are: (1) support of humanitarian logistics, (2) reduced delivery time, (3) reduced cost, (4) improved flexibility, and (5) increased sustainability. In addition, the challenges posed by drones in SCM and logistics are grouped into technical, organisational, safety-related, and regulatory issues. This study also investigates real-life drone deployments in SCM and logistics and sets forth an agenda for future research.

AB The ability to predict pedestrian behaviour is crucial for road safety, traffic management systems, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), and more broadly autonomous vehicles. We present a vision-based system that simultaneously locates where pedestrians are in the scene, estimates their body pose and predicts their intention to cross the road. Given a single image, our proposed neural network is designed using a bottom-up approach and thus runs at nearly constant time without relying on a pedestrian detector. Our method jointly detects human body poses and predicts their intention in a multitask framework. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the precision scores of the state-of-the-art for the task of intention prediction by approximately 20% while running in real-time (5 fps). The source code is publicly available so that it can be easily integrated into an ADAS or into any traffic light management systems.

AB This article proposes a new model of privacy: infrastructural surveillance. It departs from Agre's classic distinction between surveillance and capture by examining the sociotechnical claims of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) as requiring totalising surveillance of passengers and environment in order to operate. By doing so, it contributes to the ongoing debate on the commodification and platformisation of life, paying attention to the under-explored infrastructural requirements of certain digital technologies, rather than its business model. The article addresses four distinct characteristics of infrastructural surveillance: the aggregation of data, initialisation of protocols limiting possible actions, the prioritisation of distributed modes of governance and the enclosure of the driver in a personalised bubble of sovereign power. Ultimately, unlike previous modes of computer privacy in which activities are being constructed in real time from a set of institutionally standardised parts specified by a captured ontology, we observe the creation of new ontologies.

AB The path-following (PF) problem of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is studied, in which the path convergence is viewed as the main task while the speed profile is also taken into consideration as a secondary task. To accommodate the prioritized PF tasks, a novel multiobjective model predictive control (MPC) (MOMPC) framework is developed. Two methods, namely, weighted sum (WS) and lexicographic ordering, are investigated for solving the MOMPC PF problem. A logistic function is proposed for the WS method in an attempt to automatically select the appropriate weights. The Pontryagin minimum principle is subsequently applied for the WS-MOMPC implementation. The implicit relation between the two methods is shown, and the convergence of the solution with the MOMPC PF control algorithms is analyzed. Simulation studies on the Saab SeaEye Falcon AUV demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MOMPC PF control.

AB The paper discusses use-cases and a broad description of application possibilities of drones in greenhouses. Unmanned autonomous aerial vehicles (UAV), i.e. drones, are being used increasingly often for the direct or indirect collection of data. GPS navigation cannot be applied in an indoor work environment. One of the alternatives is to measure the distance from a fixed set of sensors with known positions. The paper presents a dynamic model for a hexa-rotor drone. In order to ensure reliable navigation a new navigation algorithm is presented based on the two-dimensional navigation algorithm of the robot motion control. It demonstrates the development of a three-dimensional navigation algorithm for the hexa-rotor drone with the hypothesis that the elaborate three-dimensional model can navigate the drone in an indoor environment. To prove the hypothesis, the simulation is implemented in Scilab environment with information about the flight path deviation from the planned routes, which is also given in the work.

AB In this paper, we describe the control, navigation, and mapping methods that were developed for a hovering autonomous underwater vehicle that explored flooded cenotes in Mexico. The cenotes of Sistema Zacaton in Tamaulipas, Mexico are flooded sinkholes, exotic geological formations with unique water chemistry. The largest, Zacaton, is over 300-m deep. None of the cenotes were mapped before the present DEPTHX project. The goals of the DEPTHX project were to construct metrically accurate three-dimensional maps of the cenotes, and to collect environmental data, imagery, water samples, and core samples. The unknown extent of the cenotes, together with the challenging scientific mission, spurred the development of a robotic vehicle that autonomously, with no communications to the surface, built accurate three-dimensional maps using sonar and collected a variety of scientific data, including core samples from the cenote walls. In this paper, we describe the design, implementation, and testing of the robot software, as well as the results from mapping four cenotes of Sistema Zacaton.

AB This paper presents a novel navigation method for Autonomous Mobile Vehicle in unknown environments. The proposed navigator consists of an Obstacle Avoider (OA), a Goal Seeker (GS), a Navigation Supervisor (NS) and an Environment Evaluator (EE). The fuzzy actions inferred by the OA and the GS are weighted by the NS using the local and global environmental information and fused through fuzzy set operation to produce a command action, from which the final crisp action is determined by defuzzification. The EE tunes the supports of the fuzzy sets for the OA and the NS; therefore, the capability of the navigation method is enhanced. Simulation shows that the navigator is able to perform successful navigation task in various unknown or partially known environments, and it has satisfactory ability in tackling moving obstacles. More importantly, it has smooth action and exceptionally good robustness to sensor noise.

AB The technical maturity of autonomous driving enables the discussion of beneficial use cases to leverage its full potential. This article targets one such use case: Platooning is the efficient convoying of vehicles which makes use of self driving capabilities and inter-vehicle communication. Indeed, the grouping of vehicles in platoons with a small inter-vehicle distance can result in numerous advantages, such as energy savings, congestion reduction, and safety improvements. Yet, given the diversity of involved stakeholders, a wide range of objectives must be balanced to make effective use of platooning's full potential. Moreover, these objectives depend on various factors that influence their optimization, increasing the complexity of this endeavor. So far, existent work mainly targets a limited subset of related objectives and underlying factors. To further stimulate the optimization of platooning, this article categorizes objectives and influencing factors and proposes metrics for the evaluation of objective attainment.

AB This paper investigates the delay sensitive secure transmission problem in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-relayed vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). Specifically, we take the security assurance into account and formulate this problem as a total information delay minimization problem by optimizing the UAV relay trajectory and channel allocation. To tackle this optimization problem, we propose an alternating optimization framework, where the UAV relay trajectory is solved by the Newton method, and the channel allocation is obtained by relax-and-round and sequential convex approximation methods. Finally, simulation results show the performance improvement of our algorithm compared with the current works in terms of the total information delay.

AB This paper describes the design and realisation of an on-line learning pose-tracking controller for a three-wheeled mobile robot vehicle, The controller consists of two components, The first is a constant-gain feedback component, designed on the basis of a second-order model. The second is a learning feedforward component, containing a singlelayer neural network, that generates a control contribution on the basis of the desired trajectory of the vehicle. The neural network uses B-spline basis functions, enabling a computationally fast implementation and fast learning, The resulting control system is able to correct for errors due to parameter mismatches and classes of structural errors in the model used for the controller design. After sufficient learning, an existing static gain controller designed on the basis of an extensive model has been outperformed in terms of tracking accuracy.

AB Accurate and rapid acquisition of vehicle spatial form is of great importance in the fields of intelligent transportation and autonomous driving. However, given the limitations of projective geometry, it is difficult to obtain the 3-D structure of vehicles using monocular cameras. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to estimate the vehicle spatial form using monocular traffic cameras. Firstly, we establish the camera calibration model of the road scene, and jointly construct the geometric constraint model of the vehicle spatial form by vanishing points. Secondly, the contour and edge constraints of the vehicle are obtained based on Mask R-CNN. Then, based on these constraints, the error constraint function is constructed to calculate the projection error of the vehicle spatial form. Finally, a particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to iteratively optimize the parameters in the constraint space to obtain accurate vehicle spatial form information. Experiments are carried on the BrnoCompSpeed data set and the home-made data set. The experimental results show that the processing time of a single frame is less than 0.5 s and the average accuracy is higher than 94%. Moreover, the proposed algorithm has good robustness to the issue of vehicle occlusion and queuing in the scene, which outperforms existing methods.

AB We consider the problem of vehicle following, where a safety distance to the leader vehicle is guaranteed at all times and a favourite velocity is reached as far as possible. We introduce the funnel cruise controller as a novel universal adaptive cruise control mechanism which is model-free and achieves the aforementioned control objectives. The controller consists of a velocity funnel controller, which directly regulates the velocity when the leader vehicle is far away, and a distance funnel controller, which regulates the distance to the leader vehicle when it is close so that the safety distance is never violated. We provide a rigorous proof for the feasibility of the overall controller design. The funnel cruise controller is illustrated by a simulation of three different scenarios which may occur in daily traffic. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the autonomous car, perception with point cloud semantic segmentation helps obtain a wealth of information about the surrounding road environment. Despite the massive progress of recent researches, the existing machine learning networks are still insufficient for online applications of autonomous driving due to too subdivided classes, the lack of training data, and their heavy computing load. To solve these problems, we propose a fast and lite point cloud semantic segmentation network for autonomous driving, which utilizes LiDAR synthetic data to improve the performance by transfer learning. First, we modify the labeling classes and generate the LiDAR synthetic data-set for additional training to alleviate the lack of training data of the realistic data-set. Then, to lower the computing load, we adopt a projection-based method and apply a lightweight segmentation network to projected LiDAR images, which has drastically reduced computing. Finally, we verified and evaluated the proposed network in this paper through experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed network can perform the three-dimensional point cloud semantic segmentation in an online way, in which the inference speed overwhelms the existing algorithms.

AB For autonomous driving systems, vehicle detection is an important part and challenging problem due to the complex traffic scenes and poor computing resources. This paper proposes an improved SSD(single shot mutlibox detector) algorithm for the fast detection of vehicles in traffic scenes. MobileNet v2 is selected as the backbone feature extraction network for SSD, which improves the real-time performance of the algorithm. To improve detection accuracy, the channel attention mechanism is utilized for feature weighting, and the deconvolution module is utilized to construct a bottom-top feature fusion structure. The experimental results show that the average precision of the proposed algorithm on the BDD100K and KITTI datasets is 82.59% and 84.83%, respectively. The single inference time of the algorithm is 73ms, which is only about 5/11 of the original model, realizing the improvement of inference speed and prediction accuracy.

   Driving in Unknown Underwater Canyons

DE autonomous underwater vehicle; 2D optimal path planning; deep
   reinforcement learning; unknown underwater canyons environment
AB This research aims to solve the safe navigation problem of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in deep ocean, which is a complex and changeable environment with various mountains. When an AUV reaches the deep sea navigation, it encounters many underwater canyons, and the hard valley walls threaten its safety seriously. To solve the problem on the safe driving of AUV in underwater canyons and address the potential of AUV autonomous obstacle avoidance in uncertain environments, an improved AUV path planning algorithm based on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is proposed in this work. This method refers to an end-to-end path planning algorithm that optimizes the strategy directly. It takes sensor information as input and driving speed and yaw angle as outputs. The path planning algorithm can reach the predetermined target point while avoiding large-scale static obstacles, such as valley walls in the simulated underwater canyon environment, as well as sudden small-scale dynamic obstacles, such as marine life and other vehicles. In addition, this research aims at the multi-objective structure of the obstacle avoidance of path planning, modularized reward function design, and combined artificial potential field method to set continuous rewards. This research also proposes a new algorithm called deep SumTree-deterministic policy gradient algorithm (SumTree-DDPG), which improves the random storage and extraction strategy of DDPG algorithm experience samples. According to the importance of the experience samples, the samples are classified and stored in combination with the SumTree structure, high-quality samples are extracted continuously, and SumTree-DDPG algorithm finally improves the speed of the convergence model. Finally, this research uses Python language to write an underwater canyon simulation environment and builds a deep reinforcement learning simulation platform on a high-performance computer to conduct simulation learning training for AUV. Data simulation verified that the proposed path planning method can guide the under-actuated underwater robot to navigate to the target without colliding with any obstacles. In comparison with the DDPG algorithm, the stability, training's total reward, and robustness of the improved Sumtree-DDPG algorithm planner in this study are better.

AB Determining variations in fields is important for precision farming applications. Precision farming is used to determine, analyse, and manage factors such as temporal and spatial variability to obtain maximum profit, sustainability, and environmental protection. However, precision farming is excessively dependent on soil and plant test processes. Furthermore, test processes are time-consuming, laborious and expensive. These processes also cannot be performed quickly by humans. For these reasons, autonomous robots should be designed and developed for the detection of field variations and variable-rate applications. In this study, a remote-controlled and GPS-guided autonomous robot was designed and developed, which can be controlled via the 3G internet and is suitable for image-processing applications. The joystick is used to manually remotely control the robot movements in any direction or speed. Real-time video transmission to the remote computer can be accomplished with a camera placed on the vehicle. Navigation software was developed for steering the robot autonomously. In the results of the field test for the navigation software, it was found that the linear target point precision ranged from 10 to 12 cm and the distributed target point precision ranged from 15 to 17 cm.

AB A stochastic lateral movement model is proposed to address the limitations of current traffic models, which fail to capture the stochastic nature of the lateral component in vehicle movement during lane keeping and lane changing. This model incorporates a lateral noise component and a lateral movement component, with parameters that have clear physical interpretations including noise intensity, driver's sensitivity to lateral deviation, and sensitivity to noise. The model successfully describes the real-world distribution and standard deviation of lateral displacement, achieves over 70% accuracy in distinguishing between human driven vehicles and autonomous vehicles, derives the lane changing duration distribution consistent with experimental observation, and shows that the sensitivity to lateral deviation is about 7 times higher in lane changing compared to lane keeping.

AB ASAF is a multiple agent robotic system where Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and Ground Vehicles (UGV) agents perform coordinated tasks. Our research group built this system based on Multiple Unmanned Autonomous Vehicle Experimental Testbed (MAUVET), an in-house platform that we have introduced as well. The challenge in the development of a mobile robotic system is that performance in real time deployment differs from the original plan. This case is clearer when planning the traversal path of an agent, where error happens because of mechanical and environmental factors. The aim of this paper is to investigate the agent traversal execution via system experimentation and computer simulation. The outcome of this investigation is understanding this behavior under different sets of circumstances and finding some optimization factors.

AB In this study, we address the formation control problem of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the presence of model uncertainties and ocean-current disturbances. Specifically, we propose a robust distributed leaderless formation control strategy by cross-coupling a synchronous control technique, a nonsingular terminal sliding-mode control approach, and an adaptive control method. We enhance the robustness against system uncertainties by redefining the cross-coupling errors and ensure that the finite-time tracking error converges to zero from any initial value via the designed adaptive nonsingular terminal sliding mode control, which also eliminates the chattering problem. A major advantage of our adaptive control law is neglecting the requirement of any prior knowledge about the upper bounds of the model uncertainties and ocean-current disturbances. Our comparative simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed leaderless formation control scheme.

AB The study of extending navigation range of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is popular for ocean exploration. A common method is to use the underwater docking station to recover and recharge AUVs. This paper uses the simple but effective inductive power transmission (IPT) system to realize underwater wireless charging for an AUV docking system. A design procedure is provided to select the optimal underwater operating frequency of the IPT system in consideration of eddy-current loss in seawater. To solve the power failure problem of the control power system, an inrush current limiter (ICL) is proposed on the basis of the dynamic model of the IPT system. The test results in the laboratory experiment and sea trial both verify the advantages of the frequency design method and the effectiveness of the ICL.

AB The design of the 77-GHz radar absorbing materials (RAMs) that are suitable for the automotive environment is conducted using a square-patch frequency-selective surface (SP-FSS) on the surface of a grounded dielectric substrate. The inductance (L) and capacitance (C) of the SP-FSS were determined using the strip wire conductor model and used for determining the resonance frequency and substrate thickness. Impedance matching is satisfied at 77 GHz with a controlled FSS resistance matched to the free-space impedance. The optimized surface resistance of the SP- FSS conductor is Rs = 94 /sq (corresponding to the circuit resistance R = 377 ) for the lowest reflection loss of -37 dB at 77 GHz.

AB This paper develops our geographical understanding of the material politics of automation. Through the empirical site of the autonomous vehicle, the paper argues that dominant understandings of the politics of contemporary automation draw on a restricted understanding of materiality where political agency is concentrated in the hands of powerful individuals or institutions. However, this focus potentially obscures the complex material agencies of the systems of automation themselves. In response, this paper develops the conceptual potentials of the accident to bring these overlooked interruptive material agencies to the fore. This provides us with an opportunity to appreciate how the sites of power in systems of contemporary digital automation are more multiple and dispersed than is often assumed. In making this argument, this paper seeks to contribute to political geographical research that has turned to questions of ontology to pluralise the sites of politics and diversify the agents of political change.

TI A Novel Approach to Global Positioning System Accuracy Assessment,

AB This paper concerns a new methodology for accuracy assessment of GPS (Global Positioning System) verified experimentally with LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data alignment at continent scale for autonomous driving safety analysis. Accuracy of an autonomous driving vehicle positioning within a lane on the road is one of the key safety considerations and the main focus of this paper. The accuracy of GPS positioning is checked by comparing it with mobile mapping tracks in the recorded high-definition source. The aim of the comparison is to see if the GPS positioning remains accurate up to the dimensions of the lane where the vehicle is driving. The goal is to align all the available LiDAR car trajectories to confirm the of accuracy of GNSS + INS (Global Navigation Satellite System + Inertial Navigation System). For this reason, the use of LiDAR metric measurements for data alignment implemented using SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) was investigated, assuring no systematic drift by applying GNSS+INS constraints. The methodology was verified experimentally using arbitrarily chosen measurement instruments (NovAtel GNSS + INS, Velodyne HDL32 LiDAR) mounted onto mobile mapping systems. The accuracy was assessed and confirmed by the alignment of 32,785 trajectories with a total length of 1,159,956.9 km and a total of 186.4 x 109 optimized parameters (six degrees of freedom of poses) that cover the United States region in the 2016-2019 period. The alignment improves the trajectories; thus the final map is consistent. The proposed methodology extends the existing methods of global positioning system accuracy assessment, focusing on realistic environmental and driving conditions. The impact of global positioning system accuracy on autonomous car safety is discussed. It is shown that 99% of the assessed data satisfy the safety requirements (driving within lanes of 3.6 m) for Mid-Size (width 1.85 m, length 4.87 m) vehicles and 95% for Six-Wheel Pickup (width 2.03-2.43 m, length 5.32-6.76 m). The conclusion is that this methodology has great potential for global positioning accuracy assessment at the global scale for autonomous driving applications. LiDAR data alignment is introduced as a novel approach to GNSS + INS accuracy confirmation. Further research is needed to solve the identified challenges.

AB This paper presents a novel algorithm to plan energy-efficient trajectories for autonomous ornithopters. In general, trajectory optimization is quite a relevant problem for practical applications with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Even though the problem has been well studied for fixed and rotatory-wing vehicles, there are far fewer works exploring it for flapping-wing UAVs, like ornithopters. These are of interest for many applications where long-flight endurance, but also hovering capabilities, are required. We propose an efficient approach to plan ornithopter trajectories that minimize energy consumption by combining gliding and flapping maneuvers. Our algorithm builds a tree of dynamically feasible trajectories and it applies heuristic search for efficient online planning, using reference curves to guide the search and prune states. We present computational experiments to analyze and tune the key parameters, as well as a comparison against a recent alternative probabilistic planner, showing best performance. Finally, we demonstrate how our algorithm can be used for planning perching maneuvers online.

AB In this paper, an improved variational adaptive Kalman filter for cooperative localization with inaccurate prior information is proposed, in which the prior scale matrix of the one-step prediction error covariance matrix is adaptively estimated by using the expectation-maximization algorithm. A novel alternate iteration strategy is proposed to reduce the computational complexity of the proposed method. Convergence analysis and theoretical comparisons with the existing advanced adaptive Kalman filtering methods are also provided. Based on this, a new master-slave cooperative localization method is proposed. Lake experiment results of cooperative localization for autonomous underwater vehicles demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over existing methods. Compared with the cutting-edge adaptive master-slave cooperative localization method, the proposed method has been improved by 22.52% in average localization error but no more than twice computational time is needed.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE
AB This paper studies the trajectory tracking problem of an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) under the uncertainty of model parameters and input delay. Different from previous algorithms, a novel control algorithm is proposed which is a combination of RBF neural network algorithm and state prediction using backstepping sliding mode control method. The RBF neural network algorithm is used to estimate the composite interferences of model parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Meanwhile, an appropriate virtual control law is designed for the horizontal trajectory tracking of the underactuated AUV by backstepping technique. Further, the longitudinal and heading control laws are proposed using the nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode method. Then, it is proved that the AUV velocity tracking error can converge to zero in a finite time by the Lyapunov theory. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the approach is illustrated by the simulation results.

AB In this paper, a scheduling and routing based on AGVs processing and waiting times and the existing paths in a jobshop manufacturing system is proposed. A mathematical formulation is developed to schedule and route multiple AGVs handling jobs to shops so that the total delay of AGVs including the earliness and tardiness is minimized. A Lagrangian relaxation method is developed and a sub-gradient algorithm is composed to update the iterations in the searching process of method. The results show that the method is efficient in larger sizes problems while exact method cannot obtain the solutions in reasonable time. Two different problems are solved using two algorithms of Lagrangian relaxation and linear relaxation. Statistical comparisons showed much better performance of Lagrangian relaxation approach in a negligible run time. For larger sizes that exact method cannot be obtained even in long run times, Lagrangian relaxation approach is useful and efficient.

AB Hydrodynamic coefficients strongly affect the dynamic performance of an autonomous underwater vehicle. Although these coefficients are generally obtained experimentally such as through the planar-motion-mechanism (PNM) test, the measured values are not completely reliable because of experimental difficulties and errors involved. Another approach by which these coefficients can be obtained is the observer method, in which a model-based estimation algorithm predicts the coefficients. In this paper, the hydrodynamic coefficients are estimated using two nonlinear observers-a sliding mode observer and an extended Kalman filter. Their performances are evaluated by comparing the estimated coefficients obtained from the two observer methods with the values as determined from the PMM test. By using the estimated coefficients, a sliding mode controller is constructed for the diving and steering maneuver. It is demonstrated that the controller with the estimated values maintains the desired depth and path with sufficient accuracy.

AB Devising effective post-hazard recovery strategies is critical in enhancing the resilience of transportation networks (TNs). However, existing work does not consider the multiclass users' travel behavior in network functionality quantification and the metaheuristic solution procedures often suffer from extensive computational burden due to the exploration need in large solution space and the expensive functionality quantification. This study develops a bilevel decision-making framework for the resilience-based recovery scheduling of the TN in a mixed traffic environment with connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). The lower level quantifies the TN's functionality over time considering different travel behavior of CAV and HDV users arisen from their different levels of information perception. The upper level presents a novel deep-ensemble-assisted active learning approach to balance optimization performance and computational cost. This framework can help decision makers better quantify the TN's functionality to support effective recovery scheduling of TN with different mixed traffic scenarios ranging from HDV-only to future CAV-dominant traffic. The optimization approach bears the potential to be extended to solving general large-scale network recovery scheduling problems effectively and efficiently. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using a real-world traffic network in Southern California under earthquake considering deterministic and stochastic repair durations.

AB This paper focuses on the challenge of time-varying formation control for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). To tackle this challenge, an average consensus time-varying formation control based on event triggering decoupling mechanism (ETDM-ACTVF) is proposed. Firstly, the average consensus time-varying formation (ACTVF) based on the affine transformation are introduced, and the control objective considering the dynamic characteristics of underactuated AUVs is proposed. The trajectory tracking controller is designed by the back stepping method. Secondly, an event triggering decoupling mechanism (ETDM) achieves the state decoupling to constrain the uncontrollable state. Moreover, a dynamic event triggering mechanism is employed to reduce the execution frequency of actuators. Finally, the excellent performance of the proposed algorithm in addressing both the underactuated AUV time-varying formation control and decoupling control problems is demonstrated through simulation results.

AB Localization without Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is a critical functionality in autonomous operations of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Vision-based localization on a known map can be an effective solution, but it is burdened by two main problems: places have different appearance depending on weather and season, and the perspective discrepancy between the UAV camera image and the map make matching hard. In this letter, we propose a localization solution relying on matching of UAV camera images to georeferenced orthophotos with a trained convolutional neural network model that is invariant to significant seasonal appearance difference (winter-summer) between the camera image and map. We compare the convergence speed and localization accuracy of our solution to six reference methods. The results show major improvements with respect to reference methods, especially under high seasonal variation. We finally demonstrate the ability of the method to successfully localize a real UAV, showing that the proposed method is robust to perspective changes.

AB Structural health assessments are essential for infrastructure. By using an autonomous panorama vision-based inspection system, the limitations of the human cost and safety factors of previously time-consuming tasks have been overcome. The main damage detection challenges to panorama images are (1) the lack of annotated panorama defect image data, (2) detection in high-resolution images, and (3) the inherent distortion disturbance for panorama images. In this paper, a new PAnoramic surface damage DEtection Network (PADENet) is presented to solve the challenges by (a) using an unmanned aerial vehicle to capture panoramic images and a distorted panoramic augmentation method to expand the panoramic dataset, (b) employing the proposed multiple projection methods to process high-resolution images, and (c) modifying the faster region-based convolutional neural network and training via transfer learning on VGG-16, which improves the precision for detecting multiple types of damage in distortion. The results show that the proposed method is optimal for surface damage detection.

AB This paper deals with (deep) neural network implementations of sensorimotor control for automated driving. We show how to construct complex behaviors by re-using elementary neural network building blocks that can be trained and tested extensively; one of our goals is to mitigate the "black box" and verifiability issues that affect end-to-end trained networks. By structuring complex behaviors within a subsumption architecture, we retain the ability to learn (mostly at motor primitives level) with the ability to create complex behaviors by subsuming the (well-known) learned elementary perception-action loops. The learning process itself is simplified, since the agent needs only to learn elementary behaviors. At the same time, the structure imposed with the subsumption architecture ensures that the agent behaves in predictable ways (e.g., treating all obstacles uniformly). We demonstrate these ideas for longitudinal obstacle avoidance behavior, but the proposed approach can also be adapted to other situations.

AB Many system-development projects today are mainly driven by the complexity of their software interacting with sensors or actuators in an embedded context. Autonomous vehicle development is a domain where it seems inevitably necessary to apply modern development techniques to cope with complexity, increase development efficiency, and ensure appropriate quality. Furthermore, changes that are triggered by customers or inventions of competitors, as well as bugs, enforce a comprehensible, if necessary, yet agile development process with stringent quality management. In this paper, we describe the agile efficiency- and quality-focused change management mainly based on scenario-driven regression simulation used in the CarOLO project for the development of an autonomously driving vehicle to compete in the 2007 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Urban Challenge program. The main contribution is the demonstration of the modern software engineering techniques' applicability to develop distributed embedded systems.

ID THRUSTER DYNAMICS; ACCURATE
AB Positively buoyant autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operate at survey speeds with a pitch angle that is maintained through application of the control surfaces, sufficient to generate hydrodynamic forces to counteract the excess buoyancy. To facilitate lower forward speeds and the ability to hover requires some additional method of control. This paper reviews possible options and then indicates how control can be achieved using a single or pair of through-body tunnel thrusters. New equations appropriate to AUVs are proposed and experimental results are used to estimate the equation parameters. These equations are used within a simulation of the Autosub AUV to determine the response of the AUV during the transition between survey and low speed operation. The results obtained from the simulations are analysed in terms of the performance of the AUV and the demanded energy levels to assess the feasibility of using tunnel thrusters as a low speed control device.

AB The real-time segmentation results of side-scan sonar (SSS) images can realize the intelligent perception of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). However, there remains a compelling challenge that the models trained with training data may not generalize well in practical applications due to the various marine conditions/working devices. This article proposes a real-time cross-domain segmentation adaptation scheme for SSS images based on adversarial training via min-max training to distribute SSS images in the output space and marginal distribution adaption to improve the segmentation performance by minimizing the measured distribution distance. To further enhance the adapted model, the multilayer feature discriminators are established to realize the fine-grained alignment. Experiments on the real-world SSS datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves the actual industrial application for AUV.

AB For the trajectory tracking of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) subject to disturbances, a disturbance suppression and neural network (NN) compensation based control strategy is proposed. Lyapunov method is used to guide the overall design of control system. To deal with the underactuation, Light of sight (LOS) guidance is used to establish the relationship between heading angle and cross-track error. To suppress the external disturbance, L2-gain design is employed to guarantee the controller robustness. To improve the tracking accuracy, on-line neural networks with guaranteed stability are designed to identify unknown dynamics including the derivatives of virtual controls and errors induced by input saturation. Numerical simulation is performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. Compared with sliding mode controller (SMC) and disturbance observer approaches, the proposed controller performs better in terms of robustness and the input saturation is alleviated.

AB In this paper, a fixed-time sliding mode controller (FSMC) with disturbance observer (DO) is proposed to solve the trajectory tracking control problem for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) under time-varying external disturbances. Firstly, by using the sliding mode control method, an FSMC is proposed for reducing the tracking errors. Secondly, considering the estimation problem of time-varying disturbances, a fixed-time DO is designed to reconstruct the information of the AUV. Finally, The DO can compensate time-varying disturbances and the FSMC can reduce the tracking errors incorporating the information from the DO. Thus, the FSMC-DO for AUV is derived. Compared with the conventional FSMC and the finite time controller, the proposed FSMC-DO not only offers a faster convergence rate but also a higher tracking accuracy and robustness for the trajectory tracking control of AUVs. Simulation results are provided to show the superior performance of the proposed FSMC-DO.

AB This paper presents a docking station heave motion prediction method for dynamic remotely operated vehicle (ROV) docking, based on the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). Due to the limited power onboard the subsea vehicle, high hydrodynamic drag forces, and inertia, work-class ROVs are often unable to match the heave motion of a docking station suspended from a surface vessel. Therefore, the docking relies entirely on the experience of the ROV pilot to estimate heave motion, and on human-in-the-loop ROV control. However, such an approach is not available for autonomous docking. To address this problem, an ANFIS-based method for prediction of a docking station heave motion is proposed and presented. The performance of the network was evaluated on real-world reference trajectories recorded during offshore trials in the North Atlantic Ocean during January 2019. The hardware used during the trials included a work-class ROV with a cage type TMS, deployed using an A-frame launch and recovery system.

AB In order to more effectively reduce the regulation costs of power grids and to improve the automatic generation control (AGC) performance, an optimization mathematical model of generation command dispatch for AGC with an electric vehicle (EV) charging station is proposed in this paper, in which a cost consensus algorithm for AGC is adopted. Particularly, virtual consensus variables are applied to exchange information among different AGC units. At the same time, the actual consensus variables are utilized to determine the generation command, upon which the flexibility of the proposed algorithm can be significantly enhanced. Furthermore, the implement feasibility of such an algorithm is verified through a series simulation experiments on the Hainan power grid in southern China, where the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively realize an autonomous frequency regulation of EVs participating in AGC.

ID RONNE ICE SHELF; OCEAN INTERACTIONS; MODEL; WATER; CIRCULATION
AB A combination of measurements from Autosub, an autonomous underwater vehicle, and ship-based instruments are used to describe the oceanographic conditions beneath Fimbul Ice Shelf, Antarctica. The data show an intricate oceanographic regime that is suggestive of variability at seasonal or longer time scales. Results from a numerical model of the flow beneath the ice shelf lend support to a strong seasonal variability, and data from instruments moored beneath the ice shelf show substantial temporal variations. The Autosub data indicate temperatures within the cavity somewhat lower than our model results would suggest; thus, our modeled melt rates (average of 0.85 m yr(-1)) might be overestimates, although they are substantially lower than from previously published model studies (4.9 and 1.9 m yr(-1)). The contribution of ice shelf melt in the freshwater balance of the waters upstream of the climatically important Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf needs to be reassessed.

AB The depth tracking issue of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in vertical plane is addressed in this paper. Considering the complicated dynamics and kinematics model for underactuated AUV, a more simplified model is obtained based on assumptions. Then a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) is presented to estimate the external disturbance acting on AUV, and an adaptive terminal sliding mode control (ATSMC) based on NDO is applied to enhance the depth tracking performance of underactuated AUV considering both internal and external disturbance. Compared with the traditional sliding mode controller, the static error and chattering problem of the depth tracking process have been clearly improved by adopting NDO-based ATSMC. The stability of control system is proven to be guaranteed according to Lyapunov theory. In the end, simulation results imply that the proposed controller owns strong robustness and satisfied control effectiveness in comparison with the traditional controller.

AB Future Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs) are expected to be nearly autonomous and composed of heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). While most of the current research focuses on UAV avionics and control algorithms, ground task automation has come to the attention of researchers during the past few years. Ground task automation not only relieves human operators, but may also expand the UAS operation area, improve system coverage and enable operation in risky environments without posing a threat to humans. We propose a model to evaluate the coverage of a given UAS. We also compare different solutions for various modules of an automated battery replacement system for UAVs. In addition, we propose a ground station capable of swapping a UAV's batteries, followed by a discussion of prototype components and tests of some of the prototype modules. The proposed platform is well-suited for high-coverage requirements and is capable of handling a heterogeneous UAV fleet.

ID OCEAN WAVES; PROPAGATION; ATTENUATION
AB In March 2003 several autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) missions were carried out under sea ice in the western Bellingshausen Sea. Data from the upward-looking acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) on the "Autosub" AUV indicate a strongly oscillating horizontal velocity of the ice due to ocean swell. Swell period, height, direction, and directional spread have been computed every 800 m from the ice edge to 10 km inward for three missions. Exponential, period-dependent attenuation of waves propagating through sea ice was observed. Mean period increased with distance from the ice edge. The wave field refracted during propagation. The directional wave spread does not seem to relate to distance from the ice edge. although higher frequencies tended to be more spread. If suitably deployed, an ordinary ADCP may be used with this technique to study both scalar and directional properties of waves in open or ice-covered water.

AB The Waymo Open Dataset has been released recently, providing a platform to crowdsource some fundamental challenges for automated vehicles (AVs), such as 3D detection and tracking. While the dataset provides a large amount of high-quality and multi-source driving information, people in academia are more interested in the underlying driving policy programmed in Waymo self-driving cars, which is inaccessible due to AV manufacturers' proprietary protection. Accordingly, academic researchers have to make various assumptions to implement AV components in their models or simulations, which may not represent the realistic interactions in real-world traffic. Thus, this paper introduces an approach to learn a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based model for imitating the behavior of Waymo's self-driving model. The proposed model has been evaluated based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The experimental results show that our model outperforms several baseline models in driving action prediction. In addition, a visualization tool is presented for verifying the performance of the model.

AB A real-time local path planning for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) in a completely unknown underwater environment is addressed in this paper. Firstly, image processing techniques are applied to extract information of obstacles from the sonar data to build a grid map of the local underwater environment around the AUV. Then a topologically organized bio-inspired neurodynamics model based on the map is constructed to represent the dynamic environment. The goal globally attracts the AUV through the dynamic neural activity landscape of the model, while the obstacles locally push the AUV away to avoid collisions. Finally, the AUV finds its path to the goal autonomously by a steepest gradient ascent rule. The proposed model does not require any prior knowledge of the environment or learning procedures. The simulation result shows that the proposed approaches are capable of planning collision-free paths in large-scale unknown underwater environments.

AB Autonomous vehicle systems are currently the object of intense research within scientific and industrial communities; however, many problems remain to be solved. One of the most critical aspects addressed in both autonomous driving and robotics is environment perception, since it consists of the ability to understand the surroundings of the vehicle to estimate risks and make decisions on future movements. In recent years, the Bayesian Occupancy Filter (BOF) method has been developed to evaluate occupancy by tessellation of the environment. A review of the BOF and its variants is presented in this paper. Moreover, we propose a detailed taxonomy where the BOF is decomposed into five progressive layers, from the level closest to the sensor to the highest abstract level of risk assessment. In addition, we present a study of implemented use cases to provide a practical understanding on the main uses of the BOF and its taxonomy.

AB The study on brain-computer interface technology to achieve the automatic control of unmanned vehicles can help people with disabilities to realize self-service travel, thus attracting more and more attention from scholars and manufacturers. In this paper, the visual evoked potentials of human brain are extracted by visual stimulator of FPGA, and the evoked potential vector by waveform matching recognition algorithm on Labview platform, which are used as the control signals of brain-computer interface to realize automatic control of unmanned vehicle. The article explains the basis of related technologies, based on which, the signal processing flow of unmanned vehicle control system is introduced. Finally, experiment on the automatic system control of unmanned vehicle based on visual evoked potentials is designed. The experiment shows that the average time for sending instructions is less than 3s, and the average correct recognition rate of instructions is higher than 90%. The present research has opened up the research on the brain-computer interface controlled unmanned vehicle field, and will have a positive effect for the ultimate realization of autonomous travel for patients with limited mobility.

AB Precise guidance is the primary requirement for the reliable homing of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). The necessity for accurate short-range position tracking arises due to the limitations of the inertial sensors' cumulative integral drift, unreliable acoustic positioning system in very short ranges, and non-propagation of high-frequency electromagnetic signals of the GPS system. In this article, a very low-frequency electro-magnetic (EM) field is generated for very short-range guidance for the homing operation of underwater vehicles. The design and modeling of the 3-axis low-frequency EM-based shallow water submerged Docking Station (DS) at 10 m depth is explained and the EM field is generated for a 20 m range in the 3-axis plane using two perpendicular coils operated in distinct frequencies. The stochastic magnetometer measurement model is used to estimate the relative kinematics of the underwater vehicle with respect to the EM docking coil. The EM field datasets generated from EM field maps around DS are used for training and validating with different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The designed ML aided EM-based tracking technique guidance algorithms are validated for underwater vehicle localization that requires a precise and reliable homing process to the DS even in turbid waters, bio-fouling environment, and reflective boundaries though it has limitations in presence of ambient ferromagnetic sources. Numerical simulations have been carried out with conventional methods and ML algo-rithms on the generated EM data. The results indicate that the position accuracy achieved is within 1% for ML -aided EM based guidance techniques when compared to the conventional algorithm which has a position ac-curacy of 3%. ML aided techniques are advantageous as they are independent of the dynamic ocean environment and the underwater vehicle configuration and the Time to Home (ToH) to the DS is simulated in different sce-narios, is 160 s-200 s with a vehicle speed of 0.25 m/s. It is observed that the vehicle can choose the shortest path for homing operation with the measured EM field values and with aid of ML techniques.

AB This paper presents planning of smooth trajectories using the asymmetric profiles of displacement, velocity, acceleration and jerk of described higher degree polynomials. The presented way of determination of polynomial and asymmetry coefficients as well as motion time includes the procedure at both constraints of single kinematic quantities, i.e., velocity, acceleration, jerk and introducing a few constraints simultaneously. Moreover, the paper presents a method of planning trajectories with intermediate points consisting in concatenation of the analyzed polynomials. The proposed method of trajectory planning was compared to that of using the S-curve. The results in the form of kinematic quantity courses are presented graphically. The discussed method guarantees continuity of displacement, velocity, acceleration and jerk. It can be used for planning trajectories of various technical objects (e.g., manipulators, mobile robots, CNC machine tools, optical disk drives, autonomous vehicles, etc.).

AB The purpose of this study is to provide a situation reasoning module for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), to make decision-making agents know what is the current situation, what needs to be done in the present situation, and what is the risk of task present situation. This will enhance efficiency for AUV. Situation reasoning for AUV aims to communicate mission assessments to decision-making agents. Thus, in solving this problem, it is important to design a new situation reasoning module for AUV. This article is presenting the situation reasoning module for AUV, which includes uncertain event detection, uncertain event recognition and ontology model of the situation. The article concludes by demonstrating the benefits of the situation reasoning module in a real-world scenario. A situation reasoning simulation is demonstrated in an AUV while performing a complex mission. The approach was validated by marine experiments and simulating experiments for AUV. Results show the effectiveness of situation reasoning approach.

AB Considering the problem of consensus tracking control for multiple autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) system, a neural network-based finite-time nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control method is proposed. First, in order to elaborate on the communication relationship, the algebraic graph theory is combined with a leader-follower architecture. Next, the modified nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode is adopted to improve the fast response characteristic of the system, and distributed control laws are constructed based on the force analysis of each AUV. Furthermore, neural networks technique is employed to approximate the uncertain dynamics and forces caused by the harsh environment of the ocean. Finally, it is proved that the tracking errors can converge to a small neighborhood of the origin by using the proposed algorithm. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm are illustrated by a simulation example.

AB Accurate and efficient self-localization is a critical problem for autonomous systems. This paper describes an affordable solution to vehicle self-localization which uses odometry computed from two video cameras and road maps as the sole inputs. The core of the method is a probabilistic model for which an efficient approximate inference algorithm is derived. The inference algorithm is able to utilize distributed computation in order to meet the real-time requirements of autonomous systems in some instances. Because of the probabilistic nature of the model the method is capable of coping with various sources of uncertainty including noise in the visual odometry and inherent ambiguities in the map (e.g., in a Manhattan world). By exploiting freely available, community developed maps and visual odometry measurements, the proposed method is able to localize a vehicle to 4 m on average after 52 seconds of driving on maps which contain more than 2,150 km of drivable roads.

ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE; NAVIGATION
AB A new reactive motion planning method for an autonomous vehicle in dynamic environments is proposed. The new dynamic motion planning method combines a virtual plane based reactive motion planning technique with a sensor fusion based obstacle detection approach, which results in improving robustness and autonomy of vehicle navigation within unpredictable dynamic environments. The key feature of the new reactive motion planning method is based on a local observer in the virtual plane which allows the effective transformation of complex dynamic planning problems into simple stationary in the virtual plane. In addition, a sensor fusion based obstacle detection technique provides the pose estimation of moving obstacles by using a Kinect sensor and a sonar sensor, which helps to improve the accuracy and robustness of the reactive motion planning approach in uncertain dynamic environments. The performance of the proposed method was demonstrated through not only simulation studies but also field experiments using multiple moving obstacles even in hostile environments where conventional method failed.

In this study, one aspect of the problem, that of operating a tractor-cart combination in conjunction with a small-grain combine harvester, was investigated. The tractor-cart combination and combine harvester application was selected because of the high fatigue and long duration aspects of the problem. Differential flatness-based formation following was tested in software and robotic simulation. The software simulation was based on an actual field track from a combine yield monitor and demonstrated the potential of the system. The robotic simulation used two iRobot Magellan Pro robots in an indoor environment and demonstrated that the methodology could be implemented in real time.

TI A real-time lane detection network using two-directional separation

DT Article; Early Access
ID NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION
AB Real-time network by adopting attention mechanism is helpful for enhancing lane detection capability of autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes a real-time lane detection network (TSA-LNet) that incorporates a lightweight network (LNet) and a two-directional separation attention (TSA) to enhance the lane detection capability of autonomous vehicles. By adopting the attention mechanism, the real-time performance and detection accuracy are significantly improved. Specifically, LNet employs symmetry layer to drastically reduce the number of parameters and the network's running time. TSA infers the attention map along two separate directions, transverse and longitudinal, and performs adaptive feature refinement by multiplying the attention map with the input feature map. TSA can be integrated into LNet to capture the local textural and global contextual information of lanes without increasing the processing time. Results on popular benchmarks demonstrate that TSA-LNet achieves outstanding detection accuracy and faster speed (6.99 ms per image). Additionally, TSA-LNet exhibits excellent robustness in real-world scenarios.

AB The trajectory prediction task is one of the current challenges regarding computer vision and autonomous driving. However, unlike more common tasks like object detection or semantic segmentation, the problem is far to be resolved and there are still a lot of limitations for the prediction of the trajectory regarding the surrounding vehicles. Only a few models try to make trajectory prediction for a real-life application with live responses and there are only a few datasets to work with, the trajectory being hard to annotate. At least the limitation regarding the dataset annotation can be overcome by using a video generation-based model for trajectory prediction, considering that the video generation task does not require any special annotations. Following a recent study (Iancu et al., 2022), this work proposes some modifications to the PredNet architecture with better results for the trajectory prediction task.

AB In rescue operations, the full time of action plays important role. It is the sum of the planning, travel, and manipulation (in the action place) phase times. The time minimization of the first two phases by autonomous vehicle for remote action is considered in the paper. For a known a priori map, the path planning consists of local optimal decisions collected next in the general algorithm of the optimal path. Such an approach significantly reduces time of path planning. The robot features and known sparse obstacles reduce the allowable robot speeds. The time of travel is calculated from an allowable velocity profile. Therefore, it can be used to estimate the travel performance. Genetic algorithm and random search-based methods for path finding with travel time optimization are used and compared in the paper. All the proposed time optimization solutions of rescue operations are checked during computer simulations, and results of the simulations are presented.

ID MARINE SURFACE VESSELS; GUIDANCE
AB The aim of this study is to solve the problem of poor tracking in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUVs) that are operating based on traditional line-of-sight (LOS) method when tracking different paths in a complex marine environment. An adaptive-LOS (ALOS) guidance law with drift angle compensation is proposed, and is employed to calculate the AUV's desired course (direction of velocity) and heading. First, an appropriate look-ahead distance is derived by the ALOS guidance law in consideration of the predefined path curvature, real-time tracking error and speed of the AUV. Subsequently, proper compensation is provided with respect to the actual drift angle. Compared with traditional LOS operation, this method flexibly adjusts to a suitable look-ahead distance while considering many related factors, providing a better path following performance. Both simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of this method.

AB Virtual product developments (VPDs) tools have a great effect on reducing the cost of development, which explains the considerable amount of attention they received lately from researchers. In this work, two different VPD tyre models, restricted fully non-linear and enhanced non-linear transient models, are tested through modelling and simulation. A detailed multibody mechanical system model of a large wheel loader conducting a V-shape loading cycle was used to test the performance differences between the two transient tyre models. VPD simulations show that both tyre models enable the operator (controller) to drive the machine tracking the desired path; however, the enhanced non-linear tyre model shows larger deviation and less operator comfort when compared with the restricted non-linear transient tyre model. Results also show the ability of the restricted tyre model to produce higher forces and moment to keep the machine on track.

AB This paper presents a new approach to path following control design for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). A NARMAX model of the AUV is derived first and then its parameters are adapted online using the recursive extended least square algorithm. An adaptive Propotional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller is developed using the derived parameters to accomplish the path following task of an AUV. The gain parameters of the PID controller are tuned using an inverse optimal control technique, which alleviates the problem of solving Hamilton-Jacobian equation and also satisfies an error cost function. Simulation studies were pursued to verify the efficacy of the proposed control algorithm. From the obtained results, it is envisaged that the proposed NARMAX model-based self-tuning adaptive PID control provides good path following performance even in the presence of uncertainty arising due to ocean current or hydrodynamic parameter.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES; OPTIMIZATION; COMPLEX
AB An imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) is introduced for solving the optimal path planning problem for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operating in turbulent, cluttered, and uncertain environments. ICA is a new sociopolitically inspired global search metaheuristic based on a form of competition between "imperialist" forces and opposing colonies. In this study, ICA is applied to optimize the coordinates of a set of control points for generating a curved spline path. The ICA-based path planner is tested to find an optimal trajectory for an AUV navigating through a variable ocean environment in the presence of an irregularly shaped underwater terrain. The genetic algorithm (GA) and quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) are described and evaluated with the ICA for the path optimization problem. Simulation results show that the proposed ICA approach is able to obtain a more optimized trajectory than the GA- or QPSO-based methods. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the robustness and superiority of the proposed ICA scheme compared with the GA and QPSO schemes.

AB An underwater planar covering problem is studied where the coverage region consists of polygonal cells, and line sweep motion is used for coverage. In many subsea applications, sidescan sonar has become a common tool, and the sidescan sonar data is meaningful only when the sonar is moving in a straight line. This work studies the optimal line sweep coverage where the sweep paths of the cells consist of straight lines and no turn is allowed inside the cell. An optimal line sweep coverage solution is presented when the line sweep path is parallel to an edge of the cell boundary. The total time to complete the coverage task is minimized. A unique contribution of this work is that the optimal sequence of cell visits is computed in addition to the optimal line sweep paths and the optimal cell decomposition.

AB We discuss an in situ marine imaging system based on high-speed digital line scan cameras for collection of a continuous picture of microscopic marine particles ranging in size from 200 mum to several centimeters. The system is built to operate on a 53-cm-dianieter autonomous underwater vehicle or a tethered platform. The digital imaging system provides a continuous record of all particles passing through a symmetric 96 x 96 mm, sampling tube and provides views from two orthogonal directions. Data are compressed using a lossless encoding technique and stored onto a disk drive. Over 50 h of continuous imaging is possible using the system. Data are suitable for studies requiring sizing, identification, quantification, and spatial recording of semi-transparent and opaque particles. This paper summarizes the mechanical, optical, and data processing design of this instrument and discusses recent improvements. We also present images and quantitative results from recent deployments in the Gulf of Mexico.

AB Navigational range is an important attribute of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and drag reduction efforts have been pursued to improve overall efficiency. Improved efficiency results in a more capable vehicle over all. Historically, the majority of research focused on drag reduction has been concentrated on the optimization of vehicle hull geometry. The influence of the hull appendages on drag, however, has been largely ignored owing to their smaller size. In this study, the impacts of appendage size and position on vehicle drag are investigated using a computational fluid dynamics method. The results indicate that appendages increase more drag because of their impact on the development of turbulence. The investigation of the interactions between multiple appendages fixed on a vehicle hull shows that optimization is necessary for drag reduction. This paper presents an arrangement optimization method for AUV appendages based on the Kriging approximation model and the multi-island genetic algorithm. The results of the optimization show that appendage influence on hydrodynamic performance is directly proportional to its size, and that a distributed arrangement is beneficial for drag reduction.

AB By considering a lane change maneuver as primarily a longitudinal motion planning problem, this paper presents a lane change maneuver algorithm with a pragmatic approach to determine an inter-vehicle traffic gap and time instance to perform the maneuver. The proposed approach selects an appropriate inter-vehicle traffic gap and time instance to perform the lane change maneuver by simply estimating whether there might exist a longitudinal trajectory that allows the automated vehicle to safely perform the maneuver. The lane change maneuver algorithm then proceeds to solve two loosely coupled convex quadratic programs to obtain the longitudinal trajectory to position the automated vehicle in the selected inter-vehicle traffic gap at the desired time instance and the corresponding lateral trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach to select an appropriate inter-vehicle traffic gap and time instance to initialize the lateral motion of a lane change maneuver in various traffic scenarios. The real-time ability of the lane change maneuver algorithm to generate safe and smooth trajectories is shown by experimental results of a Volvo V60 performing automated lane change maneuvers on a test track.

AB Control with unstructured uncertainties refers to controlling systems where not only the parameters are unknown but also the way the parameters appear in the dynamics. This problem becomes pivotal in autopilots, where a unified control architecture is sought for aerial/ground/marine vehicles with different structures. By only making use of basic Euler-Lagrange (EL) properties valid in most mechanical systems independent of their specific structure, this brief proposes an adaptive design that does not rely on structural knowledge of the uncertainties. The proposed adaptive method, here validated in the ArduPlane module of ArduPilot, applies also to other modules like ArduCopter, ArduRover, and ArduSub. Enhanced performance with respect to state-of-the-art methods addressing unstructured and state-dependent uncertainties is verified.

AB Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) suffer from enormous energy consumption when sensor nodes transmit data over long distances. Hence, this letter develops an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted sparse sensing algorithm to address this issue. Specifically, the data from the sensor nodes are locally stored and are sparsely sampled through Compressive Sensing (CS), while a UAV is utilized as a mobile base station to collect data from the partial sensor nodes. In the proposed UAV and WSN system, the energy consumption minimization problem is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem, which is solved utilizing a joint sparse sensing and Greedy algorithm based on a Neighborhood Search Strategy (GNSS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a sparse measurement with a smaller error and decreases energy consumption.

AB In this paper, we propose a control law to achieve a rendezvous of autonomous vehicles moving in three-dimensional (3D) space, using minimal data sensing and quantized control. A pre-assigned graph uniquely assigns the pursuer-target pair in a cyclic manner. A quantized control law has been proposed which allows the vehicle to pitch and yaw simultaneously in the required direction and track its target agent. The only measurement required for the proposed control law is the quadrant from which the target vehicle moves out of the field-of-view of the pursuing vehicle. A Lyapunov function is chosen to find a domain for the field-of-view which guarantees rendezvous under the proposed control law. Computer simulations are presented to demonstrate the control law.

AB Drivers could be more careful when vehicles move in the non-standard narrow lane. This might cause the drivers to behave differently from other normal-size lanes. To investigate the characteristics of the traffic flow in narrow lanes, this paper collected the vehicle trajectory data on four-lane road segments with 2.8m width and 3.25m width respectively. Firstly, the spatial distribution of wheel tracks in the lane under low traffic volume is studied, and the results show that the wheel trails' distribution is obviously affected by three factors: speed, lane width, and lane in cross-section position, which are significantly different from normal-size lanes. Secondly, statistical analysis shows that vehicle-following status in narrow lane environment can be divided into three types: staggered following, parallel following, and transitional following. Finally, a multivariate logistic regression model is constructed to predict the driver's following strategy under different driving micro-environment parameters. The research results can support the fine management of lanes and help to improve the driving strategy of autonomous vehicles.

AB Discriminative correlation filters (DCFs) have recently achieved competitive performance in visual tracking benchmarks. However, such trackers perform poorly when the target undergoes occlusion, viewpoint variation or other challenging attributes. To tackle these issues, in this Letter, the authors combine the fast DCF trackers with the precise deep learning methods to eliminate the accumulating drift for the vehicle tracking based on unmanned aerial vehicle platform. Specifically, the authors employ the tracking result of the DCF tracker as the input of the boundary regressing network. After judging the existence of the target in the input patch, the proposed network would estimate the boundary of the target vehicle. Furthermore, the output would be updated to the tracking template, aiming at eliminating the accumulation errors and achieving a long-term tracking. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through experimental comparison on widely used tracking benchmark data sets.

AB Car-following modeling is essential in the longitudinal control for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Considering the advantage of the generative adversarial network (GAN) in capturing realistic data distribution, this paper applies conditional GAN (CGAN) to car-following modeling. The generator is elaborately designed with a sequence-to-sequence structure to reflect the decision-making process of human driving behavior. The proposed model is trained and tested based on the empirical dataset, and it is compared with a supervised learning model and a mathematical model. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the model's performance, especially in the condition of mixed traffic flow. The comparison result shows that the CGAN model outperforms others in trajectory reproduction, indicating it can effectively imitate human driving behavior. The simulation results suggest that the introduction of CGAN-based CAVs improves the stability and efficiency of the mixed traffic flow.

AB CCTV-based surveillance using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is considered a key technology for security in smart city environments.This article creates a case where the UAVs with CCTV-cameras fly over the city area for flexible and reliable surveillance services. UAVs should be deployed to cover a large area while minimizing overlapping and shadow areas for a reliable surveillance system. However, the operation of UAVs is subject to high uncertainty, necessitating autonomous recovery systems. This article develops a multiagent deep reinforcement learning-based management scheme for reliable industry surveillance in smart city applications. The core idea this article employs is autonomously replenishing the UAV's deficient network requirements with communications. Via intensive simulations, our proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of surveillance coverage, user support capability, and computational costs.

AB Efficient algorithm integration is a key issue in aerial robotics. However, only a few integration solutions rely on a cognitive approach. Cognitive approaches break down complex problems into independent units that may deal with progressively lower-level data interfaces, all the way down to sensors and actuators. A cognitive architecture defines information flow among units to produce emergent intelligent behavior. Despite the improvements in autonomous decision-making, several key issues remain open. One of these issues is the selection, coordination, and decision-making related to the several specialized tasks required for fulfilling mission objectives. This work addresses decision-making for the cognitive unmanned-aerial-vehicle architecture coined as ARCog. The proposed architecture lays the groundwork for the development of a software platform aligned with the requirements of the state-of-the-art technology in the field. The system is designed to provide high-level decision-making. Experiments prove that ARCog works correctly in its target scenario.

AB In cooperative localization for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), the practical state and measurement noises may be non-stationary non-Gaussian distributed because of sensor outliers, multi-path effect of acoustic channel, and changeable underwater environment. In this paper, a couple of novel mixture distributions, i.e., the Gaussian-Slash mixture distribution and the Gaussian-generalized hyperbolic skew Student's t mixture distribution, are proposed to model such state and measurement noises, respectively. By introducing two Bernoulli distributed random variables, both the proposed mixture distributions can be expressed as hierarchically Gaussian forms. Based on this, a novel mixture distributions based robust Kalman filter (MDRKF) is derived by exploiting the variational Bayesian inference. A lake experiment about the cooperative localization for AUVs demonstrated that the proposed MDRKF has better localization accuracy but higher computational complexity than the existing state-of-the-art filtering algorithms.

AB In this paper we describe cooperative control algorithms for robots and sensor nodes in an underwater environment. Cooperative navigation is defined as the ability of a coupled system of autonomous robots to pool their resources to achieve long-distance navigation and a larger controllability space. Other types of useful cooperation in underwater environments include: exchange of information such as data download and retasking; cooperative localization and tracking; and physical connection (docking) for tasks such as deployment of underwater sensor networks, collection of nodes and rescue of damaged robots. We present experimental results obtained with an underwater system that consists of two very different robots and a number of sensor network modules. We present the hardware and software architecture of this underwater system. We then describe various interactions between the robots and sensor nodes and between the two robots, including cooperative navigation. Finally, we describe our experiments with this underwater system and present data.

AB This paper proposes two algorithms for adaptive driving in urban environments: the first uses vision deep learning, which is named the sparse spatial convolutional neural network (SSCNN); and the second uses a sensor integration algorithm, named the sensor-weighted integration field (SWIF). These algorithms utilize three kinds of sensors, namely vision, Light Detection and Range (LiDAR), and GPS sensors, and decide critical motions for autonomous vehicle, such as steering angles and vehicle speed. SSCNN, which is used for lane recognition, has 2.7 times faster processing speed than the existing spatial CNN method. Additionally, the dataset for SSCNN was constructed by considering both normal and abnormal driving in 7 classes. Thus, lanes can be recognized by extending lanes for special characteristics in urban settings, in which the lanes can be obscured or erased, or the vehicle can drive in any direction. SWIF generates a two-dimensional matrix, in which elements are weighted by integrating both the object data from LiDAR and waypoints from GPS based on detected lanes. These weights are the integers, indicating the degree of safety. Based on the field formed by SWIF, the safe trajectories for two vehicles' motions, steering angles, and vehicle speed are generated by applying the cost field. Additionally, to flexibly follow the desired steering angle and vehicle speed, the Proportional-Integral-Differential (PID) control is moderated by an integral anti-windup scheme. Consequently, as the dataset considers characteristics of the urban environment, SSCNN is able to be adopted for lane recognition on urban roads. The SWIF algorithm is also useful for flexible driving owing to the high efficiency of its sensor integration, including having a resolution of 2 cm per pixel and speed of 24 fps. Thus, a vehicle can be successfully maneuvered with minimized steering angle change, without lane or route departure, and without obstacle collision in the presence of diverse disturbances in urban road conditions.

AB This research presents a novel sample-based path planning algorithm for adaptive sampling. The goal is to find a near-optimal path for unmanned marine vehicles (UMVs) that maximizes information gathering over a scientific interest area, while satisfying constraints on collision avoidance and pre-specified mission time. The proposed rapidly-exploring adaptive sampling tree star (RAST*) algorithm combines inspirations from rapidly-exploring random tree star (RRT*) with a tournament selection method and informative heuristics to achieve efficient searching of informative data in continuous space. Results of numerical experiments and proof-of-concept field experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed RAST* over rapidly-exploring random sampling tree star (RRST*), rapidly-exploring adaptive sampling tree (RAST), and particle swarm optimization (PSO).

ID LOCALIZATION
AB This letter is about localising a vehicle in an overhead image using FMCW radar mounted on a ground vehicle. FMCW radar offers extraordinary promise and efficacy for vehicle localisation. It is impervious to all weather types and lighting conditions. However the complexity of the interactions between millimetre radar wave and the physical environment makes it a challenging domain. Infrastructure-free large-scale radar-based localisation is in its infancy. Typically here a map is built and suitable techniques, compatible with the nature of sensor, are brought to bear. In this work we eschew the need for a radar-based map; instead we simply use an overhead image - a resource readily available everywhere. This letter introduces a method that not only naturally deals with the complexity of the signal type but does so in the context of cross modal processing.

AB Future visions of transport systems include both a drive towards automated vehicles and the need for sustainable, active, modes of travel. The combination of these requirements needs careful consideration to ensure the integration of automated vehicles does not compromise vulnerable road users. Transport networks need to be resilient to automation integration, which requires foresight of possible challenges in their interaction with other road users. Focusing on a cyclist overtake scenario, the application of operator event sequence diagrams and a predictive systems failure method provide a novel way to analyse resilience. The approach offers the opportunity to review how automation can be positively integrated into road transportation to overcome the shortfalls of the current system by targeting organisational, procedural, equipment and training measures.

AB Vehicle trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving and advanced driver assistant systems. While existing approaches may sample from a predicted distribution of vehicle trajectories, they lack the ability to explore it - a key ability for evaluating safety from a planning and verification perspective. In this work, we devise a novel approach for generating realistic and diverse vehicle trajectories. We first extend the generative adversarial network (GAN) framework with a low-dimensional approximate semantic space, and shape that space to capture semantics such as merging and turning. We then sample from this space in a way that mimics the predicted distribution, but allows us to control coverage of semantically distinct outcomes. We validate our approach on a publicly available dataset and show results that achieve state-of-the-art prediction performance, while providing improved coverage of the space of predicted trajectory semantics.

AB Motorisation in cities has fundamentally transformed urban patterns of development, ranging from residential parking and density standards of single buildings on one hand to urban infrastructure construction and the expansion of entire cities on the other. The introduction of automated vehicles (AVs) has enormous potential to transform urbanisation patterns and urban design even further. However, the direction in which this technology will change the city is contested and a diverse set of views can be found. This paper provides a review of scenarios on these issues to date. Although some scenario studies provide useful insights about urban growth and change, very few consider detailed impacts of AVs on urban form, such as the density and mix of functions, the layout of urban development and the accessibility of locations, including the distance to transit.

Input data are recorded with a wide-baseline stereo vision system providing accuracy for distance estimations. The paper reports about followed ways and novel contributions for ensuring a working system solution. Automatic self-calibration is used for the wide-baseline stereo vision system. Robust sea surface estimation and the detection of the horizon support the understanding of the given scene environment. Long-range (i.e. up to 500 m) object detection and tracking are supported by the used wide-baseline stereo system. The paper informs about the complete system design, informs about applied or designed methods, and also about experiments which verify that the system achieved an operational state.

ID TRUST MANAGEMENT; SCHEME
AB Vehicular cooperation mechanisms are known to provide efficiency and scalability benefits but for the mechanisms to be human-centric, there is a need for them to be robust and resilient to anti-social behaviours such as deception. More specifically, decentralised vehicle-to-vehicle cooperation has been shown to be an effective and convenient approach to coordinate the use of dynamically changing common road resources such as car parking. However, the potential for selfish behaviour of some vehicles in the form of sending false information for self-benefit has a significant effect on the value of cooperation. In this paper, we investigate, via extensive simulations, the deception behaviour of malicious vehicles looking to park by sending false information in decentralized vehicle cooperation. Furthermore, Deception Detection Mechanisms (DDMs) are introduced and are shown to be valuable in ameliorating the effects of malicious vehicles. The work has broader implications for an open world of autonomous and adaptive systems with decentralized control and ownership which need to cooperate to use shared resources; they are susceptible to malicious behaviour, and hence, need to be built to be robust to such behaviour.

ID GPS; SIDESLIP; IMPLEMENTATION; SLIP
AB Active safety systems must be used to manipulate the dynamics of autonomous vehicles to ensure safety. To this end, accurate vehicle information, such as the longitudinal and lateral velocities, is crucial. Measuring these states, however, can be expensive, and the measurements can be polluted by noise. The available solutions often resort to Bayesian filters, such as the Kalman filter, but can be vulnerable and erroneous when the underlying assumptions do not hold. With its clear merits in handling nonlinearities and uncertainties, moving horizon estimation (MHE) can potentially solve the problem and is thus studied for vehicle state estimation. This paper designs an unscented Kalman filter, standard MHE, modified MHE, and recursive least squares MHE to estimate critical vehicle states, respectively. All the estimators are formulated based upon a highly nonlinear vehicle model that is shown to be locally observable. The convergence rate, accuracy, and robustness of the four estimation algorithms are comprehensively characterized and compared under three different driving maneuvres. For MHE-based algorithms, the effects of horizon length and optimization techniques on the computational efficiency and accuracy are also investigated.

ELA combines conventional lane guidance systems with a threat assessment module that tries to activate the lane guidance interventions according to the actual risk level of lane departure. The goal is to only prevent dangerous lane departure maneuvers. The ELA safety function is based on a statistical method that evaluates a list of safety concepts and tries to maximize the impact on accident statistics while minimizing development and hardware component costs. ELA. runs in a demonstrator and successfully intervenes during lane changes that are likely to result in a collision and is also able to take control of the vehicle and return it to a safe position in the original lane. It has also been tested on 2000 km of roads in traffic without giving any false interventions.

AB This paper proposes a new approach to cope with the kinematic nonlinearity in the H infinity vehicle path-tracking controller synthesis problem. The kinematic nonlinearity presented in the vehicle lateral error state is found to satisfy the sector-bound condition. By isolating the sector-bounded nonlinearity via an upper linear fractional transformation (LFT), a Lur'e system is formulated. A nominal robust controller is synthesized to meet both the Popov- H infinity criterion and the regional pole placement requirement. A polytopic gain-scheduling technique is subsequently employed to accommodate the effect of the varying vehicle longitudinal velocity. Finally, an instant-turning maneuver and a sharp lane-changing maneuver are tested in carsim-simulink joint simulations whose results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Popov- H infinity controller over a conventional H infinity controller.

AB This paper is about obtaining stable vehicle platooning by using Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control when the communication is unreliable and suffers from message losses. We model communication losses as independent random events and we propose an original design for the cooperative controller, which effectively mitigates the effects of the losses. Our design explicitly takes into account the stochastic nature of the losses by considering both the average evolution of the system and the stochastic variations around it. The control design promotes both plant stability and string stability of the average error dynamics by an ${H}_{infinity}$ approach, while minimizing the variance of the trajectories around their average. We show by simulations that the proposed controller is able to compensate losses even for high loss probabilities.

AB Performance evaluation is considered as an important part of the unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) development; it helps to discover research problems and improves driving safety. In this paper, a task-specific performance evaluation model of UGVs applied in the Intelligent Vehicle Future Challenge (IVFC) annual competitions is discussed. It is defined in functional levels with a formal evaluation process, including metrics analysis, metrics preprocessing, weights calculation, and a technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation methods. IVFC 2012 is selected as a case study and overall performances of five UGVs are evaluated with specific analyzed autonomous driving tasks of environment perception, structural on-road driving, unstructured zone driving, and dynamic path planning. The model is proved to be helpful in IVFC serial competition UGVs performance evaluation.

AB This letter presents an approach for implementing game-theoretic decision-making in combination with deep reinforcement learning to allow vehicles to make decisions at an unsignalized intersection by use of 2D Lidar to obtain their observations of the environment. The main novelty of this work is modeling multiple vehicles in a complex interaction scenario simultaneously as decision-makers with conservative, aggressive, and adaptive driving behaviors. The game model allows anticipating reactions of additional vehicles to the movements of the ego-vehicle without using any specific coordination or vehicle-to-vehicle communication. The solution of the game is based on cognitive hierarchy reasoning and it uses a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to obtain a near-optimal policy towards a specific goal in a realistic simulator (ROS-Gazebo). The trained models have been successfully tested on the simulator after training. Experiments show that the performance of the lab cars in the real-world is consistent with it in the simulation environment, which may have great significance to improve the safety of self-driving cars, as well as may reduce their dependence on road tests.

AB This paper proposes a lateral lane change obstacle avoidance constraint control simulation algorithm based on the driving behavior recognition of the preceding vehicles in adjacent lanes. Firstly, the driving behavior of the preceding vehicles is recognized based on the Hidden Markov Model, this research uses longitudinal velocity, lateral displacement and lateral velocity as the optimal observation signals to recognize the driving behaviors including lane-keeping, left-lane-changing or right-lanechanging; Secondly, through the simulation of the dangerous cutting-in behavior of the preceding vehicles in adjacent lanes, this paper calculates the ideal front wheel steering angle according to the designed lateral acceleration in the process of obstacle avoidance, designs the vehicle lateral motion controller by combining the backstepping and Dynamic Surface Control, and the safety boundary of the lateral motion is constrained based on the Barrier Lyapunov Function; Finally, simulation model is built, and the simulation results show that the designed controller has good performance. This active safety technology effectively reduces the impact on the autonomous vehicle safety when the preceding vehicle suddenly cuts into the lane.

ID OPTIMAL ENERGY MANAGEMENT
AB With the development of autonomous vehicles, research on energy-efficient eco-driving is becoming increasingly important. The optimal control problem of determining the speed profile of the vehicle for minimizing energy consumption is a challenging problem that necessitates the consideration of various aspects, such as the vehicle energy consumption, slope of the road, and driving environment, e.g., the traffic and other vehicles on the road. In this study, an approach using reinforcement learning was applied to the eco-driving problem for electric vehicles considering road slopes. A novel model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for eco-driving was developed, which separates the vehicle's energy consumption approximation model and driving environment model. Thus, the domain knowledge of vehicle dynamics and the powertrain system is utilized for the reinforcement learning process, while model-free characteristics are maintained by updating the approximation model using experience replay. The proposed algorithm was tested via a vehicle simulation and compared with a solution obtained using dynamic programming (DP), and as well as conventional cruise control driving with constant speed. The simulation results indicated that the speed profile optimized using model-based reinforcement learning had similar behavior to the global solution obtained via DP and energy saving performance compared with cruise control.

DE Autonomous underwater vehicle; AUV transient control; control
   allocation; total control capacity
AB In this paper, the author proposes a noble robust control scheme for an underwater-launched high-speed autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The proposed controller can rapidly stabilize the AUV during the initial stage of instability after launch. AUVs are typically not stable after launch due to large acceleration, deceleration, and roll torque. By adding a suitable over-define control constraint to the control command, we can obtain simple yet robust control performance using a conventional controller that is designed for normal conditions. Preventing the control effort from being monopolized by a single axis is possible by distributing it along the axes in a predetermined ratio. In addition, by over-defining the total control capacity, it was able to achieve the effect of applying the maximum possible control effort when necessary. Simulation and sea test results show that the proposed control scheme is suitable for controlling an AUV after an underwater launch.

AB Autonomous agents are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and are playing an increasing role in wide range of safety-critical systems, such as driverless cars, exploration robots and unmanned aerial vehicles. These agents operate in highly dynamic and heterogeneous environments, resulting in complex behaviour and interactions. Therefore, the need arises to model and understand more complex and nuanced agent interactions than have previously been studied. In this paper, we propose a novel agent-based modelling approach to investigating norm emergence, in which such interactions can be investigated. To this end, while there may be an ideal set of optimally compatible actions there are also combinations that have positive rewards and are also compatible. Our approach provides a step towards identifying the conditions under which globally compatible norms are likely to emerge in the context of complex rewards. Our model is illustrated using the motivating example of self-driving cars, and we present the scenario of an autonomous vehicle performing a left-turn at a T-intersection.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB LiDAR has become an indispensable sensor for autonomous vehicles due to its unique properties. The clustering of non-ground point clouds, as an essential step of the perceptual processing pipeline, is crucial to the safe driving of autonomous vehicles. However, some existing methods are prone to over-clustering, insufficient clustering, or poor real-time performance. Therefore, we propose a coarse-to-fine clustering strategy to balance clustering accuracy and speed. We first propose a clustering method based on angle and distance judgment to rough process the point cloud and then use the clustering method based on breakpoint detection to refine the point cloud. We evaluate the proposed method on two public data sets to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. Through quantitative comparison, we find that the average processing time of each frame in the two data sets is about 14 ms, which can meet the real-time requirements of automatic driving.

AB Detailed specifications of urban traffic from different perspectives and scales are crucial for understanding and predicting traffic situations from the view of an autonomous vehicle (AV). We suggest a data-driven specification scheme for maneuvers at different design elements of the built infrastructure and focus on urban roundabouts in Germany. Based on real observations, we define classes of maneuvers, interactions and driving strategies for cyclists, pedestrians and motorized vehicles and define a matrix for merging different maneuvers, resulting in more complex interactions. The sequences of these interactions, which partially consist of explicit communications, are extracted from real observations and adapted into microscopic traffic flow simulations. The simulated maneuver sequences are then visualized in 3D environments and experienced by bicycle simulator test subjects. Using trajectory segments (in fictional space) from two conducted simulator studies, we relate the recorded movement patterns of test subjects with observed cyclists in reality.

AB We investigate the problem of controlling the probability density of the state of a process that is observed by the controller via a fixed but unknown scalar non-negative function of the state. The goal is to control the process so that its probability density at a point in the state-space becomes proportional to the value of the function observed at that point. Our solution, inspired by bacterial chemotaxis, involves a randomized controller that switches among different deterministic modes. We show that under appropriate existence conditions, this controller guarantees convergence of the probability density to the desired function. The results can be applied to the problem of in loco optimization of a measurable signal using a team of autonomous vehicles that measure the signal but do not have access to position measurements. Alternative applications in the area of mobile robotics include deployment and environmental monitoring.

AB The time-sampling control strategy has communication discontinuities in the control of multiple AUVs (autonomous underwater vehicles). To overcome this problem, a distributed event-triggered communication mechanism is proposed to make each AUV communicate only when its own state is updated, which reduces the frequency of communication and improves the stability. This mechanism has better adaptability for formation control between heterogeneous AUV groups. At the same time, two consistency control algorithms based on event-triggered for homogeneous and heterogeneous AUV groups are studied, respectively. The known consistency algorithms are applied to the control of heterogeneous AUV groups for comparative analysis. The simulation results demonstrate that the number of communication among AUVs under the event-triggered control strategy can be significantly reduced. Therefore, the stability of the system is improved. Compared with the traditional consensus algorithm, the algorithm proposed in this paper has advantages in the control of heterogeneous AUV groups.

ID DYNAMICS; STABILITY; DESIGN; SYSTEM
AB This paper presents a fuzzy fixed-time learning path tracking control strategy for autonomous vehicles with saturated input and uncertainties. First, Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) model is designed to realize an accurate description of the nonlinear path tracking systems. The T-S model is the weighted sum of a series of linear dynamics models. The weighting coefficients are described by fuzzy membership functions. Then, with the consideration of the saturated input, a fixed-time learning control is proposed. It contains a learning law to estimate the uncertainties of the system on-line. The fixed-time convergence and the robustness properties are analyzed through Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control method has been verified through the CarSim/Simulink co-simulations under different driving conditions. The results demonstrate that the developed controller significantly improves the performance of path tracking and follows the desired path well even in the case of parameter uncertainties and external disturbances.

ID SLIDING MODE CONTROL; PERTURBATION OBSERVER; DESIGN
AB In the underwater environment, robust control algorithms are required to control autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) at high speed while preventing large nonlinearities and disturbances. Sliding mode control (SMC) is a well-known robust control theory and has been widely used not only in AUV control but also in systems such as industrial robots which have high nonlinearity in their system dynamics. However, SMC has the disadvantage of causing chattering on the control input, and it is difficult to apply this method to the control fins of an AUV system that cannot move its fins at high speed underwater. In this work, a design for a sliding mode control with sliding perturbation observer (SMCSPO) algorithm is applied to AUVs, and the simulation results under underwater disturbance conditions are discussed. From simulation using MATLAB, it is confirmed that AUV control using SMCSPO shows better trajectory tracking control performance without chattering than PID control.

AB This paper develops a new approach for solving optimal time and energy trajectory planning problems for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in transient, 3D, ocean currents. Realistic forecasts using an Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM) are used for this purpose. The approach is based on decomposing the problem into a minimal time problem, followed by minimal energy subproblems. In both cases, a non-linear programming (NLP) formulation is adopted. The scheme is demonstrated for time-energy trajectory planning problems in the Gulf of Aden. In particular, the numerical experiments illustrate the capability of generating Pareto optimal solutions in a broad range of mission durations. In addition, the analysis also highlights how the methodology effectively exploits both the vertical structure of the current field, as well as its unsteadiness, namely to minimize travel time and energy consumption.

AB This article presents the process used to develop safety envelopes and subsea traffic rules for autonomous remotely operated vehicles (AROVs) used in subsea inspection, maintenance, and repair (IMR) operations. Preventing loss of subsea assets and the AROV is the overall goal of the proposed safety envelopes and subsea traffic rules. Currently, no such envelopes and rules exist. The safety envelope for the AROV is constructed using an Octree method. The proposed subsea traffic rules are derived by combining existing traffic regulations in marine and aviation industries. The proposed safety envelopes and traffic rules are tested using both a novel modular open robot simulation engine (MORSE) based underwater simulator and in the laboratory. The results from the laboratory tests show that the proposed safety envelopes and subsea traffic rules can be used during simulated or real IMR operations to recommend subsea traffic rules to the AROV and the human supervisor.

The proposed algorithm consists of an adaptive subcontroller to tackle the parametric uncertainties and a robust term to vanish the effects of unstructured uncertainties and disturbances. The resulting robust adaptive controller ensures the convergence of tracking error, without any assumption on the upper bound of perturbations in the design procedure. The closed loop stability is shown, using the Lyapunov stability theorem, and verified by various simulations.

AB The integration of Connected Cruise Control (CCC) and wireless Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication technology aims to improve driving safety and stability. To enhance CCC's adaptability in complex traffic conditions, in-depth research into intelligent asymmetrical control design is crucial. In this paper, the intelligent CCC controller issue is investigated by jointly considering the dynamic network-induced delays and target vehicle speeds. In particular, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based controller design method is introduced utilizing the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm. In order to generate intelligent asymmetrical control strategies, the quadratic reward function, determined by control inputs and vehicle state errors acquired through interaction with the traffic environment, is maximized by the training that involves both actor and critic networks. In order to counteract performance degradation due to dynamic platoon factors, the impact of dynamic target vehicle speeds and previous control strategies is incorporated into the definitions of Markov Decision Process (MDP), CCC problem formulation, and vehicle dynamics analysis. Simulation results show that our proposed intelligent asymmetrical control algorithm is well-suited for dynamic traffic scenarios with network-induced delays and outperforms existing methods.

A personalized path generation approach is created to obtain the expected paths of drivers with different driving styles. Historical driving data and road features are used to calculate the waypoints that characterize driving styles. Then, a robust H-infinity output-feedback controller is designed to follow the generated paths. A solution based on matrix partition is provided to compute the output-feedback control gains without using the vehicle lateral velocity signal, which facilitates the practical implementation of the designed controller. The proposed driving strategy is validated in CarSim simulations and scaled car experiments. The results show the personalized paths can match with drivers' driving styles and can be tracked by the designed output-feedback path-following controller.

AB Trajectory prediction for the steering of autonomous vehicles means that the positioning of a vehicle on the road is based on an evaluation of the current road environment. As a crucial part of such estimations, road trajectory evaluation plays an important role in setting the trajectory of the vehicle.
   A trajectory prediction model based on combinations of vertical and horizontal curves can be established, based on the trajectory study of the drivers' responses for different road radii and slope. A virtual road simulation was designed in UC-winRoad and real-time test drive data were obtained using a driving simulator. The trajectories were fitted to curvature arcs and, based on the radius of the curve, the slope of the road, and the turning direction, the radius of prediction model were determined, thereby obtaining the vehicle trajectory.

AB Truck platooning can potentially make road freight transportation safer and greener. Technological readiness, business opportunities, and acceptance of truck platooning have mainly been studied for multilane highways with ample truck volumes. Less is known about truck platooning in areas with low traffic volumes and challenging roads and weather conditions. This paper investigates the opportunities and barriers for truck platooning on Norwegian rural freight routes, through stakeholder interviews and realistic case examples. Given modest freight volumes, dispersed industry clusters, and challenging road conditions, this study identified several prerequisites to deploying platooning and achieving economic savings. The paper discusses the future steps required to organize platooning across carriers, ensure appropriate infrastructure, and gain acceptance among truck drivers, motorists, and other road users.

AB In this paper, a model predictive control (MPC). with guaranteed stability is used for controlling an active front steering system in an autonomous vehicle. At each control interval, it is assumed that by using information obtained from the sensors on the vehicle, a trajectory is known over a finite horizon, and then it is the predictive controller duty to compute the front steering angle as the control input until the vehicle follows the trajectory. In addition, for reducing computational load of implementing the controller we convert the MPC optimization problem into linear matrix inequality (LMI) form so the problem can be solved more efficiently. The effectiveness of the proposed MPC formulation is demonstrated by simulation. A comparison is made between the time consumed for solving LMI form of the problem and another approach of solving.

AB Autonomous interaction with the underwater environment has increased the interest of scientists in the study of control structures for lightweight underwater vehicle-manipulator systems. This paper presents an essential comparison between two different strategies of designing control laws for a lightweight underwater vehicle-manipulator system. The first strategy aims to separately control the vehicle and the manipulator and hereafter is referred to as the decoupled approach. The second method, the coupled approach, proposes to control the system at the operational space level, treating the lightweight underwater vehicle-manipulator system as a single system. Both strategies use a parallel position/force control structure with sliding mode controllers and incorporate the mathematical model of the system. It is demonstrated that both methods are able to handle this highly non-linear system and compensate for the coupling effects between the vehicle and the manipulator. The results demonstrate the validity of the two different control strategies when the goal is located at various positions, as well as the reliable behaviour of the system when different environment stiffnesses are considered.

ID 5G HETNETS
AB With the anticipated arrival of autonomous vehicles, supporting vehicle generated data traffic due to the dramatically increased use of in-vehicle mobile Internet access will become extremely challenging in 5G-based vehicular networks. This is mainly due to the high mobility of vehicles on the road and the high complexity of 5G HetNets. In order to support the increasing traffic and improve Het-Net management, an SDN enabled 5G VANET is proposed in this article, where neighboring vehicles are clustered adaptively according to real-time road conditions using SDN's global information gathering and network control capabilities. With proposed dual cluster head design and dynamic beamforming coverage, both trunk link communication quality and network robustness of vehicle clusters are significantly enhanced. Furthermore, an adaptive transmission scheme with selective modulation and power control is proposed to improve the capacity of the trunk link between the cluster head and base station. With cooperative communication between the mobile gateway candidates, the latency of traffic aggregation and distribution is also reduced. Computer simulation results show that the proposed design substantially improved 5G users' bit error rate and trunk link throughput rate.

ID VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper presents a concept, herein called Combined Alternate-Direction Lane Assignment and Reservation-based Intersection Control (CADLARIC), for organizing directionally unrestricted traffic flows in automated vehicle environment. In the proposed concept, vehicles can use lanes traditionally reserved for the opposite direction of travel. This concept allows left and right turning vehicles to align themselves in an appropriate lane before reaching the downstream intersection, so that they can smoothly go through the intersection without having any conflicts with vehicles from the other movements. Conflicts between through movements are handled by a reservation-based algorithm. To simulate the proposed concept, i.e. allow flexibility of such driving maneuvers that cannot be accomplished in the other existing simulation tools, a new microsimulation platform is developed. The proposed CADLARIC control scheme is evaluated through a comparison with a conventional fixed-time signal control and Fully Reservation-Based Intersection Control (FRIC). The results show that CADLARIC: (i) significantly outperforms other control methods in terms of the traffic performance (i.e. delays and stops); and (ii) generates a reduction of conflicting situations at the network level when compared to FRIC.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) object detection based on point cloud data plays a critical role in the perception system of autonomous driving. However, this task presents a significant challenge in terms of its practical implementation due to the absence of point cloud data from automotive-grade hybrid solid-state LiDAR, as well as the limitations regarding the generalization ability of data-driven deep learning methods. In this paper, we introduce SimoSet, the first vehicle view 3D object detection dataset composed of automotive-grade hybrid solid-state LiDAR data. The dataset was collected from a university campus, contains 52 scenes, each of which are 8 s long, and provides three types of labels for typical traffic participants. We analyze the impact of the installation height and angle of the LiDAR on scanning effect and provide a reference process for the collection, annotation, and format conversion of LiDAR data. Finally, we provide baselines for LiDAR-only 3D object detection.

AB Detecting and tracking dynamic objects in a scene using point cloud data collected by LiDAR and estimating the motion state of objects with high accuracy are challenges for autonomous driving technology. In this study, a motion detection method based on point cloud registration is investigated to detect motion through the overlapping relationship between source and target point clouds after registration and extract moving objects using clustering and scale analysis by combining the object information of interest acquired by deep learning networks. Next, object association is achieved by object motion information and geometric and texture features. Then, a point cloud registration method flow is designed to estimate the motion state of the object with high accuracy by point cloud registration. The detection, tracking and estimation of the accurate motion state of moving objects are achieved.

AB Cooperative hunting of multi-autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is an important research topic. Current studies concentrate on AUVs with the same speed abilities and mostly do not consider their speed differences. In fact, AUVs in a hunting group are often of different types and possess different maximum sailing speeds. For inhomogeneous multi-AUV, a novel time competition mechanism is proposed to construct an efficient dynamic hunting alliance. Hunting team with AUVs possessing higher speed abilities is more suitable for the vast underwater environment. In the pursuing stage, AUV needs to act fast enough to avoid the escape of evader. To achieve a quick and accurate pursuit, a combined path planning approach is presented, which combines a Glasius bio-inspired neural network model and a belief function. Simulation experiments demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithm in the cooperative hunting of inhomogeneous multi-AUV under dynamic underwater environment with intelligent evaders and multi-obstacle.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Chinese calligraphy seem like two completely unrelated subjects in today's world. UAV, as one of the most advanced technology to date, has gathered much attention lately due to its potentially unlimited applications. Contrarily, Chinese calligraphy is one of the most beautiful and ancient calligraphy art originally developed from China few thousand years ago. Today in this manuscript, we present to you the art of autonomous calligraphy writing with UAVs. The proposed UAV calligraphy system is able to trace the user handwritten inputs, and then execute the writing by mimicking the user handwriting with four autonomous UAVs. This manuscript details the design considerations and implementation process of such a system. The UAV calligraphy system was performed in Singapore Airshow 2014. Robustness and reliability of the system has been well tested, and high performance can be seen from the resulting calligraphy writing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The main focus of this article is the motion planning problem for a deeply submerged rigid body. The equations of motion are formulated and presented by use of the framework of differential geometry and these equations incorporate external dissipative and restoring forces. We consider a kinematic reduction of the affine connection control system for the rigid body submerged in an ideal fluid, and present an extension of this reduction to the forced affine connection control system for the rigid body submerged in a viscous fluid. The motion planning strategy is based on kinematic motions; the integral curves of rank one kinematic reductions. This method is of particular interest to autonomous underwater vehicles which cannot directly control all six degrees of freedom (such as torpedo-shaped autonomous underwater vehicles) or in case of actuator failure (i.e. under-actuated scenario). A practical example is included to illustrate our technique.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH

ID DYNAMIC APPROACH; NEURAL FIELDS; BEHAVIOR; CRICKET; ROBOT
AB How can low-level autonomous robots with only very simple sensor systems be endowed with cognitive capabilities? Specifically, we consider a system that uses seven infrared sensors and five microphones to avoid obstacles and acquire sound targets. The cognitive abilities of the vehicle consist of representing the direction in which a sound source lies. This representation supports target detection, estimation of target direction, selection of one out of multiple-detected targets, storage of target direction in short-term memory, continuous updating of memory, and deletion of memorized target information after a characteristic delay. We show that the dynamic approach (attractor dynamics) employed to control the motion of the robot can be extended to the level of representation by using dynamic neural fields to interpolate sensory information. We show how the system stabilizes decisions in the presence of multivalue sensorial information and activates and deactivates memory. Smooth integration of this target representation with target acquisition, in the form of phonotaxis, and obstacle avoidance is demonstrated.

AB While checking functional correctness for automated driving is often achieved through vast amounts of automated and manual field testing, automating specification verification is essential for developing and releasing fully self-driving vehicles. This paper presents an automatic bounded model checking approach for functional specifications over longitudinal vehicle controller implementations. The proposed method checks the actual embedded program, rather than an extracted abstract model. The specification is converted into a monitor that is interleaved with the execution of the program over a finite time horizon in closed-loop simulation. A decomposition is proposed to tackle the verification complexity. This allows verifying the program for whole parameter sets using a software model checker as opposed to testing only individual samples. The approach is capable of identifying functional flaws in several exemplary longitudinal controllers with variable complexity. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a novel Iterated Extended Set Membership Filter (IESMF) with an application to relative localization. For safe operation of formations of automatic vehicles, consistent uncertainty estimates are of crucial importance. Here, a localization filter that provides ellipsoidal regions that are guaranteed to contain another vehicles position is presented. The proposed iterative update step can appreciably reduce the size of the a posteriori state ellipsoid. The idea of using SIVIA as a baseline to quantify conservativeness is introduced. Another novelty is that we take into account parametric uncertainty of the observation equation. The proposed filter is applied to a two unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) localization problem in simulation with observation noise obtained from real sensors. Simulation results illustrate the effective reduction of filter conservativeness by a small number of iterative updates.

AB This work aims to analyze the specific application of sensor environment perception based on the Kalman filter algorithm in intelligent vehicles. Hence, this work proposes a design for a multi-sensor environment perception and adaptive cruise control (ACC) system based on the Kalman filter algorithm. The system utilizes multiple sensors to collect data and employs the Kalman filter algorithm to process the data, enabling obstacle detection and tracking. This provides a new solution for environmental perception in intelligent vehicles. Meanwhile, combined with ACC technology, the vehicle speed is adjusted to achieve a safe and efficient autonomous driving experience. The experimental results indicate that the system using the Kalman filter algorithm performs in various scenarios, including different weather conditions, road conditions, and obstacle detection. This work achieves high detection accuracy and tracking precision, with the highest values reaching 97.5% and 96.3%, respectively. In the tests, the ACC system can maintain an appropriate following distance and control the vehicle speed well, whether it is a car, a large truck, or a motorcycle. This work has crucial reference value and promotion significance for developing intelligent vehicle technology.

AB Trajectory prediction is essential for the safe driving of autonomous vehicles. With the advancement of advanced sensors and deep learning technologies, attempts have been made to reflect complex interactions. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction method that reflects traffic light conditions in complex urban intersection situations. Based on existing state-of-the-art research, the multi-path of multi-agents was predicted using a generative model, and the actor's trajectory information, state, social interaction, and traffic light state, and scene context were reflected. Performance evaluation was conducted using metrics commonly used to evaluate the performance of stochastic trajectory prediction models. This study is meaningful in that trajectory prediction was performed by reflecting realistic elements of traffic lights in a complex urban environment. Future research will need to be conducted on efficient ways to reduce time and computational performance while reflecting different real-world environments.

AB This paper proposes a robust trajectory tracking control method for an X-rudder autonomous underwater vehicle subject to imprecise model parameters, unknown disturbances, and actuator uncertainty. The control scheme consists of a kinematics controller, dynamics controller, and rudder allocator constructed using backstepping techniques. The kinematics controller employs a line-of-sight guidance law, while the dynamics controller uses integral sliding mode and a Radial Basis Function Neural Network to handle modeling errors and unknown disturbances. Finally, a Recursive Least Square Control Allocation method is developed to minimize the allocation error considering the uncertainty in the control effectiveness matrix by solving a dual second -order cone programming problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the RBFNN-based trajectory tracking method achieves satisfactory performance in the presence of time-varying environmental disturbances, and the Recursive Least Square Control Allocation method effectively deals with actuator uncertainty.

The methodology for working with an AUV in the extreme conditions of Antarctica and the technical solutions used to visually assess the distribution of bottom animals are discussed. The results of processing the data obtained by AUV during deep-sea missions in the Atlantic sector of the Antarctic during the expedition of the RV Akademik Mstislav Keldysh (cruise 79) in 2020 are presented. At the same time, the data of image analysis and trawl catch were compared. Based on the experience gained, the requirements to be implemented in the new AUV MMT-3500, which is designed and manufactured to effectively carry out deep-sea research in subsequent expeditions in the Southern Ocean, are determined.

AB This article examines a period of experimentation in transportation technology and policy in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as the city transitioned from a finalist position in an interurban "smart city" competition to an autonomous vehicle research venture with Uber. Drawing upon analysis of policy documents, review of press accounts, and interviews with local stakeholders, I focus specifically on the contestation that emerged from the efforts of city leaders to advance an ideal of "inclusive innovation" throughout this phase of Pittsburgh's development agenda. I argue that the experimental ethos of smart city approaches compounded by the economic imperatives of entrepreneurial urbanism challenged attempts to connect the city's innovation agenda to inclusive development goals and introduced tensions over local autonomy at multiple stages of the process. The Pittsburgh case poses broader implications for efforts to promote equitable development within technocratic and entrepreneurial smart city programs.

AB This paper proposes a system providing city-logistic services, based on the use of autonomous-connected platoons consisting of delivery vans. The proposed system is tested using a microsimulation. The focus of the analysis lies on the travel times of the delivery vans. The travel time is examined focusing on three parameters related to the size and number of platoons, and number of non-platoon vehicles. The most dominant parameter found is the number of platoons in the system. This parameter has two contradicting effects: increasing this number can decrease the waiting time while switching between platoons, but at the same time increases the intersection delay. A comparison to non-platoon scenarios, representing the current state shows that the proposed system can improve in some cases the current state of the network. In addition to model development, this work also includes the development of an algorithm for regulating the behavior of platoons in roundabouts.

AB Designing non-linear model predictive control (NMPC) laws for controlling multiple autonomous surface vessels in arbitrary formations in environments containing obstacles are reported in this paper. Two leader-follower decentralized geometrical control schemes that are required for defining a unique two-dimensional formation are considered. A three-degree-of-freedom dynamic model of surface vessels has been used for the controller design. It is assumed that the surface vessels are under-actuated and obstacles are present in the vessels' work environment. The real-time optimization abilities of the NMPC method has been used to improve the response of the unactuated DOF of the vessels and to directly incorporate the local obstacle avoidance into the formation control eliminating the need for an external local obstacle avoidance algorithm. This leads to more effective obstacle avoidance decisions based on the dynamics of the vehicle. The effectiveness the developed control law, even in the presence of model uncertainty and external disturbances are demonstrated via computer simulations.

In this paper, 3 representative experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the HS. The first experiment is navigation by HS. AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles) take images of all inspection targets and navigational accuracy is estimated. The second experiment deals with obstacle avoidance. In case the smart cable is entangled within obstacles, AUV disentangle the cable and modify the plan for avoidance. The last experiment is the high-speed scanning by HS. AUV make a formation to generate the panoramic image and scan the tank wall surface. Finally, we estimate the accuracy of the mosaicked image they have developed.

AB This article focuses on the fixed-time trajectory tracking problem for surface vehicles (SVs) with prescribed performance. First, to realize prescribed performance, the error transformation and fixed-time prescribed performance function are proposed. In this way, the constrained tracking error problem can be solved by the stabilization of the transformed system. Second, by introducing a reduced-order disturbance observer, a fixed-time sliding mode controller is developed to realize trajectory tracking control while satisfying both predefined performance and perturbance rejection. It notices that the associated settling time can be preselected by parameters and independent of system initial conditions. Finally, some simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.

AB An accurate road topological structure is of great importance for autonomous driving in complex urban environments. Currently, most autonomous vehicles highly rely on the High-Definition map (HD map) to cruise across the city. Without the prior map, it's hard for vehicles to find right-turning and left-turning ways in large intersections. However, due to the complexity of intersections, producing such a map by human resources is time-consuming and error-prone. In this letter, we proposed a framework to automatically produce the topological map of complicated intersections. This framework adopts the crowdsourcing way to collect semantic information about the environment and traffic flows. The topological structure is inferred from traffic flows correctly and automatically. We highlight that this framework is highly automatic and scalable, which can greatly speed up HD map production and decrease the cost. The proposed system is validated by real-world crowdsourcing data and the result is comparable to the traditional HD maps.

AB A navigation system is critical for the operation of autonomous vehicles. Various sensors must be used to build navigation systems. To fuse multiple sensors, a highly advanced filter algorithm is required. Navigation systems have difficulties in signal-degraded scenarios, where the navigation solution can be degraded by errors such as multipath and obscured signals. This paper proposes a navigation system using a technique to reject the outliers measured by sensors. The navigation system was designed to include sensor modeling, navigation filters, and outlier rejection. The sensors used in the navigation system are the accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and global positioning system. Before the experiment, a navigation simulation was performed to evaluate the results and validate the proposed navigation algorithm. The results of the experiment verified that the navigation system, including outlier rejection, had less positional error than that of the general navigation system.

AB This paper presents a novel approach to state estimation based on particle filter dealing with measurement data effected by non-Gaussian, multimodal noise. The implementation focusses on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) utilizing data of a magnetic compass and a mechanical scanning sonar for spatial navigation. Nowadays, particle filter approaches often require complicated feature extraction methods culminating in semantic interpretation of the data. This is not suitable for low-cost and low-weight AUVs, because these steps require high computational power. Therefore, efficient CPUs and higher power delivery are required. To test the novel approach, the algorithm is simulated in different scenarios with different parameters. Additionally, the filter is applied to real environment data. Finally, the performance is tested and evaluated by several methods. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and superiority of our method over other approaches through simulations.

AB This paper presents an optimized rapidly exploring random tree A* (ORRT-A*) method to improve the performance of RRT-A* method to compute safe and optimal path with low time complexity for mobile robots in partially known complex environments. OFtRT-A* method combines morphological dilation, goal-biased RRT, A* and cubic spline algorithms. Goal-biased RRT is modified by introducing additional step-size to speed up the generation of the tree towards the goal after which A* is applied to obtain the shortest path. Morphological dilation technique is used to provide safety for the robots while cubic spline interpolation is used to smoothen the path for easy navigation. Results indicate that ORRT-A* method demonstrates improved path quality compared to goal-biased RRT and RRT-A* methods. ORRT-A* is, therefore, a promising method in achieving autonomous ground vehicle navigation in partially known environments.

AB The paper deals with the development of indirect adaptive controllers based on Hybrid Neuro-Fuzzy Network (HNFN) approach for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). The non-linear, coupled and time-varying dynamics of AUVs necessitates the development of adaptive controllers. The on-line identification and adaptation of the controller is carried out using the HNFN approach. The methodology uses the input-output data to come up with a structure for the controller and optimal adaptation of the parameters to achieve the required accuracy. The Semi-Serial-Parallel-Model is employed both for identification and control. Initial validation of the identification results are carried out numerically using a mathematical model. Hardware-in-loop (HIL) simulations are presented to validate the controller before carrying out the experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed controller is capable of suitably controlling the AUV in real environment and demonstrate its robust characteristics.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the ideal design for the external and internal shapes of duct-type autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The most important design factors for duct-type AUVs are minimizing the drag force and increasing the thrust because these determine the propulsive efficiency. To improve the propulsive efficiency, the various factors that affect the drag force and thrust of duct-type AUVs were examined. All of the experiments were performed using CFD analysis because physical experiments are inefficient in terms of cost and time. To improve the CFD analysis efficiency, the Taguchi method was used to minimize the number of CFD analyses. Through these processes, design factors that reduce the drag force and increase the thrust according to the external and internal shapes were analyzed. We propose an optimized model that can improve the propulsive efficiency.

AB The potential of angles-only navigation for autonomous orbital rendezvous is discussed. Flight algorithms for a proposed rendezvous guidance, navigation, and control system are presented. Emphasis is placed on the angles-only navigation filter development to determine relative position and attitude between a passive noncooperative target satellite and a maneuvering chaser vehicle. The navigation filter, a 32-state extended Kalman filter, processes angular measurements, from an optical navigation camera along with gyro and star tracker data to estimate the inertial position, velocity, attitude, and angular rates of both vehicles. The filter's performance is evaluated and tested by running a coded prototype in a closed-loop six-degree-of-freedom Monte Carlo simulation containing the various sensors; actuators; guidance, navigation, and control flight algorithms; and dynamics associated with a simple rendezvous scenario. The results include navigation errors, trajectory dispersions, attitude dispersions, and A v usage. The Monte Carlo results are then compared with linear covariance analysis results and the advantages and potential of each approach are discussed.

AB An in situ dissolved manganese (Mn) analyser has been built and used with the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Autosub. The Mn analyser uses a continuous flow system to produce a coloured complex with Mn in seawater, which is measured in a flow-through detection cell. The detection limit of the current system is 25 nmol dm(-3), and using 10-s averaged data, the along-track resolution of the system is about 10 m. The analyser was successfully used with Autosub in Loch Etive, Scotland, to define the three-dimensional distribution of dissolved Mn in sub-surface waters. This application of AUV and sensor technologies in combination demonstrates the great power of the approach for determining the quasisynoptic distribution of chemical species in environments (e.g. under ice, and horizontal space scales at depths of up to 500 km) where more conventional approaches are not appropriate.

AB We propose a new method for generating smooth paths for vehicle path planning. The problem of finding the 'smoothest path'' joining two given configurations is solved (a configuration is a position and a direction). Generally, we solve the problem using two ''simple'' path segments. The most important issue is how to define the smoothness cost of a path. We propose two distinct definitions: the first is the path curvature, and the second is the derivative of the path curvature. We use circular arcs with the first definition, and we use ''cubic spirals'' with the second for ''simple curves'' respectively. The set of cubic spirals has several advantages when used in smooth-path planning, one of which is curvature continuity. This theory also reveals other important concepts in robotics, such as ''symmetric configurations'' and 'symmetric means.'' This algorithm has been successfully implemented an the autonomous mobile robot Yamabico-11 at the University of California at Santa Barbara and at the Naval Postgraduate School.

AB With the rapid advancement of the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology, the collaboration of several autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in large-scale seafloor imaging has become a trending topic. Electromagnetic waves are difficult to transfer underwater, the only viable method of communication is acoustic transmission, but its bandwidth is limited. Therefore, how to compress and process multibeam bathymetry maps so that AUVs can acquire maps gathered by other AUVs has become an important topic of study. This study presents a representation approach for multibeam bathymetry maps based on a quadtree structure. In comparison to the girding approach, the sparse pseudo-input Gaussian processes (SPGPs) method, and the octree-based method, the quadtree-based method suggested in this study preserves precision while compressing storage space. Experiments utilizing field data validate the performance of the proposed technique, and the method's ability to compress storage space towards an AUV cooperative SLAM's scenario.

AB This paper presents a nonlinear model predictive control with terminal cost (NMPC-WTC) algorithm and its open/closed-loop system analysis and simulation validation for accurate and stable path tracking of autonomous vehicles. The path tracking issue is formulated as an optimal control problem. In order to improve the squeezing phenomenon of traditional NMPC, a discrete-time nonlinear model predictive controller with terminal cost is then designed, in which the state error of last step is augmented. The cost function of NMPC-WTC consists of two parts: (1) the traditional NMPC cost function responding to tracking errors and controller output, and (2) the augmented terminal cost. The algorithm was implemented on CasADi numerical optimization framework, which is free, open-source and developed for nonlinear optimization. The open-loop and closed-loop simulation results are then presented to demonstrate the improved performance in tracking accuracy and stability compared to traditional model predictive controller.

AB This paper is concerned with the security sliding mode-based leader-following control of multiple autonomous unmanned underwater vehicles (AUVs) system subject to stochastic DoS attacks. Firstly, a Bernoulli variable is used to describe the phenomenon of stochastic DoS attacks between controllers and actuators, and the attack probability is known for controller design. Secondly, the closed-loop system is established by taking the integral sliding mode control scheme and stochastic DoS attacks into account. Then, the conditions of stochastic stability for system are given by using the stochastic systems analysis method and the model decomposition technique. In the simulation part, a group of AUVs models is used to verify the validity of the proposed state consensus control scheme. The simulation example shows that all the state can achieve consensus even in presence of randomly launched DoS attack.

AB This paper proposes a novel model predictive control (MPC) algorithm that increases the path tracking performance according to the control input. The proposed algorithm reduces the path tracking errors of MPC by updating the sampling time of the next step according to the control inputs (i.e., the lateral velocity and front steering angle) calculated in each step of the MPC algorithm. The scenarios of a mixture of straight and curved driving paths were constructed, and the optimal control input was calculated in each step. In the experiment, a scenario was created with the Automated Driving Toolbox of MATLAB, and the path-following performance characteristics and computation times of the existing and proposed MPC algorithms were verified and compared with simulations. The results prove that the proposed MPC algorithm has improved path-following performance compared to those of the existing MPC algorithm.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Working in collaboration with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle is a new working method for divers. Using gestures to give instructions for the diver is a simple and effective mode of underwater human-robot interaction (HRI). In this paper, a gestures tracking method for under human-robot interaction based on fuzzy control is proposed. Firstly, four object recognition algorithms in terms of gesture recognition are compared. YOLO V4-tiny was an extremely high performance, as the gesture area recognition algorithm. We propose a model based on Siamese Network for gesture classification. A gesture tracking method based on fuzzy control is proposed, analyzing the image from AUV front camera to establish a 3D fuzzy rule set. This method can realize the self-regulation of AUV and keep the diver's gestures in the camera view. The experiment result shows the efficiency of the proposed method.

AB This paper presents a computational model of simulating a deep-sea hydrothermal plume based on a Lagrangian particle random walk algorithm. This model achieves the efficient process to calculate a numerical plume developed in a fluid-advected environment with the characteristics such as significant filament intermittency and significant plume meander due to flow variation with both time and location. Especially, this model addresses both non-buoyant and buoyant features of a deep-sea hydrothermal plume in three dimensions, which significantly challenge a strategy for tracing the deep-sea hydrothermal plume and localizing its source. This paper also systematically discusses stochastic initial and boundary conditions that are critical to generate a proper numerical plume. The developed model is a powerful tool to evaluate and optimize strategies for the tracking of a deep-sea hydrothermal plume via an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV).

AB Automated terrain analysis is required for many practical applications, such as outdoor navigation, image exploitation, remote sensing, reconnaissance and surveillance. In this paper, we present a hierarchical approach to analyze multispectral (MS) imagery for autonomous land vehicle navigation. The approach integrates several strategies to label various terrain classes in these images acquired using twelve spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared spectrum. At the low (pixel) level, it combines texture gradient results from specifically selected channels by varying the size of gradient operators and performing multithresholding and relaxation-based edge linking operations to obtain robust closed region boundaries. At the high (symbolic) level, it makes use of the spectral, locational, and relational constraints among regions to achieve accurate terrain image interpretation. Details of the technique with examples from real imagery collected by an autonomous land vehicle (ALV) are presented. Copyright (C) 1997 Pattern Recognition Society.

AB To better plan for potential impacts of automated vehicles (AV), this study investigates the effects of performance expectancy and experience, based on the Unified Theory of the Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), on willingness to pay for private automated vehicles (PAVs) and intention to use an automated shuttle bus. Using survey data (N = 2658) from Southern Ontario, Canada, experience is separated into two constructs: experience with partially automated vehicles and experience with public transit. Results indicate that the impacts of performance expectancy are strongest, that AV experience and transit experience impact PAV adoption, but that transit experience is only linked with intention to use an automated shuttle bus. Findings paint a complex picture of the application of common technology adoption models to transportation planning, as the notion of 'experience' is multi-dimensional and suggests complex pathways towards shifting from existing mobility options towards new alternatives, such as PAVs and shuttle buses.

AB This paper presents the design and experimental results of a novel output feedback controller for slender-body underwater vehicles. The controller is derived using model-based design techniques. Two separate control plant models are employed: a 3-degree-of-freedom (DOF) current-induced vessel model accounting for the current loads acting on the vehicle and a 5-DOF model describing the vehicle dynamics. The main design objective behind this strategy is to incorporate the vehicle dynamics when estimating the current influence on the vehicle. Furthermore, the transit model is based on the notion of constant propeller revolution resulting in a partly linearized model, which subsequently leads to perspicuous and implementable controller and observer structures. The controller is derived using the observer backstepping technique, and the closed loop is proved to be asymptotically stable using Lyapunov and cascaded systems theory. The control objective is to track the desired pitch and heading angle generated by the line-of-sight guidance system while keeping constant forward thrust. Experimental results demonstrate successful performance of the proposed output feedback controller implemented on the Minesniper MkII AUV/ROV.

AB A triple-band stacked-patch antenna covering dedicated short-range communication (DSRC), fifth-generation (5G) millimeter-wave, and sixth-generation (6G) millimeter-wave frequency bands is reported for autonomous vehicles telematics applications. To show the effectiveness of the developed antenna, the antenna performances, such as the S-parameter, realized gain at boresight, and radiation patterns were simulated and measured for DSRC and 5G, and only simulated for 6G. The simulated results show good agreement with the measured results. The results show that the developed triple-band antenna can cover all three bands with high peak realized gains of 6.87 dBi, 12.3 dBi, and 19.8 dBi at DSRC, 5G, and 6G frequency bands, respectively, as well as high isolation between ports of >20 dB. The results also show a straightforward structure and higher antenna gain than the previously reported triple-band antennas in the simulation level.

ID SYSTEMS; CONSENSUS
AB This paper is concerned with an event-triggered sliding mode control (SMC) scheme for trajectory tracking in autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). First, an event-triggered variable that consists of tracking error, desired trajectory and exogenous input of the reference system is introduced to decrease the magnitude of the robust SMC term. Then, the reaching conditions of the designed event-triggered sliding mode are established. Moreover, the event-triggered induced errors that exist in the rotation matrix of the ASV are analyzed. In the presence of parameter uncertainties and external disturbances, the proposed event-triggered SMC scheme can ensure the control accuracy and low-frequency actuator updates. Then both actuator wear and energy consumption of the actuators can be reduced comparing with the traditional time-triggered controller. The proposed controller not only guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of the tracking error but also ensures non-accumulation of inter-execution times. The results are illustrated through simulation examples. (C) 2021 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Vanishing point (VP) provides extremely useful information related to roads in driving scenes for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles. Existing VP detection methods for driving scenes still have not achieved sufficiently high accuracy and robustness to apply for real-world driving scenes. This paper proposes a robust motion-based road VP detection method to compensate for the deficiencies. For such purposes, three main processing steps often used in the existing road VP detection methods are carefully examined. Based on the analysis, stable motion detection, stationary point-based motion vector selection, and angle-based RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus) voting are proposed. A ground-truth driving dataset including various objects and illuminations is used to verify the robustness and real-time capability of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing motion-based and edge-based road VP detection methods for various illumination conditioned driving scenes.

TI Real-Time Semantic Segmentation for Fisheye Urban Driving Images Based

AB The interest in fisheye cameras has recently risen in the autonomous vehicles field, as they are able to reduce the complexity of perception systems while improving the management of dangerous driving situations. However, the strong distortion inherent to these cameras makes the usage of conventional computer vision algorithms difficult and has prevented the development of these devices. This paper presents a methodology that provides real-time semantic segmentation on fisheye cameras leveraging only synthetic images. Furthermore, we propose some Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) architectures based on Efficient Residual Factorized Network(ERFNet) that demonstrate notable skills handling distortion and a new training strategy that improves the segmentation on the image borders. Our proposals are compared to similar state-of-the-art works showing an outstanding performance and tested in an unknown real world scenario using a fisheye camera integrated in an open-source autonomous electric car, showing a high domain adaptation capability.

AB This brief presents a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) method for the trajectory tracking problem of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). By augmenting the desired output trajectory to a reference dynamical system, the tracking task can fit into the standard NMPC framework, which effectively avoids possible numerical difficulties in the following fast NMPC implementation. To relieve the conflict between short sampling period and high demand of online calculation, Ohtsuka's continuation/generalized minimal residual (C/GMRES) algorithm is investigated. In order to handle the realistic constraints on the AUV thrusters, we incorporate the log barrier functions into the cost function and modify the C/GMRES algorithm. Several different reference trajectories are tested using the identified dynamic model of the Saab SeaEye Falcon open-frame ROV/AUV, which demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed fast algorithm for the AUV tracking control.

AB Starting in January 2009, the RAUVI (Reconfigurable Autonomous Underwater Vehicle for Intervention Missions) project is a 3-year coordinated research action funded by the Spanish Ministry of Research and Innovation. In this paper, the state of progress after 2 years of continuous research is reported. As a first experimental validation of the complete system, a search and recovery problem is addressed, consisting of finding and recovering a flight data recorder placed at an unknown position at the bottom of a water tank. An overview of the techniques used to successfully solve the problem in an autonomous way is provided. The obtained results are very promising and are the first step toward the final test in shallow water at the end of 2011.

AB Consensus formation tracking of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) subject to nonlinear and uncertain dynamics is a challenging problem in robotics. To tackle this challenge, a distributed bioinspired sliding mode controller is proposed in this paper. First, the conventional sliding mode controller (SMC) is presented, and the consensus problem is addressed on the basis of graph theory. Next, to tackle the high frequency chattering issue in SMC scheme and meanwhile improve the robustness to the noises, a bioinspired approach is introduced, in which a neural dynamic model is employed to replace the nonlinear sign or saturation function in the synthesis of conventional sliding mode controllers. Furthermore, the input-to-state stability of the resulting closed-loop system is proved in the presence of bounded lumped disturbance by the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed formation control protocol.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB LiDAR sensors have the advantage of being able to generate high-resolution imaging quickly during both day and night; however, their performance is severely limited in adverse weather conditions such as snow, rain, and dense fog. Consequently, many researchers are actively working to overcome these limitations by applying sensor fusion with radar and optical cameras to LiDAR. While studies on the denoising of point clouds acquired by LiDAR in adverse weather have been conducted recently, the results are still insufficient for application to autonomous vehicles because of speed and accuracy performance limitations. Therefore, we propose a new intensity-based filter that differs from the existing distance-based filter, which limits the speed. The proposed method showed overwhelming performance advantages in terms of both speed and accuracy by removing only snow particles while leaving important environmental features. The intensity criteria for snow removal were derived based on an analysis of the properties of laser light and snow particles.

ID PERSISTENCE; RIGIDITY
AB This paper presents a directed distance-based leader follower formation control of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Unlike most conventional approaches, such as consensus-based method, virtual structure strategy, behaviour-based method; this work exploits a graph based model for formation with a minimally persistent property (no edge can be removed without losing its persistence). Each vertex of the graph represents centre of mass (CoM) of AUV and each of the directed edge between CoMs represents the distance constraint maintained by a follower AUV from its neighbouring leader AUV. For ensuring collision avoidance, path of each AUV is optimized based on desired distances to be maintained by it from its neighbours. The optimized path corresponds to shortest path between current and future position of an AUV. Control torque and force for each AUV can be generated by using the computed values of translational and angular velocities with help of sensors' data and using AUV dynamics.

AB We introduce a genetic algorithm-based topology control mechanism, named 3D-GA, for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) operating in Underwater Sensor Networks (UWSNs). Using limited information collected from a node's local neighbours, 3D-GA runs autonomously at each AUV and provides guidance for its speed and direction towards a uniform spatial distribution while maintaining network connectivity. Imprecise and limited neighbourhood knowledge could potentially disrupt convergence towards a uniform and stable spatial coverage. We demonstrate that AUVs running our 3D-GA create a highly resilient network that can adapt to changing conditions such as the addition, loss or malfunction of number of AUVs. We also show that the ambiguity in detecting neighbours' exact locations does not prevent 3D-GA from achieving a uniform coverage but requiring AUVs travel longer distances to stabilise. Our simulation software results verify that 3D-GA is an effective tool for providing a robust solution for volumetric spatial control of AUVs in UWSNs.

ID CAMERA CALIBRATION
AB The paper evaluates the capability of a neural model to calibrate a digital camera. By calibrate we understand the algorithms that reconstructs the 3D structure of an scene from its corresponding 2D projections in the image plane. The most used 3-D to 2-D geometrical projection models are based in the pin-hole model, a free distortions model. It is based in the correspondence established between the image and the real-world points in function of the parameters obtained from examples of correlation between image pixels and real world pixels. Depending on the sensor used, different kind of chromatic aberrations would appear in the digital image, affecting the brightness or the geometry. To be able to correct these distortions, several theoretical developments based on pin-hole models have been created. The paper proves the validity of applying a neural model to correct the camera aberrations, being unnecessary to calculate any parameters, or any modelling. The calibration of autonomous vehicle navigation system will be used to prove the validity of our model.

AB This work presents the design and implementation of a porous polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based wide-range flexible pressure sensor for autonomous underwater vehicles. The capacitive sensor, with porous PDMS as dielectric, is encapsulated in bulk PDMS polymer. The fabricated sensor was evaluated over a wide pressure range (0-230 kPa), which is similar to pressures experienced up to approx. 23 m below the sea level. The sensors showed linear response when tested in air and near-linear response (98%) when submerged in water. The sensor showed much higher sensitivity (0.375 kPa(-1)) in water than in the air environment. However, the sensor exhibited the performance and sensitivity similar to the air condition (0.005 kPa(-1)) when the readout electronics (encapsulated inside a watertight enclosure) was also submerged inside the water along with the sensor. The fabricated sensor also exhibited fast response and recovery time (190 ms), as well as excellent repeatability and stability (no drift) over tested range of 50 loading and unloading cycles. These results demonstrate the suitability of presented sensors for potential use in applications requiring a wide range of pressure, particularly the underwater robotics where real-time pressure monitoring is critical for autonomous operation.

DT Article
ID CAR-FOLLOWING BEHAVIOR; STRATEGY
AB To achieve more-accurate traffic simulation and autonomous vehicle control, increasing attention recently has been devoted to the analysis of car-following behavior considering leader-follower vehicle types. Firstly, on the basis of a vehicle trajectory data set, distance headway (DHW) and time headway (THW) distributions of leader-follower vehicle type combinations, including car following car (CC), car following truck (CT), truck following car (TC), and truck following truck (TT), were compared to verify their significant differences. Then best-fit distribution models of four combinations were identified in each scenario. Next, characteristics of DHW and THW of four combinations in different speed ranges were determined according to their best-fit distribution models. Finally, the transferability of the results was verified. Results show that DHW and THW of CC and CT can be modeled as log-logistic distributions, and DHW and THW best-fit models of TC and TT are gamma distributions. CF behavior depends more on the following vehicle type when the speed is less than 26 m/s, and the impact of the leading vehicle gradually occurs when the speed is higher than 26 m/s.

AB This article studies how to dimension and control at the system level a fleet of autonomous aerial vehicles delivering goods from depots to customers. Customer requests (jobs) arrive according to a space-time stochastic process. We compute a lower bound for the infrastructure expenditure required to achieve a certain expected delivery time. It is shown that job assignment policies can exhibit a tipping point behavior: One vehicle makes the difference between almost optimal delivery time and instability. This phenomenon calls for careful dimensioning of the system. We thus demonstrate the trade-off between financial costs and service quality. We propose a policy that assigns each incoming job to the vehicle that will do the job faster than other ones, seeking to minimize the overall workload in the system in the long term. This policy is scalable with the number of depots and vehicles, performs optimal in low load, and works well up to high loads. Simulations suggest that it stabilizes the system for any load if the number of vehicles per depot is sufficient.

AB Objective: Accounting for one fifth of all crashes and one sixth of all fatal crashes in the United States, intersection crashes are among the most frequent and fatal crash modes. Intersection advanced driver assistance systems (I-ADAS) are emerging vehicle-based active safety systems that aim to help drivers safely navigate intersections. The objective of this study was to estimate the number of crashes and number of vehicles with a seriously injured driver (Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale [MAIS] 3+) that could be prevented or reduced if, for every straight crossing path (SCP) intersection crash, one of the vehicles had been equipped with an I-ADAS.Methods: This study retrospectively simulated 448 U.S. SCP crashes as if one of the vehicles had been equipped with I-ADAS. Crashes were reconstructed to determine the path and speeds traveled by the vehicles. Cases were then simulated with I-ADAS. A total of 30 variations of I-ADAS were considered in this study. These variations consisted of 5 separate activation timing thresholds, 3 separate computational latency times, and 2 different I-ADAS response modalities (i.e., a warning or autonomous braking). The likelihood of a serious driver injury was computed for every vehicle in every crash using impact delta-V. The results were then compiled across all crashes in order to estimate system effectiveness.Results: The model predicted that an I-ADAS that delivers an alert to the driver has the potential to prevent 0-23% of SCP crashes and 0-25% of vehicles with a seriously injured driver. Conversely, an I-ADAS that autonomously brakes was found to have the potential to prevent 25-59% of crashes and 38-79% of vehicles with a seriously injured driver. I-ADAS effectiveness is a strong function of design. Increasing computational latency time from 0 to 0.5s was found to reduce crash and injury prevention estimates by approximately one third. For an I-ADAS that delivers an alert, crash/injury prevention effectiveness was found to be very sensitive to changes in activation timing (warning delivered 1.0 to 3.0s prior to impact). If autonomous braking was used, system effectiveness was found to largely plateau for activation timings greater than 1.5s prior to impact. In general, the results of this study suggest that I-ADAS will be 2-3times more effective if an autonomous braking system is utilized over a warning-based system.Conclusions: This study highlights the potential effectiveness of I-ADAS in the U.S. vehicle fleet, while also indicating the sensitivity of system effectiveness to design specifications. The results of this study should be considered by designers of I-ADAS and evaluators of this technology considering a future I-ADAS safety test.

The purpose of this study is to analyze public perceptions of autonomous driving and automotive tracking systems. Furthermore, it helps to comprehend why people adopt new technology and offers some recommendations for the global growth of EVs. We used factor analysis considering six distinct factors including Charging Time, Innovation, Perceived Quality, Perceived Affordability, Awareness, and Comfort. Our results indicate that elements including consumer loyalty, power efficiency, charging system, and consumer acceptance have a moderate effect, indicating that these factors do play an important role in influencing consumers' behaviors when it comes to adopting EVs.

AB Automated guided vehicles (AGV) or mobile robots (MR) are being used more and more in modern factories, logistics, etc. To extend the work-time of the robot, kinetic energy recovery systems are implemented to store the braking or lifting energy. In most applications, the energy storage system is a Li-ion battery, which is therefore subjected to increased stress and is also oversized. Super-Capacitors can be used in combination to solve this issue. In this paper, different power distribution systems are analysed and compared, using both single or hybrid storage systems (battery and super-capacitor combined). The comparison is both qualitative, using general system characteristics, and quantitative, using an efficiency/power density Pareto front analysis.

AB Software applications play an important role in vehicle innovation, aiming at improved safety, efficiency, and comfort, and creating the new areas of cooperative intelligent transport systems and autonomous vehicles. To accommodate modem applications, vehicles have become increasingly computerized and connected. Despite the benefits that the adoption of these applications bring to the automotive sector and consumers, automotive applications along with the enabling technological innovation open great challenges to security and privacy. Addressing these challenges is a prerequisite for the acceptance and deployment of innovative applications at a large scale. This survey investigates the main security and privacy challenges for the design of automotive applications and platforms. Based on the main security and privacy requirements and threats identified, we review existing protection mechanisms proposed within the automotive domain. We then identify the main gaps in existing research and draw a roadmap for future research.

AB In this paper a mesoscopic hybrid model, i.e. a microscopic hybrid model that takes into account macroscopic parameters, is introduced for designing a human-inspired Adaptive Cruise Control. A control law is proposed with the design goal of replacing and imitating the behavior of a human driver in a car-following situation where lane changes are possible. First, a microscopic hybrid automaton model is presented, based on human psycho physical behavior, for both longitudinal and lateral vehicle control. Then a rule for changing time headway on the basis of macroscopic quantities is used to describe the interaction among next vehicles and their impact on driver performance. Simulation results show the advantages of the mesoscopic model. A feasibility analysis of the needed communication network is also presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Learning automata; robot learning; autonomous systems
AB Symbolic reasoning is a key component for enabling practical use of data-driven planners in autonomous driving. In that context, deterministic finite state automata (DFA) are often used to formalize the underlying high-level decision-making process. Manual design of an effective DFA can be tedious. In combination with deep learning pipelines, DFA can serve as an effective representation to learn and process complex behavioral patterns. The goal of this work is to leverage that potential. We propose the automaton generative network (AGN), a differentiable representation of DFAs. The resulting neural network module can be used standalone or as an embedded component within a larger architecture. In evaluations on deep learning based autonomous vehicle planning tasks, we demonstrate that incorporating AGN improves the explainability, sample efficiency, and generalizability of the model.

AB This paper investigates an observer-based integral sliding mode control nonlinear connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) system with uncertainties, disturbances, and communication imperfections under the condition of the switched event-triggered (S-ET) scheme. The aim is to guarantee the asymptotic stability and string stability of the CAVs system and improve the tracking performance. Firstly, a nonlinear CAVs dynamic model is established with the uncertainty of the engine time constant and disturbance. Secondly, based on the new model, a framework of switched event-triggered sliding mode controller is presented, which can robustly stabilizing the CAVs with a given level of disturbance attenuation. The obtained controller is complemented by additional conditions established for guaranteeing string stability and avoiding Zeno phenomenon, yielding a valuable CAVs control algorithm. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to verify the theoretical analysis and prove the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

AB The Autonomous Underwater Vehicle's body attitude has a great influence on some specific underwater tasks, such as topographic prospecting, target detection, etc. Therefore, this paper investigates an improved integral sliding mode control (IISMC)-based attitude controller for AUV with model uncertainties and external disturbances to improve the ability of attitude tracking for AUV. To reduce the influence of strong interference on the integral term, the Gaussian function is introduced in integral sliding mode controller. Moreover, the Lyapunov function is used to prove the stability of IISMC-based attitude control law. Finally, the numerical simulations on MATLAB/Simulink are provided to demonstrate the proposed IISMC has smaller tracking error and converges faster than Sliding Mode Control (SMC) and Integral Sliding Mode Control (ISMC)-based attitude-control laws under different disturbances. Better yet, the effectiveness of the proposed IISMC-based attitude control law is tested in field experiments.

AB Safe and accurate navigation for autonomous trajectory tracking of quadrotors using monocular vision is addressed in this paper. A second order Sliding Mode (2-SM) control algorithm is used to track desired trajectories, providing robustness against model uncertainties and external perturbations. The time-scale separation of the translational and rotational dynamics allows to design position controllers by giving a desired reference in roll and pitch angles, which is suitable for practical validation in quadrotors equipped with an internal attitude controller. A Lyapunov based analysis proved the closed-loop stability of the system despite the presence of unknown external perturbations. Monocular vision fused with inertial measurements are used to estimate the vehicle's pose with respect to unstructured scenes. In addition, the distance to potential collisions is detected and computed using the sparse depth map coming also from the vision algorithm. The proposed strategy is successfully tested in real-time experiments, using a low-cost commercial quadrotor.

AB This paper presents an enhanced time-delay controller (TDC) for the position control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) under disturbances. A conventional TDC performswell when the involved data acquisition rate is fast. However, in AUV control applications that use a Doppler velocity log (DVL) navigation system, we cannot keep the data acquisition rate sufficiently fast because a DVL sensor generally supplies data at a slow acquisition rate, which degrades the performance of the TDC. To overcome this problem, we propose an integral sliding-mode controller to be supplemented to the conventional TDC to improve the control precision even if the DVL navigation system is in operation. The proposed controller is computationally simple and robust to unmodeled dynamics and disturbances. We performed computer simulations and experiments with the Cyclops AUV to demonstrate the validity of the proposed controller.

AB Sediment classification was demonstrated using the self-noise of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) received on a short towed array. The adopted approach was to separate the direct path and the surface-and bottom-reflected signals. Electrical interference from the source was used to verify source receiver separation. The amplitude ratio of the bottom reflected to the direct path signal levels, after compensating for the differences in absorption, spreading losses, and beam patterns, yields the bottom-reflection loss, at the applicable grazing angle. The latter is calculated from the travel time difference between the direct path and bottom-reflected signals. The method is self-calibrating, requiring absolute calibration of neither sound source nor receivers. The definitive isolation of the reflected and direct path signals and the self-calibrating property make this approach robust. The reflection loss may be compared to known seabed models to estimate sediment type.

The designed FDO ensures robustness outside the sliding mode surface, while the constructed NFTSM ensures the fast convergence of tracking errors and chattering suppression. The effectiveness and advantages of the designed control strategy are verified by simulation comparison with the existing results under MATLAB/Simulink and CarSim cosimulation environment.

AB An experimental system simulating a free-flying space robot, which has been constructed to study autonomous space robots, is addressed. The experimental system consists of a space robot model, a frictionless table system, a computer system, and a vision sensor system. The robot model is composed of two manipulators and a satellite vehicle and can move freely on a two-dimensional planar table, without friction, using air bearings. The robot model has successfully performed the automatic truss structure assembly, including many tasks, for example, manipulator berthing, component manipulation, arm trajectory control collision avoidance, assembly using force control, etc. Moreover, even if the robot fails in a task planned in advance, the robot replans the task by using reinforcement learning and obtains the task goal. The experiment demonstrates the possibility of the autonomous construction and the usefulness of space robots.

AB This paper reports the design of sliding-mode control laws for controlling multiple small-sized autonomous helicopters in arbitrary formations. Two control schemes, which are required for defining arbitrary three-dimensional formation meshes, are discussed. In the presented leader-follower formation control schemes, each helicopter only needs to receive motion information from at most two neighboring helicopters. A nonlinear six-degree-of-freedom dynamic model has been used for each helicopter. Four control inputs, the main and the tail rotor thrusts, and the roll and pitch moments, are assumed. Parameter uncertainty in the dynamic model and wind disturbance are considered in designing the controllers. The effectiveness and robustness of these control laws in the presence of parameter uncertainty in the dynamic model and wind disturbances are demonstrated by computer simulations.

AB Autonomous Driving (AD) has entered a period of rapid development in recent years. With the amount of sensors and control logics installed increasing tremendously to guarantee robustness, a big challenge is posed for AD middleware. Both the academia and the industry are eager for an investigation of the performance of middlewares in Autonomous Driving Vehicles (AVs). To fill this gap, we summarize typical communication scenarios of AVs and evaluate different communication mechanisms of three popular open-source middlewares comprehensively. Besides, we construct a benchmark pack named ComP which consists of a perception communication scenario and a group of real AD applications for researchers to assess middleware performance. Our findings provide useful guidelines for researchers and insightful optimization advice for designing middlewares.

AB This article presents a consistency control algorithm for the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) group combined with the leader-follower approach under communication delay. First, the six-degree-of-freedom (DoF) model of AUV is represented, and the graph theory is used to describe the communication topology of the AUV group. Especially, a hybrid communication topology is introduced to adapt to large formation control. Second, the distributed control law is constructed by combining the consensus theory with the leader-follower method. The consistency control algorithms for homogeneous and heterogeneous AUV groups based on the leader-follower approach under communication delay are proposed. Stability criteria are established to guarantee the consensus based on the Gershgorin disk theorem and Nyquist law, respectively. Finally, numerous simulation experiments are carried out to show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithms.

AB One of the main challenges that faces the monitoring of maritime structures and ports is related to constantly changing weather and surrounding conditions. These conditions make manual actions very expensive, unreliable and imprecise. To overcome these problems, using Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV) is the best option. In this research, as part of a research project, a stereo vision system was implemented on an ASV to detect and track static and dynamic obstacles. In order to examine the proposed algorithm, two sets of experiments have been designed; first, the ASV moves toward stationary objects to localise all static and dynamic objects. Second, the ASV tracks a target boat, which equipped with an RTK-GPS and estimates relative and absolute positions. The accuracy of the tracking algorithm was evaluated in the digital elevation map, with the lowest RMSE of 1.575, and 0.6621 (m) using raw and EKF data, respectively.

AB A real-time 3-D trajectory planner for the leader-following formation control of autonomous vehicles is proposed. The planner relies on the definition of a trailer body whose hinge point is rigidly attached to the leader and assigns each follower to a distinct point of such a trailer. Convergence results for the trailer body reference frame are presented based on Lyapunov analysis, which guarantee that the planning can be independently implemented by n followers, with a common leader, as they asymptotically behave as n points of a unique trailer body. As such, the need for communication among followers is dispensable. The proposed strategy is divided into trajectory planning and trajectory tracking, the first problem being vehicle-independent. Experimental results obtained with quadrotor vehicles are presented, which demonstrate the richness and suitability of the planned trajectories.

AB In this article the use of neural networks in the identification of models for underwater vehicles is discussed. Rather than using a neural network in parallel with the known model to account for unmodelled phenomena in a model wide fashion, knowledge regarding the various parts of the model is used to apply neural networks for those parts of the model that are most uncertain. As an example, the damping of an underwater vehicle is identified using neural networks. The performance of the neural network based model is demonstrated in simulations using the neural networks in a feed forward controller. The advantages of online learning are shown in case of noise impaired measurements and changing dynamics due to a change in toolskid. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Collision imminent steering is an automotive active safety feature designed to perform an aggressive lane change to avoid a forward collision in the event that the system determines there is insufficient distance to avoid a collision by braking alone.In this paper, a collision imminent steering system is developed using nonlinear model predictive control to perform a lane change at high speed in a highway environment. Two formulations are presented: one formulation to show the theoretical minimum lane change distance within which a safe lane change can be performed, and a second formulation to find the minimum aggressive maneuver for a given lane change distance. The nonlinear model predictive control formulation is posed as a constrained optimization problem, where solutions obey hard safety constraints of the highway environment. Constraint aggregation techniques are analyzed and introduced to monitor the peak tire slip throughout the maneuver. Numerical simulations of a typical luxury sedan in a highway setting show that minimum distance required to change lanes is about half the limit braking distance. Hence, there is a window of feasibility where the vehicle cannot avoid collision by braking alone, but can change lanes safely and maintain a safe trajectory throughout the maneuver. Additional simulations show that an active four wheel steering architecture improves performance over front only steering.

ID POINT CLOUD; END
AB Autonomous driving, in recent years, has been receiving increasing attention for its potential to relieve drivers' burdens and improve the safety of driving. In modern autonomous driving pipelines, the perception system is an indispensable component, aiming to accurately estimate the status of surrounding environments and provide reliable observations for prediction and planning. 3D object detection, which aims to predict the locations, sizes, and categories of the 3D objects near an autonomous vehicle, is an important part of a perception system. This paper reviews the advances in 3D object detection for autonomous driving. First, we introduce the background of 3D object detection and discuss the challenges in this task. Second, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the progress in 3D object detection from the aspects of models and sensory inputs, including LiDAR-based, camera-based, and multi-modal detection approaches. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the potentials and challenges in each category of methods. Additionally, we systematically investigate the applications of 3D object detection in driving systems. Finally, we conduct a performance analysis of the 3D object detection approaches, and we further summarize the research trends over the years and prospect the future directions of this area.

SO EUROPEAN REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Along with the rapid development and proliferation of autonomous robotic weapons, machines are beginning to replace people on battlefields. The use by the USA of Predators or Reapers and other unmanned aerial vehicles in Afghanistan, Pakistan and other places in the world clearly signals a distancing of soldiers from their targets. In this article I concentrate on fully autonomous weapons. The theses of the article are as follows: the use of autonomous weapons would be contrary to the basic and fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, such as the principles of distinction and proportionality, and thus illegal. As such, their use would threaten the wellbeing, life and health of civilians and civilian populations. Their use would undermine the whole concept of the rules of war. Still, there are scholars who are of the opinion that prohibiting the use of autonomous weapons would make no sense at all and that the development of such weapons is inevitable and will take place gradually. Their use would be an expression of the technological dimension of international security. As this article will attempt to demonstrate, the drawbacks of the use of autonomous weapons are of such magnitude that they exclude the legality of such devices.

AB With the growing interest in autonomous driving, constant connectivity for vehicles is becoming essential to enable the complete knowledge of the surrounding area, transmit and receive data that is crucial for the autonomous control. The vehicle mobility results in frequent service interruptions, and therefore, seamless handovers are required to mitigate this problem. Several IP-based solutions have been proposed in the literature, but they require tunneling approaches, which present excessive signaling and data overhead, service delay, and packet loss. One of these approaches, the NEMO-enabled Proxy Mobile IPv6 (N-PMIPv6) architecture, supports transparent handovers and simultaneous multi-homing, but at the cost of a high complexity and network overhead.
   This work explores the flexibility of Software Defined Networks (SDNs) in the management of a Vehicular Ad-hoc NETwork (VANET). In particular, the SDN concept is used to provide a seamless horizontal handover for the vehicle and its end-users. Two different SDN architectures are proposed, evaluating the impact of the depth of the softwarization environment. Real vehicular hardware and emulated mobility scenarios are used in the evaluation process where different application services are exploited. Results show that the lower complexity of the SDN solution allows for a better performance during a handover in a VANET, in terms of delays, packet losses and network overhead, making it seamless for the vehicles and its users.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB This paper presents fault diagnosis logic and signal restoration algorithms for vehicle motion sensors. Because various sensors are equipped to realize automatic operation of the vehicle, defects in these sensors lead to severe safety issues. Therefore, an effective and reliable fault detection and recovery system should be developed. The primary idea of the proposed fault detection system is the conversion of measured wheel speeds into vehicle central axis information and the selection of a reference central axis speed based on this information. Thus, the obtained results are employed to estimate the speed for all wheel sides, which are compared with measured values to identify fault and recover the fault signal. For fault diagnosis logic, a conditional expression is derived with only two variables to distinguish between normal and fault; further, an analytical redundancy structure and a simple diagnostic logic structure are presented. Finally, an off-line test is conducted using test vehicle information to validate the proposed method; it demonstrates that the proposed fault detection and signal restoration algorithm can satisfy the control performance required for each sensor failure.

A series of river and sea trials were conducted from May 2016 to November 2017, and the first rocketsonde was launched from the USSV. Real-time meteorological parameters in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) were obtained, including sea surface temperature, and vertical profiles of the pressure, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction. These data are extremely useful and important for research on air-sea interactions, sea surface heat and latent heat flux estimations, MABL modeling, and marine satellite product validation.

AB The paper focuses-on the control of a small fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) along trajectories. The trajectories are generated in real-time from a library of pre-specified motion primitives. Two concatenated primitive trajectories are considered: one formed from seven primitives and exhibiting a figure-8 geometric path and another composed of a Split-S maneuver that settles into a level-turn trim trajectory. Switched control systems stemming from l(2)-induced norm synthesis approaches are designed for discrete-time linearized models of the nonlinear UAV system. These controllers are analyzed based on simulations in a realistic operational environment and are further implemented on the physical UAV. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates the use of reinforcement learning for the path planning of an autonomous triangular marine platform in unknown environments under various environmental disturbances. The marine platform is over-actuated, i.e. it has more control inputs than degrees of freedom. The proposed approach uses a high-level online least-squared policy iteration scheme for value function approximation in order to estimate sub-optimal policy. The chosen action is considered as the desired input to a fast and efficient low-level velocity controller. We evaluate our approach in a simulated environment, including the dynamic model of the platform, the dynamics and limitations of the actuators, and the presence of wind, wave, and sea current disturbances. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach. Despite the model dynamics, the actuation dynamics and constrains, and the environmental disturbances, the presented results are promising. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Automated parking is a typical function in a self-driving car. The trajectory planning module directly reflects the intelligence level of an automated parking system. Although many competitions have been launched for autonomous driving, most of them focused on on-road driving scenarios. However, driving on a structured road greatly differs from parking in an unstructured environment. In addition, previous competitions typically competed on the overall driving performance instead of the trajectory planning performance. A trajectory planning competition of automated parking (TPCAP) has been recently organized. This event competed on parking-oriented planners without involving other modules, such as localization, perception, or tracking control. This study reports the TPCAP benchmarks, achievements, experiences, and future perspectives.

AB This paper introduces an adaptive method for detecting front vehicles under complex weather conditions. In the field of vehicle detection from images extracted by cameras installed in vehicles, backgrounds with complicated weather, such as rainy and snowy days, increase the difficulty of target detection. In order to improve the accuracy and robustness of vehicle detection in front of driverless cars, a cascade vehicle detection method combining multifeature fusion and convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, local binary patterns, Haar-like and orientation gradient histogram features from the front vehicle are extracted, then principal-component-analysis dimension reduction and serial-fusion processing are performed on the input image. Furthermore, a preliminary screening is conducted as the input of a support vector machine classifier based on the acquired fusion features, and the CNN model is employed to validate cascade detection of the filtered results. Finally, an integrated data set extracted from BDD, Udacity, and other data sets is utilized to test the method proposed. The recall rate is 98.69%, which is better than the traditional feature algorithm, and the recall rate of 97.32% in a complex driving environment indicates that the algorithm possesses good robustness.

AB Autonomous ferry operation in harbor and coastal areas is especially challenging due to the tendency to impose a high traffic density, prohibited areas, and a wide variety of different traffic participants to the automation task. To this end, we propose a concept for automated guidance and control of harbor ferry fleet operation. Subsequently, we differentiate guidance into a central, on-land scheduling unit and an on-ship trajectory planning unit that generates a set of waypoints and corresponding desired speeds by means of a flatness-based optimal control problem. Moreover, static obstacles are taken into account by means of a dual approach and the trajectory planning is linked to the control module realized as a path following model predictive control autopilot, which also handles dynamic obstacles.

AB ADAS and autonomous driving are booming. As technologies continue to innovate and mature, whether travelers understand, accept, and buy them will directly impact the technological development, popularization, and profitability of these products. This study analyzes the influence of urban residents' personal, family, and commuting characteristics on their willingness to choose and pay for ADAS and autonomous driving functions. Using the questionnaire survey data for Jiading and Meishan in China, Logit models are established for willingness to choose, and linear regression models are established for willingness to pay. Although Jiading and Meishan are similar in terms of city size and population, there are some differences in the influencing factors for willingness to choose and pay because of the differences in industrial structure, city culture, and residents' commuting habits. The results show that significant influencing factors vary for different levels of ADAS and autonomous driving functions. The findings of this research can provide a reference for city authorities, designers, and sellers of ADAS products or autonomous vehicles to identify potential buyers and promote related products.

ID DESIGN
AB The autonomous vehicle (AV) is an emerging product of intelligent transportation system. This paper proposes a new parking cost optimization scheme for long-range autonomous valet parking (L-AVP), namely AVPark. The L-AVP selects a drop-off point (as the temporary reference point for people to fetch the AV for traveling purpose) for AV. The user leaves AV at drop-off spot and the AV finds out the most optimal car parks (CPs) itself. The AVPark provides an AV with the most optimal car park considering the parking price, fuel consumption, and distance to a vacant parking space. AVPark aims to minimize the walking distance for drivers, and also the round-trip duration for AV from the drop-off point to car park through a combination of weighted values and heuristic approach. By facilitating the drop-off point that is newly brought into the emerging scenario, an optimization scheme is proposed to minimize the total cost for fuel consumption and traveling time using the weighted value analysis. The results show that AVPark optimized the total trip duration, walking distance, and cost.

We show that the system is able to plan local paths in obstacle fields based on sensor data, to plan and update global paths to goals based on frequent obstacle map updates, and to modify mission execution, e.g., the assignment and ordering of the goals, based on the updated paths to the goals.
   Two recently developed sensors are used for obstacle detection: a high-speed laser range finder, and a video-rate stereo system. An updated version of a dynamic path planner, D*, is used for on-line computation of routes. A new mission planning and execution-monitoring tool, GRAMMPS, is used for managing the allocation and ordering of goals between vehicles.
   We report on experiments conducted in an outdoor test site with two HMMWVs. Implementation details and performance analysis, including failure modes, are described based on a series of twelve experiments, each over 1/2 km distance with up to nine goals.
   The work reported here includes a number of results not previously published, including the use of a real-time stereo machine and a high-performance laser range finder, and the use of the GRAMMPS planning system.

AB Following the widespread interest of both the scientific community and companies in using autonomous vehicles to perform deliveries, we propose the 'Drone-Assisted Vehicle Routing Problem with Robot Stations' (VRPD-RS), a problem that combines two concepts studied in the autonomous vehicles literature: truck-drone tandems and robot stations. We model the VRPD-RS as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) for two different objectives, the makespan and operational costs, and analyze the impact of adding trucks, drones, and robots to the delivery fleet. Given the computational complexity of the problem, we propose a General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS) metaheuristic to solve more realistic instances within reasonable computational times. Results show that, for small instances of 10 customers, where the solver obtains optimal solutions for almost all cases, the GVNS presents solutions with gaps of 0.7% to the solver for the makespan objective and gaps of 0.0% for the operational costs variant. For instances of up to 50 customers, the GVNS presents improvements of 21.5% for the makespan objective and 8.0% for the operational costs variant. Furthermore, we compare the GVNS with a Simulated Annealing (SA) metaheuristic, showing that the GVNS outperforms the SA for the whole set of instances and in more efficient computational times. Accordingly, the results highlight that including an additional drone in a truck-drone tandem increases delivery speed alongside a reduction in operational costs. Moreover, robot stations proved to be a useful delivery element as they were activated in almost every studied scenario.

AB Automated driving of a heavy tractor-trailers vehicle using only low-cost onboard sensors is challenging. Complex system dynamics and towing configuration changes degrade the performance of conventional model-based estimation and control methods. In this article, we propose an onboard-sensor-based automatic control system for a heavy tractor-trailers vehicle used in low-speed industrial applications. First, by introducing a new hitch force sensor, a tractor dynamic state estimator (TDSE) is proposed. It integrates the kinematic and dynamic information sources such that accurate and reactive dynamic states and model parameters of the lead tractor can be obtained simultaneously. Second, building on top of the TDSE, a highly practical integrated dynamic controller (IDC) is developed. It reliably enforces the heavy tractor-trailers vehicle to track the reference path and velocity under any towing situation. The performance of the proposed TDSE and IDC is proved theoretically. TDSE and IDC are also integrated into a full-size tractor-trailers vehicle, and their feasibility and superiority are validated through extensive experiments.

AB In this paper, we propose a method to evaluate Highway Driving Assist (HDA) systems, a type of Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS), using a monocular camera, which eliminates the need of experts or expensive equipment and reduces the time, effort, and cost required in such tests. We use the information from the images captured by the monocular camera, such as the lane and rear tires of the lead vehicle, and from the geometrical composition, including the heading angle and the distance of the camera from the front bumper of the test vehicle. To verify the evaluation method, we used the image and geometric information to calculate the distances of the lead vehicle and the lane center from the test vehicle. We compared and analyzed the method using DGPS (Differential Global Positioning System), Data Acquisition(DAQ) and the method using monocular camera. Therefore, it was determined that the proposed method of evaluating HDA systems using a monocular camera is reliable because of the small margin of error between the theoretical with monocular camera and real vehicle test with DAQ and DGPS.

AB With the consideration of actuator faults, including the unknown steering mechanism misalignments and motor traction losses, this article presents a fixed-time control protocol to follow reference paths and velocities for autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) with preset performance constraints. To provide sufficient large boundaries for the initial states, the hyperbolic tangent function is employed to predefine the constraints with respect to the path-following and velocity control performance. Based on the homeomorphic mapping and barrier Lyapunov theorem, the fixed-time prescribed performance control (PPC) objective-integrated fault-tolerant scheme can be achieved for the controlled AGV. In comparison to three different fixed-time controllers without the fault-tolerant or PPC scheme, the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test results demonstrate that the proposed control protocol can always provide superior control performance for the AGV under various maneuvering conditions.

AB Actuator is critical component of the AUV, the actuator?s fault diagnosis is of great significance to ensure the safe operation of the AUV. Therefore, it is of great important to investigate an intelligent method of AUV. In this research, a diagnostic network combining wide convolutional neural network (WDCNN) and extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed. Firstly, the reliability of the diagnostic network when sailing downstream and upstream is considered, and a network with strong generalization ability is found structure. Secondly, the model does not rely on any domain adaptation algorithm or require information of the target domain. It is verified that WDCNN can effectively extract the deep features of data with high diagnostic accuracy and strong anti noise ability, and ELM can effectively increase the generalization ability of the model. The network can be applied to AUV actuator fault diagnosis. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Photovoltaic-assisted charging station (PVCS) is expected to be one of the important charging facilities for serving electric vehicles (EVs). In this paper, a type of solid-state transformer (SST) is introduced to the PVCS design and an autonomous energy management strategy (EMS) for SST is proposed. This study aims to develop an effective real-time EMS for PVCS participating in ancillary service of smart grid, and the rule-based decision-making method is utilized. Considering the dynamic classification of EVs, an energy-bound calculation (EBC) model is proposed to find the upper and lower bounds of flexible resources. Moreover, considering the EBC results and power command from the aggregator, a charging power allocation algorithm is designed for power distribution of flexible EVs. By case study and experiment analysis, the proposed EMS is effective in real-time energy management and suitable for practical applications.

AB This paper describes a simple and robust engineering approach for the real-time sensing and monitoring of unsteady hydrodynamic loads and moments. Innovative flow diagnostics techniques are used to extract critical flow phenomena such as the state of the boundary layer (laminar, transitional, or turbulent), leading-edge stagnation point (or attachment line), flow separation and reattachment, and vortex pattern and their dynamic characteristics from surface hot-film signatures obtained with multielement, micron-thin surface hot-film sensors operated by a bank of constant voltage anemometers. Unsteady hydrodynamic loads and moments are then obtained as a function of the instantaneous locations of the critical surface signatures. Test results from a few recent experiments are described. The heuristics approach presented here will be useful for the development of closed-loop active control system for advanced autonomous underwater vehicle designs with biologically inspired smart actuators.

AB Automated VEhicles' (BRAVE) in the participating EU-countries France, Germany, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden as well as in Australia and the USA. Including 5,827 respondents, the study findings disclose a rather positive acceptance of CACs from the perspective of different road user groups. However, concerns are also apparent. Results from multivariate analyses indicate that the acceptance of CACs differs between road user groups in that VRUs demonstrated lower acceptance than non-automated car drivers. The role of trust in the new vehicle technology also appears to be significant. Consequently, future developments of CACs should also focus on the communication between automated cars and bystanders (e.g. via external human-machine interfaces) to reduce uncertainties and promote trust.

DT Article
ID DYNAMICS; ERROR; ADAPTATION; MEMORY
AB Vehicles in the foreseeable future will be required to transition between autonomous driving (without human involvement) and full human control. During this transition period, the human, who has not been actively engaged in the driving process, must resume the motor control necessary to steer the car. The in-car study presented here demonstrates that when human drivers are presented with a steering behavior that is different from the last time they were in control, specifically the ratio of hand wheel angle to road wheel angle (emulating a change in vehicle speed), they undergo a significant period of adaptation before they return to their previous steering behavior. However, drivers do not require an adaptation period to return to previous driving behavior after changes in steering torque. These findings have implications for the design of vehicles that transition from automated to manual driving and for understanding of human motor control in real-world tasks.

AB Accurate trajectory prediction of vehicles is essential for reliable autonomous driving. To maintain consistent performance as a vehicle driving around different cities, it is crucial to adapt to changing traffic circumstances and achieve lifelong trajectory prediction model. To realize it, catastrophic forgetting is a main problem to be addressed. In this paper, a divergence measurement method based on conditional Kullback-Leibler divergence is proposed first to evaluate spatiotemporal dependency difference among varied driving circumstances. Then based on generative replay, a novel lifelong vehicle trajectory prediction framework is developed. The framework consists of a conditional generation model and a vehicle trajectory prediction model. The conditional generation model is a generative adversarial network conditioned on position configuration of vehicles. After learning and merging trajectory distribution of vehicles across different cities, the generation model replays trajectories with prior samplings as inputs, which alleviates catastrophic forgetting. The vehicle trajectory prediction model is trained by the replayed trajectories and achieves consistent prediction performance on visited cities. A lifelong experiment setup is established on four open datasets including five tasks. Spatiotemporal dependency divergence is calculated for different tasks. Even though these divergence, the proposed framework exhibits lifelong learning ability and achieves consistent performance on all tasks.

AB The trajectory tracking control strategy for intelligent vehicle is proposed in this article. Considering the parameters perturbations and external disturbances of the vehicle system, based on the vehicle dynamics and the preview follower theory, the lateral preview deviation dynamics model of the vehicle system is established which uses lateral preview position deviation, lateral preview velocity deviation, lateral preview attitude angle deviation, and lateral preview attitude angle velocity deviation as the tracking state variables. For this uncertain system, the adaptive sliding mode control algorithm is adopted to design the preview controller to eliminate the effects of uncertainties and realize high accuracy of the target trajectory tracking. According to the real-time deviations of lateral position and lateral attitude angle, the feedback controller is designed based on the fuzzy control algorithm. For improving the adaptability to the multiple dynamic states, the extension theory is introduced to design the coordination controller to adjusting the control proportions of the preview controller and the feedback controller to the front wheel steering angle. Simulation results verify the adaptability, robustness, accuracy of the control strategy under which the intelligent vehicle has good handling stability.

AB Transfer learning is an important field of machine learning in general, and particularly in the context of fully autonomous driving, which needs to be solved simultaneously for many different domains, such as changing weather conditions and country-specific driving behaviors. Traditional transfer learning methods often focus on image data and are black-box models. In this work we propose a transfer learning framework, core of which is learning an explicit mapping between domains. Due to its interpretability, this is beneficial for safety-critical applications, like autonomous driving. We show its general applicability by considering image classification problems and then move on to time-series data, particularly predicting lane changes. In our evaluation we adapt a pre-trained model to a dataset exhibiting different driving and sensory characteristics.

AB Optical wireless communication (OWC) is one of the promising solution to enhance the capacity of the next generation cellular as well as fiber-wireless (FiWi) broadband access networks. The proposed work aims to complement an OWC system by utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to improve the performance of an integrated terrestrial-air-underwater (TAU) communication framework. Specifically, an integrated FiWi based UAV assisted hybrid free-space optical (FSO) and underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) system is proposed to meet high data rate requirement between a terrestrial ground station and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The performance of the proposed scheme is compared against the conventional radio frequency (RF) based TAU communication framework. We also optimize the divergence angle of the optical beam of FSO link using a novel COgnition-based divergence angle tracking (CODAT) algorithm such that the outage probability of FSO links is minimized and the data rate requirement of AUV is also satisfied. The impact of the position of over-sea surface (OSS) relay and UAV altitude on the performance of the proposed system is also analyzed. Through the obtained results it has been shown that the proposed OWC based integrated TAU communication framework outperforms the conventional RF based TAU communication framework.

AB Autonomous driving will significantly shape the near future of transportation that requires the distinct knowledge of the driving environment, especially the lane boundaries ahead of the vehicle. For this sensing task, optical and automotive radar sensors are mostly applied, while the radar sensor is less sensitive to non-ideal illumination conditions. Road boundaries can be detected by radar sensors through objects like guardrails, delineators, road curbs, and so on. However, in a multi-lane roadway or with missing roadside infrastructure, the adjacent lanes and the road boundary also have to he recognized by the radar sensors. This makes it necessary to integrate appropriate radar reflectors into the lane or road boundaries. Such reflectors, when integrated in the road, should not harm the vehicle tires, so their height shall be low, but they still have to be able to reflect the radar signals properly. Conventional road markings can be accordingly adjusted with such reflectors to support vehicle guidance with radar sensors. In this paper, the scattering property of various types of reflectors is evaluated by simulations over a wide angular and range geometry. The simulation results are analyzed with regard to the view angle influence on the radar cross section. Then, the specimen measurement results will be presented and finally the clustering process will be introduced.

   and Color-constant Imagery
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

DT Article
ID NAVIGATION; VISION; CAMERA; SLAM
AB Visual Teach and Repeat (VT&R) allows an autonomous vehicle to accurately repeat a previously traversed route using only vision sensors. Most VT&R systems rely on natively three-dimensional (3D) sensors such as stereo cameras for mapping and localization, but many existing mobile robots are equipped with only 2D monocular vision, typically for teleoperation. In this paper, we extend VT&R to the most basic sensor configurationa single monocular camera. We show that kilometer-scale route repetition can be achieved with centimeter-level accuracy by approximating the local ground surface near the vehicle as a plane with some uncertainty. This allows our system to recover absolute scale from the known position and orientation of the camera relative to the vehicle, which simplifies threshold-based outlier rejection and the estimation and control of lateral path-tracking erroressential components of high-accuracy route repetition. We enhance the robustness of our monocular VT&R system to common failure cases through the use of color-constant imagery, which provides it with a degree of resistance to lighting changes and moving shadows where keypoint matching on standard gray images tends to struggle. Through extensive testing on a combined 30km of autonomous navigation data collected on multiple vehicles in a variety of highly nonplanar terrestrial and planetary-analogue environments, we demonstrate that our system is capable of achieving route-repetition accuracy on par with its stereo counterpart, with only a modest tradeoff in robustness.

AB Autonomous vehicles in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) have the ability to generate their mobility pattern in advance and share it with other vehicles or a central location. This information enables traffic systems to be aware of future traffic flow. However, the current classical traffic systems barely consider the spatial dependency of traffic data, and more advanced systems suffer from storage limitations. These problems will be exacerbated by the falsification of traffic data through corresponding data attacks, such as position forging attacks. This, in turn, negatively impacts the performance of traffic management systems. This article proposes a heuristic distributed scheme (HIDE) to validate the mobility pattern of vehicles by penalizing or rewarding vehicles based on the contacts' conformation. HIDE enables every vehicle to consider the claimed mobility pattern of every neighboring vehicle that is exchanged, and assigns a penalty or reward to each received mobility pattern and share with cloudlets via roadside units (RSUs). These calculations are based on an efficient time-homogeneous semi-Markov process (THSMP) to predict the likelihood of the accuracy of mobility patterns. Cloudlets calculate a weight factor to determine if a vehicle is malicious. The validation results from THSMP reveal that a high correlation is achieved between the theoretical model and simulation. Also, the results show that the model fairly identifies the malicious vehicles and assigns a low weight of impact on them compared to normal vehicles.

AB We develop a trajectory planning strategy for autonomous agents using Bernstein polynomials. The focus is on generating trajectories that are functionally controllable for under-actuated vehicles and that guarantee a safe path to avoid obstacles. The algorithm is suitable for local replanning and onboard quick re-computation of the trajectory when unplanned obstacles pop up. By leveraging on the properties of Bernstein polynomials the problem is cast into a quadratic programming problem that can be solved in polynomial time.

AB In this work, min-max time consensus tracking is implemented on a multi-quadrotor testbed. The trajectory of a leader quadrotor is generated manually. The remaining quadrotors converge onto this reference trajectory in min-max time using a local feedback control strategy which is known to be globally optimal. Further, the effect of finite communication/measurement rate on consensus tracking is analysed. The bounds on the deviations of the trajectories due to finite communication/measurement rate are characterized. The theoretical claims made are verified through experiments.

AB Ride comfort plays an important role in determining the public acceptance of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Many factors, such as road profile, driving speed, and suspension system, influence the ride comfort of AVs. This study proposes a hierarchical framework for improving ride comfort by integrating speed planning and suspension control in a vehicle-to-everything environment. Based on safe, comfortable, and efficient speed planning via dynamic programming, a deep reinforcement learning-based suspension control is proposed to adapt to the changing pavement conditions. Specifically, a deep deterministic policy gradient with external knowledge (EK-DDPG) algorithm is designed for the efficient self-adaptation of suspension control strategies. The external knowledge of action selection and value estimation from other AVs are combined into the loss functions of the DDPG algorithm. In numerical experiments, real-world pavements detected in 11 districts of Shanghai, China, are applied to verify the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that the EK-DDPG-based suspension control improves ride comfort on untrained rough pavements by 27.95% and 3.32%, compared to a model predictive control (MPC) baseline and a DDPG baseline, respectively. Meanwhile, the EK-DDPG-based suspension control improves computational efficiency by 22.97%, compared to the MPC baseline, and performs at the same level as the DDPD baseline. This study provides a generalized and computationally efficient approach for improving the ride comfort of AVs.

ID DE-FUCA RIDGE; EVENT; SWARM
AB This paper describes a new project to build an operational underwater vehicle that can perform scientific survey and sampling to the full depth of the ocean (11,000 meters). The vehicle, called a hybrid remotely operated vehicle (HROV), will operate in two different modes. For broad area survey, the vehicle will operate untethered as a autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) capable of exploring and mapping the seafloor with sonars and cameras. After targets of interest have been found, the vehicle will be converted at-sea to become a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) that will enable close up imaging and sampling. The ROV configuration will incorporate a lightweight fiber optic tether to the surface for high bandwidth real-time video and data telemetry to the surface to enable high-quality teleoperation, additional cameras and lights, a manipulator arm, and sampling gear. This paper outlines the scientific motivation for the project as well as the feasibility of our design concept. Analysis of the fiber optic cable shows our approach to be practical even with fairly extreme current profiles. An overall approach to the vehicle design is also presented, including options for pressure housings and buoyancy materials.

AB This article considers the following manufacturing/logistics problem: an autonomous vehicle (AV) is requested to serve a set of pickup and delivery (P/D) stations in the shop floor of a modern factory providing P/D tasks while moving safely (i.e., avoiding any collision with obstacles) in its environment. A two-sided time window associated with each P/D station brackets the service time to within a specified interval. A tour for AV is considered legal if it (a) is collision free, (b) passes through each P/D station exactly once, and (c) satisfies the service time restrictions imposed by the P/D stations. A legal tour always starts and ends at a depot. The problem is thereby dual NP-hard because it combines the characteristics of path planning and those of vehicle routing and scheduling problems. The objective is to determine the shortest possible legal tour for AV. A new method is introduced to solve the problem accomplished in two successive phases: first, AV's environment is mapped into a 2D B-spline surface embedded in 3D Euclidean space using a robust geometric model. Then, the generated surface is searched using a genetic algorithm for an optimum legal tour that satisfies the requirements of the vehicle's mission. The performance of the proposed method is investigated and discussed through characteristic simulated experiments.

AB Driverless automatically guided vehicles are becoming a new trend in transportation envisioned in a smart city environment. Automatically guided vehicles depend on environmental data for executing target-oriented navigation and movements. The traffic knowledge can be used by automatically guided vehicles by measuring their intensity and delivery date in the green light. Therefore, considering sensor data's significance in this guided vehicle environment, this article presents the Internet of Things (IoT) assisted automated guided vehicle (IoT-AGV) scheme. IoT-AGV scheme discusses the implementation of an autonomous vehicle traffic control program at crossings. The traffic knowledge operator is ready to retrieve details from the sensor utilizing quick communication through a mobile network to measure optimum travel time and transmit the information collected to automated cars. In an automated guided vehicle (AGV) scheme, the automotive-into-loop model is introduced to eliminate delays. Error indicator integrates various hurdle imbalance statistics calculated from the sensor based on the road slide. A deep neural network focuses on a minimal collection of the most critical features, eliminating the fitting problem. This aids determine the error producing sensor data and alleviate them from fusion to enhance the target's accuracy. The experimental results show that the suggested system has been validated by the images from BIT vehicle datasets and enhances the accuracy ratio of 96.22% to measure optimum travel time and transmit the information collected to automated guided vehicles.

AB Internet of Vehicles has become a promising way to realize the evolution from vehicular ad hoc networks and next-generation intelligent transportation system into future autonomous driving scenarios, clean-energy intelligent vehicles, and Smart Cities. However, multicasting service messages on available service channels and periodic exchanges of beacon messages on control channel cause the problem of efficiently scheduling those messages via multichannel transmission for intelligent vehicle terminal, to support real-world applications in Internet of Vehicles scenario. In this article, we investigate the intelligent vehicle terminal architecture and, particularly, design the wireless communication board by incorporating multicasting and congestion control modules. Especially, we present a multicast data delivery scheme with random-delay lowest-cost constraint to transfer service messages on service channels. Furthermore, a priority-aware congestion control scheme is also proposed by considering differentiated priorities of beacon messages on control channel, to cope with the congestion problem at bottleneck vehicle node. Based on the proposed schemes, we build up the RanLow (Random-delay Lowest-cost) module and the priority-aware congestion control (PARCEL) module by enabling multicasting and congestion control together in wireless communication board of the intelligent vehicle terminal architecture. Finally, the experimental results and comparison show that our devised RanLow module and PARCEL module are feasible and more efficient than existing schemes.

AB Traffic microsimulation has a functional role in understanding the traffic performance on the road network. This study originated with intent to understand traffic microsimulation and its use in modeling connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Initially, the paper focuses on understanding the evolution of traffic microsimulation and on examining the various commercial and open-source simulation platforms available and their importance in traffic microsimulation studies. Following this, current autonomous vehicle (AV) microsimulation strategies are reviewed. From the review analysis, it is observed that AVs are modeled in traffic microsimulation with two sets of strategies. In the first set, the inbuilt models are used to replicate the driving behavior of AVs by adapting the models' parameters. In the second strategy, AV behavior is programmed with the help of externalities (e.g., Application Programming Interface (API)). Studies simulating AVs with inbuilt models used mostly VISSIM compared to other microsimulation platforms. In addition, the studies are heavily focused on AVs' penetration rate impact on traffic flow characteristics and traffic safety. On the other hand, studies which simulated AVs with externalities focused on the communication aspects for traffic management. Finally, the cosimulation strategies for simulating the CAVs are explored, and the ongoing research attempts are discussed. The present study identifies the limitations of present CAV microsimulation studies and proposes prospects and improvements in modeling AVs in traffic microsimulation.

DE Autonomous driving; occupancy grid mapping; conditional imitation

AB Conditional imitation learning (CIL) trains deep neural networks, in an end-to-end manner, to mimic human driving. This approach has demonstrated suitable vehicle control when following roads, avoiding obstacles, or taking specific turns at intersections to reach a destination. Unfortunately, performance dramatically decreases when deployed to unseen environments and is inconsistent against varying weather conditions. Most importantly, the current CIL fails to avoid static road blockages. In this work, we propose a solution to those deficiencies. First, we fuse the laser scanner with the regular camera streams, at the features level, to overcome the generalization and consistency challenges. Second, we introduce a new efficient Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM) method along with new algorithms for road blockages avoidance and global route planning. Consequently, our proposed method dynamically detects partial and full road blockages, and guides the controlled vehicle to another route to reach the destination. Following the original CIL work, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposal on CARLA simulator urban driving benchmark. Our experiments showed that our model improved consistency against weather conditions by four times and autonomous driving success rate generalization by 52%. Furthermore, our global route planner improved the driving success rate by 37%. Our proposed road blockages avoidance algorithm improved the driving success rate by 27%. Finally, the average kilometers traveled before a collision with a static object increased by 1.5 times.

ID SIMULATION; RANGE; SEA
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) typically rely on underwater sound to communicate with sound channel physics defining communication performance. Current acoustic propagation models incorporate channel information and physics but are computationally expensive to run onboard an AUV. This work explores reduced-order proxies for these models through a machine-learning approach that can use in-situ measurements of observed sound-speed profile (SSP) to quickly provide transmission loss (TL) propagation information for vehicles to optimize communication performance through repositioning behaviors. The vertical structure from a year-long time series of mooring observations from offshore San Diego is decomposed with empirical orthogonal functions to reduce the SSPs to three unique amplitudes that explain 95.6% of the total variance. The acoustic propagation model Bellhop is used to estimate TL for a given SSP and different thresholds of TL are used to represent communications performance. Machine-learning models are trained with binarized Bellhop outputs to indicate locations of improved underwater acoustic communications. Amplitude values, desired TL, vehicle depth, and range are used as inputs into machine-learning models for optimizing TL. The best trained model was a random forest (ensemble) network with a 93.3% dice score. The decision tree had a faster prediction speed, relative to Bellhop, with similar prediction accuracy as the ensemble. This work aims to improve sound awareness of AUVs by generating SSP-informed communication performance maps.

AB A framework for autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) path planning using global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) signals and cellular long-term evolution (LTE) signals is evaluated through several simulations and experiments. The objective of path planning is to prescribe the optimal path for the AGV to follow to reach a desired target point. Optimality is defined as the shortest distance, while minimizing the AGV's position estimation error and guaranteeing that the uncertainty about its position is below a desired threshold. Path planning is prescribed via signal reliability maps, which provide information about regions where large errors due to cellular signal multipath or obstructed GNSS line-of-sight are expected. Simulation results are presented demonstrating that utilizing ambient cellular LTE signals together with GNSS signals 1) reduces the uncertainty about the AGV's position, 2) increases the number of feasible paths to choose from, which could be useful if other considerations arise (e.g., traffic jams and road blockages due to construction), and 3) yields significantly shorter feasible paths, which would otherwise be infeasible with GNSS signals alone. Experimental results on a ground vehicle navigating in downtown Riverside, CA, USA, are presented demonstrating a close match between the simulated and experimental results.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) represent a technological revolution in the transportation sphere. The efficient and orderly introduction of AVs will require their acceptance by the public. Although the perspectives of members of the general public concerning AVs have been surveyed, no academic research has to date been completed on the views of AVs held by people with disabilities. The present study employs a mixed methods research methodology to assess attitudes towards AVs among a UK sample of individuals with physical disabilities that affected their mobility. Participants were asked open-endedly to express their thoughts about AVs and their responses were analysed using a structural topic modelling (STM) procedure. Outputs to the STM analysis were then employed in a structural equation model (SEM) constructed to predict the sample members' willingness to travel in driverless vehicles. The results were compared against those obtained from a control group of people without physical disabilities. The attitudes towards AVs of people with disabilities differed significantly from the attitudes of the respondents without disabilities. Attitudes towards AVs among people with disabilities were significantly influenced by their levels of interest in new technology, generalised anxiety, intensity of a person's disability, prior knowledge of AVs, locus of control and action orientation. A latent class analysis confirmed the relevance of these variables as determinants of the views of people with disabilities regarding AVs.

TI An autonomous underwater vehicle for the study of small lakes
SO JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB A small autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) was designed and built to carry a wide variety of oceanographic sensors in the relatively benign lacustrine environment. PURLII navigates along preprogrammed paths for up to 3 h using compass, depth, and acoustic altimeter information. A standard, off-the-shelf, self-recording CTD with pump was integrated into PURLII such that vehicle effects on data quality were minimized. An upper bound on temperature data resolution along the vehicle track was estimated to be 10 cm in the vertical and 35 cm in the horizontal. Five missions were conducted over the course of three days in a small lake approaching autumnal turnover. The goal was to obtain several "snapshots" of the temperature structure within the thermocline before and after a wind event. Each mission consisted of the AUV recording CTD data white moving up and down in a vertical sawtooth pattern and following a constant heading. At the end of an allotted period, PURLII would surface, turn through 180 degrees, and repeat the sawtooth pattern while following a return heading to the start point. PURLII was able to complete 27 up and down profiles between 10 and 20 m over 1 km in 50 min. This provided enough temperature data to produce a vertical two-dimensional cross section of the temperature field, 1 km long and 10 m high. Temperature data measured with the AUV-mounted CTD compared favorably with that measured by conventional moored thermistor chains.

AB We investigated the effect of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) dynamics and navigation on underway submarine gravimetry. Our research was motivated by the need to obtain spatially dense marine gravity measurements close to the source of subkilometer-scale geologic features in the shallow oceanic crust. Such measurements have been previously obtained, for instance, with piloted submarines and towed sleds; however, the high cost and, in the case of on-bottom measurements, poor spatial sampling preclude routine acquisition of these measurements. Continuous underway gravity surveys with AUVs is a compelling cost-effective option, but this method requires separating the AUV accelerations from the measured gravity. We show that AUVs with a large distance between the center of buoyancy and the center of gravity have lower vertical accelerations than torpedo-shaped AUVs and consequentially are better suited for underway gravity surveys. Furthermore state estimators, which combine sensor measurements and models of the vehicle's motion, provide superior estimates of the vehicle's vertical accelerations than methods used in previous underway submarine gravity surveys. We simulated the use of these navigation methods in detecting dike swarms at the East Pacific Rise. Analysis showed that we can shorten filters used in reducing gravity data and consequentially provide improved measurements of the free-water anomaly with a minimal detectable spatial wavelength approximately 65% lower than previously reported results.

ID AUTOMATED VEHICLE; ADVERSARIAL; VISION; MODEL
AB Severe weather conditions pose a significant challenge for computer vision algorithms in autonomous driving applications, particularly regarding robust-ness. Image rain-removal algorithms have emerged as a potential solution by leveraging the power of neural networks to restore rain-free backgrounds in images. However, existing research overlooks the vulnerability concerns in neural networks, which exposes a potential threat to the intelligent perception of autonomous vehicles in rainy conditions. This paper proposes a universal rain-removal attack (URA) that exploits the vulnerability of image rain-removal algorithms. By generating a non-additive spatial perturbation, URA significantly diminishes scene restoration similarity and image quality. The imperceptible and generic perturbation employed by URA makes it a crucial tool for vulnera-bility detection in image rain-removal algorithms and a potential real-world AI attack method. Experimental results demonstrate that URA can reduce scene repair capability by 39.5% and image generation quality by 26.4%, effectively targeting state-of-the-art rain-removal algorithms.

AB In this article, we present a novel and robust registration method for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) using the forward-looking sonar (FLS). Due to the sparsity and repeatability of the underwater environment, and the loss of elevation angle, the FLS is difficult to consistently provide reliable information. The feature extraction and matching are the main difficulties encountered in registrations. This motivates us to propose a method to deal with various underwater environments and provide reliable information to improve the robustness and accuracy of the registration. First, the sonar images are preprocessed to highlight the region of interest and transformed. Next, a sonar image sequence is used for preliminary registration. Last, a combinatorial method including a feature-based region selection and a region-based registration is proposed. The validation is based on datasets and real-world experiments. Comparison studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This paper presents an integrated optimal control framework for velocity and steering control of an autonomous pursuit vehicle, where the control objectives satisfy the requirements of collision avoidance and moving target tracking. A distinctive feature of the proposed velocity and steering control is the application of logarithmic penalty functions to both. The control barrier imposed by logarithmic function provides a unique tool in computing a balanced trajectory with optimal tracking error, control effort and safety margin. Trajectories compliant with the safety regulations for autonomous driving have been planned based on estimated intention of the target and the obstacles. Effects of the controller weights have been extensively simulated to assess the performance of the proposed strategy in a variety of dynamic situations. The controller has been validated on a real-life robot by using a shrinking horizon control policy for iterative optimisation.

AB This paper presents a system that can be used to automatically recognize the intention of traffic police based on visual awareness, which is important for driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. Traffic police play an important role in traffic scenes because the presence of traffic police often means there are traffic jams, accident-prone areas, or traffic failures. In this system, key points of the human body used to express the spatial pose of traffic police are extracted by OpenPose, and these key points are used to generate a spatio-temporal map by motion representation. Then, the graph convolutional network and modified Transformer are respectively used to obtain the spatial features and temporal features from the spatio-temporal map. Finally, the above features are used to infer the intention of traffic police in continuous frame images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method had a higher accuracy than other state-of-the-art recognition algorithms in understanding traffic police intention.

TI Autonomous-underwater-vehicle-based marine multicomponent self-potential
   method: observation scheme and navigational correction
SO GEOSCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTATION METHODS AND DATA SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Marine self-potential (SP) investigation is an effective method to study deep-sea hydrothermal vents and seafloor sulfide deposits. At present, one of the commonly used marine self-potential systems is a towed array of electrodes. Large noises are recorded when great changes in electrode distance and array attitude occur due to the complex seafloor topography. In this paper, a new multicomponent electrical field observation system based on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) was introduced for the measurement of seafloor self-potential signals. The system was tested in a lake, and the multicomponent self-potential data were collected from there. Observed data involve the navigational information of the AUV, which could be corrected using a rotation transform. After navigational correction, measured data can recover the location of the artificial source using self-potential tomography. The experimental results showed that the new SP system can be applied to marine SP observations, providing an efficient and low-noise SP acquisition method for marine resources and environmental investigations.

AB Autonomous and remotely operated underwater vehicles allow us to reach places which have previously been inaccessible and perform complex repair, exploration and analysis tasks. As their navigation is not infallible, they may cause severe damage to themselves and their often fragile surroundings, such as flooded caves, coral reefs, or even accompanying divers in case of a collision. In this study, we used a shallow neural network, consisting of interlinking PID controllers, and trained by a genetic algorithm, to control a biologically inspired AUV with a soft and compliant exoskeleton. Such a compliant structure is a versatile and passive solution which reduces the accelerations induced by collisions to 56% of the original mean value acting upon the system, thus, notably reducing the stress on its components and resulting reaction forces on its surroundings. The segmented structure of this spherical exoskeleton protects the encased system without limiting the use of cameras, sensors or manipulators.

DE Vehicle stability; yaw control; lane keeping; lane change; avoidance
   manoeuvre; at-the-limit
AB Stability control of a vehicle in autonomous safety-critical at-the-limit manoeuvres is analysed from the perspective of lane keeping or lane changing, rather than that of yaw control as in traditional ESC systems. An optimal control formulation is developed, where the optimisation criterion is a linear combination of the initial and final velocity of the manoeuvre. Varying the interpolation parameter in this formulation turns out to result in an interesting family of optimal braking and steering patterns in stabilising manoeuvres. The two different strategies of optimal lane-keeping control and optimal yaw control are shown to be embedded in the formulation and result from the boundary values of the parameter. The results provide new insights and have the potential to be used for future safety systems that adapt the level of braking to the situation at hand, which is demonstrated through examples of how to exploit theresults.

AB LiDAR systems emerge as one of the key systems for autonomous vehicles. The present work quantifies the influence of rain in different LiDAR parameters: range, intensity, and number of detected points. Six areas with different target materials are used for the study. Range measurements appear stable even under important rain affectation. The variations are always lower than 20 cm. These variations come from the experimental procedure (averaging of points detected from a surface) and not from the instabilities in the LiDAR detection with rain. The detected LiDAR intensity and the sampled points attenuate with the increasing of rain intensity. Drop size distribution is assumed constant along the study area. The highest decrease in the number of points appears for pavement. However, the intensity returned from pavement is not specially influenced by rain. The rest of the materials show similar trend in the intensity and the number of detected points. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Underwater gliders are autonomous underwater vehicles that profile vertically by changing their buoyancy and use wings to move horizontally. Gliders are useful for sustained observation at relatively fine horizontal scales, especially to connect the coastal and open ocean. In this review, research topics are grouped by time and length scales. Large-scale topics addressed include the eastern and western boundary currents and the regional effects of climate variability. The accessibility of horizontal length scales of order 1 km allows investigation of mesoscale and submesoscale features such as fronts and eddies. Because the submesoscales dominate vertical fluxes in the ocean, gliders have found application in studies of biogeochemical processes. At the finest scales, gliders have been used to measure internal waves and turbulent dissipation. The review summarizes gliders' achievements to date and assesses their future in ocean observation.

AB In this paper, we compare three different marker based approaches for six degrees of freedom (6DOF) pose estimation, which can be used for position and attitude control of micro aerial vehicles (MAV). All methods are able to achieve real time pose estimation onboard without assistance of any external metric sensor. Since these methods can be used in various working environments, we compare their performance by carrying out experiments across two different platforms: an AscTec Hummingbird and a Pixhawk quadrocopter. We evaluate each method's accuracy by using an external tracking system and compare the methods with respect to their operating ranges and processing time. We also compare each method's performance during autonomous takeoff, hovering and landing of a quadrocopter. Finally we show how the methods perform in an outdoor environment. The paper is an extended version of the one with the same title published at the ICUAS Conference 2013.

ID MOTIONS
AB Considering the case of ASV (autonomous surface vehicle) navigating with low speed near water surface, a new method for design of rollmotion controller is proposed in order to restrain wave disturbance effectively and improve roll stabilizing performance. Control system design is based on GPC (general predictive control) theory and working principle of zero-speed fin stabilizer. Coupling horizontal motion model of ASV is decoupled, and an equivalent transfer function of roll motion is obtained and transformed into a discrete difference equation through inverse Laplace transformation and Euler approximation. Finally, predictive model of GPC, namely, the difference equation of roll motion, is given. GPC algorithm of ASV roll motion is derived from performance index based on roll stabilizing performance and energy consumption used for driving fin stabilizer. In allusion to time-variant parameters in roll motion model, recursive least square method is adopted for parameter estimation. Simulation results of ASV roll motion control show better stabilizing performance and minimized energy consumption improved by self-adaptive GPC.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Autonomous driving; SOTIF; inherent risk; artificial intelligence;
   perception uncertainty; entropy
AB Autonomous driving confronts great challenges in complex traffic scenarios, where the SOTIF risk can be triggered by the dynamic operational environment and system insufficiencies. The SOTIF risk is reflected not only intuitively in the collision risk with objects outside the autonomous vehicles, but also inherently in the performance limitation risk of the implemented algorithms. How to minimize the SOTIF risk for autonomous driving is currently a critical, difficult, and unresolved issue. Therefore, this paper proposes the "Self-Surveillance and Self-Adaption System" as a systematic approach to online minimize the SOTIF risk, which aims to provide a systematic solution for monitoring, quantification, and mitigation of inherent and external risks. As a demonstration of the system, the risk monitoring of the perception algorithm is highlighted. Moreover, the inherent perception algorithm risk and external collision risk are jointly quantified via SOTIF entropy, which is then propagated downstream to the decision-making module and mitigated. Finally, Hardware-in-the-Loop experiments are conducted to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the system. The results demonstrate that the system enables dependable online monitoring, quantification, and mitigation of SOTIF risk in real-time critical traffic environments.

ID DECISION
AB Recently, research on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased significantly. UAVs do not require pilots for operation, and UAVs must possess autonomous flight capabilities to ensure that they can be controlled without a human pilot on the ground. Previous studies have mainly focused on rule-based methods, which require specialized personnel to create rules. Reinforcement learning has been applied to research on UAV autonomous flight; however, it does not include six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) environments and lacks realistic application, resulting in difficulties in performing complex tasks. This study proposes a method of efficient learning by connecting two different maneuvering methods using modular learning for autonomous UAV flights. The proposed method divides complex tasks into simpler tasks, learns them individually, and then connects them in order to achieve faster learning by transferring information from one module to another. Additionally, the curriculum learning concept was applied, and the difficulty level of individual tasks was gradually increased, which strengthened the learning stability. In conclusion, modular learning and curriculum learning methods were used to demonstrate that UAVs can effectively perform complex tasks in a realistic, 6-DOF environment.

ID PARAMETER-ESTIMATION
AB In this work, we propose a new approach to the otherwise lengthy and involved process of system identification for underwater vehicles. The algorithm is based on Universal Adaptive Stabilization (UAS). The proposed methodology does not require localization equipment as it is based on the more easily attainable linear and angular velocity measurements. It also does not rely on accurate initial estimates to converge. The algorithm is proven to be stable, and its capability to yield the correct parameters of the vehicle is established. In simulation, multiple classes of vehicles are tested to verify the ability of the algorithm to identify varying arrangements of parameters depending on the class and shape of a given underwater vehicle. The algorithm is validated using simulation and experimental data. The simulation tests show very promising identification results. The algorithm is additionally validated on a publicly available Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) dataset. Experimental results establish the capacity of the algorithm to realize accurate estimates using nothing but generally available state measurements using sensors available on commercial underwater vehicles. In both testing environments, the algorithm produced parameter estimates with accuracy upwards of 95% in a Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE) sense.

ID FILTER
AB The ability for autonomous vehicles to cooperatively navigate, especially in GPS denied environments, is becoming increasingly important. It also requires the ability to initialize, or reinitialize estimation algorithms for cooperative systems on-the-fly in cases where precise a priori state information is unavailable. In this paper, we provide a framework that allows estimation of the relative pose and orientation between vehicles in the presence of high initial uncertainty. Effects of cooperation among multiple vehicles exchanging estimates of heading rate and velocity and external sensor measurements are analyzed. A Multi-Hypothesis Extended Kalman Filter (MHEKF) technique is used to initialize pairwise vehicles using range-only measurements. Using solutions identified by the MHEKF algorithm, a joint filter comprising of multiple vehicles is initialized. Sufficient conditions to maintain bounded errors are derived through nonlinear observability analysis using Lie derivatives for the pairwise and the multi-vehicle cases. Using these conditions as passive constraints in the system, simulation and hardware experiments are performed to demonstrate the advantages of using MHEKF when the initial conditions are unreliable. A multi-vehicle testbed for heterogeneous platforms with different sensing modalities is developed to facilitate hardware testing. Improvements in the system performance when cooperation is introduced among vehicles is also highlighted through experiments.

AB Autonomous land navigation has been studied extensively in recent years to improve vehicle location accuracy in the satellite-denial environment. However, many previous studies of strapdown inertial navigation system/ odometer (SINS/ODO) integrated navigation mainly focus on the horizontal location and neglect the height positioning since the troublesome problem of vertical channel divergency without extra height information assistance. In contrast, this article considered both horizontal and vertical positioning accuracy by SINS/ODO/laser doppler velocimeter (LDV)-based integration framework and proposed a novel algorithm named Schmidt ST-EKF which takes advantage of both ST-EKF's consistency by nonlinear error definition and Schmidt filter's improvement on system observability. Detailed system equations and observation equations of Schmidt ST-EKF-based SINS/ ODO/LDV integrated navigation are derived and followed by concrete experiment results, which showed that the SINS/ODO/LDV integration method had better horizontal location accuracy than SINS/ODO integration by 35% and SINS/LDV integration by 26% and that applying Schmidt ST-EKF could efficiently reduce height positioning error. A further experiment about the correlating time of pitch mounting angle's influence is conducted and revealed that the Schmidt ST-EKF is more robust than ST-EKF. Consequently, the algorithm proposed in this article for SINS/ODO/LDV has strong engineering applicability in the vast class of land vehicle applications.

AB This paper presents an innovative application of the hybrid model predictive control (HMPC) scheme to optimally regulate the intelligent vehicle longitudinal velocity. For autonomous velocity regulation, the intelligent vehicle needs to be operated in two distinct modes (drive and brake) and because of the mode-dependent constraints on accelerations and decelerations by considering the comfort of passengers, the intelligent vehicle longitudinal dynamics control process can be regarded as a constrained hybrid dynamical system. Thus, in this study, the intelligent vehicle longitudinal dynamics is approximated as a two-mode discrete-time mixed logical dynamical (MLD) system. Using this approximation, a hybrid model predictive controller, which allows us to optimize the switching sequences of the operation modes (binary control inputs) and the torques acted on the wheels (continuous control inputs), is tuned based on online mixed-integer quadratic programming. Numerical simulation analysis is conducted for a sport utility vehicle to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method. Finally, the explicit representation of the HMPC is computed to control the intelligent vehicle in real-time, and the experimental results are presented to show the applicability of the proposed controller.

AB Studies have been initiated to investigate the potential impact of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) on transportation infrastructure. However, most existing research only focuses on the wandering patterns of CAVs. To bridge this gap, an apple-to-apple comparison is first performed to systematically reveal the behavioural differences between the human-driven vehicle (HDV) and CAV trajectory patterns for the first time, with the data collected from the camera-based next generation simulation dataset and autonomous driving co-simulation platform, CARLA and SUMO, respectively. A gradient boosting-based ensemble learning model for pavement performance (i.e. international roughness index) prediction is then developed with the input features including three driving pattern features, namely, lateral wandering deviation, longitudinal car-following distance and driving speed, plus 20 other context variables. A total of 1707 observations is extracted from the long-term pavement performance database for model training purposes. The result indicates that the trained model can accurately predict pavement deterioration and that CAV deteriorates pavement faster than HDV by 8.1% on average. According to the sensitivity analysis, CAV deployment will create a greater impact on the younger pavements, and the rate of pavement deterioration is found to be stable under light traffic, whereas it will increase under congested traffic.

AB In this paper, we present an optimal rendezvous approach that facilitates the coordination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). Of particular interest is the problem of UAV-UGV rendezvous for autonomous aerial refueling, which is an important capability for the future use of UAVs. The main contribution of this work is the development of a promising method for the generation of optimal rendezvous trajectories in real time using convex optimization. First, the UAV-UGV rendezvous problem is formulated as a nonconvex optimal control problem using an error dynamic model, where the state and control variables are highly coupled. Then, great effort is devoted to reducing the nonconvexity and coupling of the dynamics through change of variables. Based on a lossless convexification technique, a sequential convex programming algorithm is designed and the solution is obtained by solving a sequence of convex optimization problems. Theoretical proof is provided to demonstrate the exactness of convexification. Furthermore, a simple line search technique is introduced to handle the model error resulting from the linear approximations and to improve the convergence of the designed successive process. Simulation results of two refueling rendezvous situations validate that the proposed method is capable of converging to the solutions within a second, which shows great potential for real-time applications.

AB This study provides a literature review of the simulation-based connected and automated intelligent-vehicle studies. Media and car-manufacturing companies predict that connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) would be available in the near future. However, society and transportation systems might not be completely ready for their implementation in various aspects, e.g., public acceptance, technology, infrastructure, and/or policy. Since the empirical field data for CAVs are not available at present, many researchers develop micro or macro simulation models to evaluate the CAV impacts. This study classifies the most commonly used intelligent-vehicle types into four categories (i.e., adaptive cruise control, ACC; cooperative adaptive cruise control, CACC; automated vehicle, AV; CAV) and summarizes the intelligent-vehicle car-following models (i.e., Intelligent Driver Model, IDM; MICroscopic Model for Simulation of Intelligent Cruise Control, MIXIC). The review results offer new insights for future intelligent-vehicle analyses: (i) the increase in the market-penetration rate of intelligent vehicles has a significant impact on traffic flow conditions; (ii) without vehicle connections, such as the ACC vehicles, the roadway-capacity increase would be marginal; (iii) none of the parameters in the AV or CAV models is calibrated by the actual field data; (iv) both longitudinal and lateral movements of intelligent vehicles can reduce energy consumption and environmental costs compared to human-driven vehicles; (v) research gap exists in studying the car-following models for newly developed intelligent vehicles; and (vi) the estimated impacts are not converted into a unified metric (i.e., welfare economic impact on users or society) which is essential to evaluate intelligent vehicles from an overall societal perspective.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; SYSTEM
AB The cooperative lane change among several connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) provides ideas for enhancing the traffic safety and efficiency issues caused by lane changes. However, most of the existing studies mainly focus on the independent analysis of the lateral and longitudinal movements of the lane change without considering the impact of the lateral motion on the longitudinal motion. These works usually assume that the target tracking-preceding vehicles are determined for both the lane change vehicle and the following cooperative vehicle in the target lane. This work proposes a model predictive control (MPC)-based cooperative lane change (CLC) control strategy by considering the preceding vehicle switching and the correlation between the lateral and longitudinal motions. It builds the lateral movement based on the appropriate function curve and integrates this lateral movement in the construction of the coordinated longitudinal motion control strategy by using a set of linear piecewise functions in the design of constraints and objective function of the optimization model to provide smooth preceding vehicles switch. An advanced optimization solver is used to solve the optimization control problem step by step. The proposed strategy is validated based on numerical comparative experiments with two typical lane-changing scenarios. The results show that the proposed control strategy can smoothly complete the preceding vehicle switching during the lane change and quickly realize the stable tracking of the target lane vehicles after changing lanes.

AB This paper studies the online scheduling of shared autonomous electric vehicle (SAEV) fleets. The study includes charging management, routing and rebalancing strategies for SAEVs to serve the trip demands in the coupled power and transportation network (PTN). It aims to minimize the total social cost of PTN. The difficulty lies in how to deal with time-varying trip demands with the time-coupled SAEV scheduling and PTN operation considered. To address this challenge, for the first time, we propose a novel framework named the shadow-price deep reinforcement learning (shadow-price DRL), which combines the rigorous PTN operation model and the data-driven model-free DRL-based algorithm. Within the shadow-price DRL, the policy neural network adaptively learns the system dynamics and imposes its actions on the online SAEV scheduling problem as the dynamic shadow prices. By doing so, the SAEV schedule will be determined in the online manner. In addition, the connection between the proposed framework and Lagrangian Relaxation method is discussed, which illustrates the principles and effectiveness of the proposed method. The case studies include the practical Xi'an city which verifies the effectiveness of the shadow-price DRL and illustrates its significant superiority over the safe DRL and model predictive control (MPC) based methods.

AB We evaluate the impact of three proposed regulations of transportation network companies (TNCs) like Uber, Lyft and Didi: (1) A minimum wage for drivers, (2) a cap on the number of drivers or vehicles, and (3) a per-trip congestion tax. The impact is assessed using a queuing theoretic equilibrium model which incorporates the stochastic dynamics of the app-based ride-hailing matching platform, the ride prices and driver wages established by the platform, and the incentives of passengers and drivers. We show that a floor placed under driver earnings can push the ride-hailing platform to hire more drivers and offer more rides, at the same time that passengers enjoy faster rides and lower total cost, while platform rents are reduced. Contrary to standard competitive labor market theory, enforcing a minimum wage for drivers benefits both drivers and passengers, and promotes the efficiency of the entire system. This surprising outcome holds for almost all model parameters, and it occurs because the wage floor curbs TNC labor market power. In contrast to a wage floor, imposing a cap on the number of vehicles hurts drivers, because the platform reaps all the benefits of limiting supply. The congestion tax has the expected impact: fares increase, wages and platform revenue decrease. We also construct variants of the model to briefly discuss platform subsidy, platform competition, and autonomous vehicles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB For networks with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) only, pricing with arc-specific tolls has been proposed to achieve minimization of travel times in a decentralized way. However, the policy is hardly feasible from a technical viewpoint without connectivity. Therefore, for networks with mixed traffic of HDVs and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), this paper considers pricing in a scenario where only CAVs are charged. In contrast to HDVs, CAVs can be managed as individual vehicles or as a fleet. In the latter case, CAVs can be routed to minimize the travel time of the fleet of CAVs or that of the entire fleet of HDVs and CAVs. We have a selfish user behavior in the first case, a private monopolist behavior in the second, a social planner behavior in the third. Pricing achieves in a decentralized way the social planner optimum. Tolls are not unique and can take both positive and negative values. Marginal cost pricing is one solution. The valid toll set is provided, and tolls are then computed according to two schemes: one with positive tolls only and minimum toll expenditure, and one with both tolls and subsidies and zero net expenditure. Convergent algorithms are used for the mixed-behavior equilibrium (simplicial decomposition algorithm) and toll determination (cutting plane algorithm). The computational experience with three networks: a two-arc network representative of the classic town bypass case, the Nguyen-Dupuis network, and the Anaheim network, provides useful policy insight.

AB Intelligent tires can be used in autonomous vehicles to insure the vehicle safety by monitoring the tire and tire-road conditions using sensors embedded on the tire. These sensors and their wireless communication systems need to be powered by energy sources such as batteries or energy harvesters. The deflection of tires during rotation is an available and reliable source of energy for electric power generation using piezoelectric energy harvesters to feed tire self-powered sensors and their wireless communication systems. The aim of this study is to design, analyze, and optimize a rainbow-shaped piezoelectric energy harvester mounted on the inner layer of a pneumatic tire for providing enough power for microelectronics devices required for monitoring intelligent tires. It is shown that the designed piezoelectric energy harvester can generate sufficient voltage, power, and energy required for a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) with high data transmission speed or three TPMSs with average data transmission speed. The effect of the vehicle speed on the voltage and electric energy generated by the designed piezoelectric is also studied. The geometry and the circuit load resistance of the piezoelectric energy harvester are optimized in order to increase the energy harvesting efficiency. It is shown that the optimized rainbow piezoelectric energy harvester can reach the highest power generation among all the strain-based energy harvesters that partially cover the inner layer of the tire.

   Achievement of proper thrust for BAUVs based on the correct application of control when parallel mechanisms are incorporated in propulsion systems.
   Incorporation of parallel mechanisms inside propulsion systems in biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicles (BAUVs) is a novel approach for motion generation. The vehicle to which the studied propulsion system is implemented presents thunniform locomotion, and its thrust depends mainly on the oscillation from its caudal fin. This paper describes the kinematic and dynamic modeling of a 3-DOF spherical 3UCU-1S parallel robotic system to which the caudal fin of a BAUV is attached. Lagrange formalism was employed for inverse dynamic modeling, and its derivation is detailed throughout this paper. Additionally, the implementation of control strategies to compute forces required to actuate limbs to change platform's flapping frequencies was developed. Four controllers: classic PD, a feedforward plus feedback PD, an adaptive Fuzzy-PD, and a feedforward plus Fuzzy-PD were compared in different simulations. Results showed that augmenting oscillating frequencies (from 0.5 to 5 Hz) increased the complexity of the path tracking task, where the classic control strategy (i.e., PD) was not sufficient, reaching percentage errors above 9%. Control strategies using feedforward terms combined with adaptive feedback techniques reduced tracking error below 2% even during the presence of external disturbances.

AB The perception-driven approach and end-to-end system are two major vision-based frameworks for self-driving cars. However, it is difficult to introduce attention and historical information into the autonomous driving process, which are essential for achieving human-like driving in these two methods. In this paper, we propose a novel model for self-driving cars called the brain-inspired cognitive model with attention. This model comprises three parts: 1) a convolutional neural network for simulating the human visual cortex; 2) a cognitive map to describe the relationships between objects in a complex traffic scene; and 3) a recurrent neural network, which is combined with the real-time updated cognitive map to implement the attention mechanism and long-short term memory. An advantage of our model is that it can accurately solve three tasks simultaneously: 1) detecting the free space and boundaries for the current and adjacent lanes; 2) estimating the distances to obstacles and vehicle attitude; and 3) learning the driving behavior and decision-making process of a human driver. Importantly, the proposed model can accept external navigation instructions during an end-to-end driving process. To evaluate the model, we built a large-scale road-vehicle dataset containing over 40 000 labeled road images captured by three cameras placed on our self-driving car. Moreover, human driving activities and vehicle states were recorded at the same time.

AB Lateral control is an essential safety control technology for autonomous vehicles, but the effectiveness of lateral control technology relies heavily on the precision of vehicle motion state judgements. In order to achieve accurate judgements of the vehicle motion state and to improve the control effectiveness of vehicle maneuverability and the stability controller, this paper starts with an analysis of phase plane stability. A simulation analysis is conducted to investigate the effect of the vehicle steering angle of the front wheels, the longitudinal velocity, and the tire-road adhesion coefficient on the boundary of the stability area. The stable area of the phase plane was partitioned using the proposed novel quadrilateral method, and we established a stability area regression model using machine learning methods. We analyzed the inherent connection between the lateral tire forces and the principles of vehicle maneuverability and stability control, indirectly combining the characteristics of tire forces with vehicle maneuverability and stability control. An allocation algorithm for maneuverability and stability control was designed. A co-simulation indicates that the vehicle stability controller not only accurately assesses the motion state of the vehicle but also demonstrates a considerably better performance in maneuverability and stability control compared to a controller using the traditional partitioning method of stable regions. The suggested allocation method enhances vehicle maneuverability and stability by enabling a seamless transition between the two and improving the effectiveness of stability control.

AB Vehicle platooning is an automated driving technology that enables a group of vehicles to travel very closely together as a single unit to improve fuel efficiency and driving safety. These advantages of platooning attract huge interests from academia and industry, especially logistics companies that can utilize the platooning technology for their heavy-duty trucks due to the huge cost savings. In this paper, we demonstrate that existing platooning solutions, however, fail to support formation of a `long' platoon consisting of many vehicles especially long-body heavy-duty trucks due to the limited range of vehicle-to-vehicle communication such as DSRC and device-to-device communication for C-V2X. To address this problem, we propose L-Platooning, the first platooning protocol that enables seamless, reliable, and rapid formation of a long platoon. We introduce a novel concept called Virtual Leader that refers to a vehicle that acts as a platoon leader to extend the coverage of the original platoon leader. A virtual leader election algorithm is developed to effectively designate a virtual leader based on the novel metric called the Virtual Leader Quality Index (VLQI) which quantifies the effectiveness of a vehicle serving as a platoon leader. We also develop mechanisms for L-Platooning to support the vehicle join and leave maneuvers specifically for a long platoon. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that L-Platooning enables vehicles to form a long platoon effectively by allowing them to maintain the desired inter-vehicle distance accurately. We also show that L-Platooning handles seamlessly the vehicle join and leave maneuvers for a long platoon.

AB Lane changes are critical contributors to road traffic safety on highways. Among the safety indexes aimed at evaluating the risk associated with lane changes, the lane-change risk index (LCRI) is used to determine the collision probability of a platoon of vehicles during lane-change maneuvers. This study estimated the impact of driver behavior and vehicle type on the LCRI using individual vehicle trajectory data from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) program. We define the subject vehicle (i.e., a vehicle changing lane) and its surrounding vehicles (i.e., front, rear, lead, and lag vehicles) as a platoon. Each vehicle type (i.e., truck, bus, car, and motorcycle) and driver behavior (i.e., aggressive, ordinary, and timid) were categorized for regression analysis. Driver behavior was classified through time-space deviations between each vehicle's trajectories and expected trajectories using Newell's car-following model. In addition, to take into account the heterogeneity among the lanes, this study used a linear mixed model, which reflected fixed and random effects. Two unique findings were that (i) we were able to quantify and analyze the complex interaction between vehicle type and driver behavior within the platoon during lane changes, and (ii) using the random parameter model, the influence of vehicle type and driver behavior in the platoon was heterogeneous, depending on the lane. The findings of this study are expected to provide detailed lane-change strategies for autonomous vehicles as well as to evaluate the causative factors of lane-change risk.

AB The navigation and localization of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in complex underwater environments are challenging. Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) can provide a precise measurement of its platform motion. Single-sided micronavigation has been used to aid AUV navigation. However, the conventional time delay estimation method in the displaced phase center antenna algorithm is not adequately robust due to phase wrap errors. In addition, it is difficult to estimate sway and heave using a single time delay estimate based on single-sided noninterference SAS. This article proposes a dual-sided SAS micronavigation algorithm that makes use of a robust method for estimating time delays between redundant phase centers of adjacent pings. The proposed dual-sided method allows the estimation of both vehicle sway and heave using a single time delay estimate from each side of the vehicle. The theoretical standard deviations for the surge, sway, and heave estimates are derived. Simulation demonstrates the advantage of the proposed time delay estimation method compared to the conventional one. Additionally, a quantitative comparison between the proposed and conventional time delay estimation methods is shown to prove that the proposed method outperforms the conventional method. Experimental validation is performed via comparisons between single- and dual-sided micronavigation, Doppler velocity log, and GPS-aided inertial navigation system, which is taken as the gold standard to calculate errors.

AB Over the last decade, the technology adopted for the automation of transportation has advanced at a pace that now the emergence of Autonomous Vehicles (AV's) might not be as far away as it was thought a few years ago. However, the successful penetration of these vehicles in public roads will mainly rest upon their acceptance and adoption by individual road users and how they embrace this new generation of cars. This paper reports the results of a national survey study conducted among 475 Irish people to evaluate their interest in, and concerns about the adoption of AVs in their daily commute trends. The paper has also analysed people's acceptance and Willingness to Pay (WTP) for AVs compared to Manually Driven Vehicles (MDVs). The results showed that people, in general, were not interested in driving AVs; only one-fifth of the population expressed a high level of interest. Concerns about recording data had an extreme and negative impact on interest since the majority of respondents were not ready to accept AVs' recording of data because of their concerns about privacy. People were also mostly unsure about or not likely to believe in the safety and security of AVs' operation, and they were not at all willing to accept liability for AVs. In addition, the results revealed that cost substantially impacts people's AV purchasing decisions, as when the cost was not an issue, people were much more interested in purchasing an AV.

AB Digital maps have been installed and attached to vehicles recently. They help with the GPS receivers to determine the relative locations of vehicles to other existing traffic and objects over the road network such as entrance/exit points, obstacles, road intersections, etc. This helps drivers or autonomous vehicles to decide the most appropriate reaction, in terms of speed, take-over, or stop operations ahead of time. Several daily traveling vehicles do not have digital maps. Besides, digital maps are vulnerable to being destroyed or inaccurate. They require regular updates due to the continuous construction and re-design of the road networks. These constructions aimed to enhance the road design and the traffic efficiency there. Moreover, accidents, broken vehicles, traffic congestion, or other ad-hoc obstacles appear unpredictably over the road network. In this article, we aim to introduce a prediction protocol that gathers and analyzes the traffic characteristics of vehicles over the investigated road scenario using wireless transceivers in vehicles. Then, it predicts the physical and traffic context based on the analyzed traffic data. This protocol can replace the absent or broken digital maps in vehicles. It also can be used to verify the correctness of the digital map in vehicles. From the experimental results, we can infer that the proposed protocol has succeeded in predicting the road context over highways and downtown scenarios. More accurate and better predictions are acquired by increasing the percentage of wireless transceiver-equipped vehicles.

AB In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), with the increasing demand for intelligent technologies such as driverless driving, more and more in-vehicle applications have been put into autonomous driving. For the computationally intensive task, the vehicle self-organizing network uses other high-performance nodes in the vehicle driving environment to hand over tasks to these nodes for execution. In this way, the computational load of the cloud alleviated. However, due to the unreliability of the communication link and the dynamic changes of the vehicle environment, lengthy task completion time may lead to the increase of task failure rate. Although the flooding algorithm can improve the success rate of task completion, the offloading expend will be large. Aiming at this problem, we design the partial flooding algorithm, which is a comprehensive evaluation method based on system reliability in the vehicle computing environment without infrastructure. Using V2V link to select some nodes with better performance for partial flooding offloading to reduce the task complete time, improve system reliability and cut down the impact of vehicle mobility on offloading. The results show that the proposed offloading strategy can not only improve the utilization of computing resources, but also promote the offloading performance of the system.

AB Human-machine handover of conditionally automated driving vehicles (CADVs) significantly affects traffic safety. Therefore, a simulation modeling was conducted for the traffic flow mixed with manual driving vehicles, fully automated driving vehicles (FADVs), and CADVs under different takeover times to unravel the impact of CADVs on traffic flow. The results showed that different takeover times significantly affected traffic flow stability. A moderate takeover time allows the driver to complete the takeover quickly with sufficient observation of the surrounding traffic conditions and mitigate the adverse effects of CADVs takeover transition on traffic flow and improve traffic flow safety. Taking moderate takeover time (7s) as the given takeover time, we developed a traffic flow model, and it is found that increasing the total penetration rates of CADVs and FADVs or that of CADVs alone will expand the traffic flow stability area. Moreover, the improving effects of traffic flow stability increase with the value of both penetration rates. This research can be a reference for the safety analysis of heterogeneous traffic flow mixed with CADVs.

AB With the development and promotion of driverless technology, researchers are focusing on designing varied types of external interfaces to induce trust in road users towards this new technology. In this paper, we investigated the effectiveness of a multimodal external human-machine interface (eHMI) for driverless vehicles in virtual environment, focusing on a two-way road scenario. Three phases of identifying, decelerating, and parking were taken into account in the driverless vehicles to pedestrian interaction process. Twelve eHMIs are proposed, which consist of three visual features (smile, arrow and none), three audible features (human voice, warning sound and none) and two physical features (yielding and not yielding). We conducted a study to gain a more efficient and safer eHMI for driverless vehicles when they interact with pedestrians. Based on study outcomes, in the case of yielding, the interaction efficiency and pedestrian safety in multimodal eHMI design was satisfactory compared to the single-modal system. The visual modality in the eHMI of driverless vehicles has the greatest impact on pedestrian safety. In addition, the "arrow" was more intuitive to identify than the "smile" in terms of visual modality.

AB This paper proposes a novel X-by-wire unmanned ground vehicle (UGV)-unmanned ground carrier (UGC). To show functions of the UGV, the mechanisms and design processes of the key subsystems are described, especially the in-wheel motor-driven and independent steer subsystems. As an all-wheel-independently steered (AWIS) UGV, the UGC is able to achieve the diagonal move steer mode (DMSM) to improve the maneuverability significantly. To improve the path tracking performance in DMSM, a robust H-2 (/) H-infinity chassis yaw controller is proposed, which uses the additional yaw moment provided by in-wheel motors to track the desired sideslip angle and avoid the yaw motion. The energy to peak and energy to energy performance of the sideslip angle and the yaw velocity are considered and handled by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) approach during the H-2 (/) H-infinity controller design. The parametric uncertainties and disturbances of the vehicle mass, the yaw inertia, and tire cornering stiffness are considered to improve the robustness. Finally, the step steer and lane change tests are conducted with the UGV testbed to validate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed chassis controller.

AB With the development of information communication and artificial intelligence, the ICV (intelligent connected vehicle) will inevitably play an important part in future urban transport system. In this paper, we study the car following behaviour under the heterogeneous ICV environment. The time to receive information varies from vehicle to vehicle, since the manual vehicles and autonomous vehicles co-exist on the road. By introducing time-varying lags function, a new car following model is proposed, and the cooperative control strategy of this model is studied. Based on Lyapunov function theory and linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, the sufficient condition that the existence of the feedback controller is given, which makes the closed-loop system asymptotically stable under mixed traffic flow environment. That is to say, traffic congestion phenomenon under heterogeneous traffic flow can be effectively suppressed, and the feedback controller gain matrix can be obtained via solving linear matrix inequality. Finally, by simulation the method is verified effective in alleviating traffic congestions and reducing fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. It could be a useful reference to Cooperative Vehicle Infrastructure System and Smart City.

AB Assessing the relative position of surrounding vehicles is a core requirement of autonomous vehicles to make decisions and plan driving trajectories. Many approaches based on monocular vision are designed for flat roads but contain unpredictable errors in some corner cases, such as sloping and uneven roads. In this article, the proposed method focuses on a relative-distance measurement adaptive to rough roads, using monocular vision and the features from connected vehicles. The proposed model takes the perspective-n-point approach as a basic framework. A connected-vehicle network can provide the fixed topology of feature points on the target vehicles for position estimation. The fixed topology replaces the requirement of cameras' extrinsic parameters, which may change unpredictably on rough roads. The proposed approach is implemented on real vehicles driving on sloping and uneven roads. The results are compared with Mobileye, a widely used product for relative positioning. The experiments take the real-time kinematic GPS as ground truth and show that the proposed method achieves decimeter-level measurements and outperforms Mobileye on sloping and uneven roads. This article also shows great potential to improve environment perception using the connected-vehicle network in the future.

AB In this work, we present an end-to-end solution for autonomous water sampling by utilizing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a cable-suspended mechanism. Towards this direction, a sampling mechanism is initially designed in such a manner that the water sampling success ratio is maximized. However, the disturbances, acting on the submerged mechanism due to the water flow during the sampling procedure, impede the stabilization of the vehicle above the desired sampling position. Consequently, to achieve the precise hovering of the UAV, the vehicle's sensor suite is further augmented with a load cell, a depth sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, and a camera. The respective measurements are appropriately fused by employing an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Hence, an estimate of the disturbances is available in real-time and is incorporated into a Model Predictive Control scheme which compensates for the aforementioned disturbances and stabilizes the vehicle above the sampling location. Finally, a complete water sampling mission entails the safe and swing-free transportation of the mechanism towards the sampling location and, then, to a position where the collected samples are postprocessed by human operators. Consequently, a model predictive controller is employed which ensures the navigation of the vehicle to the desired waypoints while minimizing the swinging motion of the mechanism. The state of the mechanism is obtained by fusing measurements provided by the load cell and the camera with an EKF. The performance of the proposed framework, which aims to address all the aspects of a water sampling mission, is demonstrated through real experiments with an octorotor.

AB Cellular-vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) is gaining an increasing interest among the technologies under consideration for future connected and automated vehicles, especially for sidelink LTE-V2X Mode 4 and sidelink 5G-V2X Mode 2, where nodes autonomously perform resource allocations and transmissions, without relying on any infrastructure. In these cases, the allocation process has been designed based on the assumption of periodic packet generation constrained to a few possible allocation periods. Nevertheless, even assuming that the awareness messages are continuously exchanged, the packet generation might not always be exactly periodical or might come with a periodicity not constrained to the expected values, as for example with the Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) standard defined by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). The non-ideal periodicity of packet generation, if not properly taken into account, can significantly impact the operation and performance of C-V2X when vehicles autonomously select their radio resources. This paper provides an analysis of how a misalignment between packet generation and resource allocation affects the system performance and provides insights into how to design the parameter settings to improve the performance. A case study is provided, focusing on LTE-V2X Mode 4 and the cooperative awareness message (CAM) generation in agreement with the the ETSI specifications. Results show that the performance generally improves if the smallest allocation interval is adopted and if the reservation is maintained even when no packets are ready for transmission. It is also shown how the parameter controlling the maximum latency in LTE-V2X, jointly with the misalignment between the allocation and generation intervals, can further affect the packet reception rate.

AB In this paper, solutions for precise maneuvering of an autonomous small (e.g., 350-class) Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are designed and implemented from smart modifications of non expensive mass market technologies. The considered class of vehicles suffers from light load, and, therefore, only a limited amount of sensors and computing devices can be installed on-board. Then, to make the prototype capable of moving autonomously along a fixed trajectory, a "cyber-pilot", able on demand to replace the human operator, has been implemented on an embedded control board. This cyber-pilot overrides the commands thanks to a custom hardware signal mixer. The drone is able to localize itself in the environment without ground assistance by using a camera possibly mounted on a 3 Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) gimbal suspension. A computer vision system elaborates the video stream pointing out land markers with known absolute position and orientation. This information is fused with accelerations from a 6-DOF Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to generate a "virtual sensor" which provides refined estimates of the pose, the absolute position, the speed and the angular velocities of the drone. Due to the importance of this sensor, several fusion strategies have been investigated. The resulting data are, finally, fed to a control algorithm featuring a number of uncoupled digital PID controllers which work to bring to zero the displacement from the desired trajectory.

AB Accurate knowledge about the motion state of preceding vehicles (PVs) contributes to the optimization of planning and decision making of autonomous vehicles, which in turn further enhances road safety. Existing studies generally rely on information from special sensors mounted on the ego vehicle to estimate PVs state. With the evolution of information technology, the use of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication to estimate the PVs state has attracted more and more attention. However, the problem of how to reduce the communication rate while ensuring the estimation accuracy of PVs state with the limited communication bandwidth has not been addressed yet. In addition, traditional studies on lateral state estimation of PVs assume that the longitudinal velocity of the PV is known or design an additional estimator to predict the longitudinal velocity. This results in the dynamical coupling characteristics of the vehicle not being fully considered. To address these problems, an event-triggered estimation framework by fusing an event-triggered mechanism with an embedded cubature Kalman filter based on a coupled vehicle model is proposed for PVs state estimation. Simulation and real vehicle test results demonstrate that the proposed prediction approach can strike an effective balance between the communication rate and the estimation performance. The estimation accuracy of the proposed method is still superior to that of the cubature Kalman filter, even if the communication rate drops to 37.55%.

AB In natural outdoor settings, advanced perception systems and learning strategies are major requirement for an autonomous vehicle to sense and understand the surrounding environment, recognizing artificial and natural structures, topology, vegetation and drivable paths. Stereo vision has been used extensively for this purpose. However, conventional single-baseline stereo does not scale well to different depths of perception. In this paper, a multi-baseline stereo frame is introduced to perform accurate 3D scene reconstruction from near range up to several meters away from the vehicle. A classifier that segments the scene into navigable and non-navigable areas based on 3D data is also described. It incorporates geometric features within an online self-learning framework to model and identify traversable ground, without any a priori assumption on the terrain characteristics. The ground model is automatically retrained during the robot motion, thus ensuring adaptation to environmental changes. The proposed strategy is of general applicability for robot's perception and it can be implemented using any range sensor. Here, it is demonstrated for stereo-based data acquired by the multi-baseline device. Experimental tests, carried out in a rural environment with an off-road vehicle, are presented. It is shown that the use of a multi-baseline stereo frame allows for accurate reconstruction and scene segmentation at a wide range of visible distances, thus increasing the overall flexibility and reliability of the perception system.

AB In automated lane-free traffic, vehicles can choose any arbitrary lateral location. This enables vehicle flocking where, compared to platooning, the grouping of vehicles is possible with smaller space gaps, not only longitudinally but also laterally. Vehicle flocking can fulfill several purposes, such as increasing the road capacity, saving energy by reducing the aerodynamic drag force, and dampening shockwaves. Within this paper, we develop a control framework for modeling vehicle flocks in automated lane-free traffic. The proposed control algorithm considers two types of agents: a -agents representing potential flock mates and a ? -agent representing the virtual leader with collective objectives (e.g., slowing down in the case of traffic congestion ahead). Our algorithm is based on energy functions for flock centering and collision avoidance, a consensus algorithm for velocity matching, and navigational feedback exerted by the virtual leader. The virtual leader's path, which should be followed by the flock, is defined in an upper-level controller. In addition, a feedback algorithm for dynamic road boundary control is implemented. We simulate the proposed approach with very promising results. We show that vehicle flocks are efficiently formed within a few seconds, speeds are successfully aligned, and vehicle arrangements stay stable under different scenarios. In addition, the lateral and longitudinal flock extension changes with different energy functions and changing road boundaries, and vehicle flocks follow the trajectory of the virtual leader. Most importantly, vehicle flocks stay stable in the case of perturbations and the induced shock is dampened efficiently because of slight changes in the vehicles' lateral locations.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; DESIGN
AB A multimode hybrid automaton is proposed for setting vehicle platoon modes with velocity, distance, length, lane position, and other state information. Based on a vehicle platoon shift movement under different modes, decisions are made based on key conditional actions, such as sudden acceleration changes because of vehicle distance changes, emergency braking to avoid collisions and free-lane changing choices adapted to various traffic conditions, so as to ensure effortless movement and safety in the multimode shift. With a 3-degree (longitudinal, lateral, and yaw directions) of the freedom coupled model, a hybrid vehicle platoon controller is proposed using nonsingular terminal sliding-mode control to ensure fast and steady tracking on the hybrid automaton outputs during the multimode shift process. The convergence of the hybrid controller in finite time is also analyzed with the Lyapunov exponential stability. The analysis result proves that the proposed controller not only ensures the stability of the individual vehicle and the vehicle platoon but also ensures the stability of the multimode shift movement system. The proposed cooperative driving strategy for vehicle platoon is evaluated using simulations, where varying traffic conditions and the influence of cutting off are considered in conjunction with demonstration simulations of a vehicle platoon's cruising, following, lane changing, overtaking, and moving in/out of garage functions.

AB One of the difficult tasks in the field of computer vision is the classification and detection of vehicles. Researchers from all over the world are working to create autonomous vehicle detection (AVD) systems due to their numerous practical applications, including highway management and surveillance systems. Deep learning techniques, which require a lot of data for proper model training, are the current AVD trend. However, a number of vehicles are discovered in India, the second-largest nation in terms of population, that are not included in the vehicle detection datasets that are currently in use. Furthermore, India's over crowding makes traffic management difficult and unusual. In this research, we present a dataset for still-image-based vehicle detection that includes one class of pedestrians and 13 different types of vehicles that are seen on Indian urban and rural roads. Initially, we provide baseline results using some state-of-the-art deep learning models on this dataset. To improve the accuracy further, we present an ensemble-based object detection and classification model. The dataset consists of 4K images and 14.3K bounding boxes of various vehicles; that is researchers are provided with appropriately annotated rectangular boxes for use with these vehicles in the future. A 16-megapixel Sony IMX519 high-resolution camera was used to take all images while travelling throughout West Bengal, an Indian state on the eastern side. Dataset can be found at:https://github.com/IRUVD/IRUVD.git.

AB Unmanned vehicles operating in formation may perform more complex tasks than vehicles working individually. In order to control a formation of unmanned vehicles, however, the following main issues must be faced: vehicle motion is usually described by nonlinear models, feasible control actions for each vehicle are constrained, collision between the members of the formation must be avoided while, at the same time, the computational efforts must be kept low due to limitations on the onboard hardware. To solve these problems, a nonlinear decentralized model predictive control algorithm is presented in this paper. The adopted model is based on the nonlinear kinematic equations describing the motion of a body with six degrees of freedom, where each vehicle shares information with its leader only by means of a wireless local area network. Saturation and collision-free constraints are included within the formulation of the optimization problem, while decentralization allows to distribute the computational efforts amongst all the vehicles of the formation. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, it has been applied to a formation of quadrotor vehicles. Simulation results prove that the approach presented in this paper is a valid way to solve the problem of controlling a formation of unmanned vehicles, granting at the same time the possibility to deal with constraints and nonlinearity while limiting the computational efforts through decentralization.

AB In this investigation, we focus on the problem of mapping the ground reflectivity with multiple laser scanners mounted on mobile robots/vehicles. The problem originates because regions of the ground become populated with a varying number of reflectivity measurements, whose value depends on the observer and its corresponding perspective. Here, we propose a novel automatic, data-driven computational mapping framework specifically aimed at preserving edge sharpness in the map reconstruction process and that considers the sources of measurement variation. Our new formulation generates map-perspective gradients and applies sub-set selection fusion and de-noising operators to these through iterative algorithms that minimize an l(1) sparse regularized least squares formulation. The reconstruction of the ground reflectivity is then carried out based on Poisson's formulation posed as an l(2) term promoting consistency with the fused gradient of map-perspectives and a term that ensures equality constraints with reference measurement map data. We demonstrate that our new framework outperforms the capabilities of the existing ones with experiments realized on Ford's fleet of autonomous vehicles. For example, we show that we can achieve map enhancement (i.e., contrast enhancement), artifact removal, de-noising, and map-stitching without requiring an additional reflectivity adjustment to calibrate sensors to the specific mounting and robot/vehicle motion.

AB Vehicle lane change behavior, which is an important part of traffic flow theory, can have a fundamental impact on the macro and micro characteristics of traffic flow. At the same time, it has an important impact on the safety and throughput of the traffic system of road vehicles. Understanding vehicle changes is of great significance to the popularization of autonomous driving and ensuring the safety of human life and prop-erty. In order to conduct a systematic review of vehicle lane change research, the paper retrieves literature related to vehicle lane change from the Web of science database, and uses the VOSviewer bibliometric tool to analyze and visualize the literature data in various aspects. Further, a comprehensive review of existing models in vehicle lane change behavior decision and lane change trajectory is conducted and the advantages and disadvantages of each model are evaluated. Additionally, the lane change models are categorized based on their traits, with a recognition of the restrictions of current lane change models. Then, the existing research results are further discussed and more promising research directions are proposed. Finally, the research results and conclusions of this paper are summarized.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.

In this work, robust analysis of a control strategy based on electrolocation for performing obstacle avoidance in electrically heterogeneous corridors is presented and validated. Static output feedback control is shown to achieve the desired goal of reflexive obstacle avoidance in such environments in simulation and experimentation. The proposed approach is computationally inexpensive and readily implementable on a small scale underwater vehicle, making underwater autonomous navigation feasible in real-time.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used for many missions, including weather reconnaissance, search and rescue assisting operations over seas and mountains, aerial photographing and mapping, fire detection, and traffic control. Autonomous operation of UAVs requires the development of control systems that can work without human support for long time periods. The path planners, which generate collision-free and optimized paths, are needed to provide autonomous operation capabilities to the UAVs. The optimization of the flight trajectory is a multi-objective problem dealing with variable terrain features as well as dynamic environment conditions. This paper presents a simulation environment for offline path planning of unmanned aerial vehicles on three-dimensional terrains. Our path planner aims to identify the shortest path and/or flight envelope in a given line of sight by avoiding terrain collisions, traveling on a path that stays within the restricted minimum and maximum distances above the terrain, traveling far from the specified threat zones, and maneuvering with an angle greater than the minimum curvature radius. We present two meta-heuristics (genetic algorithms and hyper-heuristics) in order to construct the paths for UAV navigation and compare our results with a reference work given in the literature. A comparative study over a set of terrains with various characteristics validates the effectiveness of the proposed meta-heuristics, where the quality of a solution is measured with the total cost of a constructed path, including the penalties of all constraints.

ID PLATOON
AB This study proposes a two-level optimization model system for vehicle control and signal timing at isolated signal intersections under the mixed traffic flow environment composed of intelligent connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and connected human-driven vehicles (CHVs), to minimize the energy consumption and vehicle delay at intersections. The proposed two-layer optimization model is composed of a two-layer vehicle trajectory control model and a fuzzy control signal timing optimization model. The two-layer vehicle trajectory control model includes a signal-oriented vehicle trajectory control model and a car-following oriented vehicle trajectory control model. The former calculates expected acceleration and speed commands at each time step according to the coming signal information, to help vehicle pass the closest signal intersection without stopping during the green light interval; the latter uses the variable headway (VTH) strategy to follow the preceding vehicle by maintaining a safe distance. A microscopic simulator based on SUMO is developed to test the performance of the proposed optimization algorithm. In the simulation experiment, with the driving characteristics of CHV drivers considered, the results show that our model performs well under a CAV penetration rate of 30%-60% and under small or moderate levels of traffic flow. The average waiting time of vehicles is reduced by about 25% compared with the uncontrolled scheme. Under the condition of penetration rate of 60%, the average energy consumption of vehicles in the proposed model is 17.56% lower than that of the uncontrolled scheme. In addition, the proposed model reduces by 21.94% compared with the scheme of only controlling vehicles. When the traffic flow is at a low or medium level, the average energy consumption and waiting time of vehicles are reduced by nearly 35% with the proposed model.

ID TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT
AB In this paper we develop methods for maximizing the throughput of a mobility-on-demand urban transportation system. We consider a finite group of shared vehicles, located at a set of stations. Users arrive at the stations, pickup vehicles, and drive (or are driven) to their destination station where they drop-off the vehicle. When some origins and destinations are more popular than others, the system will inevitably become out of balance: vehicles will build up at some stations, and become depleted at others. We propose a robotic solution to this rebalancing problem that involves empty robotic vehicles autonomously driving between stations. Specifically, we utilize a fluid model for the customers and vehicles in the system. Then, we develop a rebalancing policy that lets every station reach an equilibrium in which there are excess vehicles and no waiting customers and that minimizes the number of robotic vehicles performing rebalancing trips. We show that the optimal rebalancing policy can be found as the solution to a linear program. We use this solution to develop a real-time rebalancing policy which can operate in highly variable environments. Finally, we verify policy performance in a simulated mobility-on-demand environment and in hardware experiments.

AB In this paper, we consider the navigation of a group of solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for periodical monitoring of a set of mobile ground targets in urban environments. We consider the scenario where the number of targets is larger than that of the UAVs, and the targets spread in the environment, so that the UAVs need to carry out a periodical surveillance. The existence of tall buildings in urban environments brings new challenges to the periodical surveillance mission. They may not only block the Line-of-Sight (LoS) between a UAV and a target, but also create some shadow region, so that the surveillance may become invalid, and the UAV may not be able to harvest energy from the sun. The periodical surveillance problem is formulated as an optimization problem to minimize the target revisit time while accounting for the impact of the urban environment. A nearest neighbour based navigation method is proposed to guide the movements of the UAVs. Moreover, we adopt a partitioning scheme to group targets for the purpose of narrowing UAVs' moving space, which further reduces the target revisit time. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified via computer simulations.

In addition, because no fully self-driving vehicles are yet available to the public, most research has been limited to subjective survey-based assessments that depend on the respondents' limited knowledge based on second-hand reports and do not reflect the complex situational and dispositional factors known to affect trust and technology adoption.
   Methods: To address these issues, the current study examined the specific factors that affect younger and older adults' trust in self-driving vehicles.
   Results: The results showed that trust in self-driving vehicles depended on multiple interacting variables, such as the age of the respondent, risk during travel, impairment level of the hypothesized driver, and whether the self-driving car was reliable.
   Conclusion: The primary contribution of this work is that, contrary to existing opinion surveys which suggest broad distrust in self-driving cars, the ratings of trust in self-driving cars varied with situational characteristics (reliability, driver impairment, risk level). Specifically, individuals reported less trust in the self-driving car when there was a failure with the car technology; and more trust in the technology in a low risk driving situation with an unimpaired driver when the automation was unreliable.

AB Vision-based autonomous underwater vehicle localization, navigation, and mapping is an attractive field of research in recent years. Despite the development of vision-only and vision-inertial-based algorithms, particularly in the terrestrial and aerial robotics groups, applying such approaches directly to underwater environments remains challenging due to visual degradation in the medium and further due to the slow crusade of the underwater vehicles. This paper introduces U-VIP-SLAM, a unique visual-inertial-pressure SLAM system that combines data from a monocular camera, a low-cost IMU, and a pressure sensor to create a SLAM system focused to the underwater region. All of the key components of a comprehensive SLAM system are included in theU-VIP-SLAM, including loop closure capabilities tailored to the underwater environment. Further, we introduce forward and backward projection strategies to fuse pressure measurement in the local bundle adjustment. Furthermore, a unique initialization strategy is proposed to effectively bootstrap the system by fusing pressure and IMU data. Several datasets were used to compare the performance of the proposed methods against the state-of-the-art monocular VI systems. Source Code is available at https://github.com/chintha/U-VIP-SLAM.git.

AB Target search in 3-D underwater environments is a challenge in multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (multi-AUVs) exploration. This paper focuses on an effective strategy for multi-AUV target search in the 3-D underwater environments with obstacles. First, the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is applied to extract information of environment from the sonar data to build a grid map of the underwater environments. Second, a topologically organized bioinspired neurodynamics model based on the grid map is constructed to represent the dynamic environment. The target globally attracts the AUVs through the dynamic neural activity landscape of the model, while the obstacles locally push the AUVs away to avoid collision. Finally, the AUVs plan their search path to the targets autonomously by a steepest gradient descent rule. The proposed algorithm deals with various situations, such as static targets search, dynamic targets search, and one or several AUVs break down in the 3-D underwater environments with obstacles. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of guiding multi-AUV to achieve search task of multiple targets with higher efficiency and adaptability compared with other algorithms.

AB Urban traffic is developing rapidly in the direction of intelligence and networking. In order to further enhance the role of connected vehicles in improving the traffic characteristic of the heterogeneous traffic flow, this paper designs a memory feedback control signal based on the historical traffic information of the vehicle itself, so as to improve the in-telligent driver model. Furthermore, the improved homogeneous intelligent driver model is extended to heterogeneous intelligent driver model of heterogeneous traffic flow com-posed of connected vehicles and regular vehicles, and the stability of heterogeneous traffic flow is discussed. The stability condition of the heterogeneous traffic flow is derived by linear stability analysis method, which shows that the proportion and distribution of con-nected vehicles and the strength of memory feedback control signal affect the stability of traffic flow to a certain extent. In addition, the results of numerical simulation reveal that the stability of heterogeneous traffic flow is enhanced after considering the memory feedback control signal, no matter in low or high proportion of connected vehicles.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB As an important combination of autonomous vehicle networks (AVNs) and smart grid, the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) network can facilitate the adoption of renewable resources. Based on V2G networks, parked electric vehicles (EVs) can charge during off-peak hours and inject excess power to the grid during peak hours for earnings. However, each EV's power injection bids in V2G are sensitive and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication may be eavesdropped, which has become an obstacle to the wide deployments of AVNs. Aiming to efficiently tackle these security and privacy issues in AVNs, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving communication and power injection (ePPCP) scheme without pairings, which is suitable for vehicle networks and 5G smart grid slice. In ePPCP, each EV calculates two secret keys shared respectively by the utility company and the gateway to blind power injection bids. A novel aggregation technique called hash-then-homomorphic is used to further aggregate the blinded bids of different time slots. Our security analysis indicates that individual bids are hidden and secure V2V communication is ensured. Furthermore, extensive performance comparisons show that ePPCP is efficient in terms of the computation cost and communication overhead.

AB Shared mobility can fundamentally change road transport and improve life quality. Car-sharing services have reached a high level of growth worldwide and members adopting them as an alternative transportation mode are constantly on the increase. The advent of highly automated vehicles could boost the adoption of car sharing as more inexpensive and convenient on-demand services could be achieved. In recent years, vehicle automation is facilitated and supported by the latest advances in information and communication technologies, forming the cornerstone of the new generation of In-Vehicle Intelligent Systems. The goal of this study is to introduce a novel in-vehicle cognitive framework that utilises (i) driver's/user's profile data and personal preferences, (ii) real-time information associated with the vehicle's driving environment, and (iii) previous knowledge and experience, in proposing adaptations of the vehicle's level of autonomy, in an automated manner, when a driver/user wishes to make a road journey within the automated vehicle sharing context. Knowledge is obtained through the exploitation of Bayesian networking principles. Indicative results on the performance of the proposed cognitive mechanism and the associated knowledge-based selection scheme are presented, mostly with regards to proactively identifying the optimum level of autonomy to be implemented.

AB Intelligent vehicle applications, such as autonomous driving and collision avoidance, put forward a higher demand for precise positioning of vehicles. The current widely used global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) cannot meet the precision requirements of the submeter level. Due to the development of sensing techniques and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, some vehicles can interact with surrounding landmarks to achieve precise positioning. Existing work aims to realize the positioning correction of common vehicles by sharing the positioning data of sensor-rich vehicles. However, the privacy of trajectory data makes it difficult to collect and train data centrally. Moreover, uploading vehicle location data wastes network resources. To fill these gaps, this article proposes a vehicle cooperative positioning (CP) system based on federated learning (FedVCP), which makes full use of the potential of social Internet of Things (IoT) and collaborative edge computing (CEC) to provide high-precision positioning correction while ensuring user privacy. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first attempt to solve the privacy of CP from a perspective of federated learning. In addition, we take the advantages of local cooperation through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications in data augmentation. For individual differences in vehicle positioning, we utilize transfer learning to eliminate the impact of such differences. Extensive experiments on real data demonstrate that our proposed model is superior to the baseline method in terms of effectiveness and convergence speed.

AB Collision risk assessment aims to provide a subjective cognitive comprehension of the risk level in driving scenarios, which is critical for the safety of autonomous driving systems. Pedestrian crossing scenarios contain intricate human-vehicle interactions. Hence, it is important to capture the rich relations between traffic entities and to assess the collision risk promptly to ensure safety. Existing studies focus on modeling the spatial relationships between the ego-vehicle and other vehicles in typical traffic scenarios, while ignoring the complex interactions between pedestrians and the ego-vehicle in critical driving scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that involves constructing traffic scene graphs with enhanced vehicle-pedestrian interactions, along with introducing an innovative deep model built upon Transformer and GCN for pedestrian collision risk assessment. Specifically, to facilitate spatio-temporal modeling of traffic scene graph sequence, we propose a novel unified framework that integrates Multi-Relation Graph Convolution Network (MR-GCN) and Temporal Transformer Encoder. In addition, two variants of traffic scene graph datasets termed as Interaction-Enhanced Scene Graph (IESG) and None-Interaction-Enhanced Scene Graph (Non-IESG) are created for the purpose of assessing pedestrian collision risk, utilizing the CAP-DATA and JAAD respectively. Experiments are conducted on our newly created traffic scene graph datasets of pedestrian crossing scenes. The results on the IESG dataset show that our model outperforms the baseline model with higher accuracy (94% vs. 84%), higher AUC (98% vs. 89%), and higher F1-score (93% vs. 84%). IESG and Non-IESG datasets are available at https://github. com/Pedestrian-Crossing-Collision-Risk-Assessment-Datasets.

AB This manuscript presents an Adam optimization-based Deep Reinforcement Learning model for Mixed Traffic Flow control (ADRL-MTF), so as to guide Connected and Autonomous vehicle's (CAV) longitudinal trajectory on a typical urban roadway with signal-controlled intersections. Two improvements are made when compared with prior literatures. First, the common assumptions to simplify the problem solving, such as dividing a vehicle trajectory into several segments with constant acceleration/deceleration, are avoided, to improve the modeling realism. Second, built on the efficient Adam Optimization and Deep Q-Learning, the proposed mod& avoids the enumeration of states and actions, and is computational efficient and suitable for real time applications. The mixed traffic flow dynamic is firstly formulated as a finite Markov decision process (MDP) model. Due to the discretization of time, space and speed, this MDP model becomes high-dimensional in state, and is very challenging to solve. We then propose a temporal difference-based deep reinforcement learning approach, with E-greedy for exploration-exploitation balance. Two neural networks are developed to replace the traditional Q function and generate the targets in the Q-learning update. These two neural networks are trained by the Adam optimization algorithm, which extends stochastic gradient descent and considers the second moments of the gradients, and is thus highly computational efficient and has lower memory requirements. The proposed model is shown to reduce fuel consumption by 7.8%, which outperforms a prior benchmark model based on Monte Carlo Tree Search. The model's runtime efficiency and stability are tested, and the sensitivity analysis is also performed.

AB The research in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) has progressed to design architectures for driver specific performance. Personalised ADASs in this aspect have been developed with adaptation to driver attributes, state, style, behaviour, skill and so on. For the lane keeping task, the driver driving style while navigating a high/low curvature track plays an important part in the design of a lane keeping assist system. Considering this aspect, a robust co-operative control approach is formulated to design a personalised lane keeping assist with adaptation to driver style. Based on statistical analysis of lateral jerk and steer feel, a fuzzy rule based identification procedure for the classification of the driver style as clam, moderate, aggressive or very aggressive is designed. Using the identified driving style, a modulation function is proposed to adapt the assist torque. The assist torque is generated based on a robust higher order sliding mode approach as a feedback control for the driver-vehicle system. Closed-loop stability of the proposed driver-vehicle design in the presence of disturbances is established. Co-operative control between human driver-autonomous controller for the lane keeping task over the Satory test track with adaption to driver style is then shown for validation of the proposed architecture.

AB A stochastic optimization methodology is formulated for computing energy-optimal paths from among time-optimal paths of autonomous vehicles navigating in a dynamic flow field. Based on partial differential equations, the methodology rigorously leverages the level-set equation that governs time-optimal reachability fronts for a given relative vehicle-speed function. To set up the energy optimization, the relative vehicle-speed and headings are considered to be stochastic and new stochastic Dynamically Orthogonal (DO) level-set equations are derived. Their solution provides the distribution of time-optimal reachability fronts and corresponding distribution of time-optimal paths. An optimization is then performed on the vehicle's energy-time joint distribution to select the energy-optimal paths for each arrival time, among all stochastic time-optimal paths for that arrival time. Numerical schemes to solve the reduced stochastic DO level-set equations are obtained, and accuracy and efficiency considerations are discussed. These reduced equations are first shown to be efficient at solving the governing stochastic level-sets, in part by comparisons with direct Monte Carlo simulations. To validate the methodology and illustrate its accuracy, comparisons with semi-analytical energy-optimal path solutions are then completed. In particular, we consider the energy-optimal crossing of a canonical steady front and set up its semi-analytical solution using a energy-time nested nonlinear double-optimization scheme. We then showcase the inner workings and nuances of the energy-optimal path planning, considering different mission scenarios. Finally, we study and discuss results of energy-optimal missions in a wind-driven barotropic quasigeostrophic double-gyre ocean circulation. (C) 2016ElsevierLtd. All rights reserved.

AB Globally, the increases in vehicle numbers, traffic congestion, and road accidents are serious issues. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) traveling in platoons provide innovative solutions for efficient traffic flow management, especially for congestion mitigation, thus reducing accidents. In recent years, platoon-based driving, also known as vehicle platoon, has emerged as an extensive research area. Vehicle platooning reduces travel time and increases road capacity by reducing the safety distance between vehicles. For connected and automated vehicles, cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) systems and platoon management systems play a significant role. Platoon vehicles can maintain a closer safety distance due to CACC systems, which are based on vehicle status data obtained through vehicular communications. This paper proposes an adaptive traffic flow and collision avoidance approach for vehicular platoons based on CACC. The proposed approach considers the creation and evolution of platoons to govern the traffic flow during congestion and avoid collisions in uncertain situations. Different obstructing scenarios are identified during travel, and solutions to these challenging situations are proposed. The merge and join maneuvers are performed to help the platoon's steady movement. The simulation results show a significant improvement in traffic flow due to the mitigation of congestion using platooning, minimizing travel time, and avoiding collisions.

AB This work describes an adaptive trajectory tracking controller for underactuated underwater vehicles. The control design process is two-fold; first, a high-level kinematic controller is designed to produce velocity commands that steer the vehicle towards the desired trajectory, and second, a low-level controller is designed to utilize the mathematical model of the vehicle to produce force and torque commands for the thrusters onboard the underwater vehicle. A novel adaptive Nussbaum-function-based controller is proposed and compared with an adaptive proportional controller with integral feedback. Further, a conditional adaptation scheme is developed to combat effects of noise, disturbance, or uncertainty. The proposed scheme governs adaptation such that the gains only adapt when it is necessary, even in the presence of noise. The target vehicle for the controller is a four-thruster quadcopter-like vehicle, which does not have direct control over all degrees of freedom. The issue of having an underactuated thruster arrangement is common in many classes of inspection robots. The devised adaptive control law exhibits fast convergence for the adaptation. Four different parametrized trajectories are tested, and the performance of the proposed algorithms, when considering the tracking errors and required control effort, is shown to be superior to an adaptive proportional controller.

AB Automated vehicles have become a popular topic of conversation. Initially, these conversations were limited to technology developers, innovators and engineers, as they worked to progressed the various technologies and systems that are required to create automated vehicles. Then, over time, these conversations extended to other communities; lawyers, insurers, planners, policymakers, social scientists, and various publics all began hearing, and talking about automated vehicles ? also known as ?driverless?, ?self-driving?, and ?autonomous? vehicles. Levels of automation emerged as a way to depict gradations or categories of autonomy, with tasks divided be-tween those for the machine and those for humans. In this paper, we critically reflect upon the dominance of levels of automation ? up to seven sequential ?steps? -proposed by a number of industry organisations. Focusing on the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Standard J3016, we signal the intended and unintended perfor-mative effects of these levels. We argue that current discourses on automated vehicles have been underpinned by a techno-centric, expert-dominated logic, and point to the benefits of more dispersed, geographically contingent, and socio-technical perspectives in re-framing the dominant discourse and allowing for more nuanced spatial and temporal understandings on future systems of (automated) mobility.

AB By platooning, a string of autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) is instructed to accept simultaneous driving control to facilitate the autonomous driving with improved traffic safety and efficiency. However, an AEV with limited battery capacity cannot stably travel with the platoon if its energy is exhausted, which leads to unexpected platoon splitting and further influences the platoon stability. To overcome the bottleneck of platoon lifetime, we integrate wireless power transfer (WPT) into platooning and propose WPT assisted platoon autonomous driving based on a leader-to-follower approach. Specifically, an energy-rich AEV plays as a leader in the platoon to provide reliable and trusted energy replenishment for energy-deficient platoon members who play as followers. We introduce the implementation of the leader-to-follower WPT and study its decentralized energy management. A user-oriented energy allocation problem is formulated, and a Nash mechanism is proposed to solve the problem through a game-based interaction among the noncooperative users. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism can obtain the optimal solution in a privacy-friendly way and has great advantages in improving the overall satisfaction of users.

AB Autonomous tractors, with path tracking as one of the key technologies, have become a research hotspot in recent years. However, the nonlinearity of and uncertainties in the autonomous tractor path tracking process can lead to challenges in terms of control. Although the model-based control method has been widely used in path tracking and achieved good results, only a limited number of model-free adaptive control (MFAC) methods have been developed for path tracking. This paper proposes an MFAC path tracking controller for autonomous tractors based on the use of a preview heading deviation method in which the preview heading angle is used as an input to control the steering, enabling the controller to achieve a small lateral error and stable control. In the simulation, the tracking effects of the designed controller, proportional integral differential (PID) and pure pursuit controllers at different speeds were compared. The results show that the proposed controller has good tracking ability and adaptability and can achieve high tracking accuracy. Finally, the tracking errors of the designed and PID controllers were compared in a real vehicle test, with the results verifying the effectiveness and practicality of the designed controller.

AB Autonomous systems will soon be integrating into our lives as home assistants, delivery drones, and driverless cars. The implementation of the level of automation in these systems from being manually controlled to fully autonomous would depend upon the autonomy approach chosen to design these systems. This article reviews the historical evolution of autonomy, its approaches, and the current trends in related fields to build robust autonomous systems. Toward such a goal and with the increased number of cyberattacks, the security of these systems needs special attention from the research community. To gauge the extent to which research has been done in this area, we discuss the cybersecurity of these systems. It is essential to model the system from a security perspective, identify the threats and vulnerabilities, and then model the attacks. A survey in this direction explores the theoretical/analytical system and attack models that have been proposed over the years and identifies the research gap that needs to be addressed by the research community.

AB Most autonomous car control frameworks are based on a middleware layer with several independent modules that are connected by an inter-process communication mechanism. These modules implement basic actions and report events about their state by subscribing and publishing messages. Here, we propose an executive module that coordinates the activity of these modules. This executive module uses hierarchical interpreted binary Petri nets (PNs) to define the behavior expected from the car in different scenarios according to the traffic rules. The module commands actions by sending messages to other modules and evolves its internal state according to the events (messages) received. A programming environment named RoboGraph (RG) is introduced with this architecture. RG includes a graphical interface that allows the edition, execution, tracing, and maintenance of the PNs. For the execution, a dispatcher loads these PNs and executes the different behaviors. The RG monitor that shows the state of all the running nets has proven to be very useful for debugging and tracing purposes. The whole system has been applied to an autonomous car designed for elderly or disabled people.

AB State-of-the-art (SoTA) object detection models and their accuracy have been improved by a large margin via CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks); however, these models still perform poorly for small road objects. Moreover, the SoTA models are mainly trained on public benchmark datasets such as MS COCO, which include more complicated backgrounds and thus make them robust for object detection. However, for surveillance or road videos, their monotone backgrounds make these SoTA detectors background-over-fitted. In applications such as autonomous driving or traffic flow estimation, the backgroundover-fitting problem will increase various challenges and lead to accuracy degradation in object detection. One novelty of this paper is to propose an MBA (Mixed Background Augmentation) method to improve detection accuracy without adding new labeling efforts and any pre-training processes. During the inference stage, only one input image is needed for vehicle detection without involving background subtraction. Another novelty of this paper is the design of an efficient MSP (Mixed Stage Partial) network to detect objects more accurately and efficiently from surveillance videos. Extensive experiments on KITTI and UA-DETRAC benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves the SoTA results for highly accurate and efficient vehicle detection. The detection accuracy is improved from 78.53% to 83.59% with 25.7 f ps on the UA-DETRAC data set. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/ pingyang1117/MSPNet.

AB Motion control design plays a crucial role in autonomous vehicles. Mainly, these systems operate in conditions of under-actuation, which make the control a serious task especially in presence of practical constraints. The main objective within this paper is to ensure the tracking of 3D reference trajectory overcoming some of the issues related to the control of multi-rotor vehicles (such as underactuation, robustness, limited power, accuracy, overshoot, etc.). Therefore, a control scheme for Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is designed, applying the Interconnection and Damping Assignment-Passivity Based Control (IDA-PBC) technique. As reference model based technique, the control specifications are readily met by fixing a desired dynamic model, which is a major advantage of the technique. Moreover, a port -controlled Hamiltonian representation is exploited in order to point out the physical properties of the system such as its internal energy. This latter is exploited, as a fitness function for an optimization algorithm, in order to decrease the consumed energy especially at the take-off step and allows the tuning of the controller parameters. The numerical simulations have shown satisfactory results that support the claims using nominal system model or disturbed model. The designed controller has been implemented on a real vehicle for which one demonstrates, in an indoor area manipulation, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

AB Ensuring that intelligent vehicles do not cause fatal collisions remains a persistent challenge due to pedestrians' unpredictable movements and behavior. The potential for risky situations or collisions arising from even minor misunderstandings in vehicle-pedestrian interactions is a cause for great concern. Considerable research has been dedicated to the advancement of predictive models for pedestrian behavior through trajectory prediction, as well as the exploration of the intricate dynamics of vehicle-pedestrian interactions. However, it is important to note that these studies have certain limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based trajectory prediction model for vehicle-pedestrian interactions called Holistic Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention (HSTGA) to address these limitations. HSTGA first extracts vehicle-pedestrian interaction spatial features using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) sub-network and max pooling. Then, the vehicle-pedestrian interaction features are aggregated with the spatial features of pedestrians and vehicles to be fed into the LSTM. The LSTM is modified to learn the vehicle-pedestrian interactions adaptively. Moreover, HSTGA models temporal interactions using an additional LSTM. Then, it models the spatial interactions among pedestrians and between pedestrians and vehicles using graph attention networks (GATs) to combine the hidden states of the LSTMs. We evaluate the performance of HSTGA on three different scenario datasets, including complex unsignalized roundabouts with no crosswalks and unsignalized intersections. The results show that HSTGA outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in predicting linear, curvilinear, and piece-wise linear trajectories of vehicles and pedestrians. Our approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of social interactions, enabling more accurate trajectory prediction for safe vehicle navigation.

AB With the development of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, RFID systems on roads (RSR) have recently been put forward to localize not only manned vehicles but also autonomous vehicles. In such an RFID-based localization infrastructure, passive RFID tags with road-related information are deployed on road surfaces, and any vehicle equipped with an RFID reader can interrogate the tags to obtain its locations. However, like traditional RFID systems, reader collisions could occur when many vehicles (readers) continuously move in and out of a tag's reading range, significantly degrading tag reading performance. Although many anti-collision algorithms have been devised to improve tag reading efficiency, none can be applied in highly mobile and dynamic road environments. In this paper, we propose an adaptive mobile tag reading algorithm, which can effectively reduce reader collisions and improve tag reading efficiency for reliable vehicle localization under various traffic scenarios. Extensive simulation and experiment have verified the feasibility and the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. Particularly, the field tests demonstrate that, with moderate vehicle density and sparsely deployed tags, our proposed algorithm can satisfy the tag reading requirements specified by the upper-layer localization system with a probability as high as 0.976.

AB In recent years, the development of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) - mainly based on lidar and cameras - has considerably improved the safety of driving in urban environments. These systems provide warning signals for the driver in the case that any unexpected traffic circumstance is detected. The next step is to develop systems capable not only of warning the driver but also of taking over control of the car to avoid a potential collision. In the present communication, a system capable of autonomously avoiding collisions in traffic jam situations is presented. First, a perception system was developed for urban situations-in which not only vehicles have to be considered, but also pedestrians and other non-motor-vehicles (NMV). It comprises a differential global positioning system (DGPS) and wireless communication for vehicle detection, and an ultrasound sensor for NMV detection. Then, the vehicle's actuators brake and throttle pedals - were modified to permit autonomous control. Finally, a fuzzy logic controller was implemented capable of analyzing the information provided by the perception system and of sending control commands to the vehicle's actuators so as to avoid accidents. The feasibility of the integrated system was tested by mounting it in a commercial vehicle, with the results being encouraging. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) utilize a variety of onboard sensors to sense their surrounding environment. CAVs can improve their perception capabilities if vehicles exchange information about what they sense using V2X communications. This is known as cooperative or collective perception (or sensing). A frequent transmission of collective perception messages could improve the perception capabilities of CAVs. However, this improvement can be compromised if vehicles generate too many messages and saturate the communications channel. An important aspect is then when vehicles should generate the perception messages. ETSI has proposed the first set of message generation rules for collective perception. These rules define when vehicles should generate collective perception messages and what should be their content. We show that the current rules generate a high number of collective perception messages with information about a small number of detected objects. This results in an inefficient use of the communication channel that reduces the effectiveness of collective perception. We address this challenge and propose an improved algorithm that modifies the generation of collective perception messages. We demonstrate that the proposed solution improves the reliability of V2X communication and the perception of CAVs.

AB Switching energy demand for transport from liquid fuels to electricity is the most promising way to significantly improve air quality and reduce transport emissions. Previous studies have shown this is possible, that by 2035 the economics of alternative powertrain and energy vectors will have converged. However, they do not address whether the transition is likely or plausible. Using the UK as a case study, we present a systems dynamics model based study informed by transition theory and explore the effects of technology progress, policy-making, user preferences and; for the first time, automated vehicles on this transition. We are not trying to predict the future but to highlight what is necessary in order for different scenarios to become more or less likely. Worryingly we show that current policies with the expected technology progress and expectations of vehicle buyers are insufficient to reach global targets. Faster technology progress, strong financial incentives or a change in vehicle buyer expectations are crucial but still insufficient. In contrast, the biggest switch to alternatively fuelled vehicles could be achieved by the introduction of automated vehicles. The implications will affect policy makers, automotive manufactures, technology developers and broader society.

AB Adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles are proving to be the first generation of automated vehicles. Although many studies have found that, theoretically, ACC vehicles may have positive impacts on traffic string stability and throughput, recent studies reveal that commercially available ACC vehicles are string unstable. However, it is still not clear what impacts on highway traffic these commercially-available ACC vehicles may have at higher market penetration rates. Therefore, the objective of this study is twofold: (i) investigate the impacts on highway traffic capacity of mixed human-piloted vehicles and theoretical ACC vehicles as well as commercially-available ACC vehicles at different market penetration rates; (ii) explore the potential relationship between string stability and highway throughput.
   We use the intelligent driver model with calibrated parameter values from car following data collected on commercially-available ACC vehicles and compare the simulation results to simulations conducted using a theoretical ACC vehicle model with parameter values obtained in the literature. The results show that when simulating ACC vehicles found in the literature,traffic flow is string stable and the bottleneck capacity increases by up to 7% at higher market penetration rates as compared to homogeneous human driven traffic. When commercially-available ACC vehicles are simulated, the traffic flow is string unstable and the bottleneck capacity decreases at higher market penetration rates with some scenarios resulting in a decrease in capacity of up to 35%. The analysis provides evidence that bottleneck capacity is substantially affected by string stability and inter-vehicle time gap, while downstream throughput is solely influenced by time gap.

AB As the complexity of an unmanned vehicle's operational environment increases so does the need to consider the obstacle space continually, and this is aided by splitting the motion planning functionality into distinct global and local layers. This paper presents a new continuous local motion planning framework, where the output and control space elements of the traditional receding horizon control problem are separated into distinct layers. This separation reduces the complexity of the local motion trajectory optimisation, enabling faster design and increased horizon length. The focus of this paper is on the output space component of this framework. Bezier polynomial functions are used to describe local motion trajectories which are constrained to vehicle performance limits and optimised to track a global trajectory. Development and testing is in simulation, targeted at a nonlinear model of a quadrotor unmanned air vehicle. The defined framework is used to provide situation-aware tracking of a global trajectory in the presence of static and dynamic obstacles, as well as realistic turbulence and gusts. Also demonstrated is the immediate-term decentralised deconfliction of multiple unmanned vehicles, and multiple formations of unmanned vehicles.

ID VEHICLE DETECTION; VISION
AB Sensing is an essential part in autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems. It enables the vehicle to better understand itself and its surrounding environment. Vehicular networks support information sharing among different vehicles and hence enable the multi-vehicle multi-sensor cooperative sensing, which can greatly improve the sensing performance. However, there are a couple of issues to be addressed. First, the multi-sensor data fusion needs to deal with heterogeneous data formats. Second, the cooperative sensing process needs to deal with low data quality and perception blind spots for some vehicles. In order to solve the above problems, in this paper the occupancy grid map is adopted to facilitate the fusion of multi-vehicle and multi-sensor data. The dynamic target detection frame and pixel information of the camera data are mapped to the static environment of the LiDAR point cloud, and the space-based occupancy probability distribution kernel density estimation characterization fusion data is designed , and the occupancy grid map based on the probability level and the spatial level is generated. Real-world experiments show that the proposed fusion framework is better compatible with the data information of different sensors and expands the sensing range by involving the collaborations among multiple vehicles in vehicular networks.

AB We propose semi-autonomous control strategies to assist in the teleoperation of mobile robots under unstable communication conditions. A short-term autonomous control system is the assistance in the semi-autonomous control strategies, when the teleoperation is compromised. The short-term autonomous control comprises of lateral and longitudinal functions. The lateral control is based on an artificial potential field method where obstacles are repulsive, and a route is attractive. LiDAR-based artificial potential field methods are well studied. We present a novel artificial potential field method based on color and depth images. Benefit of a camera system compared to a LiDAR is that a camera detects color, is cheaper, and does not have moving parts. Moreover, utilization of active sensors is not desired in the particle accelerator environment. A set of experiments with a robot prototype are carried out to validate this system. The experiments are carried out in an environment which mimics the accelerator tunnel environment. The difficulty of the teleoperation is altered with obstacles. Fully manual and autonomous control are compared with the proposed semi-autonomous control strategies. The results show that the teleoperation is improved with autonomous, delay-dependent, and control-dependent assist compared to the fully manual control. Based on the operation time, control-dependent assist performed the best, reducing the time by 12% on the tunnel section with most obstacles. The presented system can be easily applied to common industrial robots operating e.g. in warehouses or factories due to hardware simplicity and light computational demand.

AB Machine learning is used for extraction of valuable information from data thus helping in exploration of hidden patterns, leading to learning models that can be used for prediction. In the domain of autonomous vehicles machine learning techniques have been applied in several areas, vehicle platooning being one of them. Vehicle platooning is a vital feature of automated highways which provides the key benefits of fuel economy, road safety and environmental protection coupled with safe road transportation. However, high computational cost associated with the numerical simulation of vehicle aerodynamics makes the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study of vehicle platoon prohibitively expensive and complex. Machine learning, with its high predictive power, has emerged as a promising compliment to CFD studies of external aerodynamics. This paper presents estimation error based performance comparison of five different supervised learning algorithms: Support Vector Regression, Polynomial Regression, Linear Regression and two different models of Neural Networks for prediction of aerodynamic drag coefficient corresponding to each vehicle in a two, three and four vehicle platoon configurations based on the drag coefficients provided by experimental study at different inter-vehicle distances. Predicted drag coefficients are then juxtaposed with CFD data from numerical simulations to evaluate closeness to experimental drag coefficients. Results reveal that polynomial regression model best fits the aerodynamics with 0.0223 estimation error. To the best of our knowledge no machine learning based methods have been applied before for modeling aerodynamic drag on vehicle platoon.

AB Novel innovations have been witnessed in the past few years in the field of technology for autonomous vehicles. These have been exploited in various applications in the maritime domain; one such application is the proposal to develop autonomous passenger ships (APS) or ferries for carrying passengers in urban waterways. Such technology requires the integration of several components to support the safe and secure operation of the ferries. In this paper, a communication architecture is proposed, that satisfies pre-established communication requirements and supports autonomous and remotely controlled functions of an APS. The architecture was designed using the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL); this enabled an iterative design process to be followed and allows for future improvements. The proposed architecture is verified by showcasing the role of the different architectural components in addressing the requirements and in supporting the expected functions in a number of operational scenarios based on the expected operations of an APS use case called "Autoferry." Furthermore, the proposed architecture has been evaluated by demonstrating its ability to achieve the expected performance according to the requirements, in simulated experiments using the network simulator GNS3.

ID GENERATION
AB With the increasing applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in surveying, mapping, rescue, etc., the security of autonomous flight in complex environments becomes a crucial issue. Deploying autonomous UAVs in complex environments typically requires them to have accurate dynamic obstacle perception, such as the detection of birds and other flying vehicles at high altitudes, as well as humans and ground vehicles at low altitudes or indoors. This work's primary goal is to cope with both static and moving obstacles in the environment by developing a new framework for UAV planning and control. Firstly, the point clouds acquired from the depth camera are divided into dynamic and static points, and then the velocity of the point cloud clusters is estimated. The static point cloud is used as the input for the local mapping. Path finding is simplified by identifying key points among static points. Secondly, the design of a trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance controller based on the control barrier function guarantees security for moving and static obstacles. The path-finding module can stably search for the shortest path, and the controller can deal with moving obstacles with high-frequency. Therefore, the UAV can deal with both long-term planning and immediate emergencies. The framework proposed in this work enables a UAV to operate in a wider field, with better security and real-time performance.

ID PROBABILISTIC DATA ASSOCIATION; MULTITARGET TRACKING; CLUTTER
AB In an intelligent multi-target tracking (MTT) system, the tracking filter cannot track multi-targets significantly through occlusion in a low-altitude airspace. The most challenging issues are the target deformation, target occlusion and targets being concealed by the presence of background clutter. Thus, the true tracks that follow the desired targets are often lost due to the occlusion of uncertain measurements detected by a sensor, such as a motion capture (mocap) sensor. In addition, sensor measurement noise, process noise and clutter measurements degrade the system performance. To avoid track loss, we use the Markov-chain-two (MC2) model that allows the propagation of target existence through the occlusion region. We utilized the MC2 model in linear multi-target tracking based on the integrated probabilistic data association (LMIPDA) and proposed a modified integrated algorithm referred to here as LMIPDA-MC2. We consider a three-dimensional surveillance for tracking occluded targets, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other autonomous vehicles at low altitude in clutters. We compared the results of the proposed method with existing Markov-chain model based algorithms using Monte Carlo simulations and practical experiments. We also provide track retention and false-track discrimination (FTD) statistics to explain the significance of the LMIPDA-MC2 algorithm.

AB In this work, the output feedback sliding mode control (SMC) methods are developed for the path-tracking control system of autonomous agricultural vehicles with unknown bounded disturbances, where only the position deviation information of vehicles is required to be known for the control implementation. First of all, the path-tracking offset dynamics model is converted to a canonical system by introducing a coordinate transformation, where the unmodeled dynamics, the external disturbances, the parameter perturbations in the transformed system is regarded as a lumped term. Then, the second-order robust exact differentiator (RED) reconstructs the unknown system state in finite time and provides an estimate of the unknown lumped perturbation in the resulting system. On this foundation, the traditional first-order sliding mode (FOSM) controller is constructed to ensure that the lateral deviation and the orientation error will approach the origin as closely as possible. To further improve the transient performance of the path-tracking errors, the second-order sliding mode (SOSM) controller is designed by means of the modified adding a power integrator (API) technique. The Lyapunov analysis is carried out to verify the finite-time convergence of the path-tracking errors. Finally, comprehensive simulation results are presented to clearly illustrate that the designed control strategies can acquire high precision path-tracking performance and significantly reduce the chattering effects.

AB This study determines the threshold for the computational rate of actuator motor controllers for unmanned underwater vehicles necessary to accurately follow discontinuous square wave commands. Motors must track challenging square-wave inputs, and identification of key computational rates permit application of deterministic artificial intelligence (D.A.I.) to achieve tracking to a machine-precision degree of accuracy in direct comparison to other state-of-art approaches. All modeling approaches are validated in MATLAB simulations where the motor process is discretized at varying step-sizes (inversely proportional to computational rate). At a large step-size (fast computational rate), discrete D.A.I. shows a mean error more than three times larger than that of a ubiquitous model-following approach. Yet, at a smaller step size (slower computational rate), the mean error decreases by a factor of 10, only three percent larger than that of continuous D.A.I. Hence, the performance of discrete D.A.I. is critically affected by the sampling period for discretization of the system equations and computational rate. Discrete D.A.I. should be avoided when small step-size discretization is unavailable. In fact, continuous D.A.I. has surpassed all modeling approaches, which makes it the safest and most viable solution to future commercial applications in unmanned underwater vehicles.

AB Reinforcement learning-based techniques, empowered by deep-structured neural nets, have demonstrated superiority over rule-based methods in terms of making high-level behavioral decisions due to qualities related to handling large state spaces. Nonetheless, their training time, sample efficiency and the feasibility of the learnt behaviors remain key concerns. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning-based decision-making architecture for learning left-turn policies at unsignalized intersections with feasibility guarantees. The proposed technique is comprised of two layers; a high-level learning-based behavioral planning layer which adopts soft actor-critic (SAC) principles to learn high-level, non-conservative yet safe, driving behaviors, and a low-level motion planning layer that uses Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to ensure feasibility of the two-dimensional left-turn maneuver. The high-level layer generates reference signals of velocity and yaw angles for the ego vehicle taking into account safety and collision avoidance with the intersection vehicles, whereas the low-level motion planning layer solves an optimization problem to track these reference commands taking into account several vehicle dynamic constraints and ride comfort. While training the behavioral SAC-based planning layer, We develop an adaptive entropy regularization technique that results in faster convergence, higher mean rewards, and lower collision rates. We validate the proposed decision-making scheme in simulated environments and compare with other model free Reinforcement Learning (RL) baselines. The results demonstrate that the proposed integrated framework possesses better training and navigation capabilities.

AB Underwater sensor networks (UWSNs) are of interest to gather data from underwater sensor nodes (SNs) and deliver information to a terrestrial access point (AP) in the uplink transmission, and transfer data from the AP to the SNs in the downlink transmission. In this paper, we investigate a triple-hop UWSN in which autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relays enable end-to-end communications between the SNs and the AP. It is assumed that the SN-AUV, AUV-UAV, and UAV-AP links are deployed by underwater optical communication (UWOC), free-space optic (FSO), and radio frequency (RF) technologies, respectively. Two scenarios are proposed for the FSO uplink and downlink transmissions between the AUV and the UAV, subject to water-to-air and air-to-water interface impacts; direct transmission scenario (DTS) and retro-reflection scenario (RRS). After providing the channel models and their statistics, the UWSN's outage probability and average bit error rate (BER) are computed. Besides, a tracking procedure is proposed to set up reliable and stable AUV- UAV FSO communications. Through numerical results, it is concluded that the RSS scheme outperforms the DTS one with about 200% (32%) and 80% (17%) better outage probability (average BER) in the uplink and downlink, respectively. It is also shown that the tracking procedure provides on average 480% and 170% improvements in the network's outage probability and average BER, respectively, compared to poorly aligned FSO conditions. The results are verified by applying Monte-Carlo simulations.

AB Automated vehicle (AV) technology is rapidly moving towards reality and will be mature within the next decade. However, the physical, institutional, and legal infrastructure for enabling widespread adoption of this technology are still lagging significantly. The focus of this research is on developing a decision framework for optimal upgrading of the road network for mixed AV and conventional (NAV) traffic. Given that AVs will undoubtedly share a large segment of the current road network with conventional traffic for the foreseeable future, how the network can be retrofitted to optimize flow of all traffic is a critical issue. Of particular interest are questions regarding when and where the provision of dedicated lanes for AVs can offer benefits for all traffic, and at what level of AV adoption this investment becomes cost-effective. Answers to these questions are critical for planning the future transportation system. We use the term autonomous vehicle to indicate that they can not only drive without human interference using sensing technology but can also communicate with other vehicles and road infrastructure. While the technology is progressing rapidly, planning infrastructure investments and enhancements to optimally harness the benefits of AV technology capabilities merits serious attention. Specifically, the use of dedicated lanes to accommodate AVs so that they may platoon is an important consideration from a policy as well as planning perspective. The proposed study investigates this issue to determine when and where dedicated AV lanes would provide the maximum benefit to all traffic and make such infrastructure investments cost effective.

ID DESIGN
AB The use of autonomous underwater vehicles is often hampered by stringent power constraints that limit the duration of their deployment. Here, we present a novel autonomous underwater charging system for robotic fish. The system features a charging station designed with form-fit claws to facilitate the robotic fish docking. A controller is implemented externally to monitor the battery level of the robotic fish, swimming autonomously in two dimensions. When the battery level is low, the controller commands the robotic fish to approach the charging station using video feedback from an overhead camera. The approach angle of the robotic fish to the charging station is optimized through a series of experiments, assessing the success of both docking and electrical contact, as well as the time to approach the charging station. To demonstrate the feasibility of the autonomous charging system, the robotic fish is monitored as it cycles through periods of charging and discharging while swimming in the tank. The proposed system is expected to find application in laboratory and educational settings, where robotic fish should operate with minimal supervision and assistance from technical staff over extended time periods.

AB The uptake of electric vehicles supports decarbonization and increasingly interconnects the electricity and transport system. While the integration of electric vehicles could challenge electricity grids, bidirectional power flows between vehicles and grids could support grid operations. Despite the globally increasing number of Vehicle-to-X trials, including Vehicle-to-Grid and Vehicle-to-Customer, an in-depth understanding of trial implementations and expert experiences has largely been overlooked although they are both crucial for technological development and deployment. Based on our analysis of a global Vehicle-to-X trial database and 47 interviews with experts from industry and academia, we (i) provide an overview of the implementation status of Vehicle-to-X and analyze predominate trial configurations, i.e. combinations of characteristics, (ii) identify important technical, social and regulatory challenges for the implementation of Vehicle-to-X and assess and discuss expert evaluations of these challenges and (iii) derive implications for different actors. The most predominate trial configurations are Vehicle-to-Customer and transmission-level services provided by commercial fleets that charge at work due to current practical advantages of centralized approaches. From a technical standpoint, we find that although Vehicle-to-X can defer or even mitigate grid reinforcement at the distribution level, this potential is highly dependent on local conditions. Regarding social aspects, incentives and Vehicle-to-X operations need to be tailored to different vehicle users. Concerning regulation, it is imperative to avoid double taxation of electricity, simplify market participation for small providers, and further develop Vehicle-to-X standards. Implications for actors include the evaluation and enablement of portfolios with different flexibility assets, and stacking of services to increase revenue streams and reduce risk resulting from variations in driving patterns and charging behavior.

AB As a novel computing paradigm, multiaccess edge computing (MEC) migrates computing and storage capabilities to edge nodes of the network to meet the requirements of executing computationally intensive or delay-sensitive tasks on intelligent vehicles. In addition, MEC fills the gap between cloud computing and terminals in vehicular networks. In the MEC system, to reduce the load on MEC servers with large-scale vehicle deployment and promote the efficient use of network resources, vehicles can also transfer tasks to neighboring resource-rich vehicles using cooperative computation offloading. However, cooperative computation offloading between vehicles faces the challenges of security and insufficient information about the server vehicle. Therefore, this paper proposes using blockchain technology to achieve efficient data sharing between vehicles and service providers (i.e., server vehicles) and ensure the security of computation offloading between vehicles. First, we design a secure data sharing architecture in blockchain-based vehicular edge computing networks. Then, a new consensus mechanism in this architecture is proposed to improve the efficiency of data sharing and prevent malicious attacks. Furthermore, we present a cooperative offloading decision-making method using an offloading game, and the Nash equilibrium of the offloading strategy is achieved using this method. The results of numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.

AB In order to reduce the environmental impacts caused by the transport sector, autonomous and electrified on-the-road modular vehicles (otrm) could be a solution. By separating the drive unit from the transport unit, they enable use cases for various transport tasks and reduce individual and motorized transport and its generated emissions. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the environmental impacts from cradle to grave by applying the LCA methodology for a defined otrm-the U-Shift-vehicle fleet considering a specific use case relative to a reference vehicle fleet. The results indicate that the U-Shift fleet reduces the life cycle environmental impacts in a range of 3-28% for all of the seven impact categories, which are analyzed in detail. While emissions from the use phase are similar, U-Shift has an environmental benefit in the production phase due to a low amount of resource-intensive driveboards. Considering the early development stage of U-Shift, several measures are discussed, addressing the material and configuration aspects of the vehicles as well as optimized use case applications, which promise further impact-reduction potential.

AB This paper studies the cooperative driving of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) at conflict areas (e.g., non-signalized intersections and ramping regions). Due to safety concerns, most existing studies prohibit lane change since this may cause lateral collisions when coordination is not appropriately performed. However, in many traffic scenarios (e.g., work zones), vehicles must change lanes. To solve this problem, we categorize the potential collision into two kinds and thus establish a bi-level planning problem. The right-of-way of vehicles for the critical conflict zone is considered in the upper-level, and the right-of-way of vehicles during lane changes is then resolved in the lower-level. The solutions of the upper-level problem are represented in tree space, and a near-optimal solution is searched for by combining Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with some heuristic rules within a very short planning time. The proposed strategy is suitable for not only the shortest delay objective but also other objectives (e.g., energy-saving). Numerical examples show that the proposed strategy leads to good traffic performance in real-time.

AB Intensive interactions among vehicles at freeway on-ramp merging areas lead to congestion and accidents. The emergence of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) has shown great potential to improve this issue. In this paper, a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is proposed and solved for the task of a cooperative merging of two traffic streams at a freeway on-ramp merging section. The proposed model simultaneously optimizes multiple vehicles' trajectories and their merging sequence to improve traffic efficiency and ensure safety. Unlike conventional treatments, which match one mainline facilitating vehicle with one merging vehicle, the proposed model determines the optimal number of facilitating vehicles and which mainline vehicles should serve as the facilitating vehicles to cooperatively minimize disruption from ramps. The safety and feasibility of the planned vehicle trajectories are guaranteed at any time. We propose an integrated solution algorithm that incorporates an iterative linear programming method into a novel search process based on a necessary condition for optimality that we identify and prove. The algorithm is highly efficient because it enjoys a significantly reduced search space. The proposed approach, consisting of the MINLP model and the solution algorithm, is evaluated under different traffic demands and mainline-ramp demand ratios and real vehicle arrival patterns from the NGSIM dataset. The performance of the proposed method outperforms benchmark CAV control algorithms, and the computational efficiency is promising for real-time automated merging tasks.

AB When operating autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in real environments it is necessary to deal with the effects of wind that causes the aircraft to drift in a certain direction. In such conditions it is hard or even impossible for UAVs with a bounded turning rate to follow certain trajectories. We designed a method based on an Accelerated A* algorithm that allows the trajectory planner to take the wind effects into account and to generate states that are reachable by UAV. This method was tested on hardware UAV and the reachability of its generated trajectories was compared to the trajectories computed by the original Accelerated A*.

AB Cooperating unprotected turns in mixed connected and autonomous traffic environments is beneficial to improving the systemic utility of intersections. However, interactions among connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and manually driving vehicles (MVs) are varied and interrelated. These factors make the cooperation a multimodal problem and bring many difficulties to interactions analyzing and the optimal plan solving. This paper proposes a situationaware Reasoning Graph (RG) framework that consists of the Reasoning Process and the Solution Process. Complex interactions are first described by a graph, where the mapping from situations to the graph is constructed. Then the Reasoning Process divides future motion space into numerous situations and reasons potential situations using the graph search-based algorithm. Some rules for maneuver compatibility and social interaction customs are integrated into the graph search to ensure the maneuver compatibility and social compliance of these reasoned situations. The Solution Process develops a heuristic algorithm to quickly search for speed profiles that follow the reasoned situations. After comparative tests of the reservation-based and the optimization-based methods, the results show that the RG-based method helped decrease the average systemic cost by approximately 10%. However, it did not cause losses in individual performances. The statistical analysis of individual performance shows that the RG even increased the individual performances regarding safety, efficiency, and energy-saving.

ID SYSTEM RESTORATION
AB This study presents a new method of forming emergency-responsive autonomous islands for restoring electric power supply using an electric vehicle (EV) idle power against the so-called cold load pickup (CLPU). Two stepwise discretisation methodologies are firstly proposed, which are used to discretise arbitrarily given cold-load models and aggregate discretised EV discharge models, respectively. Then, under the framework of mixed-integer linear programming, a methodology of forming particular responsive restoration islands is built, which aims to maximise the recovered energy of interrupted end-users given discretised CLPU and EV discharge models. Comparative analyses via the proposed method against existing algorithms are conducted on both a partial IEEE RBTS-BUS6 test feeder and a practical feeder. Specifically, the conducted analyses investigate the impacts of the CLPU on energy restoration and the assistance performance of discharge power from EV's on boosting the capability of responsive restoration islands to restore the interruption. Moreover, an especial relationship is studied, between the utilisation rate of total discharge power of an EV parking lot and the rate of restored energy concerning the total lost energy.

AB Vehicle to anything (V2X), especially vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technology, is regarded as a promising technology to improve traffic efficiency and safety. Under V2V environment, drivers can communicate with each other, and obtain the real-time information of followers, besides of that from the preceding vehicle. According to the condition of sending a request of cooperative driving to the preceding vehicle, drivers are categorized into three sensitivity types, i.e. aggressive, normal and conservative. The mechanism of the driver's reaction to the backward request is also presented. Then, a safety rule-based cellular automaton (CA) model is developed, which involves bi-directional vehicular information. Finally, through numerical experiments, the influences of cooperative driving by V2V on traffic efficiency and safety are analyzed and concluded as follows. 1) The cooperative driving is conducive to improving the efficiency of vehicles to achieve their desired states when the speed constraint (of head vehicle) is serious; 2) The higher average danger coefficient is produced in the more congested vehicular fleet; 3) With regard to homogeneous vehicle fleets, more aggressive driving behaviors with V2V communication results in the lower safety performance, but can increase the traffic flux at synchronized flow and congested state; 4) As for heterogeneous vehicle fleets, the stimulation type, the sensitivity type, and the orders of sensitivity types all have an important effect in the safety performance.

AB A telematics device is a vehicle instrument that comes preinstalled by the vehicle manufacturer or can be added later. The device records information about driving behavior, including speed, acceleration, and turning force. When connected to vehicle computers, the device can also provide additional information regarding the mechanical usage and condition of the vehicle. All of this information can be transmitted to a central database via mobile networks. The information provided has led to new services such as Usage Based Insurance (UBI). A range of consultants, industry commentators and academics have produced an abundance of projections on how telematics information will allow the introduction of services from personalized insurance, bespoke entertainment and advertise and vehicle energy optimization, particularly for Electric Vehicles (EVs). In this paper we examine these potential services against a backdrop of nascent regulatory limitations and against the technical capacity of the devices. Using a case study approach, we examine three applications that can use telematics information. We find that the expectations of service providers will be significantly tempered by regulatory and technical hurdles. In our discussion we detail these limitations and suggest a more realistic rollout of ancillary services.

ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE; MOTION
AB Motion planning and control for articulated logistic vehicles such as tugger trains is a challenging problem in service robotics. The case of tugger trains presents particular difficulties due to the kinematic complexity of these multiarticulated vehicles. Sampling-based motion planners offer a motion planning solution that can take into account the kinematics and dynamics of the vehicle. However, their planning times scale poorly for high dimensional systems, such as these articulated vehicles moving in a big map. To improve the efficiency of the sampling-based motion planners, some approaches combine these methods with discrete search techniques. The goal is to direct the sampling phase with heuristics provided by a faster, precociously ran, discrete search planner. However, sometimes these heuristics can mislead the search towards unfeasible solutions, because the discrete search planners do not take into account the kinematic and dynamic restrictions of the vehicle. In this paper we present a solution adapted for articulated logistic vehicles that uses a kinodynamic discrete planning to bias the sampling-based algorithm. The whole system has been applied in two different towing tractors (a tricycle and a quadricycle) with two different trailers (simple trailer and synchronized shaft trailer).

AB The goal of this study was to analyze the impact of private autonomous vehicles (PAVs), specifically their near-activity location travel patterns, on vehicle miles traveled (VMT). The study proposes an integrated mode choice and simulation-based parking assignment model, along with an iterative solution approach, to analyze the impacts of PAVs on VMT, mode choice, parking lot usage, and other system performance measures. The dynamic simulation-based parking assignment model determines the parking location choice of each traveler as a function of the spatial-temporal demand for parking from the mode choice model, whereas the multinomial logit mode choice model determines mode splits based on the costs and service quality of each travel mode coming, in part, from the parking assignment model. The paper presents a case study to illustrate the power of the modeling framework. The case study varies the percentage of persons with a private vehicle (PV) who own a PAV versus a private conventional vehicle (PCV). The results indicated that PAV owners traveled an extra 0.11 to 1.51 mi compared with PCV owners on average, and the PV mode share was significantly higher for PAV owners. Therefore, as PCVs are converted into PAVs in the future, the results indicate substantial increases in VMT near activity destinations. However, the results also indicated that adjusting parking fees and redistributing parking lot capacities could reduce VMT. The significant increase in VMT from PAVs implies that planners should develop policies to reduce PAV deadheading miles near activity locations, as the automated era comes closer.

Heterogeneous multi-robot systems can offer a solution to this limitation, by allowing an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to serve as a recharging station for the aerial one. Moreover, cooperation between aerial and terrestrial robots allows them to overcome other individual limitations, such as communication link coverage or accessibility, and to solve highly complex tasks, e.g., environment exploration, infrastructure inspection or search and rescue. This work proposes a vision-based approach that enables an aerial robot to autonomously detect, follow, and land on a mobile ground platform. For this purpose, ArUcO fiducial markers are used to estimate the relative pose between the UAV and UGV by processing RGB images provided by a monocular camera on board the UAV. The pose estimation is fed to a trajectory planner and four decoupled controllers to generate speed set-points relative to the UAV. Using a cascade loop strategy, these set-points are then sent to the UAV autopilot for inner loop control. The proposed solution has been tested both in simulation, with a digital twin of a solar farm using ROS, Gazebo and Ardupilot Software-in-the-Loop (SiL); and in the real world at IST Lisbon's outdoor facilities, with a UAV built on the basis of a DJ550 Hexacopter and a modified Jackal ground robot from DJI and Clearpath Robotics, respectively. Pose estimation, trajectory planning and speed set-point are computed on board the UAV, using a Single Board Computer (SBC) running Ubuntu and ROS, without the need for external infrastructure.

AB The hybrid aerial underwater vehicle (HAUV) merges the best of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and unmanned underwater vehicle into one platform makes it possible to operate in both the air and water. Various possible applications of HAUV have aroused much research on it. However, the underwater endurance and operation depth of current HAUVs are still limited. This hinders the application and popularization of HAUV in rugged environments. This paper presented the design, fabrication, and testing of a novel concept HAUV, Nezha III. It is featured by its piston-driven underwater glide strategy and combination of an underwater glider and fixed-wing vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. In-depth design and evaluation of the amphibious wings with tradeoffs between aerodynamic and hydrodynamic performance in both fluids was conducted. The vehicle prototype was built, and field experiments, including domain transitions and underwater operations, were conducted in Qiandao Lake, China. Due to the experiment site constraints, the computational fluid dynamics technique evaluated horizontal flight performance with fixed wings. The experimental results show that the prototype can realize rotor flight and stable domain transitions. Moreover, this piston-driven underwater glide strategy extended the HAUV's underwater endurance over 24 h and operational depth to 25.5 m. To the best of our knowledge, Nezha III possesses the most extended underwater endurance among existing HAUVs.

AB In a large-scale epidemic, reducing direct contact among medical personnel, attendants and patients has become a necessary means of epidemic prevention and control. Intelligent vehicles and mobile robots in the hospital environment, such as disinfection vehicles, logistics vehicles, nursing robots, and guiding robots, play an important role in improving the operational efficiency of the medical system and promoting epidemic prevention and governance. Powerful capabilities of environmental spatial perception and reconstruction are the keys to accurate localization, navigation, and obstacle avoidance for intelligent vehicles and autonomous robots in such operations. Omnidirectional perception is becoming increasingly important and proliferative in autonomous vehicles and robots since its wide field of view significantly enhances the perception ability. However, the lack of dense and accurate 360 degrees depth datasets has brought the challenge to the omnidirectional perception. In this paper, we propose a depth-sensing and reconstruction system to address this challenge in the large-scale indoor environment. First, we design an omnidirectional depth completion convolutional neural network model, in which a spherical normalized convolutional and the unit sphere area-based loss are introduced to extract features from cross-modal omnidirectional input with unequal sparsity and deal with the imbalanced data distribution and distortion in the panoramic input. In addition, we present a 3D reconstruction system by integrating our depth completion into omnidirectional localization and dense mapping. We evaluate our method on 360D large-scale indoor datasets and real-world sequences of a challenging hospital scene. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the other state-of-the-art (SoTA) approaches in terms of depth completion and 3D reconstruction.

AB Many connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) applications benefit from navigation technologies that reliably achieve lane-level accuracy. Global organizations have recently begun to provide real-time common-mode error corrections for Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) that enable this level of positioning accuracy using Precise Point Positioning (PPP). Incorporating an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) with a GNSS receiver can achieve this positioning performance reliably on moving platforms while providing a full state estimate, with high bandwidth at a high sampling rate. For commercial automotive applications cost is critical; therefore, this article focuses on commercial grade IMU's and single-frequency GNSS code and Doppler measurements. This article presents and demonstrates a tightly-coupled PPP GNSS aided Inertial Navigation System (INS) using only publicly available real-time data sources. The article discusses the role of the INS in automotive applications and how the quality of the IMU affects the ability to achieve that role. The experimental results demonstrate positioning accuracy that surpasses the Society of Automotive Engineering (SAE) J2945 specification (horizontal error <= 1.5 m and vertical error <= 3 m 68%).

TI Anomaly recognition method of perception system for autonomous vehicles

SO ELECTRONICS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB Environmental perception system is the premise of the safety and stability of the autonomous vehicle system. However, studies have shown that the on-board sensors included in the perception system are extremely vulnerable to external attacks and interference, leading to incorrect driving strategies and bringing great security threats. Aiming at the problem, this paper divides the vehicle-mounted sensors into a positioning group and an identification group according to their role in the perception system. Then, based on the information correlation between sensors in the same group and the information correlation of a single sensor on adjacent time series, the distance metric model between sensors in a group and the distance metric model for each sensor of this group on time series is established. And the normal distance intervals corresponding to the confidence interval are calculated respectively. According to the distance metric model between sensors, the authors can detect anomalies in the perception system in real time. Further, according to the distance metric model for each sensor on adjacent time series, the authors can identify anomaly sensors. The authors' experimental results quantitatively show that the method achieves real-time anomaly recognition, and demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the method on the open-source Karlsruhe institute of technology and toyota technological institute (KITTI) dataset.

AB Autonomous landing on a moving target is challenging because of external disturbances and localization errors. In this paper, we present a vision-based guidance technique with a log polynomial closing velocity controller to achieve faster and more accurate landing as compared to that of the traditional vertical landing approaches. The vision system uses a combination of color segmentation and AprilTags to detect the landing pad. No prior information about the landing target is needed. The guidance is based on pure pursuit guidance law. The convergence of the closing velocity controller is shown, and we test the efficacy of the proposed approach through simulations and field experiments. The landing target during the field experiments was manually dragged with a maximum speed of 0.6 m/s. In the simulations, the maximum target speed of the ground vehicle was 3 m/s. We conducted a total of 27 field experiment runs for landing on a moving target and achieved a successful landing in 22 cases. The maximum error magnitude for successful landing was recorded to be 35 cm from the landing target center. For the failure cases, the maximum distance of vehicle landing position from target boundary was 60 cm.

AB As one of the classical problems in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) research, path planning has obtained a lot of research results. Many studies have focused on planning an optimal path for AUVs. These optimal paths are sometimes too close to obstacles. In the real environment, it is difficult for AUVs to avoid obstacles according to such an optimal path. To solve the safety problem of AUV path planning in a dynamic uncertain environment, an algorithm combining a bio-inspired neural network and potential field is proposed. Based on the environmental information, the bio-inspired neural network plans the optimal path for the AUV. The potential field function adjusts the path planned by the bio-inspired neural network so that the actual AUV can avoid obstacles. The proposed approach for AUV path planning with safety consideration is capable of planning a real-time "comfortable" trajectory by overcoming either "too close" or "too far" shortcomings. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm considers both AUV security and path rationality. The planned path can meet the need for collision-free navigation of AUVs in a dynamic, uncertain environment.

AB This paper presents a path planner which exploits ocean energy to enable long-range operation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in turbulent, cluttered, time varying and uncertain environments. The proposed strategy employs current field forecasts within an evolutionary path planner to find an optimal trajectory for an AUV, with maximum energy utilization of the current motion and minimal time usage to reach its destination. The proposed path planner is simulated to generate an optimal trajectory for an AUV navigating through a spatiotemporal variable ocean environment in the presence of irregularly shaped terrains as well as obstacles whose position coordinates are uncertain. Simulation results show that with integration of an ocean current forecast model, the proposed methodology is able to obtain a more optimized trajectory than one relying on a static current map. Monte Carlo simulations were run to testify the performance of the proposed path planner, and analyse the effects of currents prediction uncertainties on the time optimal path. The results highlight the benefits of including ocean forecasts in the planning, and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme based on a forecasted ocean current map compared with a configured quasi-stationary scenario.

AB This paper presents a scientometric and bibliometric review of the research on autonomous vehicles (AVs) to identify its main characteristics, evolution, and potential trends for future studies. Relevant articles were searched on WoS, yielding a research corpus of 10,580 papers, and the software CiteSpace was subsequently used for analysis. The results showed that AV research is heterogeneous and registered a growing demand over time. Multidisciplinarity is present, with 96 science fields being identified. As in any other sector, it is necessary to understand broader aspects of this industry such as the market factors surrounding it, as well as other economic and managerial issues. In this sense, we observed a migration of the research field from multidisciplinarity to pluridisciplinarity with a greater number of studies focusing on the latter. We understand that terminology standardisation contributes to achieving pluridisciplinarity. As such, it is important to highlight that sustainability, public policies, liability, and safety, as well as business issues such as performance and business models are some of the tendencies in the field of AVs. For future studies, we suggest a more in-depth analysis of publications in terms of individual search terms, as well as the sub-areas identified as trends in this paper.

AB Machine perception of dynamic scenes becomes more and more important for autonomous vehicles and vision-based driver-assistance systems. Even with other 3D ranging devices, dense, detailed and instantaneous detection of optical flow is essential for early distinguishing small moving objects in the 3D environment from the moving vehicle. To overcome the limited performance in the immediacy, resolution, accuracy and acuity of existing methods, we provide an optical flow detection scheme based on a three-phase correlation image sensor (3PCIS) that is capable of Fourier-coefficient imaging combined with an exact and direct algorithm derived from the weighted integral method of identifying the differential equation model from a short-duration observation. To utilize inherent performances of the detection scheme by removing the large and rapid disturbances induced by the rotational fluctuations of the platform, we introduce a software operation of gaze in which the image coordinates are fixed on and smoothly pursue a forward stable object so that the optical flow field is relative to the moving coordinate system. In it, the gaze subsystem continuously provides angular velocity and pose between the camera and gaze target, while the imaging subsystem instantaneously obtains two optical flow distributions by cancelling the ego-rotation components and then removing the outwardly diverging components derived mainly from stationary 3D environments. Possible anomalies captured in each frame instantaneously provide candidates of hazardous objects that should be tracked and further investigated. We examine the performance of optical flow stabilization and anomaly detection using image sequences of monocular 3PCIS mounted on a moving vehicle on town roads and a highway.

ID OPERATIONS; FLEET
AB While connected, highly automated, and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) will eventually hit the roads, their success and market penetration rates depend largely on public opinions regarding benefits, concerns, and adoption of these technologies. Additionally, the introduction of these technologies is accompanied by uncertainties in their effects on the carsharing market and land use patterns, and raises the need for tolling policies to appease the travel demand induced due to the increased convenience. To these ends, this study surveyed 1088 respondents across Texas to understand their opinions about smart vehicle technologies and related decisions. The key summary statistics indicate that Texans are willing to pay (WTP) $2910, $4607, $7589, and $127 for Level 2, Level 3, and Level 4 automation and connectivity, respectively, on average. Moreover, affordability and equipment failure are Texans' top two concerns regarding AVs. This study also estimates interval regression and ordered probit models to understand the multivariate correlation between explanatory variables, such as demographics, built-environment attributes, travel patterns, and crash histories, and response variables, including willingness to pay for CAV technologies, adoption rates of shared AVs at different pricing points, home location shift decisions, adoption timing of automation technologies, and opinions about various tolling policies. The practically significant relationships indicate that more experienced licensed drivers and older people associate lower WTP values with all new vehicle technologies. Such parameter estimates help not only in forecasting long-term adoption of CAV technologies, but also help transportation planners in understanding the characteristics of regions with high or low future-year CAV adoption levels, and subsequently, develop smart strategies in respective regions.

AB To find the most-likely-failure scenarios given a certain operation domain, a critical-scenario-based test is supposed as an effective method. However, for the state of the art, critical-scenario-generation approaches commonly based on random-search and take amounts of computing resource, some of them are also inapplicable in real time. Moreover, the approaches sometimes fail to obtain critical results, which are strongly relevant to the choice of initial condition. In order to address the above challenges, the authors proposed a Real-time Critical-scenario-generation framework in this paper. The authors proposed an aggressive-driving algorithm based on the model predictive control method to lead the agent vehicle. The agent vehicle will be controlled to directly create critical scenarios for a black-box target under test, and the real-time critical-scenario test can be brought into reality. A specially designed cost function is presented that guides scenarios to evolve towards the interested conditions, and a self-adaptive coefficient iteration is designed that enables the approach to be applied within a wider range of initial conditions. The authors carried out both simulation and Vehicle-in-the-Loop (VIL) test; in the VIL test, the authors' approach improves 15.45% criticality of scenarios with around 9.7 times of efficiency, or improves 38.67% criticality with still around 1.7 times of efficiency with further iterations.
   The authors' work focuses on generating critical scenarios for designers to detect defections of a developing autonomous driving system. With their approach, given a black-box real-time system, a series of critical scenarios which indicates failure driving conditions can be obtained within minutes.image

AB This paper reports on the execution of a combined chemical sensing/high-resolution terrain-following autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) survey to explore the fine structure and functional boundaries of the Santa Monica Basin suboxic zone and its relationship to topography. An AUV mapping vehicle is used in a novel configurationcombining the mapping vehicle tail section, with precision inertial navigation and acoustic communications systems, with CTD/O-2, NO3 sensing, and Gulper water sampling systems. The challenge was to perform a long-distance near-bottom physical/chemical survey in deep water without any intermediate surfacing to disrupt the survey or require the vehicle to surface in areas of heavy ship traffic. Some 210 km of AUV cruise track at approximate to 10 m above bottom were accomplished during a 3-day survey. The dissolved oxygen concentration [O-2] data are combined with temperature T, salinity S, and hydrostatic pressure P to produce maps of oxygen partial pressure pO(2) that help define the limits at which the oceanic supply of O-2 can match the O-2 demands required to sustain various forms of marine life. The chemical NO3 sensing was included to define the critical pO(2) boundary at which NO3 reduction occurs. The combination of a high-resolution terrain-following AUV with chemical sensors is important for a diverse array of investigations, including the study of vent sites, and for locating the source of chemical signals originating from the seafloor. The hypoxic basin example here permits better discrimination between general climate/circulation controls on hypoxia and more specific point-source-driven processes.

ID DRIVERS STRESS; VEHICLES; SYSTEM
AB The evaluation of car drivers' stress condition is gaining interest as research on Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) progresses. The analysis of the stress response can be used to assess the acceptability of ADS and to compare the driving styles of different autonomous drive algorithms. In this contribution, we present a system based on the analysis of the Electrodermal Activity Skin Potential Response (SPR) signal, aimed to reveal the driver's stress induced by different driving situations. We reduce motion artifacts by processing two SPR signals, recorded from the hands of the subjects, and outputting a single clean SPR signal. Statistical features of signal blocks are sent to a Supervised Learning Algorithm, which classifies between stress and normal driving (non-stress) conditions. We present the results obtained from an experiment using a professional driving simulator, where a group of people is asked to undergo manual and autonomous driving on a highway, facing some unexpected events meant to generate stress. The results of our experiment show that the subjects generally appear more stressed during manual driving, indicating that the autonomous drive can possibly be well received by the public. During autonomous driving, however, significant peaks of the SPR signal are evident during unexpected events. By examining the electrocardiogram signal, the average heart rate is generally higher in the manual case compared to the autonomous case. This further supports our previous findings, even if it may be due, in part, to the physical activity involved in manual driving.

AB In order to adequately characterize the driving risks that vehicles face during the lane change process and ensure that vehicles perform safer lane change decisions, a vehicle lane change model based on the safe potential field theory is established in this paper. Firstly, the driving risk encountered during the vehicle lane-changing process is evaluated, and the spatial distribution of the safety potential field under different motion states during the vehicle driving process is given based on the potential field theory. Secondly, the critical distances between vehicles at the end of the lane-change process are summarized according to the distribution of different safety potential fields of relevant vehicles during the lane change process. Compared with the traditional critical distance calculation model, the method proposed in this paper can dynamically characterize the trend of the critical distance of the vehicle under different velocity and acceleration conditions. Based on this, according to the characteristics that various types of vehicle movement status can be perceived in real-time under the CAVs environment, the safety-critical time required for lane change under various motion states of the vehicle is summarized, and the minimum safety distance lane change model based on the safety potential field theory is finally established. Numerical simulation analysis of the model shows that the model can characterize the effects of various motion parameters on the lane change results. The research results can provide some theoretical support for related researches such as vehicle lane changing, vehicle autonomous driving, and vehicle group optimization control in the intelligent networked environment in the future.

AB Although significant progress has been made in developing autonomous vehicle technology, further research is still needed to reduce the risk of collision by planning a suitable path. Drawing vehicle paths through pedestrian collision avoidance action is worth further study. In this paper, vehicle path planning considering pedestrian collision avoidance action is proposed to improve vehicle driving safety further. First, the movement features reflecting different types of pedestrian collision avoidance intention are summarized through the actual human-vehicle collision accident video. Then, the data representing the pedestrian action features are obtained through the deep neural network and input into the trained Hidden Markov Model to predict pedestrian intention. Finally, the vehicle collision avoidance path is planned through the cubic polynomial combined with the pedestrian intention. The algorithm is verified through the pedestrian collision avoidance action in the simulation scene. The results show that this algorithm can predict the intention of different types of pedestrians to avoid collisions at frames 9, 8, and 10, respectively, which is 0.6 seconds, 0.4 seconds, and 0.6 seconds faster than the Long Short Term Memory algorithm. Finally, a suitable path is planned, and the collision was successfully avoided.

AB The growth in the number of connected vehicles in ad-hoc networks or VANETs enables the use of increasingly sophisticated services and applications. One emerging application in this scenario is Platooning, a stable stream of connected autonomous vehicles. This application improves safety, vehicle flow on the road, energy consumption, among other variables. However, vehicles using this technology need to share space with vehicles not connected or with other automation levels. Among the bottlenecks in scenarios like this, Platoons formation and splits stand out, as these maneuvers involve costs and risk. Therefore, our contribution is developing a new strategy for Platoons formation in a mixed universe of vehicles to bring some of these desired benefits. The results show that the proposed solution achieved an accuracy of 89% of the entire amount of platoons in the datasets. Our experiments demonstrate cases with collisions, and the proposed solution provides a solution to a more safe operation on roads. Finally, we conclude that our solution provides more determinism in the traffic conditions, as vehicles achieving stationary speeds with low variation.

AB The computation of compact and meaningful representations of high dimensional sensor data has recently been addressed through the development of Nonlinear Dimensional Reduction (NLDR) algorithms. The numerical implementation of spectral NLDR techniques typically leads to a symmetric eigenvalue problem that is solved by traditional batch eigensolution algorithms. The application of such algorithms in real-time systems necessitates the development of sequential algorithms that perform feature extraction online. This paper presents an efficient online NLDR scheme, Sequential-Isomap, based on incremental singular value decomposition (SVD) and the Isomap method. Example simulations demonstrate the validity and significant potential of this technique in real-time applications such as autonomous systems.

AB According to the evolution tendency of the control decision process from a trackside to a train-borne system, various autonomous localization units for railway vehicles were developed. As recommended in railway standards, the design process of each system, here the autonomous localization units (LU), follows the V-model whose first step is to define its availability requirement in order to satisfy the global ETCS system requirements. The classical approach for assigning the subsystem availability is based on the assumption that failure parameters of other units are precisely known. This assumption is too restricted in reality due to the lack of information. In this paper, we propose a new approach that allows taking into account uncertainties in the dependability parameters of the ETCS components for identifying the upper threshold of the LU unavailability to reach ETCS availability requirements. Using fuzzy fault trees, the fuzzy unavailability of the ETCS without the autonomous LU is evaluated. Then, based on its membership function, we assess the satisfaction rate that an advanced ETCS with the autonomous LU can satisfy the ETCS availability target.

DE Cut-in behavior; Gap acceptance; Naturalistic driving study; Driving
   style; Duration distribution; Traffic safety
AB Cut-in maneuvers, when vehicles change lane and move closely in front of a vehicle in the adjacent lane, are very common but adversely affect roadway capacity and traffic safety. Yet little research has comprehensively explored cut-in behavior, particularly in China, which has a challenging driving environment and is often used for connected and autonomous vehicle testing. This study developed an extraction algorithm to retrieve 5608 cut-in events from the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study. The data were used to identify cut-in characteristics, including motivation, turn signal usage, duration, urgency, and impact. Results showed that almost half of drivers did not use a turn signal when cutting in, and that cut-ins had a shorter time to collision (TTC) than other lane changing. A lognormal distribution was found to produce the best fit for cut-in duration, which varied from 0.7 s to 12.4 s. As characteristics were found to vary by roadway type and motivation, multilevel mixed-effects linear models were developed to examine the influencing factors of cut-in gap acceptance. Acceptance of lead and lag gaps was significantly affected by environmental variables, vehicle type, and kinematic parameters, which has important implications for microsimulation, as does the large variance in duration that makes specifying duration essential when setting scenarios. Improvement in safety education is warranted by the high degrees of risk and aggression shown by TTC and turn signal usage; but the ability of drivers, who needed to yield to the cut-in, to predict danger and adopt safe, suitable, and timely strategies suggests that advanced driver assistance systems and connected and autonomous vehicles can learn similar responses.

AB Learning to drive in urban areas is an open challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs), as complex decision making requirements are needed in multi-task co-ordinations environments. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework with a new perception model involving affordance learning to simplify the surrounding urban scenes for training an AV agent, along with a planned trajectory and the associated driving measurements. Our proposed solution encompasses two main aspects. Firstly, a supervised learning network is used to map the input sensory data into affordance predictions. The predicted affordances provide a low-dimensional representation of surrounding scenes of the AV in the form of key perception indicators, e.g., true or false with respect to a traffic light signal. Secondly, a deep deterministic policy gradient model that maps the perception information into a series of actions is devised. We evaluate the proposed solution using the CARLA driving simulator in an urban town and evaluate the performance in a new, unseen town under different weather conditions. The quantitative and qualitative results indicate that our proposed solution can generalize well to cope with different traffic solutions and environmental conditions. Our proposed solution also outperforms other baseline methods in a comparative study in handling various AV driving tasks with different levels of difficulty. In addition, the model trained with simulated scenes yields promising prediction results when testing on recorded video streams on real-world highway and suburb environments with varying traffic and weather conditions.

AB Model predictive control (MPC) has been widely applied to different aspects of autonomous driving, typically using nonlinear physically derived models for prediction. However, feedback control systems inherently correct for model errors, and thus in many applications it is sufficient to use a linear time-invariant (LTI) model for control design, especially when using robust control methods. This philosophy of approach appears to have been neglected in current driverless car research and is the research gap that we aim to address here. Namely, instead of deriving meticulous nonlinear physical models of vehicle dynamics and solving a correspondingly complex optimal control problem (OCP), we identify a low-order data-driven LTI model and handle its uncertainty via robust linear MPC methods. We develop a two-step control scheme for driverless cars based on tube MPC (TMPC), which introduces structural robustness, ensuring constraint compliance despite modeling error in the data-driven prediction model. Furthermore, we use fast optimization methods designed to exploit the special structure of the linear MPC problem. We evaluate the proposed control scheme using a vehicle model identified from real-world data and simulations in IPGCarmaker, where the model of the vehicle under control is inherently nonlinear and uses detailed 3-D physics. Our results show that an LTI model can be effectively used for the task of lane-keeping, that TMPC can prevent lane departure and possible collisions due to model uncertainty, and that linear models allow for several algorithmic improvements that can decrease computation time by an order of magnitude compared with naive MPC implementations.

AB This paper presents a longitudinal speed control algorithm using a model-reference adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC) scheme for an autonomous vehicle in various driving environments using only wheel speed sensors. The proposed algorithm could control the vehicle's speed not using parameter estimators but using an adaptation technique. The parameter adaptation laws were designed to compensate for the changes in the environmental disturbances and model uncertainties. Moreover, the upper bound of unknown disturbances, that were not compensated by the adaptation algorithm, was estimated using radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). The sliding mode controller updated the upper bound from the RBFNN and obtained robustness without knowing the bound in advance. Adaptive equivalent control input was also defined to compensate for zero-throttle acceleration varying with speed. This input could enhance the mode switch smoothly between throttle and brake control. We conducted computer simulations and vehicle tests under various driving environments to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. In the simulation result, the average tracking error of the proposed algorithm was 0.718 kph, and the maximum change rate of the error due to the disturbances was 11%. The improvements were 55% and 68%, respectively, compared to the PID control. The average error in the vehicle test result was 0.414 kph, which was improved by 48% compared to the PID control in the test track. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm ensures desirable tracking performance under environmental disturbances and model uncertainties.

AB To better understand the current status and development of new energy vehicle (NEV) safety studies and explore the knowledge base and research hotspots, 1,007 papers related to NEV safety studies from 2000-2020 were collected from the Web of Science Core Collection database as data samples. The bibliometric method and mapping knowledge domain technology were used to visually analyze the knowledge structure and research trends in the field of NEV safety studies. The study found that publications in the United States rank first among countries/regions. Tsinghua University has the most publications in related research; the disciplines of NEV safety research mainly focus on energy and fuel, chemistry and electrochemistry; and the Journal of Power Sources, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy and International Journal of Crashworthiness are the core journals in the field. New energy exploration and application as well as performance improvement/lifetime optimization/ use safety of lithium-ion batteries are the research knowledge bases in the field. Lithium-ion batteries, fuel cell and hydrogen energy safety, autonomous driving technology, computer simulation, and vehicle crashworthiness are the five main research directions. Research on the safety of NEVs has basically formed a theoretical research framework, but the system construction of various research directions has not yet been fully formed. The research topics are concentrated, but a clear evolutionary path has not been formed. The current research hotspots and frontiers are how to improve the performance of lithium-ion batteries, the safety of fuel cells, the autonomous driving technology and the crashworthiness of NEVs.

DE autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV); debris deposit; sidescan sonar;

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) present the important advantage of being able to approach the seafloor more closely than surface vessel surveys can. To collect bathymetric data, bottom material information, and sub-surface images, multibeam echosounder, sidescan sonar (SSS) and subbottom profiler (SBP) equipment mounted on an AUV are powerful tools. The 3000 m class AUV URASHIMA was developed by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC). After finishing the engineering development and examination phase of a fuel-cell system used for the vehicle's power supply system, a renovated lithium-ion battery power system was installed in URASHIMA. The AUV was redeployed from its prior engineering tasks to scientific use. Various scientific instruments were loaded on the vehicle, and experimental dives for science-oriented missions conducted from 2006. During the experimental cruise of 2007, high-resolution acoustic images were obtained by SSS and SBP on the URASHIMA around the northern Kumano Basin off Japan's Kii Peninsula. The map of backscatter intensity data revealed many debris objects, and SBP images revealed the subsurface structure around the north-eastern end of our study area. These features suggest a structure related to the formation of the latest submarine fan. However, a strong reflection layer exists below similar to 20 ms below the seafloor in the south-western area, which we interpret as a denudation feature, now covered with younger surface sediments. We continue to improve the vehicle's performance, and expect that many fruitful results will be obtained using URASHIMA.

AB The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has truly stimulated the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in the transportation industry. Fueled by big data from various sensing devices and advanced computing resources, AI has become an essential component of AVs for perceiving the surrounding environment and making appropriate decision in motion. To achieve goal of full automation (i.e., self-driving), it is important to know how AI works in AV systems. Existing research have made great efforts in investigating different aspects of applying AI in AV development. However, few studies have offered the research community a thorough examination of current practices in implementing AI in AVs. Thus, this paper aims to shorten the gap by providing a comprehensive survey of key studies in this research avenue. Specifically, it intends to analyze their use of AIs in supporting the primary applications in AVs: 1) perception; 2) localization and mapping; and 3) decision making. It investigates the current practices to understand how AI can be used and what are the challenges and issues associated with their implementation. Based on the exploration of current practices and technology advances, this paper further provides insights into potential opportunities regarding the use of AI in conjunction with other emerging technologies: 1) high definition maps, big data, and high performance computing; 2) augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR) enhanced simulation platform; and 3) 5G communication for connected AVs. This paper is expected to offer a quick reference for researchers interested in understanding the use of AI in AV research.

AB In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, have gained increasing interest in both academia and industries. The evolution of UAV technologies, such as artificial intelligence, component miniaturization, and computer vision, has decreased their cost and increased availability for diverse applications and services. Remarkably, the integration of computer vision with UAVs provides cutting-edge technology for visual navigation, localization, and obstacle avoidance, making them capable of autonomous operations. However, their limited capacity for autonomous navigation makes them unsuitable for global positioning system (GPS)-blind environments. Recently, vision-based approaches that use cheaper and more flexible visual sensors have shown considerable advantages in UAV navigation owing to the rapid development of computer vision. Visual localization and mapping, obstacle avoidance, and path planning are essential components of visual navigation. The goal of this study was to provide a comprehensive review of vision-based UAV navigation techniques. Existing techniques have been categorized and extensively reviewed with regard to their capabilities and characteristics. Then, they are qualitatively compared in terms of various aspects. We have also discussed open issues and research challenges in the design and implementation of vision-based navigation techniques for UAVs.

AB This article proposes an improved lane detection and tracking method for autonomous vehicle applications. In real applications, when the pose and position of the camera are changed, parameters and thresholds in the algorithms need fine adjustment. In order to improve adaptability to different perspective conditions, a width-adaptive lane detection method is proposed. As a useful reference to reduce noises, vanishing point is widely applied in lane detection studies. However, vanishing point detection based on original image consumes many calculation resources. In order to improve the calculation efficiency for real-time applications, we proposed a simplified vanishing point detection method. In the feature extraction step, a scan-line method is applied to detect lane ridge features, the width threshold of which is set automatically based on lane tracking. With clustering, validating, and model fitting, lane candidates are obtained from the basic ridge features. A lane-voted vanishing point is obtained by the simplified grid-based method, then applied to filter out noises. Finally, a multi-lane tracking Kalman filter is applied, the confirmed lines of which also provide adaptive width threshold for ridge feature extraction. Real-road experimental results based on our intelligent vehicle testbed proved the validity and robustness of the proposed method.

SO IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL

DT Article
DE Extrinsic calibration; robust initialization; vehicle motion constraint;
   visual-inertial-odometer fusion
AB Autonomous positioning in complex urban areas is a challenging problem and has attracted increasing attention in academia. Multisensor fusion of camera, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and wheel odometer has been a prevailing solution that is not only low-cost but easy-to-build. Most of the related methods fuse the odometer measurements into the visual-inertial framework by preintegrating the wheel speed into the displacement. However, they are not very suitable for some scenarios where the vehicle velocity changes frequently. Instead of preintegrating the odometer measurements, in this article, we present an efficient and practical visual-inertial-odometer approach that fuses the wheel speed into the visual-inertial framework directly based on the vehicle motion constraint. Specifically, we use the nonholonomic constraint (NHC) and lever-arm compensation to introduce the vehicle velocity measurement into the fusion framework to limit the drift. Meanwhile, the proposed framework also allows to online calibration of the IMU-odometer extrinsic parameters (EPs) explicitly. Moreover, we develop an observability-aware method to enhance the system stability and the performance of online extrinsic calibration. We also develop a robust initialization method to obtain the initial values of the visual-inertial-odometer system in one-step optimization. Our approach is validated extensively in simulation environments, autonomous driving public datasets, and real-world experiments. The simulation results show the extrinsic calibration error is within 0.1 degrees/0.02 m for rotation and translation. The public dataset and real-world ground robot experiments show a 0.3% position error in both the 4-km long urban area route and the 403-m long park route.

AB Automated vehicles (AVs) are seen as a gateway to safer and more accessible mobility, while others see AVs as unrealistic and dangerous. Public perception of AVs is not always in line with experts' views on issues relating to technology and public safety. To explore how the views of the public and experts compare, two qualitative studies were conducted with the aim of understanding attitudes, opinions, and expertise on a variety of matters relating to emerging AV technology and its societal impacts. Interviews were conducted with 11 AV experts from a variety of fields of expertise including optometry, engineering, computer science and psychology. Additionally, eight focus groups were held with 34 members of the public to discuss their opinions about AV technologies. Views from the public and experts were divided into 12 themes, with three categories (positive, mixed, and negative feelings towards AVs). The five themes under the positive category included topics of the danger of conventional vehicles, inclusive mobility, the use of time and space, familiarisation with AVs, and safety benefits. The two themes under the mixed feelings categories were, concerns about trust and the legal challenges. The five themes under the negative category were, the technological challenges, the complexity of monitoring, mixedfleet danger, skills atrophy, and cybersecurity. The results showed that both the experts and public participants were enthusiastic about AVs, with a minority from both groups sceptical about this emerging technology. Insights from this research can be used to help inform 1) how the law can be adapted to AVs and 2) areas that can be focused on to alleviate the public's concerns around AVs.

AB There have a large number of pedestrian-vehicle accidents on the pedestrian crossing area in China every year, causing huge loss of life and property. In view of different road conditions, it's crucial to establish a more accurate crossing intention recognition model to improve the safety of pedestrians. In this work, a pedestrian crossing area was chosen. Due to construction reasons, two road conditions appeared in the same crossing area at different periods, namely a condition with a zebra crossing and that without a zebra crossing. We compared pedestrian crossing intention parameters under two road conditions in the same crossing area. The results found that there was a great difference in the characterization parameters of pedestrian crossing intention when the site with and without a zebra crossing. Additionally, a more comprehensive crossing intention characteristic parameters set was established. The characteristic parameters were pedestrian speed, the distance between vehicle and crossing area, time to collision (TTC), and safe vehicle deceleration (SVD), pedestrian age, pedestrian gender, group, respectively. The pedestrian intention recognition model for the site with a and without a zebra crossing were established by long short-term memory network integrated with the attention mechanism (AT-LSTM). When the model recognized pedestrian crossing intention 0.6 seconds in advance, the recognition accuracies were 93.05% and 93.89% respectively. The research results are of great significance for improving the safety of autonomous vehicles in the future, and there are also important to improve pedestrian safety.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have become an emerging crucial component of the intelligent transportation system (ITS) in modern smart cities. In particular, coordinated operations of AVs can potentially enhance the quality of public services, e.g., logistic and AV charging services. However, the joint logistic and AV charging scenario involves the sophisticated interactions between a large number of complicated agents, dynamic logistics, and electricity prices in real-world systems. Since AVs are individuals owned by different parties, the design of attractive incentive to motivate them to provide multiple public services becomes a fundamental issue. In this article, we develop an urban intelligent system (UIS) by exploiting the efficient incentive mechanisms, e.g., noncooperative and cooperative game-theoretic approaches, to motivate the AVs to provide logistic and charging services in UIS. For the noncooperative game approach, we formulate the interaction between the selfish AVs and the aggregator as a Stackelberg game. Meanwhile, the aggregator, known as the leader in the game, aims to decide the logistic and electricity trading prices, and then the AVs, executed as the followers, determine their service schedules. Furthermore, considering that all the players are willing to cooperate, we develop a cooperative potential game for the selfless AVs to maximize the social welfare of the UIS. These case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of proposed incentive mechanisms that can motivate EVs to provide high-quality logistic and charging services by maximizing their utilities. Also, both the proposed schemes provide significant system revenues than that of conventional system optimization-based approaches.

AB This article considers intelligent fuel cell/battery hybrid vehicles (FCHVs) that can make autonomous decisions at both the vehicle and powertrain levels. Since the vehicle and powertrain level dynamics are inherently integrated, we propose an integrated motion and powertrain model predictive control approach for intelligent FCHVs by jointly optimizing the vehicle acceleration and fuel cell current. The control goals are to achieve vehicle mobility, minimal hydrogen consumption, and battery state-of-charge maintenance within system constraints. The main challenge in an integrated control is that the electric motor can operate in both propelling and generating modes coupling with vehicle and powertrain states. This hybrid operation is handled by the mixed logical dynamical modeling resulting in a mixed integer nonlinear control problem. To relieve the possible heavy computational burden, two simplification approaches are proposed: hierarchical control and successive linearizations. Two standard driving cycles and a typical vehicle cruising scenario are employed to test the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and control algorithms. Simulation results show that the hierarchical linear control is more suitable for real-time applications with comparable control performance with that of the integrated control. However, additional constraints must be carefully designed to compensate for the ignored coupling dynamics and constraints.

AB With increasing number of vehicles registered on road the CO2 emissions and the amount of fuel wasted because of congestion has been rising. V2X and Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) technology allows vehicles and traffic infrastructure to communicate with each other, and could facilitate better use of existing resources by providing vehicles information about their surroundings and traffic signals. The information regarding the phase of traffic signal, vehicles' position and vehicles' speed can be used by drivers and autonomous vehicle control algorithms to make informed decisions as they approach traffic signals. This research proposes a coordination heuristic to improve traffic flow of CAV vehicles through traffic signals and reduce system wide emissions. A simulation was used to compare the system level impacts to emissions, travel time, and wait time of the proposed coordination heuristic to a single vehicle optimization strategy and baseline driver behavior. The results of this research suggest that traffic density and CAV market penetration impact the potential benefits of CAV control strategies. At low CAV penetration rates both the single vehicle and coordination heuristic produced increased emissions primarily driven by driving behavior of non-V2X enabled vehicles. At higher CAV penetration rates the co-ordination heuristic significantly outperformed the single vehicle control strategy and baseline driver behavior with regards to emissions reduction. The analysis indicates that at 900 vehicles per hour for either of the two driving strategies: coordination heuristic or single-vehicle optimization, to be more preferred over baseline driver behavior, at least 50% of the vehicles should be CAV. Once a threshold penetration rate of CAV vehicles is achieved, vehicles following the coordination heuristic generate nearly 10% fewer CO2 emissions than vehicles following baseline driver behavior, a 30% improvement over the reduction in CO2 emissions obtained using single-vehicle optimization. The vehicles following the coordination heuristic also have less travel time than vehicles following single-vehicle optimization, and less wait times than vehicles following baseline driver behavior.

AB Origami-inspired engineering has enabled intelligent materials and structures to react to environments, yet a complete sense-decide-act autonomous loop is still challenging. Yan et al. introduce autonomous origami robots by embedding sensing, computing, and actuating in compliant, conductive materials.
   Origami-inspired engineering has enabled intelligent materials and structures to process and react to environmental stimuli. However, it is challenging to achieve complete sense-decide-act loops in origami materials for autonomous interaction with environments, mainly due to the lack of information processing units that can interface with sensing and actuation. Here, we introduce an integrated origami-based process to create autonomous robots by embedding sensing, computing, and actuating in compliant, conductive materials. By combining flexible bistable mechanisms and conductive thermal artificial muscles, we realize origami multiplexed switches and configure them to generate digital logic gates, memory bits, and thus integrated autonomous origami robots. We demonstrate with a flytrap-inspired robot that captures 'living prey', an untethered crawler that avoids obstacles, and a wheeled vehicle that locomotes with reprogrammable trajectories. Our method provides routes to achieve autonomy for origami robots through tight functional integration in compliant, conductive materials.

AB The advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has complicated traffic flow and raised safety concerns, there is a pressing need to enhance traffic efficiency alongside ensuring robust safety. This paper proposes a dynamic longitudinal control strategy for AVs, based on real-time accident risk assessments. Data from traffic flow, road characteristics, and weather conditions are analyzed using a random forest algorithm, producing a real-time accident risk identification model through a support vector machine. In addition, the Perceived Risk Field Model (PRFM), a car-following model calibrated using the NGSIM dataset, considers vehicle distance, velocity, relative velocity, and acceleration. These models underpin our proposed longitudinal control strategies, tailored to variable accident risk levels. Under the normal risk control strategy, the PRFM outperforms the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) and the Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control Model (CACC) in stability and driving comfort. For high accident risk scenarios, our approach shows improved collision avoidance and traffic oscillation mitigation. Simulations indicate that the high accident risk control strategy offers better safety and stability than the normal risk strategy. Furthermore, traffic flow diagrams suggest an increase in road capacity as AV penetration rates rise, pointing to the promising efficiency of our proposed solution. This research provides a robust framework for AV operation, ensuring optimal traffic safety and efficiency.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) will inevitably coexist on roads in the future, creating mixed-flow traffic. The heterogeneous car-following (CF) behavior of HDVs can degrade the control performance of CAVs and introduce inefficiencies in CAV operations. To address these challenges, it is necessary to comprehend HDV CF behavior in mixed-flow traffic. This driving simulator-based study investigates HDV CF behavior in mixed-flow traffic under three different CAV control settings (string-stable, string-unstable, and HDV-like). The effects of traffic congestion level and demographic characteristics on CF behavior are also considered. Statistical analysis and CF model calibration, based on trajectory data collected from 72 participants in driving simulator experiments, are performed to examine the impacts of these factors on string stability, traffic efficiency, and safety. Then, online parameter estimation is conducted to illustrate the time-varying desired time headway, and sensitivity to spacing and speed variations (i.e., CF behavior evolution). Additionally, analysis of post-experiment interview results and eye-tracking data show that the string-stable CAV control setting is preferred by most HDV drivers, but can trigger driver distraction. The results also provide insights for CF behavior prediction and the optimal mixed platoon formation to enhance CAV benefits for traffic flow.

AB Coastal ecosystems host high levels of primary productivity leading to exceptionally dynamic elemental cycling in both water and sediments. In such environments, carbon is rapidly cycled leading to high rates of burial as organic matter and/or high rates of loss to the atmosphere and laterally to the coastal ocean in simpler forms, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). To better understand carbon cycling across these heterogeneous environments, new technologies beyond discrete sample collection and analysis are needed to characterize spatial and temporal variability. Here, we describe the ChemYak, an autonomous surface vehicle outfitted with a suite of in situ sensors, developed to achieve large spatial scale chemical mapping of these environments. Dissolved methane and carbon dioxide are measured by a laser spectrometer coupled to a gas extraction unit for continuous quantification during operation. The gas-powered vehicle is capable of rapidly surveying the coastal system with an endurance of up to 10 h at operating speeds in excess of 10 km h(-1). Here, we demonstrate its ability to spatially characterize distributions of CO2, CH4, oxygen, and nitrate throughout a New England saltmarsh estuary.

AB Mapping an unknown large-scale marine area by a side-scan sonar onboard a marine vehicle as quickly as possible is often of great importance. It is also important that a-priori unknown interesting parts of the area are scanned in more detail, i.e. with the removal of sonic shadows. In contrast to the standard overlap-all-sonar-ranges lawnmower pattern offline static coverage problem solution for side-scan sonar missions, here a novel online side-scan sonar data-driven coverage solution is proposed. The proposed coverage algorithm provides a coverage solution based on local information gain from side-scan sonar data. At the same time, the solution is generated in such a way that coverage path length/time is minimized while covering the same area as the standard lawnmower. Upper and lower bounds of the proposed algorithm's improvement compared to the overlap-all-sonar-ranges lawnmower method are estimated analytically and validated through extensive mission parameters variation simulations. Simulation results show that this approach can cut down coverage path length/time significantly compared to the standard lawnmower method in most application cases. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The automation of a Mars aerobraking vehicle that uses reaction wheels for attitude and angular momentum control during atmospheric flythrough is investigated. In a previous study, single-axis control laws were developed for minimum onboard instrumentation to compensate for large variations in entry time and atmospheric density. Modifications of those control laws to provide two-axis control in high-fidelity simulations that include six degrees of freedom, nearly ideal reaction wheels, spherical harmonics, and oblate atmosphere are now tested. Preliminary results indicate that our approach may be highly practical for an autonomous aerobraking mission at Mars.

AB Material transportation is an essential process in mining operations and accounts for a large portion of total energy consumption. With the development of automation technology, autonomous mining trucks have been deployed in open-pit mines to reduce transportation costs. Compared to manned mining trucks, autonomous trucks are more appropriate for automatic scheduling techniques due to their high informatization, high-precision perception, and sophisticated control. However, the existing truck scheduling research does not exploit autonomous trucks' strengths to perform more delicate control, but still takes a traditional approach toward autonomous trucks. In this paper, we propose a mixed-integer programming model for joint optimization of autonomous trucks trips and speeds to minimize energy consumption. To solve the proposed scheduling model, a novel tabu search algorithm is proposed, which consists of two parts: an improved flow allocation model with matching factor is formulated in the upper part to determine the optimal truck flow, and in the lower part a tabu search procedure guided with the optimal flow is developed. Based on the mathematical model and solution technique, we also propose a real-time scheduling system of autonomous trucks for the stochastic and dynamic mining environment. A coal mine in Inner Mongolia, China, for example, we verified the effectiveness of the proposed truck scheduling model and real-time scheduling approach. We demonstrate that the proposed allocation model effectively accelerates the tabu search procedure, and for short-term decisions, the proposed solution technique satisfies the computational requirements of the real-time scheduling system.

TI Antisubmarine Warfare Applications for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles:
   The GLINT09 Sea Trial Results
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Surveillance in antisubmarine warfare (ASW) has traditionally been carried out by means of submarines or frigates with towed arrays. These techniques are manpower intensive. Alternative approaches have recently been suggested concerning distributed mobile and stationary sensors, such as sonobuoys and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). To field a fully operational system, many technological hurdles need to be overcome. These include battery life, limited acoustic communications ranges, incorporating sonar signal processing on the AUV's embedded hardware, and increasing autonomy to ensure that the system as a whole acts in a sensible and appropriate fashion. The main thrust of this paper is how the latter two issues have been addressed for a real experimental system and how the proposed solutions have been demonstrated at sea. This paper describes ongoing development at the NATO Undersea Research Centre (NURC) to construct an autonomous distributed sensor system that uses AUVs for ASW applications. In a series of at-sea experiments, we have demonstrated real-time processing-incorporating traditional ASW processing as far as tracking-and adaptive autonomous behaviors, which concern AUV navigation to optimize target localization. This paper describes the hardware and software configurations that facilitated the rapid development of this system and details the recent at-sea successes that have been demonstrated with our AUV, towed arrays, and active acoustic sources. Results are given of our most recent at-sea trial, GLINT09, held in the summer of 2009, when an AUV with a towed array detected and maneuvered in response to an active source (c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB To achieve the perception-based autonomous control of UAVs, schemes with onboard sensing and computing are popular in state-of-the-art work, which often consist of several separated modules with respective complicated algorithms. Most methods depend on handcrafted designs and prior models with little capacity for adaptation and generalization. Inspired by the research on deep reinforcement learning, this paper proposes a new end-to-end autonomous control method to simplify the separate modules in the traditional control pipeline into a single neural network. An image-based reinforcement learning framework is established, depending on the design of the network architecture and the reward function. Training is performed with model-free algorithms developed according to the specific mission, and the control policy network can map the input image directly to the continuous actuator control command. A simulation environment for the scenario of UAV landing was built. In addition, the results under different typical cases, including both the small and large initial lateral or heading angle offsets, show that the proposed end-to-end method is feasible for perception-based autonomous control.

TI CarSpeak: A Content-Centric Network for Autonomous Driving
SO ACM SIGCOMM COMPUTER COMMUNICATION REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE Autonomous Vehicles; Content-Centric; Wireless
AB This paper introduces Car Speak, a communication system for autonomous driving. Car Speak enables a car to query and access sensory information captured by other cars in a manner similar to how it accesses information from its local sensors. Car Speak adopts a content-centric approach where information objects - i.e., regions along the road are first class citizens. It names and accesses road regions using a multi-resolution system, which allows it to scale the amount of transmitted data with the available bandwidth. CarSpeak also changes the MAC protocol so that, instead of having nodes contend for the medium, contention is between road regions, and the medium share assigned to any region depends on the number of cars interested in that region.
   CarSpeak is implemented in a state-of-the-art autonomous driving system and tested on indoor and outdoor hardware testbeds including an autonomous golf car and 10 iRobot Create robots. In comparison with a baseline that directly uses 802.11. Cat-Speak reduces the time for navigating around obstacles by 2.4x. and reduces the probability of a collision due to limited visibility by 14 x.

AB Automatic scenario recognition (ASR) based on channel status information (CSI) is an important auxiliary technology for various wireless communication systems, especially vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) systems. CSI-based ASR methods, only based on the on-board wireless receivers rather than other expensive sensors, can identify the surrounding environments of vehicles to serve assisted and autonomous driving technologies. Recently, deep learning (DL)-based ASR methods have been proposed, which generally outperform traditional, but they generally have high computation complexity and large model sizes, which are hardly introduced into mobile edge devices, such as smart vehicles. In this paper, a lightweight convolutional neural network design method, inspired by MobileNet, is introduced into ASR for reducing computation complexity and model sizes. In addition, this method may bring about performance loss, and knowledge distillation (KD) is adopted to make up for this performance loss. Simulation results demonstrated that our proposed ASR method just has 30% computation complexity and model size of the original method, and its performance loss is very limited, especially after KD.

AB This paper describes lane change motion planning with a combination of probabilistic and deterministic prediction for automated driving under complex driving circumstances. The autonomous lane change should arrive safely at the destination. The subject vehicle needs to perceive and predict the behaviors of other vehicles with sensors. From the information of other vehicles, a collision probability is defined using a reachable set of uncertainty propagation. In addition, the lane change risk is monitored using predicted time-to-collision and safety distance to guarantee safety in lane change behavior. A safe driving envelope is defined as constraints based on the combinatorial prediction (probabilistic and deterministic) of the behavior of surrounding vehicles. To obtain the desired steering angle and longitudinal acceleration to maintain the automated driving vehicle under constraints, a stochastic model-predictive control problem is formulated. The proposed model has been evaluated by performing lane change simulations in MATLAB/Simulink, while considering the effect of combination prediction. Also, the proposed algorithm has been implemented on a test vehicle. The simulation and test results show that the proposed algorithm can handle complicated lane change scenarios, while guaranteeing safety.

AB We consider the transient behavior of a large linear array of coupled linear damped harmonic oscillators following perturbation of a single element. Our work is motivated by modeling the behavior of flocks of autonomous vehicles. We first state a number of conjectures that allow us to derive an explicit characterization of the transients, within a certain parameter regime Omega. As corollaries we show that minimizing the transients requires considering non-symmetric coupling, and that within Omega the computed linear growth in N of the transients is independent of (reasonable) boundary conditions.

AB In autonomous indoor navigation some number of localizations and orientations of the vehicle can be learned in advance. No artificial landmarks are required to exist. We describe and compare the detection of several global features of color images (sensor data). This constitutes the measurement process in a self-localization approach that is based on Bayes filtering of a Markov environment - the posterior probability density over possible discrete robot locations (the belief) is recursively computed. The approach was tested to provide robust results under varying scene brightness conditions and small measurement errors.

AB In order to maximize the advantage of four-wheel independently actuated (FWIA) technology, the paper proposes a new configuration and dynamics control method. It is called relaxed static stability (RSS). First, RSS allows lateral dynamics system of the vehicle to be inherently unstable to enhance overall structure design flexibility. Three FWIA electric vehicles (a racecar, a passenger car, and a military vehicle) are shown to demonstrate the benefit of RSS. By applying the RSS, the configuration flexibilities of the battery pack location of these vehicles are improved by 95.4%, 167% and 20%, respectively. Second, the closed-looped handling stability could be improved by yaw moment control through the pole assignment technique. The target pole's positions of closed-looped lateral dynamics system are selected according to various performance requirements. Four cases of target pole locations are given as examples to show the principle of selecting the target pole locations for different type vehicles. A pole assignment controller is designed with the consideration of the parametric uncertainties caused by tire nonlinear behavior. Finally, an FWIA electric vehicle, which is built by the authors, is used as testbed to show the benefit of the RSS. The experiments in step steer and sine steer conditions prove the efficiency and robustness of the controller, as well as the convenience of adjusting target pole locations according to various performance requirements.

AB In order to solve the problem of insufficient range of autonomous underwater vehicles, underwater docking stations deployed on the seabed can wirelessly charge autonomous underwater vehicles through recyclers. Compared with traditional wireless charging of electric vehicles, wireless charging based on underwater docking stations has many special technical problems that need to be further understood and deciphered. This paper introduces the basic functions of the docking system and the docking process, and then focuses on the following three aspects of wireless charging at docking stations: firstly, the design of the coupler to suit the underwater vehicle and the complex marine environment, the coupler mechanism should match the shape and structure of the underwater vehicle, and the coupler should have a high resistance to deflection; secondly, the influence of the seawater medium on the wireless charging system. The impact of seawater medium on the wireless charging system is analysed, and the equivalent circuit model considering seawater eddy currents and the equivalent circuit model considering cross-connecting capacitance effects are established respectively; thirdly, the design of communication-independent wireless charging system. The existing eddy current loss calculation methods are analysed for the key technical problem of eddy current loss in seawater. A new type of electromagnetic coupler is proposed, the structural characteristics of the coupler are introduced and the simulation results show that the new coupler has a strong anti-deflection capability.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; BEHAVIOR; RECONSTRUCTION; VALIDATION
AB The development of connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology has received increasing attention in recent years. Although car-following behavior in mixed traffic with CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) is a core component of microscopic traffic simulation, intelligent traffic systems, etc., the current study of car-following behavior in mixed traffic has some limitations. Furthermore, actual data do not support its applicability to the Chinese traffic environment. To address this gap, this paper designs and organizes a car-following experiment in mixed traffic in Beijing, extracts the trajectory data of CAVs and HDVs based on video recognition, and reconstructs the extracted trajectory data using the Lagrangian theory and Kalman filter theory to ensure the accuracy of the data. Based on this data set, this paper develops an extended car-following model. The model considers the cooperation between drivers by reformulating the prospect theory (PT). The root mean square percentage error (RMSPE) is selected to calibrate and validate the parameters of the proposed model, and the results show that there is significant heterogeneity between CAVs and HDVs in mixed traffic, and the proposed model captures this heterogeneity well. The model presented in this paper provides theoretical support for microscopic traffic simulation in mixed traffic.

AB Computer vision is an important part of the autonomous vehicles to gain the perception of the surrounding environment. In order to satisfy the adaptability of lane detection system under different illumination and different road conditions, an effective lane detection method based on image classification and hybrid isomeric operators is proposed. Camera correction matrix and distortion coefficient are obtained by using checkerboard grid images, and they will be cached to be shared with subsequent image streams to improve the speed of real-time lane detection. In the process of preprocessing, the images under different illumination conditions are classified and processed, and the inverse perspective transformation is used to deal with the 2-D image flow so that the image flow has a certain depth of data. According to the intensity of the whole gray mean, the edge detection is carried out by using heterogeneous operators and combining with a variety of threshold filtering methods to extract the lane pixels. The lane detection module transmits the vehicle steering angle and the deviate distance from the road center line to the decision layer, effectively implementing the interactive simulation. Experiments show that the algorithm has good real-time performance, stability, and robustness under different illumination and road conditions.

AB Research of the oceans and seas from an almost purely scientific view may be transformed to a broader perspective having considerable socio-economic significance. With a shift in focus of such magnitude, it is necessary to correspondingly expand the scales of data collection and the scope of research. Research must expand surface investigations to include the entire water column from the air-water interface to the seafloor on a regional scale. This monumental task can be solved effectively if automatic and robotic systems are applied. A properly designed autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) would be the most promising system capable of such work.
   The Institute of Marine Technology Problems (IMTP) has pursued AUV technological development since 1972. During this period several AUVs have been designed, tested, and used in marine operations. Some of the most interesting aspects of the IMTP experiences relating to AUV development are reflected in this paper.
   An important achievement of the Institute's underwater vehicle program is the development of modular structural design for the AUV. Use of the modular concept design facilitates construction and modification of AUVs, adapting to new applications as required. With respect to the new challenges of ocean science research, the modular AUV provides a mechanism capable of expanding the scale of remote human presence in the three dimensional ocean inner space.

AB Recently, autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) have been receiving considerable attention. Unlike traditional automated guided vehicles, AMRs are highly flexible because they can move in any path without guide rails. However, AMRs in narrow regions require very careful control because the higher the number of autonomous mobile robots, the greater the probability of collisions and deadlocks. This study proposes a design methodology for a virtual grid layout with direction constraints for efficient AMR routing in a factory with limited workspace. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, several simulation models of two factories were constructed using FlexSim, which supports modules for autonomous mobile robots simulation. AMR routing using the proposed virtual grid layout with direction constraints performed considerably better than conventional guided path-based routing as well as AMR routing with no restriction with respect to average lead-time and number of deadlocks. In the sample layout experiments, the proposed method demonstrated a remarkable 39.5% reduction in delivery time compared to the guided path-based routing. Furthermore, unlike the unrestricted AMR routing, the proposed method did not experience any deadlocks.

AB We consider the problem of characterizing a generalized Voronoi diagram that is relevant to a special class of area assignment problems for multi-vehicle systems. It is assumed that the motion of each vehicle is described by a second order mechanical system with time-varying linear or affine dynamics. The proposed generalized Voronoi diagram encodes information regarding the proximity relations between the vehicles and arbitrary target points in the plane. These proximity relations are induced by an anisotropic (generalized) distance function that incorporates the vehicle dynamics. In particular, the generalized distance is taken to be the minimum control effort required for the transition of a vehicle to an arbitrary target point with a small terminal speed at a fixed final time. The space we wish to partition corresponds to the union of all the terminal positions that can be attained by each vehicle using finite control effort. Consequently, the partition space has lower dimension than the state space of each vehicle. We show that, in the general case, the solution to the proposed partitioning problem can be associated with a power Voronoi diagram generated by a set of spheres in a five-dimensional Euclidean space for the computation of which efficient techniques exist in the relevant literature.

AB This paper presents a receding horizon methodology for trajectory tracking with safe collision conflict resolution for multiple autonomous vehicles. The proposed decentralized scheme is formulated in discrete-time domain where each vehicle's objective function represents deviations from its desired trajectory. The safety constraints penalizing if two or more vehicles get closer than a prescribed safety distance are incorporated using avoidance functions. These avoidance functions are added to the objective functions to be minimized by each vehicle. They also represent the coupling elements in the decentralized scheme allowing for implicit coordination among the vehicles in the case of a possible collision. Vehicles are modeled by the unicycle model subject to bounds on both velocity and angular velocity. The optimization scheme performed by each vehicle uses a sequential quadratic programming method which is well suited for minimization of a scalar nonlinear function subject to nonlinear equality constraints (dynamic model) and multiple inequality constraints (velocity constraints and safety conditions). Outputs of the optimization process are kinematic control inputs for each vehicle. For symmetric cases where the gradient based methods are known to perform poorly (such as singular cases) a limit cycle method is implemented to modify segments of the desired trajectories leading to feasible solutions in terms of the optimization process performed by each vehicle.

AB Large mobility gaps exist between people with and without disabilities. People with special needs are heavily dependent upon public transportation for their essential needs. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to increase mobility for these populations. However, they have been largely absent from AV perception research. To fill this gap, we analyzed their perceptions, willingness to use, and concerns over autonomous public transit (APT) based on an on-board intercept survey of 1861 current bus riders in Michigan, with 40% having some type of special needs. We found significant differences among different special needs groups. While respondents who were visually impaired, mobility restricted, or with multiple accommodation needs were more likely to rely on public transit than those without any special needs, their willingness to use APT varied. Respondents with visual impairment were more likely, but riders with mobility disabilities were less likely to be willing to use APT. In addition, our survey results suggest that respondents with special needs perceive AVs primarily negatively. This was especially true for mobility-restricted groups. Furthermore, there were differences in bus riders' reasons not to use APT. Compared to respondents without special needs, those with multiple accommodation needs hold concerns over APT's safety more, while respondents with mobility disabilities were more likely to distrust AV technology. This study advances our understanding of different special needs populations' perception and acceptance of APT, providing support to policymakers in developing inclusive policies and practices that would bring the promised benefits of AVs to these populations.

ID VISION-BASED NAVIGATION; DESIGN
AB Underwater vehicle manipulator system (UVMS) generally consists of a camera unit and robotic manipulator. Its main function is to replace human work in underwater manipulation tasks. Most commercially available manipulators are not designed for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) because the vehicle does not have sufficient power supply to drive these manipulators which are electro-hydraulically driven. A proposed solution is to invest in development of low power underwater manipulator to deepen studies in AUV. Thus, this research has an objective of developing an underwater manipulator for small scale AUV. In this research, the manipulator is used in an object recovery task. An acrylic scissor arm which is electro-mechanically driven is used as manipulator in this research. Permanent magnets are used as its end effector. A Pixy CMUcam5 vision sensor is paired with this manipulator to navigate the AUV and control the manipulator. The usage of planar pressure housing helps in reducing light refraction effect of underwater environment that may affect the sensor's accuracy. From the simulation done using Solid Works, it is found out that type 316L stainless steel is the best choice for the manipulator developed. To evaluate the performance of the UVMS developed, a series of tests are carried out. Based on the results obtained, it is known that the system has high speed and consistency with minimum time delay between input and output. As long as an object has distinct colour signature from its background and its surrounding is clear and well illuminated, the Pixy vision sensor can detect that object regardless of the distance between the sensor and the object.

AB This paper presents a systematic method to establish the kinematics model for a tracked mobile manipulator on firm grounds, with consideration of the interactive mortions between the tracks and the terrain, as well as those between the tracked vehicle and the onboard manipulator. Kinematics analysis is essential for real-time pose estimation and online autonomous navigation of tracked mobile manipulators. Furthermore, to improve the effectiveness of motion planning, and to simulate or control tracked mobile manipulators, a reliable kinematics model is required. However, kinematics modeling for a tracked mobile manipulator is complicated by the fact that there are infinite number of contact points between the tracks and the terrain, which makes slippage unavoidable. The track-terrain and vehicle-manipulator interactions make the problem even more complicated as the motion of the onboard manipulator and the centrifugal forces during moderate or high speed motion give rise to transfer of the load distribution, which will affect the longitudinal and lateral tractive forces and the resistance. Also, the motion of the mobile platform contributes to the inertial forces of the manipulator, and the track-terrain interactive forces help balance the gravity as well as the manipulation forces. The developed kinematics modeling approach is presented on the basis or a tracked mobile manipulator in our laboratory, but the forward kinematics analysis method, and the track-terrain and vehicle-manipulator interaction analysis algorithm are general, and can be used for any tracked mobile manipulators with little modification. This work lays a solid foundation for autonomous control. online slippage estimation, real-time traction optimization as well as tip-over prediction and prevention of tracked mobile manipulators.

AB In the industrial environment, Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) generally run on a planned route. Among trajectory-tracking algorithms for unmanned vehicles, the Pure Pursuit (PP) algorithm is prevalent in many real-world applications because of its simple and easy implementation. However, it is challenging to decelerate the AGV's moving speed when turning on a large curve path. Moreover, this paper addresses the kidnapped-robot problem occurring in spare LiDAR environments. This paper proposes an improved Pure Pursuit algorithm so that the AGV can predict the trajectory and decelerate for turning, thus increasing the accuracy of the path tracking. To solve the kidnapped-robot problem, we use a learning-based classifier to detect the repetitive pattern scenario (e.g., long corridor) regarding 2D LiDAR features for switching the localization system between Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) method and Odometer method. As experimental results in practice, the improved Pure Pursuit algorithm can reduce the tracking error while performing more efficiently. Moreover, the learning-based localization selection strategy helps the robot navigation task achieve stable performance, with 36.25% in completion rate more than only using SLAM. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible and reliable in actual conditions.

AB As humans accelerate the pace of marine development, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are increasingly attracting worldwide attention. Due to the limitations of carrying energy and battery technology, AUV's endurance is nonideal. Therefore, designers usually make AUVs more streamlined to reduce drag. Here we show that when a layer of porous material is attached to an AUV's surface, the AUV's drag changes significantly. In this paper, simulations of the basic body of a REMUS100 and SUBOFF submarine model were carried out under multiple conditions. It is found that the drag increases as the porous viscosity coefficient or the thickness of the porous material increases. When REMUS100 and SUBOFF models are attached to the porous material with suitable porous viscosity coefficient, their drag becomes smaller. Boundary layer theory is also used to explain and analyze the phenomenon of the proportional increase of viscous pressure drag when using porous material, which is verified by vertical plate numerical simulations. Finally, we tested the mechanical properties of porous nickel and aluminum alloy 6061, and found that the porous material does have an effect of drag reduction, and can reduce the fluctuation range of the drag during the movement.

AB The design of a controller able to deal with uncertainties and physical constraints plays an essential role in fast and complex systems. Then, a reference governor approach based on model predictive control (MPC-RG) for an autonomous racing vehicle is proposed. The MPC-RG guarantees constraint satisfaction and recursive feasibility online while including obstacle avoidance capability and energy-aware management by solving a multi-objective optimization problem. In particular, a trade-off between maximizing the longitudinal velocity and the state of charge of the vehicle's battery, as well as minimizing the variation of control actions is adopted. Moreover, the proposed MPC-RG is combined with a state-feedback linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and a Kalman filter (KF) to compensate for modeling errors and exogenous disturbances, as well as to estimate the unmeasured lateral velocity. In fact, for control and estimation purposes, a data-driven Takagi-Sugeno (TS) model trained by an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference network is used. The performance of the developed approach is assessed in simulations using a well-known case study based on a 1/10 scale RC electric car.

AB Due to the rapid increase in cargoes and postal transport volumes in smart transportation systems, an efficient automated multidimensional terminal with autonomous elevating transfer vehicles (ETVs) should be established, and an effective cooperative scheduling strategy for vehicles needs to be designed for improving cargo handling efficiency. In this paper, as one of the most effective artificial intelligence technologies, the artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC), which possesses a strong global optimization ability and fewer parameters, is firstly introduced to simultaneously manage the autonomous ETVs and assign the corresponding entrances and exits. Moreover, as ABC has the disadvantage of slow convergence rate, a novel full-dimensional search strategy with parallelization (PfdABC) and a random multidimensional search strategy (RmdABC) are incorporated in the framework of ABC to increase the convergence speed. After being evaluated on benchmark functions, it is applied to solve the combinatorial optimization problem with multiple tasks and multiple entrances and exits in the terminal. The simulations show that the proposed algorithms can achieve a much more desired performance than the traditional artificial bee colony algorithm in terms of balancing the exploitation and exploration abilities, especially when dealing with the cooperative control and scheduling problems.

AB This article deals with the detection of low-frequency noise sources and the estimation of their direction of arrivals using an acoustic vector sensor hosted on a buoyancy Slocum glider. The sensor used is a 3-D directional hydrophone capable of acquiring both the acoustic pressure and the components of the particle velocity vector. This article presents experimental results with data collected at sea and describes the signal processing chain, including detection, direction of arrival, and clustering. The vehicle is equipped with a modem and is supported by an ultrashort baseline (USBL) located on a mother ship or gateway to achieve the navigational accuracy required for correct target localization. The surface vessel localizes the glider via the USBL and then transmits position fixes, which are used by the underwater vehicle to reset the drift error of its navigation filter. The results discussed in this article demonstrate two important achievements, i.e., an underwater glider can produce accurate bearing estimates on a target and the feasibility of the integration of an acoustic modem and a USBL positioning system on a glider. The results obtained open up the possibility of using multiple autonomous sensorized gliders integrated in intelligent surveillance robotic networks.

AB The introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs) to consumer markets will expedite the trend of car sharing and enable co-owning or co-leasing a car. In this paper, we consider a combinatorial auction market for fractional ownership of AVs, which is unique in two aspects. First, items are neither predefined nor discrete; rather, items are continuous time slots defined by bidders. Second, the spatial information of bidders should be incorporated within the winner determination problem (WDP) so that sharing a vehicle is indeed a viable plan. The consideration of spatial information increases the computational complexity significantly. We formulate the WDP, which plays a critical role in various auction designs and pricing schemes, for both discrete- and continuous-time settings. In terms of social welfare maximization, we show that the continuous-time model is superior to the discrete-time model. We provide a conflict-based reformulation of the continuous-time model, for which we develop an effective solution approach based on a heuristic and maximal clique based reformulations. Using samples of the 2010-2012 California Household Travel Survey, we verify that the proposed solution methods provide effective computational tools for the combinatorial auction with bidder-defined items.

AB To avoid collision accidents and achieve independent recovery in the cluttered marine environment, this work proposes an intelligent path planning system for a waterjet-propelled unmanned surface vehicle (USV). Unlike the existing works on USV navigation systems, our study focuses on the real-time, smoothness and seaworthiness properties of the path in practical clutter environments. A hybrid A* algorithm with motion primitive constraints is proposed to generate an initial reference path. According to different types of dynamic obstacles, the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) rules are used, and a local threat map based on the Apollonius circle is constructed to avoid these obstacles. Together with the motion characteristics of the waterjet-propelled USV, the Reeds-Shepp curve is used to calculate the autonomous recovery path. The performance of the proposed intelligent navigation system is verified in a practical marine environment. The experimental results show that our hybrid A* algorithm outperforms the conventional A* algorithm, and it is easy for the waterjet-propelled USV to follow the final continuous curvature path. It was demonstrated that our method can effectively avoid various static and dynamic obstacles in real time and thus help achieve autonomous recovery.

AB A randomised motion planner is presented that operates within a suitable timeframe for constrained mobile robots in agricultural environment. The core of this approach relies on splitting planning into two efficient phases to reduce its computational time. The effectiveness of sampling based planners is combined with the robustness of parametric vector-valued splines. The first phase involves relaxed two-dimensional path planning using rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT). Recent advances in sampling based planning are leveraged to improve the performance of the planner. Detailed implementation of the RRT approach and parameter selection are highlighted using comprehensive analysis and simulations. Feasible continuous paths with bounded curvature for nonholonomic robots are generated using B-spline curves. Curve segment parameters are formulated with respect to vehicle specifications. Manoeuvres satisfying maximum curvature constraints and path continuity are designed based on the segment parameters. Numerical experiments are used to validate the practicality of the proposed two-phase planner in solving kinodynamic motion queries, in real-time and replanning under limited sensing conditions.

AB To improve the endurance and speed of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), we consider adopting the slip over a solid-liquid interface, which has the effect of drag reduction. However, the simulation of motion of an AUV with the slip remains a challenge due to the fluid-structure interaction and multiscale problems involving the moving boundary. To solve these problems, the present work proposes a novel and competitive mesoscopic method. Firstly, the Discrete Unified Gas Kinetic Scheme (DUGKS) coupled with the immersed boundary method is improved by correcting the boundary force, avoiding any additional computational time or implementation effort. Its effectiveness and accuracy are validated by two numerical tests involving the moving boundary. Furthermore, a fluid-solid interaction force is introduced to this method to model the slip condition due to its easy and effective implementation. We perform the experiment of motion of an AUV model in water to further validate the proposed method, which shows that it can predict acceptable results. Then, the method is applied to study the effect of the slip on the motion of the AUV model. The greater slip induced by the fluid-solid interaction force has a greater effect on reducing the drag and improving the velocity. It is indicated that increasing the fluidsolid interaction force can increase the amplitude and decrease the oscillation frequency of the drag curve. Overall, the slip can improve the endurance and speed of the AUV model.

AB Along with the increasing popularity of autonomous vehicles (AVs), urban livability and public health will be enhanced due to ecofriendly issues: alleviated traffic congestion, lower car ownership, and reduced transport emissions. However, some emerging issues, including public safety, trust, privacy, reliability, underdeveloped legislation, and liability, may deter user intentions to adopt an AV. This study introduces an extensive factor, playfulness, into the technology acceptance model (TAM) to quantify the impacts of psychological factors (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived playfulness) on AV adoption intention. This study proposes four AV-related policy measures (financial incentivization, information dissemination, convenience, and legal normalization) and examines how policy measures motivate users to adopt an AV to facilitate public safety. Furthermore, this study investigated the moderating effects of demographic factors on the relationships between independent variables and AV adoption intention. Two models were proposed and estimated using a total of 1831 survey responses in China. The psychology-related and policy-related models explained 62.2% and 33.6% of the variance in AV adoption intention, respectively. The results suggest that perceived playfulness (beta = 0.524, p < 0.001) and information dissemination (beta = 0.348, p < 0.001) are the most important influencing factors of AV adoption intention. In addition, demographic factors (gender, education, income, the number of private cars owned by a family, and types of cities) can moderate the effects of psychological factors and policy measures on user intentions to adopt an AV. These insights can be employed to design more cost-effective policies and strategies for subgroups of the population to maximize the AV adoption intention.

   Purchasing behavior; Autonomous vehicles
ID WOULD; DILEMMA
AB In preparation for unavoidable collisions, autonomous vehicle (AV) manufacturers could program their cars with utilitarian ethical algorithms that maximize the number of lives saved during a crash. However, recent research employing hypothetical AV crash scenarios reveals that people are not willing to purchase a utilitarian AV despite judging them to be morally appropriate (Bonnefon, Shariff, & Rahwan, 2016). This important result, indicating evidence for a social dilemma, has not yet been psychologically explored by behavioral scientists. In order to address the psychological underpinnings of this phenomenon, we developed and tested a novel theoretical proposal - perspective-taking accessibility (PT accessibility). Accordingly, we established that providing participants with access to both situational perspectives (AV buyers can be passengers or pedestrians) in crash scenarios, eliminated the behavioral inconsistency between their utilitarian judgments of moral appropriateness and non-utilitarian purchasing behavior. Moreover, our full PT accessibility induced respondents' utilitarian prosocial judgments and purchasing behavior (Experiments 1a and 1b) and consistent utilitarian preferences across judgment tasks (Experiment 2). Crucially, with full PT accessibility, participants' utilitarian purchasing behavior as well as their willingness to buy and ride utilitarian AVs were informed by their utilitarian moral judgments. Full PT accessibility provides the participants with even odds of being a pedestrian or passenger in crash scenarios, and thus impartiality. It could be argued that full PT accessibility is a new type of 'veil of ignorance', which is not based on purposely induced self-interest and uneven risk options (as in Huang, Greene, & Bazerman, 2019), but rather is based on even odds of being a passenger or pedestrian, and therefore with even 50/50 chance to die/live as passenger or pedestrian. Under these circumstances one can measure utilitarian preferences.

AB This paper explores a method by which an unpowered, fixed-wing micro air vehicle (MAV) may autonomously gain height by utilising orographic updrafts in urban environments. These updrafts are created when wind impinges on both man-made and natural obstacles, and are often highly turbulent and very localised. Thus in contrast to most previous autonomous soaring research, which have focused on large thermals and ridges, we use a technique inspired by kestrels known as 'wind-hovering', in order to maintain unpowered flight within small updrafts. A six-degree-of-freedom model of a MAV was developed based on wind-tunnel tests and vortex-lattice calculations, and the model was used to develop and test a simple cascaded control system designed to hold the aircraft on a predefined trajectory within an updraft. The wind fields around two typical updraft locations (a building and a hill) were analysed, and a simplified trajectory calculation method was developed by which trajectories for height gain can be calculated on-board the aircraft based on a priori knowledge of the wind field. The results of simulations are presented, demonstrating the behaviour of the system in both smooth and turbulent flows. Finally, the results from a series of flight tests are presented. Flight tests at the hill were consistently successful, while flights around the building could not be sustained for periods of more than approximately 20 s. The difficulty of operating near a building is attributable to significant levels of low-frequency unsteadiness (gustiness) in the oncoming wind during the flight tests, effectively resulting in a loss of updraft for sustained periods.

AB Autonomous solutions for transportation are emerging worldwide, and one of the sectors that will benefit the most from these solutions is the public transport by shifting toward the new paradigm of Mobility as a Service (MaaS). Densely populated areas cannot afford an increase in individual transportation due to space limitation, congestion, and pollution. Working towards more effective and inclusive mobility in public areas, this paper compares user experiences of autonomous public transport across Baltic countries, with the final goal of gaining an increased insight into public needs. User experience was evaluated through questionnaires gathered along pilot projects implementing a public transportation line, using an automated electric minibus between 2018 and 2019. To have sufficient diversity in the data, the pilot projects were implemented in several cities in the Baltic Sea Area. The data analysed in this paper specifically refer to the cities of Helsinki (Finland), Tallinn (Estonia), Kongsberg (Norway), and Gdansk (Poland). Across all cities, passengers provided remarkably positive feedback regarding personal security and safety onboard. The overall feedback, which was very positive in general, showed statistically significant differences across the groups of cities (Kongsberg, Helsinki, Tallinn and Gdansk), partially explicable by the differences in the route design. In addition, across all cities and feedback topics, males gave a lower score compared to females. The overall rating suggests that there is a demand for future last-mile automated services that could be integrated with the MaaS concept, although demand changes according to socio-economic and location-based conditions across different countries.

AB This article proposes a two-layer trajectory optimization method for the autonomous ground vehicle. This two-layer strategy includes an efficient path planning layer and a fast trajectory planning layer. In the first layer, a novel target area adaptive rapidly exploring random tree algorithm (TAA-RRT*) is proposed to search the shortest path. This layer mainly includes a preprocessing and a sampling planning process. In the preprocessing process, the generalized voronoi diagram is used to construct the environment information and find the initial path. Then, the sampled target area (TA) is constructed based on this initial path to provide nonuniform sampling. In the sampling planning process, the improved adaptive RRT* algorithm is used to carry out sampling planning in the TA, and the direct connection strategy is combined to quickly locate the optimal solution. In the trajectory planning layer, combined with the constraints of the unmanned vehicle and the path constraints obtained in the first layer, the speed planning and the trajectory optimization are addressed by solving the optimal control problem. After performing a large number of experiments, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified.

AB Visual analytics is vital for identifying targets by differentiating their structure and texture from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Object sensing disturbance and swift texture differentiation are tedious due to the UAV displacements. For improving the accuracy of target detection, this article introduces a learning optimizer-based visual analytics method. The proposed method assimilates deep learning and a gradient descent algorithm for feature differentiation and error minimization concurrently. The captured images are identified using multiple structural feature variations and are correlated with similar stored images. The features are extracted at different displacement and structural changing instances for leveraging accuracy. The learning process trains the similarity features during different differentiation factors. In the feature extraction, the minimum slope points are identified using a gradient descent algorithm by assigning random weights. As the differentiation increases using similar features, the minimum similarity value is detection. Postdetection, the weights are incremental and linear across different feature slopes. Therefore, the accuracy increases under varying displacement instances, preventing target misdetection. The gradient function is invariable between the minimum and maximum values for identifying high-precision features. This ensures optimal detection of different buildings and structures with high accuracy.

AB The agent-based land use/transport model SILO/MITO/MATSim is adapted to simulate the impact of AVs on household relocation. The revised model accounts for the fact that households who own conventional cars are sensitive to parking availability at their dwelling. As AVs could park themselves anywhere, this sensitivity to parking is reduced for households who own AVs. Distance to work, which serves as a hard constraint for household relocation with conventional cars, becomes less critical for households who use an AV to commute as they may perform other activities while commuting. The induced demand of travel by AV is represented and leads to increased congestion.Several scenarios were designed to analyze the effects of reduced value of time for AV travel, parking restrictions and increase of congestion. The simulation shows that AVs will compete with transit and reduce transit ridership by three quarters. The average commute distance is expected to double, and the vehicle-kilometers traveled will increase by one third. The impact of AVs on the distribution of population, however, is marginal. The urban sprawl caused by less burdensome commuting is largely compensated by the increased attractiveness of core cities in the absence of parking issues for AVs.

AB Studying the impact of AVs on our road infrastructure offers a lot of potential in the transportation domain; one of these issues is how capacity will be affected. This paper presents a contribution to this research area by investigating the impact of AVs on the capacity of single-lane roundabouts using a microsimulation model. For the development of the model, a roundabout situated in Gyor (Hungary) was selected and field data on the roundabout geometric characteristics as well as traffic volumes were used. Simulations using Vissim were run for various scenarios based on varying input traffic volumes and market penetration rates of AVs to assess queue lengths. The highway capacity manual (HCM) roundabout model was used to estimate the capacity of the existing roundabout. Values of follow-up times and critical gaps were set to decreasing as the penetration rate of AVs increases. The results demonstrated that 20% and 40% AVs in the flow would increase leg capacities by about 10% and 20%, respectively. Furthermore, a reduction in excessive queue lengths was estimated and capacities and queue lengths were calculated by legs. It was found that these are highly influenced by the distribution of flows among legs, and the share of flows in various directions.

AB The purpose of this study is to develop maneuvering models and systems of a simulator to improve the motion performance of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) at the preliminary design stages in advance. The AUVs simulation systems based on the standard submarine equations of motion in six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) integrated with the Euler-Rodriguez quaternion method for representing singularity-free AUV attitude and time-saving calculation, and with a nonlinear control model for maneuvering and depth control simulations, time-marching in the fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme. For validation of the simulation codes, results of the ISiMI AUV open-loop tests including turning test and zigzag test as well as an AUV simulator on the basis of Euler-angle method were used to compare with the quaternion-based AUV simulator. The computational results from the proposed simulator agree well with those from both the ISiMI AUV experiments and the Euler-angle based simulations. Additionally, a new maneuvering procedure, namely "put-out" was implemented to test directional stability for a large-scale AUV in the proposed AUV simulator that can be considered for vehicles in space as well as in constrained planes.

AB A 3-D path-following controller is proposed in this brief for a 6-degrees-of-freedom model-scaled autonomous helicopter. The reference path and path-following errors are newly defined using implicit expressions. On the basis of geometric analysis, a new speed error is designed for singularity avoidance. The proposed control algorithm is designed using command filtered backstepping, such that complicated solutions for derivatives of virtual controls are circumvented. It is proved that, with the proposed controller, path-following errors are locally ultimately bounded. Theoretical results are demonstrated by the numerical simulation.

AB To realize the potential of autonomous underwater robots that scale up our observational capacity in the ocean, new techniques are needed. Fleets of autonomous robots could be used to study complex marine systems and animals with either new imaging configurations or by tracking tagged animals to study their behavior. These activities can then inform and create new policies for community conservation. The role of animal connectivity via active movement of animals represents a major knowledge gap related to the distribution of deep ocean populations. Tracking underwater targets represents a major challenge for observing biological processes in situ, and methods to robustly respond to a changing environment during monitoring missions are needed. Analytical techniques for optimal sensor placement and path planning to locate underwater targets are not straightforward in such cases. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of reinforcement learning as a tool for range-only underwater target-tracking optimization, whose promising capabilities have been demonstrated in terrestrial scenarios. To evaluate its usefulness, a reinforcement learning method was implemented as a path planning system for an autonomous surface vehicle while tracking an underwater mobile target. A complete description of an open-source model, performance metrics in simulated environments, and evaluated algorithms based on more than 15 hours of at-sea field experiments are presented. These efforts demonstrate that deep reinforcement learning is a powerful approach that enhances the abilities of autonomous robots in the ocean and encourages the deployment of algorithms like these for monitoring marine biological systems in the future.

AB This paper presents a hierarchical trajectory planning based on the integration of a sampling and an optimization method for urban autonomous driving. To manage a complex driving environment, the upper behavioral trajectory planner searches the macro-scale trajectory to determine the behavior of an autonomous car by using environment models, such as traffic control device and objects. This planner infers reasonable behavior and provides it to the motion trajectory planner. For planning the behavioral trajectory, the sampling-based approach is used due to its advantage of a free-form cost function for discrete models of the driving environments and simplification of the searching area. The lower motion trajectory planner determines the micro-scale trajectory based on the results of the upper trajectory planning with the environment model. The lower planner strongly considers vehicle dynamics within the planned behavior of the behavioral trajectory. Therefore, the planning space of the lower planner can be limited, allowing for improvement of the efficiency of the numerical optimization of the lower planner to find the best trajectory. For the motion trajectory planning, the numerical optimization is applied due to its advantages of a mathematical model for the continuous elements of the driving environments and low computation to converge minima in the convex function. The proposed algorithms of the sampling-based behavioral and optimization-based motion trajectory were evaluated through experiments in various scenarios of an urban area.

AB We tested the applicability and signal quality of a 16 channel dry electroencephalography (EEG) system in a laboratory environment and in a car under controlled, realistic conditions. The aim of our investigation was an estimation how well a passive Brain-Computer Interface (pBCI) can work in an autonomous driving scenario. The evaluation considered speed and accuracy of self-applicability by an untrained person, quality of recorded EEG data, shifts of electrode positions on the head after driving-related movements, usability, and complexity of the system as such and wearing comfort over time. An experiment was conducted inside and outside of a stationary vehicle with running engine, air-conditioning, and muted radio. Signal quality was sufficient for standard EEG analysis in the time and frequency domain as well as for the use in pBCIs. While the influence of vehicle-induced interferences to data quality was insignificant, driving-related movements led to strong shifts in electrode positions. In general, the EEG system used allowed for a fast self-applicability of cap and electrodes. The assessed usability of the system was still acceptable while the wearing comfort decreased strongly over time due to friction and pressure to the head. From these results we conclude that the evaluated system should provide the essential requirements for an application in an autonomous driving context. Nevertheless, further refinement is suggested to reduce shifts of the system due to body movements and increase the headset's usability and wearing comfort.

AB The utilization of unmanned systems has witnessed a steady surge in popularity owing to its tremendous potential for a wide range of applications. In particular, the coordination among multiple vehicle systems has been demonstrated to possess unparalleled efficacy in accomplishing intricate and diverse tasks. In light of this, the present paper delves into the coordinated path planning mission that is accomplished by collaborative efforts amongst multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). First, considering the potential threats, arrival time windows, space, and physical constraints for the AUVs, a sophisticated coordinated path planning model is formulated in a 3D environment, serving as a systematic and structured blueprint for the underlying mechanism. Subsequently, the optimization problem is addressed through the incorporation of a restricted initialization scheme and a multi-objective clustering strategy in the proposed methodology. The resulting approach leads to the development of the Parallel Grey Wolf Optimizer (P-GWO) which exhibits strong global searching abilities and a rapid convergence rate, rendering it a dependable and effective solution. The results demonstrate a 10-15% improvement in convergence rate and a reduction of over 60% in the average cost value compared to reliable references, thus presenting an effective solution for underwater missions with specific requirements.

AB We describe the design and validation of a decision-making system in the guidance and control architecture for automated driving. The decision-making system determines the timing of transitions through a sequence of driving modes, such as lane following and stopping, for the vehicle to eventually arrive at the destination without colliding with obstacles, hence achieving safety and liveness. The decision-making system commands a transition to the next mode only when it is possible for an underlying motion planner to generate a feasible trajectory that reaches the target region of such next mode. Using forward and backward reachable sets based on a simplified dynamical model, the decision-making system determines the existence of a trajectory that reaches the target region, without actually computing it. Thus, the decision-making system achieves fast computation, resulting in reactivity to a varying environment and reduced computational burden. To handle the discrepancy between the dynamical model and the actual vehicle motion, we model it as a bounded disturbance set and guarantee robustness against it. We prove the safety and liveness of the decision-making system and validate it using small-scale car-like robots.

AB This study proposes a unified optimization framework for strategic planning of shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) systems that explicitly and endogenously considers their operational aspects based on macroscopic dynamic traffic assignment. Specifically, the proposed model optimizes fleet size, road network design, and parking space allocation of an SAV system with optimized SAVs' dynamic routing with passenger pickup/delivery and ridesharing. It is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes total travel time of travelers, total distance traveled by SAVs, total number of SAVs, and infrastructure construction cost; thus, both the user-side cost and the system-side cost are taken into account, and their trade-off relations can be explicitly investigated. Furthermore, the problem is formulated as a linear programming problem, making it easy to solve. By leveraging the linearity, we mathematically derive a useful property of the problem: introduction of ridesharing can weakly monotonically and simultaneously decrease the user-side cost and system-side cost. The proposed model is evaluated by applying it to actual travel records obtained from New York City taxi data.

AB Flying insects are capable of vision-based navigation in cluttered environments, reliably avoiding obstacles through fast and agile maneuvers, while being very efficient in the processing of visual stimuli. Meanwhile, autonomous micro air vehicles still lag far behind their biological counterparts, displaying inferior performance at a much higher energy consumption. In light of this, we want to mimic flying insects in terms of their processing capabilities, and consequently show the efficiency of this approach in the real world. This letter does so through evolving spiking neural networks for controlling landings of micro air vehicles using optical flow divergence from a downward-looking camera. We demonstrate that the resulting neuromorphic controllers transfer robustly from a highly abstracted simulation to the real world, performing fast and safe landings while keeping network spike rate minimal. Furthermore, we provide insight into the resources required for successfully solving the problem of divergence-based landing, showing that high-resolution control can be learned with only a single spiking neuron. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to integrate spiking neural networks in the control loop of a real-world flying robot. Videos of the experiments can be found at https://bit.ly/neuro-controller.

AB A novel timing synchronizing scheme is proposed for use in inter-vehicle communication (IVC) with an autonomous distributed intelligent transport system (ITS). The scheme determines the timing of packet signal transmission in the IVC network and employs the guard interval (GI) timing in the orthogonal frequency divisional multiplexing (OFDM) signal currently used for terrestrial broadcasts in the Japanese digital television system (ISDB-T). This signal is used because it is expected that the automotive market will demand the capability for cars to receive terrestrial digital TV broadcasts in the near future. The use of broadcasts by automobiles presupposes that the on-board receivers are capable of accurately detecting the GI timing data in an extremely low carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) condition regardless of a severe multipath environment which will introduce broad scatter in signal arrival times. Therefore, we analyzed actual broadcast signals received in a moving vehicle in a field experiment and showed that the GI timing signal is detected with the desired accuracy even in the case of extremely low-CNR environments. Some considerations were also given about how to use these findings.

AB In this paper, we address the problem of determining the optimal geometric configuration of an acoustic sensor network that will maximize the angle-related information available for underwater target positioning. In the set-up adopted, a set of autonomous vehicles carries a network of acoustic units that measure the elevation and azimuth angles between a target and each of the receivers on board the vehicles. It is assumed that the angle measurements are corrupted by white Gaussian noise, the variance of which is distance-dependent. Using tools from estimation theory, the problem is converted into that of minimizing, by proper choice of the sensor positions, the trace of the inverse of the Fisher Information Matrix (also called the Cramer-Rao Bound matrix) to determine the sensor configuration that yields the minimum possible covariance of any unbiased target estimator. It is shown that the optimal configuration of the sensors depends explicitly on the intensity of the measurement noise, the constraints imposed on the sensor configuration, the target depth and the probabilistic distribution that defines the prior uncertainty in the target position. Simulation examples illustrate the key results derived.

AB Path planning and collision avoidance are common problems for researchers in vehicle and robotics engineering design. In the case of autonomous ships, the navigation is guided by the regulations for preventing collisions at sea (COLREGs). However, COLREGs do not provide specific guidance for collision avoidance, especially for multi-ship encounters, which is a challenging task even for humans. In short-range path planning and collision avoidance problems, the motion of target ships is often considered as moving at a constant velocity and direction, which cannot be assumed in long-range planning and complex environments. The research challenge here is how to factor in the uncertainty of the motion of the target ships when making long-range path plans. In this paper, we introduce a long-range path planning algorithm for autonomous ships navigating in complex and dynamic environments to reduce the risk of encountering other ships during future motion. Based on the information on the position, speed over ground, and course over ground of other ships, our algorithm can estimate their intentions and future motions based on the probabilistic roadmap algorithm and use a risk-aware A* algorithm to find the optimal path that has low accumulated risk of encountering other ships. A case study is carried out on real automatic identification systems (AIS) datasets. The result shows that our algorithm can help reduce multi-ship encounters in long-term path planning.

AB This paper proposes a two-level, data-driven, digital twin concept for the autonomous landing of aircraft, under some assumptions. It features a digital twin instance (DTI) for model predictive control (MPC); and an innovative, real-time, digital twin prototype for fluid-structure interaction and flight dynamics to inform it. The latter digital twin is based on the linearization about a pre-designed glideslope trajectory of a high-fidelity, viscous, nonlinear computational model for flight dynamics; and its projection onto a low-dimensional approximation subspace to achieve real-time performance, while maintaining accuracy. Its main purpose is to predict in real time, during flight, the state of an aircraft and the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on it. Unlike static lookup tables or regression-based surrogate models based on steady-state wind tunnel data, the aforementioned real-time digital twin prototype allows the DTI for MPC to be informed by a truly dynamic flight model, rather than a less accurate set of steady-state aerodynamic force and moment data points. The paper describes in detail the construction of the proposed two-level digital twin concept and its verification by numerical simulation. It also reports on its preliminary flight validation in autonomous mode for an off-the-shelf unmanned aerial vehicle instrumented at Stanford University.This article is part of the theme issue 'Data-driven prediction in dynamical systems'.

AB This paper proposes and evaluates a new safety concept called backup plan safety for path planning of autonomous vehicles under mission uncertainty using model predictive control (MPC). Backup plan safety is defined as the ability to complete an alternative mission when the primary mission is aborted. To include this new safety concept in control problems, we formulate a feasibility maximization problem aiming to maximize the feasibility of the primary and alternative missions. The feasibility maximization problem is based on multi-objective MPC, where each objective (cost function) is associated with a different mission and balanced by a weight vector. Furthermore, the feasibility maximization problem incorporates additional control input horizons toward the alternative missions on top of the control input horizon toward the primary mission, denoted as multihorizon inputs, to evaluate the cost for each mission. We develop the backup plan constrained MPC algorithm, which designs the weight vector that ensures asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system, and generates the optimal control input by solving the feasibility maximization problem with computational efficiency. The performance of the proposed algorithm is validated through simulations of an unmanned aerial vehicle path planning problem.

AB Intelligent decision making and efficient trajectory planning are closely related in autonomous driving technology, especially in highway environment full of dynamic interactive traffic participants. This work integrates them into a unified hierarchical framework with long-term behavior planning (LTBP) and short-term dynamic planning (STDP) running in two parallel threads with different horizon, consequently forming a closed-loop maneuver and trajectory planning system that can react to the dynamic environment effectively and efficiently. In LTBP, a novel voxel structure and the `voxel expansion' algorithm are proposed for the generation of driving corridors in 3D configuration, which involves the prediction states of surrounding vehicles. By using Dijkstra search, the maneuver with minimal cost is determined in form of voxel sequences, then a quadratic programming (QP) problem is constructed for solving the optimal trajectory. And in STDP, another small-scaled QP problem is performed to track or adjust the reference trajectory from LTBP in response to the dynamic obstacles. Meanwhile, a Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) Checker keeps running at high frequency for real-time feedback to ensure security. Experiments on real data collected in different highway scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our work.

AB Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communication is a technology that provides connectivity between vehicles, pedestrians, and road infrastructure. Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) is proposed by different standards such as ETSI, IEEE, and others since ten years ago to provide wireless connectivity in V2X. Recently, the LTE-V2X based cellular communication is standardized by the 3rd Generation Partner Project (3GPP) Release 14 as an alternative V2X technology to support autonomous driving. 5G-NewRadio (5G-NR) is being proposed by the 3GPP Release 16 as a new radio access technology to offer enhanced radio coverage and wide ultra-high reliability services. 3GPP Release15 was published in 2018 to include Phase 1 5G-NR standard. 3GPP Release 16 is designed to provide the 5G phase 2 and scheduled for being delivered in June 2020. In this paper, we study V2X based DSRC and LTE-V2X standards and introduce the current 5G-V2X standards progress. We present the 5G-V2X architecture design, core elements, challenges, essential requirements, security enhancement, and radio techniques. Also, we consider the security aspects of architecture and issues of 5G-V2X.

AB Connected autonomous electric vehicles (CAEVs) are essential actors in the decarbonization process of the transport sector and a key aspect of home energy management systems (HEMSs) along with PV units, CAEVs and battery energy storage systems. However, there are associated uncertainties which present new challenges to HEMSs, such as aleatory EV arrival and departure times, unknown EV battery states of charge at the connection time, and stochastic PV production due to weather and passing cloud conditions. The proposed HEMS is based on proximal policy optimization (PPO), which is a deep reinforcement learning algorithm suitable for continuous complex environments. The optimal solution for HEMS is a tradeoff between CAEV driver's range anxiety, batteries degradation, and energy consumption, which is solved by means of incentives/penalties in the reinforcement learning formulation. The proposed PPO algorithm was compared to conventional methods such as business-as-usual (BAU) and value iteration (VI) solutions based on dynamic programming. Simulation results indicate that the proposed PPO's performance showed a daily energy cost reduction of 54% and 27% compared to BAU and VI, respectively. Finally, the developed PPO algorithm is suitable for real-time operations due to its fast execution and good convergence to the optimal solution.

AB The structure of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), usually composed of a cylindrical shell, may be exposed to high hydrostatic pressures where buckling collapse occurs before yield stress failure. In conventional submarines, welded stiffeners increase the buckling resistance, however, in small AUVs, they reduce the inner space and cause residual stresses. This work presents an innovative concept for the structural design of an AUV, proposing the use of sliding stiffeners that are part of the structure used to accommodate the electronics inside it. Since the sliding stiffeners are not welded to the shell, there are no residual stresses due to welding, the AUV fabrication process is simplified, enabling a reduction of the manufacturing cost, and the inner space is available to accommodate the equipment needed for the AUV mission. Moreover, they provide a higher buckling resistance when compared to that of an unstiffened cylindrical shell. A comparative analysis of the critical buckling loads for different shell designs was carried out considering the following: (i) the unstiffened shell, (ii) the shell with ring stiffeners, and (iii) the shell with sliding stiffeners. Results evidenced that major advantages were obtained by using the latter alternative against buckling.

AB Vehicles in developing countries have widely varying dimensions and speeds, and drivers tend to not follow lane discipline. In this flow state called "mixed traffic", the interactions between drivers and the resulting maneuvers resemble more that of general disordered self-driven particle systems than that of the orderly lane-based traffic flow of industrialized countries. We propose a general multi particle model for such self-driven "high-speed particles" and show that it reproduces the observed characteristics of mixed traffic. The main idea is to generalize a conventional acceleration-based car-following model to a two-dimensional force field. For in-line following, the model reverts to the underlying car following model, for very slow speeds, it reverts to an anisotropic social-force model for pedestrians. With additional floor fields at the position of lane markings, the model reverts to an integrated car-following and lane-changing model with continuous lateral dynamics including cooperative aspects such as zip merging. With an adaptive cruise control (ACC) system as underlying car-following model, it becomes a controller for the acceleration and steering of autonomous vehicles in mixed or lane-based traffic.

AB High-precision localization has drawn more and more attention in recent research of intelligent vehicle systems and autonomous robot navigation technology. In most methods, the approaches are only effective in some specific situations. In other words, these methods can only perform well with obvious features, like tall building walls, road curbs, etc. In this paper, a novel framework for precise localization of autonomous vehicle applying to different scenes especially some typical urban environments is proposed. The main procedures of this method include mapping and localization. During mapping process, inertial measurement unit, odometry, and high-precision GPS are fused together with the data sensed by LIDAR, a high-precision map that could provide global position and pose is generated using rolling window. When localizing, live laser data align with the prior-map. A particle filter based point cloud matching method is utilized here. Based on this, a hierarchical localizing method is proposed, which is more accurate and faster than the original matching method. With this method, the sampling guided by proposal density is propagated upward every hierarchy. Besides that, some accelerating algorithms are utilized to make this approach real time. Finally, decimeter-level localization is achieved in different environments, which is proven by some experiments.

ID MODEL
AB On-ramp merging is a challenging task for autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially in mixed traffic where AVs coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). In this paper, we formulate the mixed-traffic highway on-ramp merging problem as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem, where the AVs (on both merge lane and through lane) collaboratively learn a policy to adapt to HDVs to maximize the traffic throughput. We develop an efficient and scalable MARL framework that can be used in dynamic traffic where the communication topology could be time-varying. Parameter sharing and local rewards are exploited to foster inter-agent cooperation while achieving great scalability. An action masking scheme is employed to improve learning efficiency by filtering out invalid/unsafe actions at each step. In addition, a novel priority-based safety supervisor is developed to significantly reduce collision rate and greatly expedite the training process. A gym-like simulation environment is developed and open-sourced with three different levels of traffic densities. We exploit curriculum learning to efficiently learn harder tasks from trained models under simpler settings. Comprehensive experimental results show the proposed MARL framework consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art benchmarks.

ID TERMINAL SLIDING-MODE; TRAJECTORY TRACKING; DESIGN
AB To improve the path tracking accuracy and yaw stability of distributed drive autonomous vehicles (DDAVs) under extreme working conditions, a cooperative lateral motion control method based on the dynamic boundary is proposed to prevent different road adhesion conditions from affecting the motion stability of DDAVs. Based on the analysis of the DDAV lateral dynamics system coordination mechanism, a dynamic boundary considering the pavement adhesion coefficient is proposed, and the Lateral Motion Synergistic Control System (LMSCS) is designed. The LMSCS is divided into the coordination, control, and executive layers. The coordination layer divides the control domain into the stable, quasi-stable, and unstable domains by the dynamic boundary, and coordinates the control strength of the path following control and yaw stability control. In the control layer, the path following control and yaw stability control laws are designed based on the global fast terminal sliding mode. The executive layer estimates the expected steering wheel angle and expected additional wheel torque. Joint simulations under double line shifting conditions confirmed that LMSCS reflects the impact of the road attachment conditions and improves the path tracking accuracy and vehicle yaw stability. The LMSCS has better overall performance than existing lateral motion control methods.

AB The vast increase in the available computational capability has allowed the application of Particle-Filter (PF)-based approaches for monocular 3D-model-based tracking. These filters depend on the computation of a likelihood function that is usually unavailable and can be approximated using a similarity metric. We can use temporal filtering techniques between filter iterations to achieve better results when dealing with this suboptimal approximation, which is particularly important when dealing with the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) model symmetry. The similarity metric evaluation time is another critical concern since we usually want a real-time implementation. We explored, tested, and compared with the same dataset two different types of PFs, (i) an Unscented Bingham Filter (UBiF) and (ii) an Unscented Bingham-Gauss Filter (UBiGaF), using pose optimization in both implementations. Using optimization steps between iterations increases the convergence capability of the filter and decreases the obtained error. A new tree-based similarity metric approach is also explored based on the Distance Transform (DT), allowing a faster evaluation of the possibilities without losing accuracy. The results showed that the obtained pose estimation error is compatible with the automatic landing requirements.

AB Automated parking system (APS) that explicitly considers the time efficiency of the motion has received large amounts of attention in recent years. Trajectory planning module in these APS delivered parking trajectory, which was expected to be precisely tracked by tracking module. However, the reference points of frequently used trackers were selected in the spatial domain, resulting in significant trajectory tracking errors with temporal information. In this paper, a tracking control method called ILC-MPC, which combined model predictive control (MPC) and iterative learning control (ILC), was proposed to improve the spatiotemporal tracking accuracy of the autonomous vehicle. ILC was utilized for longitudinal compensation using the error signal between historical and expected speed. Accordingly, the error model in the longitudinal direction was simplified to decrease the number of decision variables in MPC. Simulation experiments using CarSim were carried out to compare the proposed method with open-loop control, linear quadratic regulator (LQR), and pure MPC that had a similar computing time with ILC-MPC. ILC-MPC converged in a few iterations of the learning process and achieved the highest tracking accuracy in spatiotemporal domain among the mentioned methods.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is widely used in marine scientific research and military. An underwater vehicle launch tube with a turbopump as power input is deemed to be the prior method to launch AUV. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of a launch tube system of AUV is built to study the hydrodynamic characteristics and the launch parameters during the launch process. The overset mesh methodology and 6-Degree of Freedom (6-DOF) dynamic mesh are applied in the numerical simulation. The results show that the AUV is launched out of the tube at 12.65 m s(-1) in 0.454s, which also proves the high-efficiency of the launch method. Due to the blocking effect of the AUV in the launch tube, the pump is started at a low flow rate condition. However, the performance of the pump changes sharply when the AUV passes through the seal rings. Meanwhile, the AUV velocity variation is related to its position, too. It is accelerated by the pump before passing through the second seal ring but then slows down since the pressure difference between the head and the tail of the AUV no longer provides momentum.

AB This paper presents a novel roll mechanism and an efficient control strategy for internally actuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The developed control algorithms are tested on Michigan Tech's custom research glider, ROUGHIE (Research Oriented Underwater Glider for Hands-on Investigative Engineering), in a controlled environment. The ROUGHIE's design parameters and operational constraints were driven by its requirement to be man portable, expandable, and maneuverable in shallow water. As an underwater glider, the ROUGHIE is underactuated with direct control of only depth, pitch, and roll. A switching control method is implemented on the ROUGHIE to improve its maneuverability, enabling smooth transitions between different motion patterns. This approach uses multiple feedforward-feedback controllers. Different aspects of the roll mechanism and the effectiveness of the controller on turning motion are discussed based on experimental results. The results illustrate that the ROUGHIE is capable of achieving tight turns with a radius of 2.4 meters in less than 3 meters of water, or one order of magnitude improvement on existing internally actuated platforms. The developed roll mechanism is not specific to underwater gliders and is applicable to all AUVs, especially at lower speeds and in shallower water when external rudder is less effective in maneuvering the vehicle.

AB Autonomous vehicle perception systems typically rely on single-wavelength lidar sensors to obtain three-dimensional information about the road environment. In contrast to cameras, lidars are unaffected by challenging illumination conditions, such as low light during night-time and various bidirectional effects changing the return reflectance. However, as many commercial lidars operate on a monochromatic basis, the ability to distinguish objects based on material spectral properties is limited. In this work, we describe the prototype hardware for a hyperspectral single photon lidar and demonstrate the feasibility of its use in an autonomous-driving-related object classification task. We also introduce a simple statistical model for estimating the reflectance measurement accuracy of single photon sensitive lidar devices. The single photon receiver frame was used to receive 30 12.3 nm spectral channels in the spectral band 1200-1570 nm, with a maximum channel-wise intensity of 32 photons. A varying number of frames were used to accumulate the signal photon count. Multiple objects covering 10 different categories of road environment, such as car, dry asphalt, gravel road, snowy asphalt, wet asphalt, wall, granite, grass, moss, and spruce tree, were included in the experiments. We test the influence of the number of spectral channels and the number of frames on the classification accuracy with random forest classifier and find that the spectral information increases the classification accuracy in the high-photon flux regime from 50% to 94% with 2 channels and 30 channels, respectively. In the low-photon flux regime, the classification accuracy increases from 30% to 38% with 2 channels and 6 channels, respectively. Additionally, we visualize the data with the t-SNE algorithm and show that the photon shot noise in the single photon sensitive hyperspectral data contributes the most to the separability of material specific spectral signatures. The results of this study provide support for the use of hyperspectral single photon lidar data on more advanced object detection and classification methods, and motivates the development of advanced single photon sensitive hyperspectral lidar devices for use in autonomous vehicles and in robotics.

AB The Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) LiDAR point cloud in autonomous vehicles has a large deflection range, which results in slow registration speed and poor applicability. To maximize speed, an improved Normal Distribution Transform (NDT) method that integrates point cloud density features has been proposed. First, the point cloud is reduced using a modified voxel filter and a pass-through filter. Next, the Intrinsic Shape Signature (ISS) algorithm is utilized to analyze the point cloud features and extract key points; the Four-Point Congruent Set (4PCS) algorithm is then employed to calculate the initial pose under the constraints of the key point set to complete the coarse registration. Finally, the self-adaptive segmentation model is constructed by using a K-D tree to obtain the density features of key points, and the NDT algorithm is combined with this model to form an SSM-NDT algorithm, which is used for fine registration. Each algorithm was compared on the autonomous vehicle dataset PandaSet and actual collected datasets. The results show that the novel method increases the speed by at least 60% and takes into account good registration accuracy and strong anti-interference.

AB Summertime decreases in albedo due to algal blooms on mid-latitude snowpack surfaces may strongly enhance snow melt, suggest observations with autonomous aerial vehicles and numerical spectral modelling of resultant albedo changes in the North Cascades, USA.
   Snow algae are ubiquitous in the Pacific Northwest cryosphere in the summer where snowmelt is an important contribution to regional watersheds. However, less attention has been given to biological impurities as drivers of snowmelt compared to inorganic light-absorbing particles. Here we map snow algae near Mt. Baker with a multispectral camera on an uncrewed aerial vehicle using (1) principal components and (2) spectral indexing. The two approaches are tested under differing bloom states and verified with coincident algal pigment and cell count data. During high bloom intensity we found an average instantaneous radiative forcing of 237 W m(-2) with a maximum of 360 W m(-2). This translated to 1,508 +/- 536 m(3) of melted snow water equivalent in the 0.1 km(2) basin. These results demonstrate snow algae contribute to snowmelt at mid-latitudes and the potential for uncrewed autonomous vehicles to map snow algae over expansive areas of the cryosphere.

AB Trajectory planning is a crucial task in designing the navigation systems of automatic underwater vehicles (AUVs). Due to the complexity of underwater environments, decision makers may hope to obtain multiple alternative trajectories in order to select the best. This paper focuses on the multiple-trajectory planning (MTP) problem, which is a new topic in this field. First, we establish a comprehensive MTP model for AUVs, by taking into account the complex underwater environments, the efficiency of each trajectory, and the diversity among different trajectories, simultaneously. Then, to solve the MTP, we develop an ant colony-based trajectory optimizer, which is characterized by a niching strategy, a decayed alarm pheromone measure, and a diversified heuristic measure. The niching strategy assists in identifying and maintaining a diverse set of high-quality solutions. The use of decayed alarm pheromone and diversified heuristic further improves the search effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm. Experimental results on practical datasets show that our proposed algorithm not only provides multiple AUV trajectories for a flexible choice, but it also outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the single trajectory efficiency.

AB Perception and vehicle control remain major challenges in the autonomous driving domain. To find a proper system configuration, thorough testing is needed. Recent advances in graphics and physics simulation allow researchers to build highly realistic simulations that can be used for testing in safety-critical domains and inaccessible environments. Despite the high complexity of urban environments, it is the non-urban areas that are more challenging. Nevertheless, the existing simulators focus mainly on urban driving. Therefore, in this work, we describe our approach to building a flexible real-time testing platform for unmanned ground vehicles for indoor and off-road environments. Our platform consists of our original simulator, robotic operating system (ROS), and a bridge between them. To enable compatibility and real-time communication with ROS, we generate data interchangeable with real-life readings and propose our original communication solution, UDP Bridge, that enables up to 9.5 times faster communication than the existing solution, ROS#. As a result, all of the autonomy algorithms can be run in real-time directly in ROS, which is how we obtained our experimental results. We provide detailed descriptions of the components used to build our integrated platform.

ID MODEL
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are efficient sensor-carrying platforms for mapping and monitoring undersea ice. However, under-ice operations impose demanding requirements to the system, as it must deal with uncertain and unstructured environments, harsh environmental conditions, and reduced capabilities of the navigational sensors. This paper proposes a Bayesian approach to supervisory risk control, with the objective of providing risk management capabilities to the control system. First, an altitude guidance law for following a contour of an ice surface via pitch control using measurements from a Doppler velocity log (DVL) is proposed. Furthermore, a Bayesian network (BN) for probabilistic reasoning over the current state of risk during the operation is developed. This is then extended to a decision network (DN) for autonomously adapting the behavior of the AUV in order to maximize the mission utility, subject to a constraint on the predicted risk from the risk model. The vehicle is thus able to autonomously adapt its behavior in response to its current belief about the risk. The goal of this work is to improve the AUV performance and likelihood of mission success. Results from a simulation study are presented in order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.

AB Traffic signs play an important role in warning drivers by providing information about traffic restrictions, directions, and road quality in order to make sure that every driver is kept safe. Over the past decade, the development of autonomous vehicles has been an active area of research. Therefore, automatic traffic sign detection is a crucial part of the intelligent transportation systems that can be used in autonomous vehicles to detect traffic signs on the road. The optimization methods based on a biologically inspired computation are very powerful in solving optimization problems. In this work, we consider the traffic sign detection task as an optimization problem and propose the artificial bee colony (ABC) method, one of the most popular biologically inspired methods, as an alternative approach for solving it. In other words, we aim to present an algorithm for the automatic detection of multiple traffic signs with a circular shape based on solutions generated by the ABC method without considering the conventional Hough transform principles. Experimental results obtained by our method demonstrate that the proposed approach works well for multiple traffic sign detection and outperforms other existing algorithms.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are advancing the state of the art in numerous scientific and commercial applications. The current surge in micro electronics enables the development of small micro AUVs (AUVs) which are expected to gain increasing popularity in industrial applications such as monitoring of liquid-based processes. This paper presents an information theoretic approach for exploration and monitoring of liquid containing tanks with AUVs. The controller is based on ideas from path integral control and inference with Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs). Both parts are combined in a receding horizon scheme to the PI-GMRF controller. The control problem is formulated within the stochastic optimal control domain and a solution is stated as a path integral. In order to close the control theoretic loop each AUV maintains a belief representation of the environment expressed with GMRFs which allows reasoning by computing posterior distributions conditioned on measurements. Each AUV has its own controller instance and the system is decentral. Only the exchange of measurements and intended control inputs of each AUV is required through the communication link. The approach is validated in simulations for an advection-diffusion scenario and benchmarked against random walk, which it outperforms.

AB This paper presents a description of the 'sensor-fusion' algorithm for a navigation system suitable for autonomous guided vehicles that use two navigation systems: an odometric one which uses encoders mounted on the vehicle's wheels and an inertial one which uses a gyroscope. In the proposed algorithm the accuracy of both navigation systems is estimated as a function of the actual manoeuvre being carried out, which is identified by navigation data, and then the outputs of both sensors are fused taking into account the accuracy ratios. The method is explained starting from the measurement models and its calibration as a function of the different manoeuvres. Experimental calibration of the proposed algorithm was carried out using a scaled mock-up of an industrial robot. While the mean absolute value of the estimated error in distance over the path is 49 mm when using odometric navigation and 28 mm when using odometric plus inertial attitude navigation, it is only 15 mm. when carrying out data fusion between the two measurement systems. A recursive method for estimating the evolution of spatial uncertainty, which also takes into account the systematic effects, is proposed.

AB Vehicular communications in Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) play an interesting role in improving traffic flow on the roads. In such wireless networks, the vehicles cooperate with each other or with the roadside infrastructure to disseminate the data. In this paper, we introduce a mechanism based on coalitional game theory to study the cooperative transmission in VANETs. Each vehicle tries to access the Internet via gateways that can be either fixed or mobile. However, these gateways help the vehicles to access the Internet by cooperatively relaying the vehicles' messages. Thus, two notions to indicate the availability of transmission between vehicles and gateways are introduced. These notions are chosen to deal with the highly dynamic topology in VANETs, namely the notion of an encounter and the notion of a link's predicted lifetime. The problem is modelled as a non-transferable utility game. Then, an algorithm is proposed to dynamically form coalitions among the vehicles. Moreover, a probability of being active is set in terms of speed of the received vehicle. To evaluate the proposed solution, two scenarios are used: fixed gateways scenario and mobile gateways scenario. The numerical results show that the scenario of mobile gateways is more effective in terms of stimulating vehicles to regroup into coalitions. Hence, this helps the vehicles to access the Internet.

AB Since shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) are expected to become an essential transportation mode, lots of research has been conducted to investigate people's attitudes toward SAV and their behaviors in specific situations. Most studies have focused on the single trip service of SAVs, but in fact users always travel in trip chains with multiple sub-trips. To address this research gap, this study provides insights into a trip-chain based service in SAV systems. When users need a short-time stay in a trip chain, they can choose paying and keeping the same SAV (PKSS) to continue their trips, or recalling a new SAV (RNS) after the stay. To reveal users' decision-making mechanisms, a stated preference (SP) survey is designed and implemented in Beijing, China. Then a hybrid choice model (HCM) framework is adopted to analyze critical factors under various trip scenarios. The results show that stay time, price (CNY/min) for PKSS, and waiting time for RNS are three crucial factors determining users' choice-making. Users' choice-making in the current sub-trip is related to other sub-trips features in a trip chain. Further, people who are more concerned about convenience and time-sensitivity are more likely to choose PKSS. Finally, the impacts of operators' level of services are deeply analyzed to understand users' decision making. This paper can be beneficial for SAV operators to provide trip-chain based service in term of service pattern, key findings (suggestions), and the foundation for SAVs' optimization operation.

AB Social perception and acceptance are crucial for the large-scale adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Using the theoretical lens of the mobilities paradigm, this study explored the social meanings, cultural practices, and structure of feelings that could influence adoption and use of AVs in New Zealand (NZ) cities. The data were collected from public NZ Facebook pages during the period 2015-2020 when the AV debate gained momentum. Qualitative content analysis was conducted for a dataset drawn from 57 Facebook posts with over 4200 com-ments. The findings show that AVs are associated with meanings of safety, (un)employment, freedom, and control. The findings show how a society's car culture influences the adoption and ownership of AVs. They also show how AVs may increase productivity by introducing new practices while on the move such as eating, applying makeup, reading, or working, suggesting that travel time in AVs is not 'dead' time. The findings also uncover new aspects of how and why the public could develop trust in AVs. Overall, NZ society tends to be inclined towards accepting AVs with lower automation levels to maintain the pleasure of driving and allow the exploration of unplanned destinations. This study contributes to the mobilities paradigm by enriching our un-derstanding of the diversified meanings and competencies associated with the adoption of AVs and draws attention to ways in which social meanings could be incorporated in AV policy interventions to better inform urban planning and infrastructure decisions that would shape the smart cities of the future.

AB This paper focuses on how cities can use climate action plans (CAPs) to ensure that on-demand mobility and autonomous vehicles (AVs) help reduce, rather than increase, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and inequitable impacts from the transportation system. We employed a three-pronged research strategy involving: (1) an analysis of the current literature on on-demand mobility and AVs; (2) a systematic content analysis of 23 CAPs and general plans (GPs) developed by municipalities in California; and (3) a comparison of findings from the literature and content analysis of plans to identify opportunities for GHG emissions reduction and mobility equity. Findings indicate that policy and planning discussions should consider the synergies between AVs and on-demand mobility as two closely related emerging mobility trends, as well as the key factors (e.g., vehicle electrification, fuel efficiency, use and ownership, access, and distribution, etc.) that determine whether the deployment of AVs would help reduce GHG emissions from transportation. Additionally, AVs and on-demand mobility have the potential to contribute to a more equitable transportation system by improving independence and quality of life for individuals with disabilities and the elderly, enhancing access to transit, and helping alleviate the geographic gap in public transportation services. Although many municipal CAPs and GPs in California have adopted several strategies and programs relevant to AVs and on-demand mobility, several untapped opportunities exist to harness the GHG emissions reduction and social benefits potential of AVs and on-demand mobility.

AB To greatly extend the capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles, automation systems for the various piloting functions are being developed. However, the development of these auto-systems is not without challenges. One of these challenges is the ability to prove the robustness of an autonomous system against unpredicted events. For the navigation task, this means to prove that the system can recover safely after a deviation from the original plan. In a decoupled scheme where the planner generates a plan online and the controller executes the plan, it is difficult to prove the safety of a system exhaustively. Conversely, using a feedback motion plan generated off-line, it is possible to pre-verify and pre-approve a large number of cases simultaneously. Therefore, it is easier to prove system safety. In this work, this approach is utilized to integrate the guidance toward a target location or a target path with geofence avoidance and recovery for a fully autonomous fixed-wing aircraft. Our formulation extends the wavefront expansion to the case of vehicles having minimum turning radius constraints. The solution is suitable for both single goal missions and path following problems in presence of geofences that can have both convex and non-convex shape. The main novelties introduced in the proposed method are the followings: (1) path following in presence of obstacles having an arbitrary shape, (2) definition of a transition function for the rotation of the flow around the predefined path, (3) use of a Gaussian filter to smooth the vector field. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB The emerging technologies of connectivity and automation enable the potential for signal-free intersection control. In this context, virtual platooning is posited to be an innovative, decentralized control strategy that maps two-dimensional vehicle movements onto a one-dimension virtual platoon to enable intersection operations. However, the effectiveness of virtual platooning-based control can be limited or degraded by parametric inaccuracies and unparameterized disturbances in vehicle dynamics, heavy traffic congestion, and/or uncoordinated platoons in multi-lane intersections. To explicitly address these limitations, this study proposes a hybrid cooperative intersection control framework consisting of microscopic-level virtual platooning control and macroscopic-level traffic flow regulation for traffic environments with connected autonomous vehicles. In virtual platooning control, vehicles approaching an intersection are organized into coordinated independent virtual platoons to avoid potential conflicts triggered by platoon formation changes. Through coordination, vehicles in a platoon are grouped into compatible passing sets to maintain desired safe spacing when proceeding through the intersection. We propose a distributed adaptive sliding mode controller (DASMC) which uses the backstepping control method and model reference adaptive control method to address parametric inaccuracies, and the sliding mode control method to consistently suppress the negative effects of the unparameterized disturbances. Each vehicle approaching the intersection utilizes the kinematic information from neighboring vehicles to implement the DASMC in a distributed manner such that vehicles within the same virtual platoon can achieve consensus safely. However, virtual platooning control cannot preclude excessive traffic from approaching the intersection, which can cause undesired spillbacks and degrade intersection control performance. To address this issue, traffic flow regulation is integrated with the virtual platooning control using an iterative feedback loop mechanism. In each iteration of the iterative feedback loop, a constrained finite-time optimal control (CFTOC) problem is solved to determine the optimal input flow permitted to proceed through the intersection, and the virtual platooning control provides feedback on the queue status to the CFTOC to initiate the next iteration. The effectiveness of the proposed intersection control framework is evaluated through numerical experiments. The results indicate that the proposed virtual platooning DASMC controller can mitigate the effects of parametric inaccuracies and unparameterized disturbances to achieve consensus for approaching vehicles, as well as guarantee string stability. Further, the proposed framework can alleviate traffic spillbacks and travel delays effectively through traffic flow regulation.

AB The rapid increase in the number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) poses a threat to the safety of personnel, ground facilities, and aircraft. Therefore, as the basis of UAV safety protection, requirements on collision avoidance technology are getting higher in the mean time. Although plenty of research on UAV collision avoidance systems and methods exists, there is still a lack of integrated view of the UAV safety in the current civil airspace. The reason behind this is that the collision avoidance is always treated as a simple and basic behavior of autonomous robots, wherein a UAV is considered not so much different from other unmanned moving vehicles except its dynamic model. Regulations and rules that are specific to the UAVs under the background of airspace safety are not emphasized and put into consideration in the system and method design. This review paper serves as a guide for developing the UAV collision avoidance technology by summarizing the existing regulations and rules related to UAV collision avoidance, discussing the mathematical formulation of the rule-based collision avoidance methods, and testing and benchmarking those methods.

AB This work is concerned with a machine vision system for an autonomous vehicle designed to treat horticultural crops. The vehicle navigates by following rows of crop (individual cauliflower plants) that are planted in a reasonably regular array typical of commercial practice. We adopt an extended Kalman filter approach where the observation model consists of a grid which is matched to the crop planting pattern in the perspective view through the vehicle camera. Plant features are extracted by thresholding near infrared images of the scene evolving before the camera. A clustering method collects the features into groups representing single plants. An important aspect of the approach is that it provides both localization information and crop/weed discrimination within a single framework since we can assume that features not matching the planting pattern are weeds.
   Off-line tests with two image sequences are carried out to compare the tracking with assessment by three different humans. These show that the extended Kalman filter is a viable method for tracking and that the model parameters derived from the filter are consistent with human assessment.
   We conclude that the performance will be good enough for accurate in-field navigation.

AB The age of automation is upon us. Few decades earlier, nearly all the flying vehicles were human-controlled. Nowadays, almost every air vehicle is partially automated or getting closer to full automation. This race towards full automation has led to the introduction of features like autopilot. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the tiniest version of all types of air vehicles. The widespread usage of autonomous UAVs has spawned the need for safe landing zone (SLZ) detection techniques for UAV landing. A SLZ detection becomes an important face of a mission when the UAV needs emergency landing due to the technical difficulties or adverse weather conditions on the way of its operation. Before directly proceeding for landing, a UAV has to decide whether the landing zones are safe or not. On-board visual sensors provide potential information of the ground surface in the form of image or signal. Different image processing and safe landing area detection (SLAD) algorithms are then used to identify the best possible landing sites from the input data. In this survey, we discuss indoor and outdoor landing zone detection techniques. We further classify outdoor landing zones as either static or dynamic and discuss existing literature in the specific categories. We critique the shortcomings of existing SLZ detection techniques while also acknowledging their contributions. Further, we point to potential areas of improvement and future directions of the safe landing zone detection algorithms we surveyed. This survey paper may be a useful tutorial for understanding the types of landing zones and landing zone detection techniques for the UAVs, the strengths of zone detection algorithms, and the open areas for future improvement and research.

AB This paper introduces a nonconventional approach for autonomous multirotor UAV deployment, in which a quadrotor is aggressively launched through the air with its motors turned OFF. A continuous quaternion attitude trajectory is proposed to safely recover the vehicle into a hover mode. Then, an operator could take the command or continue a desired mission in the autonomous mode. The controller is a chattering-free sliding mode algorithm based on the geometrical properties of quaternions and axis-angle rotations. Lyapunov theory is used to analyze the system stability. The proposed methodology is validated in real-world indoor and outdoor experiments.

AB The logistics and delivery industry is undergoing a technology-driven transformation, with robotics, drones, and autonomous vehicles expected to play a key role in meeting the growing challenges of last-mile delivery. To understand the public acceptability of automated parcel delivery options, this U.S. study explores customer preferences for four innovations: autonomous vehicles, aerial drones, sidewalk robots, and bipedal robots. We use an Integrated Nested Choice and Correlated Latent Variable (INCLV) model to reveal substitution effects among automated delivery modes in a sample of U.S. respondents. The study finds that acceptance of automated delivery modes is strongly tied to shipment price and time, underscoring the importance of careful planning and incentives to maximize the trialability of innovative logistics options. Older individuals and those with concerns about package handling exhibit a lower preference for automated modes, while individuals with higher education and technology affinity exhibit greater acceptance. These findings provide valuable insights for logistics companies and retailers looking to introduce automation technologies in their last-mile delivery operations, emphasizing the need to tailor marketing and communication strategies to meet customer preferences. Additionally, providing information about appropriate package handling by automated technologies may alleviate concerns and increase the acceptance of these modes among all customer groups.

AB It is promising and interesting to supply unmanned marine devices (UMDs) such as data buoys, unmanned surface vessels, and unmanned underwater vehicles with sustainable energy by in-situ wave energy harvesting. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey about the state of the art. This review summarizes the fundamentals, research status, comparisons, applications, challenges, and future trends of wave energy har-vesters (WEHs) incorporated into the UMDs. Various in-situ wave energy capture mechanisms are categorized into external and internal types according to the positional relation, including hydrofoils, floating bodies, tur-bines, pendulums, spring masses, and gyroscopic mechanisms. Also, they are divided into series and parallel types according to the principle of motion generation. Transducers convert the captured mechanical energy into electricity, including electromagnetic, piezoelectric, triboelectric, dielectric elastomer, liquid metal magneto -hydrodynamic, and hybrid transducers. Existing applications of the in-situ WEHs are reviewed and discussed. Finally, the main challenges are summarized. It is found that there is a gap between fully powering the UMDs and using the WEHs. A list of potential solutions, including nonlinear methods, are proposed to promote the further development of this topic.

TI Learning to Drive in the NGSIM Simulator Using Proximal Policy
   Optimization
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB As a popular research field, autonomous driving may offer great benefits for human society. To achieve that, current studies often applied machine learning methods like reinforcement learning to enable an agent to interact and learn in a stimulating environment. However, most simulators lack realistic traffic which may cause a deficiency in realistic interaction. The present study adopted the SMARTS platform to create a simulator in which the trajectories of the vehicles in the NGSIM I-80 dataset were extracted as the background traffic. The built NGSIM simulator was used to train a model using the proximal policy optimization method. The actor-critic neural network was applied, and the model takes inputs including 38 features that encode the information of the host vehicle and the nearest surrounding vehicles in the current lane and adjacent lane. A2C was selected as a comparative method. The results revealed that the PPO model outperformed the A2C model in the current task by collecting more rewards, traveling longer distances, and encountering less dangerous events during model training and testing. The PPO model achieved an 84% success rate in the test which is comparable to the related studies. The present study proved that the public driving dataset and reinforcement learning can provide a useful tool to achieve autonomous driving.

ID VEHICLE; AUVS
AB Using seafloor docking stations to automatedly recover and recharge autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) is an emerging technology to solve the problem of energy limitation for persistent observation. However, this operational modality would constrain the range of AUV activity within a certain radius centered of the seafloor docking station. To increase the recovery flexibility of AUV, this paper demonstrates a concept of docking to a suspended underwater charging station, which is fixed on a taut rope from a surface vessel. This study provides some critical design steps of the AUV docking system, including the construction of the platforms, the guidance method, the collision analysis of docking operation, as well as the rotation-adaptive contactless power/data transfer method. The feasibility of the system was verified in Qingjiang River. Aided by a re-attempt mechanism, the success rate of docking to the cone-type entrance of the suspended station is 100% (39 of 39 tests) after the surface vessel was anchored and the operating depth was over 30-m. The maximum contactless charging power is 882 W with an efficiency of 81.3%, and the maximum data transmission rate is of approximately 41.1 Mbps at different roll angle of AUV.

AB In this study, a low-cost proposed platform for training dynamics (PPTD) is proposed based on operational amplifiers to understand the dynamics and variables of the agricultural tractor John Deere tractor model 4430 to gain autonomy and analyze the behavior of control algorithms proposed in real time by state feedback. The proposed platform uses commercial sensors and interacts with the Arduino Uno and/or Daq-6009 board from National Instruments. A mobile application (APP) was also developed for real-time monitoring of autonomous control signals, the local reference system, and physical and dynamic variables in the tractor; this platform can be used as a mobile alternative applied to a tractor in physically installed form. In the presented case, the PPTD was mounted on a John Deere tractor to test its behavior; moreover, it may be used on other tractor models similarly as established here. The established results of this platform were compared with models established in MATLAB, validating the proposal. All simulations and developments are shared through a web-link as open-source files so that anyone with basic knowledge of electronics and modeling of vehicles can reproduce the proposed platform.

AB This paper presents the experimental evaluation of the alternating landmark navigation (ALN) by multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) using latest results of sea experiments and tank tests in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Self-localization is essential for AUV navigation, and AUVs are typically supported by long base line or super short base line of the support system. Against these methods, the ALN was proposed, where each AUV alternately becomes a landmark, which remains stationary on the seafloor, whereas the other AUVs can navigate based on acoustic positioning with the landmark AUV. The ALN realizes stable navigation without any support. Our goal is to realize surveying near the seafloor using only AUVs. The performance of the ALN in obstacle-existing environments was evaluated through the simulation to discuss the expandability of the ALN. The ALN was implemented on AUVs "Tri-Dog 1," "Tri-TON," and "Tri-TON 2." On the basis of the sea experiments and the tank tests conducted with these AUVs, the performance of the ALN was verified. In particular, accuracy and efficiency of the ALN were evaluated through the tank test. Finally, it is shown that the ALN can realize accurate and efficient survey of the seafloor by only AUVs without any support.

AB Berthing assistance systems (BASs) for berthing operations of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) in restricted waters are very important. Existing BASs are primarily designed for crewed vessels and cannot satisfy the intricate demands of ASV berthing tasks due to limited assistance. In this study, a novel ASV-centric BAS comprising the following four distinctive modules is presented: localization, navigable region acquisition, idle berth determination, and berthing status estimation. The localization module employs a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm that fuses LiDAR and real-time kinematic (RTK) data to achieve precise ship positioning. The navigable region acquisition module involves segmenting point clouds based on horizontal emission angles and identifies the nearest points within each segment to establish the navigable re-gion. The idle berth determination module employs a shoreline-constrained point cloud linear fitting algorithm, thereby extracting docking zones from nearest point clouds and acquiring idle berth information. The berthing status estimation module leverages the pre-established berth lines to compute essential berthing parameters, encompassing the berthing distance, approaching angle, berthing speed, and yaw rate. Experimental validation shows the high accuracy of the proposed BAS, which maintains a 0.438494 m root mean square error for localization, 0.482% relative error in the berthing distance, and 0.493% relative error in the approaching angle. Furthermore, both the navigable region acquisition and idle berth determination modules consistently provide accurate navigable region and idle berth information. Notably, comparative analysis against existing LiDAR-based solutions demonstrates significant performance improvements of 97.86% in the berthing distance accuracy and 98.12% in the approaching angle accuracy.

AB Software-defined data centers (SDDC) are an emerging softwarized model that can monitor the virtual machines' allocation atop the cloud servers. SDDC consists of softwarized entities like Virtual Machine (VM) and hardware entities like servers and connected switches. SDDCs apply VM deployment algorithms to preserve efficient placement and processing data traffic generated from the Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV). To enhance user satisfaction, SDDC providers are always looking for an intellectual model to monitor large-scale incoming traffics, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and CAV applications, by optimizing service quality and service level agreement (SLA). This paper is motivated by this, raising an energy-efficient VM cluster placement algorithm named EVCT to handle service quality and SLA issues in an SDDC in a CAV environment. EVCT algorithm leverages the similarity between VMs and models the problem of VM deployment into a weighted directed graph. Based on the amount of traffic between VM, EVCT adopts the "maximum flow and minimum cut theory" to cut the directed graph and achieve high energy-efficient placement for VMs. The proposed algorithm can efficiently reduce the energy consumption cost, provide a high quality of services (QoS) to users, and have good scalability for the variable workload. We have also carried out a series of experiments to use the real-world workload to evaluate the performance of the EVCT. The results illustrate that the EVCT surpasses the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of energy consumption cost and efficiency.

AB The monitoring of water resources using Autonomous Surface Vehicles with water-quality sensors has been a recent approach due to the advances in unmanned transportation technology. The Ypacarai Lake, the biggest water resource in Paraguay, suffers from a major contamination problem because of cyanobacteria blooms. In order to supervise the blooms using these on-board sensor modules, a Non-Homogeneous Patrolling Problem (a NP-hard problem) must be solved in a feasible amount of time. A dimensionality study is addressed to compare the most common methodologies, Evolutionary Algorithm and Deep Reinforcement Learning, in different map scales and fleet sizes with changes in the environmental conditions. The results determined that Deep Q-Learning overcomes the evolutionary method in terms of sample-efficiency by 50-70% in higher resolutions. Furthermore, it reacts better than the Evolutionary Algorithm in high space-state actions. In contrast, the evolutionary approach shows a better efficiency in lower resolutions and needs fewer parameters to synthesize robust solutions. This study reveals that Deep Q-learning approaches exceed in efficiency for the Non-Homogeneous Patrolling Problem but with many hyper-parameters involved in the stability and convergence.

AB In this paper, we define and investigate a novel model-free deep reinforcement learning framework to solve the taxi dispatch problem. The framework can be used to redistribute vehicles when the travel demand and taxi supply is either spatially or temporally imbalanced in a transportation network. While previous works mostly focus on using model-based methods, the goal of this paper is to explore the policy-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm as a model-free method to optimize the rebalancing strategy. In particular, we propose an actor-critic algorithm with feed-forward neural networks as approximations of both policy and value functions, where the policy function provides the optimal dispatch strategy and the value function estimates the expected costs at each time stamp. Our numerical studies show that the algorithm converges to the theoretical upper bound with less than 4% optimality gap, whether the system dynamics are deterministic or stochastic. We also investigate the scenario where we consider user priority and fairness, and the results indicate that our learned policy is capable of producing a superior strategy that balances equity, cancellation, and level of service when user priority is considered.

AB In the complex ocean environment, the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is subject to the multiple uncertainties including deterministic uncertainties and stochastic uncertainties, which greatly degrade the control performance. To solve this problem, a novel robust control strategy using combined uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is proposed for the path-following control (PFC) of the underactuated AUV under multiple uncertainties in this paper. First, the UDE technique is adopted to handle the deterministic uncertainties, including deterministic components of environmental disturbances, parameter uncertainties, and unmodeled dynamics, etc. Second, the uncertainty of unactuated lateral channel, which cannot be dealt with by the UDE, is treated as an unknown parameter. Also, to tackle the stochastic uncertainties, which is often ignored in previous studies, including stochastic components of environmental disturbances, measurement noise, and the estimation errors of UDE which are treated as the process noise, the augmented UKF technique is adopted to jointly estimate the system states and the lateral channel unknown parameter. Finally, extensive numerical simulations and comparative analyses are presented to verify the efficiency and robustness of the proposed control strategy.

AB In the artificial intelligent and big data technology era, the marine industry among others is inevitably developing in this direction, aiming at becoming autonomous and completing tasks without relying on human involvement while providing safety. The technology of small unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) is relatively mature but with a large development potential and wide research interest expecting significant benefits such as safety and high efficiency in shipping and transportation systems. This article addresses these issues and utilizes an imitation learning algorithm to resolve autonomous navigation for USVs even in complex environmental conditions. We formulate the trajectory modeling as a data-driven imitation learning problem where we employ a state of the art imitation learning algorithm. Experiments are performed in a particular simulated environment tailored to match the specific weather conditions of the local area. The simulation results show the potential of the proposed imitation learning scheme to create advanced intelligent agents for USVs under real-world environmental settings, and USV actuation constraints that allow to predict trajectories with high accuracy and safety.In addition, we evaluated the method's robustness in generating successful trajectories under environmental conditions that differed from those encountered during training, thereby promoting knowledge reusing without the need for retraining.

AB This paper considers the unique attributes of autonomous vehicles, the characteristics of expressways' minor actual slope grade, and the speed update integer requirements of discrete cellular automata (CA). The continuous deceleration efficiency of the uphill is discretized by introducing variable parameters connected to the vehicle position and gradient, and the hybrid traffic flow CA model suitable for slope bottlenecks based on the principle of the safety distance is further improved. The simulation results show that the improved model can simulate the unique traffic flow phenomenon caused by the change in slope conditions. There is a critical mutation in the traffic flow phase on the slope road section. Secondly, according to the different main factors influencing traffic flow, free flow, terrain jams, and homogeneous congested flow coexist on the slope section. The traffic flow in the crowded terrain area is significantly negatively correlated with the length and longitudinal gradient of the slope, and increasing the longitudinal angle of the hill will extend the congested terrain area. In addition, the influence of the change in slope conditions on mixed traffic flow has a critical longitudinal gradient of 3% and a fixed critical slope length. In non-free flow areas, autonomous vehicles can significantly alleviate traffic congestion on upslopes.

AB Recognition of obstacle type based on visual sensors is important for navigation by unmanned surface vehicles (USV), including path planning, obstacle avoidance, and reactive control. Conventional detection techniques may fail to distinguish obstacles that are similar in visual appearance in a cluttered environment. This work proposes a novel obstacle type recognition approach that combines a dilated operator with the deep-level features map of ResNet50 for autonomous navigation. First, visual images are collected and annotated from various different scenarios for USV test navigation. Second, the deep learning model, based on a dilated convolutional neural network, is set and trained. Dilated convolution allows the whole network to learn deep features with increased receptive field and further improves the performance of obstacle type recognition. Third, a series of evaluation parameters are utilised to evaluate the obtained model, such as the mean average precision (mAP), missing rate and detection speed. Finally, some experiments are designed to verify the accuracy of the proposed approach using visual images in a cluttered environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the dilated convolutional neural network obtains better recognition performance than the other methods, with an mAP of 88%.

ID TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM
AB This letter studies the problem of data collection where an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is required to inspect several goals while staying within the communication range of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) moving along a predefined path. A reward is associated with each inspected goal, and, so the overall objective is to increase the sum of the rewards. The proposed planner takes the AUV dynamics and the obstacles into account in order to generate collision-free and dynamically-feasible trajectories that enable the AUV to inspect multiple goals while maintaining communication with the USV. When not all the goals can be inspected, the planner generates trajectories that increase the sum of the rewards. The proposed planner constructs a roadmap equipped with time information in order to facilitate navigation and maintain communication in complex 3D environments. A crucial aspect is an effective coupling of discrete search with sampling-based motion planning. Specifically, a multi-goal discrete search is proposed to effectively compute roadmap paths that increase the sum of the rewards. These paths then guide the sampling-based expansion of a motion tree. Experiments using complex 3D environments and an AUV model defined by nonlinear second-order differential equations indicate the efficiency of the planner to inspect an increasing number of goals.

AB Crowd simulation has been widely used as a tool to demonstrate the behavior of passengers on public transport. A simulation model allows researchers to evaluate the platform or interior designs without involving real-world experimentation. In this paper, we propose a passenger model to measure the effect of different public transport vehicle layouts on the required time for boarding and alighting. We first model a low level collision avoidance behavior based on an extended social force model aiming at simulating human interactions in confined spaces. The model introduces a mechanism to emulate rotation behavior while avoiding complex geometric computations and is calibrated to experimental data. The model also allows agents to perform collision prediction in low density environments. Strategical behavior of passengers is modeled according to the recognition-primed decision paradigm and combined with the collision avoidance model. We validate our model against real-world experiments from the literature, demonstrating deviations of less than 6%. In a case study, we evaluate the boarding and alighting times required by three autonomous vehicle interior layouts proposed by industrial designers in both low-density and high-density scenarios.

AB A robust model-free path following controller is developed for autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) with time-varying ocean disturbance. First, the geometrical relationship between ASV and virtual tracking point on the reference path is investigated. The differentiations of tracking errors are described with the relative motion method, which greatly simplified the direct differential of tracking errors. Furthermore, the control law for the desired angular velocity of the vehicle and virtual tracking point are built based on the Lyapunov theory. Second, the traditional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is developed based on the desired velocities and state feedback. The radial basic function (RBF) neural network taking as inputs the desired surge velocity and yaw angular velocity is developed as the supervisor to PID controller. Besides, RBF controller tunes weights according to the output errors between the PID controller and supervisor controller, based on the gradient descent method. Hence, PID controller and RBF supervisor controller act as feedback and feed forward control of the system, respectively. Finally, comparative path following simulation for straight path and sine path illustrate the performance of the proposed supervisor control system. The PID controller term reports loss of control even in the unknown disturbance.

AB After natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornados and fires, providing emergency management schemes which mainly rely on communications systems is essential for rescue operations. To establish an emergency communications system during unforeseen events such as natural disasters, we propose the use of a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The proposed system is a post-disaster solution and can be used whenever and wherever required. Each UAV in the team has an onboard computer which runs three main subsystems responsible for end-to-end communication, formation control and autonomous navigation. The onboard computer and the low-level controller of the UAV cooperate to accomplish the objective of providing local communications infrastructure. In this study, the subsystems running on each UAV are explained and evaluated by simulation studies and field tests using an autonomous helicopter. While the simulation studies address the efficiency of the end-to-end communication subsystem, the field tests evaluate the accuracy of the navigation subsystem. The results of the field tests and the simulation studies show that the proposed system can be successfully used in case of disasters to establish an emergency communications system.

AB Advances in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have led to an exponential increase in their market, thanks to the development of innovative technological solutions aimed at a wide range of applications and services, such as emergencies and those related to fires. In addition, the expansion of this market has been accompanied by the birth and growth of the so-called UAV swarms. Currently, the expansion of these systems is due to their properties in terms of robustness, versatility, and efficiency. Along with these properties there is an aspect, which is still a field of study, such as autonomous and cooperative navigation of these swarms. In this paper we present an architecture that includes a set of complementary methods that allow the establishment of different control layers to enable the autonomous and cooperative navigation of a swarm of UAVs. Among the different layers, there are a global trajectory planner based on sampling, algorithms for obstacle detection and avoidance, and methods for autonomous decision making based on deep reinforcement learning. The paper shows satisfactory results for a line-of-sight based algorithm for global path planner trajectory smoothing in 2D and 3D. In addition, a novel method for autonomous navigation of UAVs based on deep reinforcement learning is shown, which has been tested in 2 different simulation environments with promising results about the use of these techniques to achieve autonomous navigation of UAVs.

TI A Rapid Prototyping Environment for Cooperative Advanced Driver
   Assistance Systems
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) were strong innovation drivers in recent years, towards the enhancement of traffic safety and efficiency. Today's ADAS adopt an autonomous approach with all instrumentation and intelligence on board of one vehicle. However, to further enhance their benefit, ADAS need to cooperate in the future, using communication technologies. The resulting combination of vehicle automation and cooperation, for instance, enables solving hazardous situations by a coordinated safety intervention on multiple vehicles at the same point in time. Since the complexity of such cooperative ADAS grows with each vehicle involved, very large parameter spaces need to be regarded during their development, which necessitate novel development approaches. In this paper, we present an environment for rapidly prototyping cooperative ADAS based on vehicle simulation. Its underlying approach is either to bring ideas for cooperative ADAS through the prototyping stage towards plausible candidates for further development or to discard them as quickly as possible. This is enabled by an iterative process of refining and assessment. We reconcile the aspects of automation and cooperation in simulation by a tradeoff between precision and scalability. Reducing precise mapping of vehicle dynamics below the limits of driving dynamics enables simulating multiple vehicles at the same time. In order to validate this precision, we also present a method to validate the vehicle dynamics in simulation against real world vehicles.

TI Warning Apps for Road Safety: A Technological and Economical Perspective

DT Article
AB In the last decade, mobile warning apps and security services for drivers were developed, driven by the evolving market for smartphone-based applications. Now, in times of emerging autonomous vehicles, the value of warning detection in form of warning apps for road transport needs to be reappraised. In our study, we address the following questions: Does this kind of application have a technological and economical perspective for future mobility? How will the interaction between drivers, information systems (smartphone or onboard computer), and driving systems change? In this article, we bring together the aspects to consider in terms of technology development and business modeling amidst a changing human-computer interaction (HCI) toward autonomous driving. We provide a comprehensive picture of how technology-driven applications, such as warning detection apps, could develop their economic and technological impact within the transition of individual transport. By classifying the warning apps available in German-speaking regions it became apparent that apps exist for diverse areas of risk. Some of them are currently under development, others are already in use, but still with minor operational deficits. We found out that till today, the majority of warning services provides either an interim solution with a standalone mobile app, or a first test stage approach for prospective mobility solutions, only working on the basis of a car-to-car or car-to-pedestrian communication. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of warning apps was exemplarily proven by a survey about the Wildwarner, an app for wildlife-vehicle collision warnings. Looking ahead, warning-service-usage scenarios (1) without driving assistance, (2) with driving assistance and (3) fully autonomous driving are gone through, showing the still important but altered interactions between humans, warning information systems, and automated driving systems. From an economical perspective, already existing business models for warning services are identified and evaluated according to whether they could be transferred to business models for future mobility under changing ways of user interaction. The analysis of existing established warning apps indicates that more integrated approaches combining different warning types and delivering them as services either for autonomous vehicle navigation or human drivers ought to be supported for increasing road safety.

AB Despite the expected future introduction of autonomous vehicles in cities, very few studies have analysed the needs and challenges facing urban planning. This paper employs a combination of backcasting and Q-methodology to carry out participatory visioning for a future driverless city. This novel approach was used to elaborate shared visions of the desirable city among a group of 20 citizens and 10 practitioners. Views on 41 statements were analysed relating to urban design, society, environment, transport and mobility needs. Three main visions were identified. The first focuses on high-quality urban spaces and active mobility. The second vision is more futuristic and pro-social, consistent with the more imaginative and innovative stance of young people. The third vision is more conventional and closer to business-as-usual. The results suggest that there is some agreement on the future conditions and policies, especially on the need for environmentally friendly urban development and safe urban design. The article is premised on the belief that engaging stakeholders from different backgrounds, including citizens of various ages, can be enriching for urban planning since there is a wide variety of heterogeneous preferences across society. This requires a search for common ground when designing policy measures that satisfy multiple interests.

AB This article develops a model to plan energy-efficient speed trajectories of electric trucks in real time by considering the information of topography and traffic ahead of the vehicle. In this real-time control model, a novel state-space model is first developed to capture vehicle speed, acceleration, and state of charge. An energy minimization problem is then formulated and solved by an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) that exploits the structure of the problem. A model predictive control (MPC) framework is further employed to deal with topographic and traffic uncertainties in real time. An empirical study is finally conducted on the performance of the proposed eco-driving algorithm and its impact on battery degradation. The simulation results show that the energy consumption by using the developed method is reduced by up to 5.05%, and the battery life is extended by more than 100% compared to benchmarking solutions.

AB Due to the high maneuverability and strong adaptability, autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are of high interest to many civilian and military organizations around the world. Automatic path planning which autonomously finds a good enough path that covers the whole area of interest, is an essential aspect of UAV autonomy. In this study, we focus on the automatic path planning of heterogeneous UAVs with different flight and scan capabilities, and try to present an efficient algorithm to produce appropriate paths for UAVs. First, models of heterogeneous UAVs are built, and the automatic path planning is abstracted as a multi-constraint optimization problem and solved by a linear programming formulation. Then, inspired by the density-based clustering analysis and symbiotic interaction behaviours of organisms, an adaptive clustering-based algorithm with a symbiotic organisms search-based optimization strategy is proposed to efficiently settle the path planning problem and generate feasible paths for heterogeneous UAVs with a view to minimizing the time consumption of the search tasks. Experiments on randomly generated regions are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in terms of task completion time, execution time and deviation ratio.

AB Highly automated driving allows the driver to temporarily delegate the driving task to the autonomous vehicle. The challenge is to define the information that needs to be displayed to the driver in this mode, to let him be able to take over properly. This study investigates the automation transparency to ensure a meta-cooperation between the driver and the automation and the way to convey information to the driver using Augmented Reality according to some transparency principles. Therefore, among 45 participants, we evaluated five human-machine interface (HMI) in which some or all of the following functions were integrated: information acquisition, information analysis, decision-making and action execution. To validate our transparency principles, we assessed Situation Awareness, discomfort feeling, and the participants' preferences. Even though there is no convergence in the first results, it appears clearly that no transparency in the HMI does not help to understand the environment. Additionally, it appears that "information acquisition" and "action execution" functions are quite necessary. Furthermore, the HMI with the high level of transparency was preferred by the participants. However, more analysis is required to obtain final results.

AB Controllers working in uncertain environments are often required to adapt themselves continuously to changing conditions to avoid steady-state errors, oscillations at the output or even instability of the closed loop system. The moving horizon estimation (MHE)-nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework being proposed combines these two optimization-based methods to control field vehicles utilizing an adaptive nonlinear kinematic model. The full system state, including two unknown slip parameters and the unmeasurable vehicle orientation, is estimated by the MHE after each new measurement and fed afterwards to the NMPC routine which provides a wheel velocity and a steering rate to follow arbitrary time-based reference trajectories in difficult environmental conditions. This control problem occurs in modern agriculture e.g. in planting or mechanical weeding while slippery conditions make these operation difficult and off-track navigation results in plant damage. The experimental results show accurate reference tracking performance of the MHE-NMPC framework on a wet and bumpy grass field. The feedback times lie in the range of 0.6-1.6 ms when the ACADO Code Generation tool is used, which is part of the open-source software toolkit ACADO. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Negative obstacles for field autonomous land vehicles (ALVs) refer to ditches, pits, or terrain with a negative slope, which will bring risks to vehicles in travel. This paper presents a feature fusion based algorithm (FFA) for negative obstacle detection with LiDAR sensors. The main contributions of this paper are fourfold: (1) A novel three-dimensional (3-D) LiDAR setup is presented. With this setup, the blind area around the vehicle is greatly reduced, and the density of LiDAR data is greatly improved, which are critical for ALVs. (2) On the basis of the proposed setup, a mathematical model of the point distribution of a single scan line is deduced, which is used to generate ideal scan lines. (3) With the mathematical model, an adaptive matching filter based algorithm (AMFA) is presented to implement negative obstacle detection. Features of simulated obstacles in each scan line are employed to detect the real negative obstacles. They are supposed to match with features of the potential real obstacles. (4) Grounded on AMFA algorithm, a feature fusion based algorithm is proposed. FFA algorithm fuses all the features generated by different LiDARs or captured at different frames. Bayesian rule is adopted to estimate the weight of each feature. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is robust and stable. Compared with the state-of-the-art techniques, the detection range is improved by 20%, and the computing time is reduced by an order of two magnitudes. The proposed algorithm had been successfully applied on two ALVs, which won the champion and the runner-up in the Overcome Danger 2014 ground unmanned vehicle challenge of China.

AB This research presents path planning and tracking for an articulated large wheel loader during the travel portion of a loading cycle. The study proposes a methodology for path planning, modeling, simulation and control of such vehicles; the analysis focuses on all of these components together and explains the relation among them. The developed methodology for path planning takes into account the dynamics and the performance characteristics of the heavy construction articulated vehicles, it also takes into account the construction working site constraints. The path optimization criterion is based on distance and cusp minimization without neglecting the constraints imposed by the size of the vehicle and its stable turning radius. The proposed path planning methodology is an extension and an improvement for Reeds and Shepp algorithm for a point shortest path calculation. The optimal path is consisted of circular arcs and straight segments, the radius is constant and identical for each arc in the desired path, the radius assumed to be similar to the minimum turning radius of the machine. When optimizing articulated machine path; to best account for machine size and articulation; more than one approach are discussed and compared. The machine is modeled and simulated during tracing the pre-defined planned path. The machine model includes the main frames, tires and a steering controller. The developed PID controller is used to keep machine lateral position within the pre-defined path while traveling with constant speed. The results showed an acceptable optimized path which the machine is able to track closely. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The maritime industry has been following the paradigm shift toward the automation of typically intelligent procedures, with research regarding autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) having seen an upward trend in recent years. However, this type of vehicle cannot be employed on a full scale until a few challenges are solved. For example, the docking process of an ASV is still a demanding task that currently requires human intervention. This research work proposes a volumetric convolutional neural network (vCNN) for the detection of docking structures from 3-D data, developed according to a balance between precision and speed. Another contribution of this article is a set of synthetically generated data regarding the context of docking structures. The dataset is composed of LiDAR point clouds, stereo images, GPS, and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) information. Several robustness tests carried out with different levels of Gaussian noise demonstrated an average accuracy of 93.34% and a deviation of 5.46% for the worst case. Furthermore, the system was fine-tuned and evaluated in a real commercial harbor, achieving an accuracy of over 96%. The developed classifier is able to detect different types of structures and works faster than other state-of-the-art methods that establish their performance in real environments.

AB With the spread of smartphones and mobile internet, Global Positioning System (GPS) data from vehicles has become widely available. This data represents a unique opportunity to automatically extract road network features and generate detailed maps that can be used in the creation of transport network models, while minimising the quantity of resources usually invested in that task. Accurate transport network models can be used in a variety of applications either in transport simulation models or autonomous vehicles navigation. Although two relevant literature reviews were performed during the last decade, they were not systematic and did not explore the road network inference methods from a transport network modelling point of view. The objective of this research is to perform a systematic and reproducible literature review on the use GPS data in transport network modelling and provide limitations and future work to extract a road network representation for transport models and autonomous vehicles navigation. This was done by systematically examining the studies' different approaches with respect to relevant criteria. Most studies produced a simple representation of the road network, not detailed enough for transport models. Other limitations were the bias introduced by the GPS sample and the reproducibility of the different methods.

AB Neural networks are currently suggested to be implemented in several different driving functions of autonomous vehicles. While showing promising results the drawback lies in the difficulty of safety verification and ensuring operation as intended. The aim of this paper is to increase safety when using neural networks, by proposing a monitoring framework based on novelty estimation of incoming driving data. The idea is to use unsupervised instance discrimination to learn a similarity measure across ego-vehicle camera images. By estimating a von Mises-Fisher distribution of expected ego-camera images they can be compared with unexpected novel images. A novelty measurement is inferred through the likelihood of test frames belonging to the expected distribution. The suggested method provides competitive results to several other novelty or anomaly detection algorithms on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. It also shows promising results on real world driving scenarios by distinguishing novel driving scenes from the training data of BDD100 k. Applied on the identical training-test data split, the method is also able to predict the performance profile of a segmentation network. Finally, examples are provided on how this method can be extended to find novel segments in images.

AB For the first time in history, automated vehicles (AVs) are being deployed in populated environments. This unprecedented transformation of our everyday lives demands a significant undertaking: endowing complex autonomous systems with ethically acceptable behavior. We outline how one prominent, ethically relevant component of AVs-driving behavior-is inextricably linked to stakeholders in the technical, regulatory, and social spheres of the field. Whereas humans are presumed (rightly or wrongly) to have the "common sense" to behave ethically in new driving situations beyond a standard driving test, AVs do not (and probably should not) enjoy this presumption. We examine, at a high level, how to test the common sense of an AV. We start by reviewing discussions of "driverless dilemmas," adaptions of the traditional "trolley dilemmas" of philosophy that have sparked discussion on AV ethics but have limited use to the technical and legal spheres. Then, we explain how to substantially change the premises and features of these dilemmas (while preserving their behavioral diagnostic spirit) in order to lay the foundations for a more practical and relevant framework that tests driving common sense as an integral part of road rules testing.

AB Predictably, future urban airspaces will be crowded with autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offering different services to the population. One of the main challenges in this new scenario is the design of collision-free navigation algorithms to avoid conflicts between flying UAVs. The most appropriate collision avoidance strategies for this scenario are non-centralized ones that are dynamically executed (in real time). Existing collision avoidance methods usually entail a high computational cost. In this work, we present Bounding Box Collision Avoidance (BBCA) algorithm, a simplified velocity obstacle-based technique that achieves a balance between efficiency and cost. The performance of the proposal is analyzed in detail in different airspace configurations. Simulation results show that the method is able to avoid all the conflicts in two UAV scenarios and most of them in multi-UAV ones. At the same time, we have found that the penalty of using the BBCA collision avoidance technique on the flying time and the distance covered by the UAVs involved in the conflict is reasonably acceptable. Therefore, we consider that BBCA may be an excellent candidate for the design of collision-free navigation algorithms for UAVs.

AB This paper presents a task prioritization strategy based on a generic underwater task goal classification transformation for multitasking underwater operational tasks: attitude control, floating manipulation, collision-free motion, especially optimizing trajectory of the end-effector of an underwater vehicle manipulator system (UVMS) in a complex marine environment. The design framework aims to divide the complex underwater operational tasks into UVMS executable generic task combinations and optimize the resource consumption during the whole task. In order to achieve the corresponding underwater task settings, the system needs to satisfy different task scheduling structures. We consider the actual application scenarios of the operational goals and prioritize and define each category of task hierarchy accordingly. Multiple tasks simultaneously enable fast adaptation to UVMS movements and planning to complete UVMS autonomous movements. Finally, an underwater vehicle manipulator system implements the task prioritization planning framework for a practical scenario with different constraints on different goals. We quickly and precisely realize the interconversion of different tasks under goal constraints. The autonomous motion planning and real-time performance of UVMS are improved to cope with the increasing operational task requirements and the complex and changing practical engineering application environments.

AB Current works of environmental perception for connected autonomous electrified vehicles (CAEVs) mainly focus on the object detection task in good weather and illumination conditions, they often perform poorly in adverse scenarios and have a vague scene parsing ability. This paper aims to develop an end-to-end sharpening mixture of experts (SMoE) fusion framework to improve the robustness and accuracy of the perception systems for CAEVs in complex illumination and weather conditions. Three original contributions make our work distinctive from the existing relevant literature. The Complex KITTI dataset is introduced which consists of 7481 pairs of modified KITTI RGB images and the generated LiDAR dense depth maps, and this dataset is fine annotated in instance-level with the proposed semi-automatic annotation method. The SMoE fusion approach is devised to adaptively learn the robust kernels from complementary modalities. Comprehensive comparative experiments are implemented, and the results show that the proposed SMoE framework yield significant improvements over the other fusion techniques in adverse environmental conditions. This research proposes a SMoE fusion framework to improve the scene parsing ability of the perception systems for CAEVs in adverse conditions.

AB On-road motion planning concerns about how to find a local trajectory that is free from collisions or violations of traffic laws, easy to be tracked by the low-level controllers, comfortable for the passengers, and consistent with the common practice of human drivers. Safety is an essential issue when a vehicle travels on an urban road, especially when blind regions appear in the way ahead. Absent-minded pedestrians may appear suddenly from the blind region at the roadside. Following the predominant first-sampling-then-optimization hierarchical planning framework, this work is focused on how to make the derived trajectory safer w.r.t. the underlying risks in the occlusion areas. In searching for a coarse trajectory via sampling in the time-s-l state space and searching via dynamic programming (DP), we formulate a cost function that can handle occlusion-related risks quantitatively. Through this way, the occluded regions would be treated seriously but not overcautiously. According to the derived simulation results, the ego vehicle tends to go far away from the occluded regions or to slow down, which is intuitively following human drivers' common practice.

I do so by charting the emergence of two such processes enabled by the redesign of vehicle dashboards: firstly, the transformation of 'geodata' into 'navigational data' with the integration of voice-activated navigation systems into vehicle dashboards, and secondly, the transformation of 'vehicle data' into 'driving data' in the convergence, and customization, of dashboard features and functionality. Both transformations are enabled through strategic design decisions, persuading drivers to participate in novel practices they might otherwise not.

AB Multi-vehicle cooperative perception has recently emerged for facilitating long-range and large-scale perception ability of connected automated vehicles (CAVs). Nonetheless, enormous efforts formulate collaborative perception as LiDAR-only 3D detection paradigm, neglecting the significance and complementary of dense image. In this work, we construct the first multi-modal vehicle-to-vehicle cooperative perception framework dubbed as V2VFormer ++ , where individual camera-LiDAR representation is incorporated with dynamic channel fusion (DCF) at bird's-eye-view (BEV) space and ego-centric BEV maps from adjacent vehicles are aggregated by global-local transformer module. Specifically, channel-token mixer (CTM) with MLP design is developed to capture global response among neighboring CAVs, and position-aware fusion (PAF) further investigate the spatial correlation between each ego-networked map in a local perspective. In this manner, we could strategically determine which CAVs are desirable for collaboration and how to aggregate the foremost information from them. Quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted on both publicly-available OPV2V and V2X-Sim 2.0 benchmarks, and our proposed V2VFormer ++ reports the state-of-the-art cooperative perception performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and advancement. Moreover, ablation study and visualization analysis further suggest the strong robustness against diverse disturbances from real-world scenarios.

AB We present a dynamic stability and agility study of a pendulum-turn vehicle maneuver. Instead of optimizing the controlled inputs to mimic expert human driver performance, we focus on understanding the stability and agility performance of the vehicle motion using professional racing car driver testing data. We propose to use the rear side slip angle, rather than the vehicle mass center side slip angle, as one state variable to obtain the precise stable region. A hybrid physical/dynamic tire/road friction model is used to capture the dynamic friction force characteristics. We also introduce the use of vehicle lateral jerk and acceleration information as the agility metrics to compare maneuvering performance under the racing car driver and a typical human driver. The analysis and testing results show that during the pendulum-turn maneuvers, the professional driver operates the vehicle outside the stable regions of the vehicle dynamics to achieve superior agility performance than that under typical human driver control. Comparison results also show that the racing car driver outperforms in both the traveling time and the agility metrics. It is ongoing work to design a control strategy for autonomous aggressive maneuvers by using the new stability and agility results presented in this paper.

AB The blockage is a tough hurdle for millimetre-wave (mmWave) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. In this Letter, the authors propose an angle domain channel transmission scheme for mmWave hybrid UAV communication with blockage. Firstly, they investigate the angle domain channel transmission of mmWave UAV communication systems with massive array antennas. Then, they solve the blockage problem through the multi-UAV coordination. Specially, they provide a practical user scheduling algorithm to maximize the achievable sum rates. Finally, simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Despite their sustainable benefits, large-scale adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) into the distribution system is challenging. Uncontrolled charging of EVs could increase voltage violations, system power losses, and feeder overloads. In this article, an autonomous EV charge control strategy is proposed to control EV charging in a way that mitigates their negative impacts. To ensure fair contribution from EVs connected to different nodes, both the local nodal voltage and sensitivity of voltage to load changes are used as inputs to the proposed controller. This is so because these two inputs have a complementary relationship. That is, nodes with lower voltages are generally more sensitive to load changes than those with higher voltages. In addition, a novel approach for locally estimating the voltage sensitivities online is proposed. This ensures the robustness of the proposed control strategy to changes in loading conditions and system configurations without the need for communication. An EV-rich test distribution system is modeled in the DIgSILENT PowerFactory environment and used to validate the proposed control strategy. The test results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed strategy considering different loading conditions, system reconfiguration, distributed generators, and voltage control devices.

AB Automated vehicle control systems are a key technology for intelligent vehicle highway systems (IVHSs). This paper presents an automated vehicle control algorithm for combined longitudinal and lateral motion control of highway vehicles, with special emphasis on front-wheel-steered four-wheel road vehicles. The controller is synthesized using an online neural-estimator-based control law that works in combination with a lateral velocity observer. The online adaptive neural-estimator-based design approach enables the controller to counteract for inherent model discrepancies, strong nonlinearities, and coupling effects. The neurocontrol approach can guarantee the uniform ultimate bounds (UUBs) of the tracking and observer errors and the bounds of the neural weights. The key design features are 1) inherent coupling effects will be taken into account as a result of combining of the two control issues, viz., lateral and longitudinal control; 2) rather ad hoc numerical approximations of lateral velocity will be avoided via a combined controller-observer design; and 3) closed-loop stability issues of the overall system will be established. The algorithm is validated via a formative mathematical analysis based on a Lyapunov approach and numerical simulations in the presence of parametric uncertainties, as well as severe and adverse driving conditions.

ID FAULT IDENTIFICATION
AB The architecture of an advanced fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) system is described and applied with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The architecture aims to provide a more capable system that does not require dedicated sensors for each fault, can diagnose previously unforeseen failures and failures with cause-effect patterns across different subsystems. It also lays the foundations for incipient fault detection and condition-based maintenance schemes. A model of relationships is used as an ontology to describe the connected set of electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, and computing components that make up the vehicle, down to the level of least replaceable unit in the field. The architecture uses a variety of domain dependent diagnostic tools (rulebase, model-based methods) and domain independent tools (correlator, topology analyzer, watcher) to first detect and then diagnose the location of faults. Tools nominate components, so that a rank order of most likely candidates can be generated. This modular approach allows existing proven FDD methods (e.g., vibration analysis, FMEA) to be incorporated and to add confidence to the conclusions. Illustrative performance is provided working in real time during deployments with the RAUVER hover capable AUV as an example of the class of automated system to which this approach is applicable.

AB Electrifying the ground vehicles is a promising approach to alleviating the energy and climate issues. The adoption of an electric vehicle (EV) and a hybrid EV (HEV) has introduced significant impacts on various aspects of vehicle design, especially on the chassis systems. When vehicles tend to be lighter, smarter, and autonomous, more electroactuators with a wide-bandwidth control and an energy-regeneration capability are deployed instead of traditional hydraulic ones to improve the vehicle dynamic and energy performance. In this article, an overview of the chassis electrification technologies regarding different configurations of electric/hybrid powertrains, active suspension, and steering systems, along with a comprehensive review of key research fields on the design and control of the discussed systems, is presented. For related technologies, the comparative discussions and design considerations serve as a reference for practical research and development. Although the electric solutions in different subsystems show great potential to further benefit the essential chassis functions, a fully electrified chassis still has a long way to go considering the technical maturity and the cost-performance tradeoff. This article also highlights the technical gaps and supplies future directions for the chassis electrification.

AB Trust is the key factor for people to accept autonomous vehicles(AVs). Existing studies have reported that multimodal interaction would enhance people's trust in AVs. However, these researches mainly focus on the superposition effect between sensory channels, and lack on the research of correlation between different sensory channels and its influence on AVs trust. Therefore, we innovatively introduce synesthesia theory for the research of improving AVs trust. We present an AVs multimodal interaction model based on audio-visual synesthesia theory, and finally prove that the model has a definite effect on improving AVs trust by experiments. Firstly, 82 participants are recruited and assigned into two groups: Group A (non-synesthesia group) and Group B (synesthesia group). They conduct an experimental driving experienced normal traffic conditions (NTC) (turning, traffic lights, over and limit speed prompts) and emergency traffic condition (ETC) (sudden braking of the car in front, temporary lane change, pedestrian thrusting) while completing a secondary task. Then, we conduct a survey (questionnaire and interviews) to evaluate the attitude about trust, technical competence, situation management and perceived ease of use after participants finished experimental driving. The results demonstrate that synesthetic-based multimodal interaction (SBMI) can more effectively remind people of relevant information especially under ETC. SBMI model is more effective than single information stimulus or non-synesthetic audio-visual information stimulus not only in terms of information transmission efficiency and effect, but also in terms of output response/ action. The results also show that SBMI contributes to the improvement of AVs trust. These findings provide evidence on the importance of SBMI to the improvement of AVs trust. The findings of this study will be helpful to the future design of AVs interaction system.

ID ATTITUDE-CONTROL; IDENTIFICATION; DYNAMICS
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have important applications in several areas such as data collection, geological survey and exploration in underwater environment. The hydrodynamic forces acting on AUVs are highly nonlinear and the higher-order hydrodynamic coefficients should be taken into account to represent these nonlinear behaviors. Therefore, developing a suitable dynamic model of the AUV and also an accurate knowledge about the hydrodynamic parameters are important for proper design of the navigation and control system. The main goal of the present paper is to investigate the role of proper dynamic model for an AUV which includes different hydrodynamic stability derivatives coefficients. Design of proper actuator is also significant for the global performance of the system and the expenses of the plan. It is tried in the present paper to investigate the effect of full hydrodynamic coefficients on the design of actuators and control system performance analysis for an AUV which was ignored in the previous works. For this purpose, the effect of these parameters on the open loop characteristics of the AUV, its role in the control system design and the interaction of control system and actuator dynamics are considered in nonlinear time domain and frequency domain. It is shown that in a full hydrodynamic consideration for design of the AUV, the effect of control gains, system bandwidth and damping can be different in comparison with the cases which are not fully considered them. Finally, the design of optimum actuator and the effect of actuator natural frequency on the flight performance in the presence of full hydrodynamic coefficients are studied.

AB Picking and placing of objects by aerial robots in fields is an important and challenging task for a range of outdoor activities, including industry and rescue operations. General strategies depend on the magnetic force to the pick object; however, this approach lacks both generality and robustness. Therefore, we focus on an articulated structure to grasp bricking. Another issue in performing pick-and-place tasks in fields is autonomous recognition using onboard sensors. In this article, we present a fully autonomous pick-and-place scheme in outdoor environments using articulated aerial robots. First, an articulated robot model with an actively tiltable sensor is developed to guarantee robustness in both state estimation and object detection. Second, object detection methods are designed according to the distance between the robot and target object. Third, a comprehensive motion strategy is developed to perform an autonomous object searching, picking, and placing sequence. In particular, a visual servoing method for robot position control is also proposed in this motion strategy to improve the robustness while approaching the target. Finally, we present the experimental results of autonomous brick picking and placing by our proposed methods in various outdoor environments, including a real robotics challenge, the 2020 Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC 2020). To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first successful attempt at fully autonomous object grasping by an articulated aerial robot in a field.

AB The Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) is a European spacecraft intended to service the International Space Station (ISS). It is designed to perform automated phasing, approach, rendezvous and docking to the ISS, then departure and deorbitation manoeuvres. Such an automated rendezvous mission towards a manned facility raises severe performance and safety constraints for the vehicle, which are declined towards the on-board Navigation in terms of availability, accuracy and failure tolerance: the ATV shall be operational after any first failure and safe conditions shall be reached after a second failure. The whole ATV navigation system has been designed to fulfil these very stringent requirements. Based on fully redundant hardware, the navigation algorithms present optimal estimators and multi-layers Failure, Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) capabilities to ensure the continuity of the state vector in case of failure. Several functions provide state vectors estimations and health reports, according to the flight phase: the attitude and drift estimation function provides the vehicle absolute attitude and angular rate during the whole flight; for the far rendezvous, position and velocity relative to the ISS are estimated by the relative GPS navigation and a dedicated relative navigation with Videometer applies in close rendezvous, in the final approach. All these autonomous navigation functions offer nevertheless a high level of monitoring and control to the ATV Control Centre operators. Thus the ATV innovative navigation chain provides the high level of performance, robustness and autonomy required by modem spacecrafts involved in human programs, today in Earth orbit but also for future space exploration missions.

AB With regard to autonomous driving, on-road projections cannot only be used for communication with the driver but also with other road users. Our study aims to investigate the distraction potential for other road users when on-road projections (e.g., for driver assistance) are used to communicate with the driver of the projecting vehicle. We perform this investigation in a blind study with 38 test persons who are overtaken six times on a constant motorway section by the projection vehicle. The distraction potential is examined with an eye-tracking system, which detects the direction of the subjects' gaze. In addition, the subjects' physiological perception of the headlight projection is recorded with a questionnaire afterward. Several test subjects looked at the projection for less than one second, which is well below the critical threshold for the distraction of 1.6 s. In the interviews, on the other hand, only one of the 38 test persons stated that a projection on the road was recognized. For the examined scenario, it is therefore deduced that on-road projections with the selected symbol shape and brightness do not lead to critical distraction.

AB This article presents a multichannel wireless rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) charging system with compact receivers for improving transmission stability and capacity. The multichannel scheme and associated landing structure are proposed according to the application challenges. It contains multiple null-cross-coupled transmission paths to improve charging capability, and the structure stabilizes the charging. Compact and shielding-free receivers are embedded to avoid affecting the airflow and the weight of the flight. Misalignment-tolerant unipolar coils are designed based on transmission and field characteristics, which cooperate with the scheme for efficient coupling and restrained leakage flux. The output characteristics of the multichannel system are analyzed based on theoretical modeling and simulation. A multichannel output estimation control strategy is implemented, based on the deduced mapping relations and transmitter-side information, to regulate output currents and eliminate circulating currents. It is realized without real-time massive communication or measuring on board, and the parallel channels avoid influences of faulty channels. A multichannel experimental prototype is established and tested to prove the feasibility of the design, which can be applied to rotary-wing UAV autonomous charging flexibly.

AB We report a low-power, bio-inspired mixed-signal 2-D optic flow sensor to realize artificial compound eyes, which can provide a wide field of view (FoV) sensing capability for autonomous navigation of micro-air-vehicles (MAVs). Inspired by insect vision, a 2-D time-stamp algorithm has been developed to scale the number of deployable sensors at low power. The fabricated sensor estimates 16-b 2-D optic flows of maximum 1.96 rad/s with FoV of 60; from the integrated mixed-signal algorithm core, which consumes only 243.3 pJ/pixel or \sim 30\mu \text{W} at 120 fps. In addition, the peripheral circuits for modular design have been integrated on chip to provide optic flow data compression, wide-field integration (WFI), and serial peripheral interface (SPI). More than 25 sensors can be connected in a single SPI bus and transmit the full resolution optic flows. The fabricated prototype sensor supports full resolution 2-D optic flows from an array of 64\times 64 pixels at 120 fps through a 3 MB/s SPI bus (4 wires total).

AB A simultaneous trajectory tracking and stability control method is present for the four-wheel independent drive (4WID) automated vehicles to handle dynamic coupling maneuvers. To conquer the disadvantage that attendant disturbances caused by the dynamic coupling of traditional decentralized control methods degenerate the trajectory tracking accuracy, the proposed method takes advantage of the idea of decoupling to optimize the tracking performance. After establishing the dynamic model of the 4WID automated vehicles, the coupling mechanism of the vehicle dynamic control and its negative effect on trajectory tracking were studied at first. The inverse system model was then determined by machine learning and connected in series with the controlled object to form a pseudo linear system to realize dynamic decoupling. Finally, differing from previous tracking methods following the apparent lateral position and longitudinal velocity references, the pseudo linear system tracks the ideal intermediate targets transferred from the target trajectory, that is, the accelerations of vehicle in longitudinal, lateral and yaw directions, to indirectly achieve trajectory tracking and validly restrain the vehicle motion. The effectiveness of the proposed method, i.e., the high tracking accuracy and the stable driving performance, is verified through three coupling driving scenarios in the CarSim-Simulink co-simulations platform.

AB The interaction with autonomous driving technology has increased in the past few years. Although a few studies have investigated the opinion of people who have physically experienced AVs, the understanding regarding how the experienced users can integrate AV-based services into real life is limited. To address this gap, the present study examines the travel characteristics of autonomous taxi trips and the determinants of continuous use intention. The data used in this study were collected in Guangzhou, China where paid autonomous taxi service have been publicly accessible and operated for one year. The analysis of the autonomous taxi trips revealed that this novel mobility choice has been accepted and extensively used by experienced users. In addition, five market segments were identified according to the supplement and alternative travel mode to autonomous taxi trips. Results indicate a possible mode shift from public transport to autonomous taxis. The role of a safety steward on board was also identified. Findings suggest that takeover action influences the acceptable time for fully autonomous driving and the preference for autonomous taxis. Certain factors-service satisfaction, psychological ownership, and concern for the equality of safety-for autonomous taxi use are considered in this study. On this basis, an extended technology acceptance model is proposed to explain the continuous use intention of autonomous taxis. The maintenance of a positive attitude toward use, which underlines the simplicity and usefulness of autonomous taxis and the improvement of service quality, is essential for experienced users. Furthermore, the approaches that establish psychological ownership and alleviate the concern for the equality of safety can also enhance the continuous use intention. Interestingly, the effect of concern for the equality of safety on continuous use intention is larger when experienced users do not or seldom encounter takeovers. The research contributes to the ongoing research related to the real-life application of AVs, with implications for urban transportation managers, mobility providers, and automobile industry players.

AB Based on the theory of planned behavior, this study identifies the causal relationship between attitudinal factors and intention to use transportation mode. A structural equation model was developed based on twelve hypotheses. The main findings and implications of this study are as follows. First, people who want to express themselves through cars have a high intention to use personal vehicles, and they purchase cars for this purpose. If the shared vehicle service provides a vehicle rental that reflects individual tastes, those who want to own the vehicle will use the shared vehicle. This could be a solution to the parking problem. Second, those who perceive travel as a disutility have a low intention to use public transportation. If fare discounts are applied when transferring public transportation and micro-mobility, it is expected that the use of public transportation will increase due to reduction of access time for public transportation. Third, people who like to drive have a high intention to use personal vehicles and micro-mobility. Providing space for driving cars as a leisure activity may be one of the ways to prevent traffic accidents that may occur in the future due to a mixed flow of autonomous vehicles and conventional vehicles.

AB Nowadays, vehicles are being fitted with systems that improve their maneuverability, stability, and comfort in order to reduce the number of accidents. Improving these aspects is of particular interest thanks to the incorporation of autonomous vehicles onto the roads. The knowledge of vehicle sideslip and roll angles, which are among the main causes of road accidents, is necessary for a proper design of a lateral stability and roll-over controller system. The problem is that these two variables cannot be measured directly through sensors installed in current series production vehicles due to their high costs. For this reason, their estimation is fundamental. In addition, there is a time delay in the relaying of information between the different vehicle systems, such as, sensors, actuators and controllers, among others. This paper presents the design of an H-infinity-based observer that simultaneously estimates both the sideslip angle and the roll angle of a vehicle for a networked control system, with networked transmission delay based on an event-triggered communication scheme combined with neural networks (NN). To deal with the vehicle nonlinearities, NN and linear-parameter-varying techniques are considered alongside uncertainties in parameters. Both simulation and experimental results are carried out to prove the performance of observer design.

AB Recently, many studies have shown that during the transition period of the coexistence of autonomous vehicles (AVs)/connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), a dedicated lane (DL) for AVs/ CAVs can improve traffic throughput and lower collision risk, which has become a hot topic in the field of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). This study presents an integrated simulation platform for DL optimi-zation from cyber-physical-system (CPS) perspective. The developed simulation platform can be used to quali-tatively and quantitatively evaluate the design parameters, operation modes, contingency plan, etc. of DL in a "What You See Is What You Get (Wysiwyg)" style. First, we introduce the architecture and features of the proposed platform, which comprises of SUMO, OMNeT++, and Unity3D. We implemented all experimental scripts for DL optimization in SUMO, including the configuration of the DLs, car-following models, lane-changing models, vehicle departure models, origin-destination demands, and 2D visualization of traffic flow simulation. We used OMNeT++ for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Unity3D is a 3D visualization platform for simulations synchronized with SUMO. Connected with the driving simulator and paired with a virtual reality (VR) helmet, Unity3D can offer a high-fidelity immersive environment for all types of users. We developed a specific communication protocol to achieve data sharing and synchronization of all components of the proposed simulation platform. Second, this paper depicts the functions of the proposed simulation platform in detail, including the modeling of road networks, vehicles, traffic flow, optimal design, and evaluation indicators of DL. Finally, by using the developed simulation platform, we demonstrated and analyzed three cases: (1) without DL vs with DL, (2) inner lane vs outer lane, and (3) without V2I vs with V2I. The experimental results confirm the feasibility of the developed simulation platform, and yield some interesting findings, such as (1) market penetration rates (MPRs) are an important factor in deciding whether to deploy DLs, (2) the number of lane changes when the vehicle enters/leaves the designated lane is the key criterion for determining the placement of the DLs, and (3) the cooperative vehicle-infrastructure system can offer AVs/CAVs with better over-the-horizon perception capabilities, helping to improve the smoothness of traffic flow in the case of abnormal events. The developed simulation platform is expected to offer a new tool for optimal design and evaluation of DLs for AVs/CAvs.

ID MODEL
AB This paper studies the cooperative control problem of a mixed vehicle platoon, which is composed of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) in an arbitrary order. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based distributed model predictive control (DMPC) algorithm is proposed for CAVs to lead the mixed vehicle platoon travelling in a string with anticipated inter-vehicle spacing and a desired velocity. First, the mixed vehicle platoon is divided into multiple interrelated sub-platoons with any two adjacent sub-platoons having a common CAV, and then a generic model is constructed for each sub-platoon based on the intelligent driver model for HDV and the kinematic model for CAV, respectively. Second, a local MPC controller is designed for each sub-platoon to optimize the control inputs of CAVs with the objective of minimizing the position and velocity errors of all vehicles in the sub-platoon, and then the ADMM is utilized to obtain the global optimal solution among local MPC controllers of all sub-platoons. Finally, numerical simulations and experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed DMPC algorithm, the results of which reveal that it can reduce the computation cost significantly and ensure the control performance comparable to the centralized MPC algorithm.

AB A vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a collection of mobile vehicles that aids roadside communication through vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure operation modes. The network is autonomous and, hence, requires a wide range of security measures to protect its communications from attack. Recent studies on VANET security have focused on resolving the issues due to computation and distribution density of the vehicles. Probability distribution measures have been administered for detecting collision attacks, which increases the computational complexity. In this paper, a trust-based distributed authentication (TDA) method that relies on a global trust server and vehicle behavior for avoiding collision attacks is proposed. This method ensures both inter-vehicular and intra-vehicular communication security in the network. In addition, a channel state routing protocol (CSRP) is proposed to improve the communication reliability among the vehicles. Reliable vehicles are identified according to the on-board unit (OBU) energy and the channel state of the vehicle to deliver seamless communication. The biased methods are assimilated to improve the communication reliability by avoiding collision attacks and improving secured packets flow in VANETs. In particular, the CSRP minimizes the energy exploitation of OBUs and time delay. TDA improves the security of the network by improving the collision recognition rate and the broadcast rate.

AB Research of car-following behavior is very important to alleviate traffic congestion and ensure traffic safety. To describe the car-following behavior of connected vehicles and restore the real driving environment, this paper presents an improved car-following model for connected vehicles by considering driver characteristic and speed information of multiple vehicles, which reflects the interaction between adjacent connected vehicles and the influence of driver characteristic on the stability of car-following. The linear stability analysis and nonlinear stability analysis prove that the improved model is effective and can promote the stability of traffic flow more than other models. In addition, the numerical simulations show that the new model performs better in eliminating disturbances than other models. Finally, the parameters of proposed model are calibrated based on NGSIM data. The results show that the new model performs well in car-following process, keeping a safe distance from the leader vehicle without sudden acceleration and deceleration. The new model also can predict the acceleration behavior of the leader vehicle after emergency brake. In summary, the model proposed in this paper can be used as active safety technology to prevent collision accidents, or as a user-defined function or model in the traffic simulation software, or as car-following strategy in driverless algorithms.

AB Getting a land vehicle's accurate position, azimuth and attitude rapidly is significant for vehicle based weapons' combat effectiveness. In this paper, a new approach to acquire vehicle's accurate position and orientation is proposed. It uses biaxial optical detection platform (BODP) to aim at and lock in no less than three pre-set cooperative targets, whose accurate positions are measured beforehand. Then, it calculates the vehicle's accurate position, azimuth and attitudes by the rough position and orientation provided by vehicle based navigation systems and no less than three couples of azimuth and pitch angles measured by BODP. The proposed approach does not depend on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), thus it is autonomous and difficult to interfere. Meanwhile, it only needs a rough position and orientation as algorithm's iterative initial value, consequently, it does not have high performance requirement for Inertial Navigation System (INS), odometer and other vehicle based navigation systems, even in high precise applications. This paper described the system's working procedure, presented theoretical deviation of the algorithm, and then verified its effectiveness through simulation and vehicle experiments. The simulation and experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can achieve positioning and orientation accuracy of 0.2 m and 20 respectively in less than 3 min.

AB The perception of vibration sources can be used to detect, classify, locate, and track autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), which is of great importance for ocean scientific research and naval applications. The artificial lateral lines system (ALLS) is a promising technique to sense underwater vibration sources. However, most current ALLS research focuses on perception mechanism and biomimetic sensor design. The design of a systematic ALLS that is ready for practical applications is still an unsolved pmblem. To this end, a novel biomimetic sensor system is proposed in this work for the purpose of developing a practical ALLS for AUVs. In order to determine the distribution of the developed biomimetic sensors in the AUVs, hydromechanics modelling and simulation of the artificial lateral lines were implemented to investigate the pressure response mechanisms of the AUVs in terms of the position, frequency and amplitude of the vibration source(s). Subsequently, an experimental AUV was equipped with biomimetic sensors to evaluate the performance of the vibration source perception. Experimental tests were conducted to analyze the relationship between the measured AUV pressure and the distance, frequency and amplitude of the vibration source. Analysis results demonstrate that the experimental measurements were consistent with simulation results. Based on the relationship between the sensor measurements and the vibration source, a neural network model was used to identify the coordinates, frequency and amplitude of the vibration source, producing an identification accuracy of 93%. Hence, the proposed ALLS is effective for vibration source perception of AUVs.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have gained enormous popularity over the years and are employed extensively in various industries, including bio-research, subsea industries, and military applications. Most of the available commercial AUVs are very expensive and complex. This makes it unsuitable to be used for civilian applications. On the other hand, recent technological advance-ments have made it possible to have highly capable sensors at acceptable prices as an alternative to expensive commercial vehicles. In this paper, an embedded system-based multi-sensor hardware architecture for an H-configured AUV, called H-AUV, is designed and developed with low-cost, power-efficient, real-time con-trollers with a small footprint for data acquisition and sensors. These parameters play an important role for designing and developing energy-efficient autonomous vehicles. Significantly, auto navigation is a very important mechanism for AUVs, which includes auto heading control and depth keeping control techniques devel-oped, deployed, and tested in the H-AUV. Additionally, the denoise filters such as moving average, exponential, and dynamic linear Kalman filter (KF) have been ex-ercised and validated for heading and depth control of an H-AUV. It was found that the dynamic KF is very efficient and performs with 88% accuracy in the head-ing and depth control mechanisms. The KF is also found to perform with 98% accuracy for surface navigation of the H-AUV. Finally, an indigenous graphical user interface has been developed for data telemetry, command, and logging in autonomous and manual modes through wired and wireless communication. The proposed development and validation of an efficient and low-cost H-AUV shall support academic researchers for subsea applications.

AB Small-object detection and avoidance in unknown environments is a significant challenge to overcome for small autonomous vehicles that are generally highly agile and restricted in payload and computational processing power. Typical machine-vision and range measurement-based solutions suffer either from restricted fields-of-view or significant computational complexity and are, hence, not easily portable to small platforms. In order to overcome these drawbacks, in this paper, two novel bioinspired approaches are proposed to extract information about small-field objects contained in planar optic flow. The first approach, which is analogous to the small-field extraction process hypothesized to occur in the lobula plate of the fly visual system, is based on the Fourier residual analysis of instantaneous optic flow. Alternatively, the flow-of-flow method is the engineering analogue of the small-field extraction process thought to occur in the fruit-fly's medulla, and extracts high-frequency content of optic flow by means of an elementary motion detector array. Both approaches extract instantaneous relative range and bearing of small-field obstacles from planar optic flow in a local environment characterized by small and wide-field obstacles, which is then combined with an artificial potential function-based low-order steering control law. The proposed sensing and control scheme is experimentally validated with a quadrotor vehicle that is able to effectively navigate an unknown environment laden with small-field clutter. This bioinspired approach is computationally efficient, which renders extraction of vehicle velocity and local environment structure superfluous, and thus, serves as a robust, reflexive solution to the problem of small-object detection, and avoidance for small autonomous robots.

AB A hierarchically improved fuzzy dynamical sliding-model control (HIFDSMC) is presented to address the autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) path tracking problem. The proposed controller has two portions: one is the virtual desired input (VDI), and the second is the path tracking control (PTC). In addition to the equivalent control in VDI and PTC, an improved fuzzy dynamical sliding-mode control (IFDSMC) is designed to deal with the system uncertainties, e.g., different payloads. Contributions of this paper include the following four parts: 1) Based on the nominal system response, the fuzzy rules and scaling factors of the IFDSMCs in the VDI and PTC are easily chosen. In contrast, a conventional fuzzy logic control approach requires more trial-and-error tuning to obtain a satisfactory performance. 2) The proposed HIFDSMC possesses the tuning mechanism (the coefficients of two sliding surfaces, the scaling factors in indirect and direct modes, and the fine tuning in fuzzy table) such that the uncertainties are tackled without a larger computational burden. 3) The stability of the closed-loop system is verified by the Lyapunov stability with hierarchical concept. 4) Different payloads not at the mass center of the AGV (e.g., greater than 25% in the total weight of the AGV) are tackled by the IFDSMCs to obtain a satisfactory performance. Finally, the application to the assembly line of the AGV with different payloads to track the circular and piecewise straight-line paths by the proposed HIFDSMC is compared with the hierarchical fuzzy decentralized PTC.

AB With the development of communication and automation technologies, the great energy-saving potential of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) has gradually been highlighted. By means of interactions with surrounding vehicles and infrastructure, CAVs can automatically plan ecological driving behaviours to significantly reduce energy consumption, which is normally defined as eco-driving. Currently, eco-driving is recognised as an effective method to improve the energy economy of individual CAVs and promote the overall energy economy of transportation without requiring significant hardware investment. After reviewing the scattered eco-driving literature, this study systematically summarizes the state-of-the-art in this field for promoting its future development. The basic principles of eco-driving and energy management systems are firstly discussed to figure out the relationship between eco-driving and powertrain control. Then, related eco-driving studies are classified into three categories according to their applications in terms of single-vehicle scenario, car-following operation, and multi-vehicle co-operation. The key characteristics of various eco-driving studies are in-depth addressed, and the energy-saving potential for cooperative eco-driving is emphasized. Finally, the potential development trends are provided, thereby contributing to the development of eco-driving techniques.

AB Prospective customers are becoming more concerned about safety and comfort as the automobile industry swings toward automated vehicles (AVs). A comprehensive evaluation of recent AVs collision data indicates that modern automated driving systems are prone to rear-end collisions, usually leading to multiple-vehicle collisions. Moreover, most investigations into severe traffic conditions are confined to single-vehicle collisions. This work reviewed diverse techniques of existing literature to provide planning procedures for multiple vehicle cooperation and collision avoidance (MVCCA) strategies in AVs while also considering their performance and social impact viewpoints. Firstly, we investigate and tabulate the existing MVCCA techniques associated with single-vehicle collision avoidance perspectives. Then, current achievements are extensively evaluated, challenges and flows are identified, and remedies are intelligently formed to exploit a taxonomy. This paper also aims to give readers an AI-enabled conceptual framework and a decision-making model with a concrete structure of the training network settings to bridge the gaps between current investigations. These findings are intended to shed insight into the benefits of the greater efficiency of AVs set-up for academics and policymakers. Lastly, the open research issues discussed in this survey will pave the way for the actual implementation of driverless automated traffic systems.

AB This study compares the regulation of two emerging technologies, the CRISPR genome-editing system and Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) in the United States. The study draws on 33 in-depth interviews with innovation and governance experts to study the relationship between their regulatory environments and developing beliefs about these technologies. Using sociotechnical imaginaries as a framework, we explore how social actors envision technologically driven futures and the social order that enables them. These imaginaries are essential to emerging technologies, where experts build a framework of potentialities for innovation still underway. While scholarship has documented how sociotechnical imaginaries arise among policymakers, groups of scientists, state and local stakeholders, and public actors in different countries, less has been said about how regulatory organizations and their actors shape expectations around technologies that are in the early and middle stages of development. This article finds that regulatory institutions shape emerging imaginaries along three related axes: the distribution of authority, technological novelty, and risk. Interviewees negotiate these three contingencies differently based on relevant extant regulatory structures and ideologies, resulting in distinct imaginaries around each technology. CRISPR actors envision genome editing as largely diminishing biomedical harm and eventually suitable for health markets, while CAV actors diverge on whether self-driving cars alleviate or exacerbate risk and how they may enter roads. That organizational structures and practices of regulation inform broadly held sociotechnical imaginaries bears significance for studies of innovation trajectories, suggesting regulators can take an active role in shaping how risks and benefits of emerging technology are defined.

While previous research has emphasized specific features and qualities of AVs, little is known about how attitudinal factors shape AV acceptance across a range of AV "modes" from privately-owned AVs to AV taxis shared with strangers. With an online panel of 834 US-based participants, we examine attitudes towards AVs and sharing. An exploratory factor analysis establishes four attitudinal dimensions: technology acceptance, risk-taking, traffic regulation, and driving enjoyment. We estimate multinomial logistic regression models to examine the impact of these four factors on attitudes toward AVs, willingness to purchase AVs, willingness to use AVs as a taxi service, and willingness to share AV taxis with strangers. We find a complex relationship between psychological factors and AV attitudes. "Early adopters" of technology and those who support stricter traffic regulations are more likely to have a positive attitude about AVs, whereas those who avoid risky behavior were more likely to have a negative attitude instead of a neutral attitude. Similar patterns were found across models of purchasing, using, and sharing AVs. The results imply that people who support traffic regulations may perceive AVs as a safer transport mode than human-driven cars, while those who avoid risk-taking behavior may perceive AVs to be more dangerous. However, we find that a large fraction of the population is not yet ready to use an AV with no driver, and overall reluctance to share a ride in an AV taxi. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Autonomous air combat has received significant attention from researchers working on artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Most previous research on autonomous air combat has focused on one-on-one air combat scenarios in which air combat situational information is considered to be precisely observable. However, most modern air combats are conducted in formations, where air combat situational information is obtained from multiple sensors. Therefore, we introduce a novel automated maneuver decision architecture for close-range multiaircraft air combat scenarios under the multisensor unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) platform that can handle air combat scenarios with variable-sized formations. Then, a multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm is proposed to obtain the strategy. The training performance of the training algorithm is evaluated, the obtained strategy is analyzed in different air combat scenarios, and it is found that these formations exhibit effective cooperative behavior in symmetric and asymmetric situations. Finally, we give ideas for the engineering implementation of a maneuver control architecture. This study provides a solution for future multiaircraft autonomous air combat.

   VISION
AB Advances in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, offer unprecedented opportunities to boost a wide array of large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Nevertheless, UAV platforms still face important limitations mainly related to autonomy and weight that impact their remote sensing capabilities when capturing and processing the data required for developing autonomous and robust real-time obstacle detection and avoidance systems. In this regard, Deep Learning (DL) techniques have arisen as a promising alternative for improving real-time obstacle detection and collision avoidance for highly autonomous UAVs. This article reviews the most recent developments on DL Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) and provides a detailed explanation on the main DL techniques. Moreover, the latest DL-UAV communication architectures are studied and their most common hardware is analyzed. Furthermore, this article enumerates the most relevant open challenges for current DL-UAV solutions, thus allowing future researchers to define a roadmap for devising the new generation affordable autonomous DL-UAV IoT solutions.

AB With the increasing need to reduce time and cost of vehicle development there is increasing advantage in simulating mathematically the dynamic interaction of a vehicle and its occupant. The larger design space arising from the introduction of automated vehicles further increases the potential advantage. The aim of the paper is to outline the role of the internal model hypothesis in understanding and modelling occupant-vehicle dynamics, specifically the dynamics associated with direction and speed control of the vehicle. The internal model is the driver's or passenger's understanding of the vehicle dynamics and is thought to be employed in the perception, cognition and action processes of the brain. The internal model aids the estimation of the states of the vehicle from noisy sensory measurements. It can also be used to optimise cognitive control action by predicting the consequence of the action; thus model predictive control (MPC) theory provides a foundation for modelling the cognition process. The stretch reflex of the neuromuscular system also makes use of the prediction of the internal model. Extensions to the MPC approach are described which account for: interaction with an automated vehicle; robust control; intermittent control; and cognitive workload. Further work to extend understanding of occupant-vehicle dynamic interaction is outlined. This paper is based on a keynote presentation given by the author to the 13th International Symposium on Advanced Vehicle Control (AVEC) conference held in Munich, September 2016.

TI A Queuing Model for Mixed Traffic Flows on Highways considering
   Fluctuations in Traffic Demand
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; STABILITY
AB Modelling the mixed traffic flows of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs) on highways is challenging. Randomness, fluctuations, and congestion exist in the mixed traffic flows. This paper extends the current literature by proposing an M/G(n)/c/c state-dependent queuing model operating in a random environment. The fluctuating traffic demand is addressed by arrival rates modulated by the random environment. Meanwhile, a Markovian arrival process (MAP) is incorporated to describe the platoons. We investigate the performance of the mixed traffic flow under the I policy (AVs and HVs travel together in all lanes) and the D policy (one lane is designated to AVs). Numerical experiments reveal the following interesting findings: (1) the fluctuation degree of traffic demand, the traffic intensity, and the penetration rate of AVs play essential roles in determining the performance of mixed traffic flows. (2) The I policy should always be adopted if the travel time is more valuable. In terms of output rate, the choice between the I and the D policies depends on the traffic intensity, SCV of arrival rates and penetration rate. (3) A larger penetration rate is required to completely eliminate congestion on a longer highway segment.

AB This paper is concerned with the target tracking problem of an autonomous surface vehicle in the presence of a maneuvering target. The velocity information of target is totally unknown to the follower vehicle, and only the relative distance and angle between the target and follower are obtained. First, a reduced-order extended state observer is used to estimate the unknown relative dynamics due to the unavailable velocity of the target. Based on the reduced-order extended state observer, an antidisturbance guidance law for target tracking is designed. The input-to-state stability of the closed-loop target tracking guidance system is analyzed via cascade theory. Furthermore, the above result is extended to the case that collisions between the target and leader are avoided during tracking, and a collision-free target tracking guidance law is developed. The main feature of the proposed guidance law is twofold. First, the target tracking can be achieved without using the velocity information of the target. Second, collision avoidance can be achieved during target tracking. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed antidisturbance guidance law for tracking a maneuvering target with the arbitrary bounded velocity.

AB An Antilock Braking System (ABS) is one of the most important safety facilities equipped in modern vehicles. A self-test is therefore embedded into its ECU to identify any electronic malfunction. However there is no effective method to predict or check its mechanical conditions routinely to ensure its functionality. Because the ABS system is merely actuated above a particular speed in emergency stops, the current brake test facilities are not adequate for ABS test. Because of the dangers involved it would not be acceptable to use a public road to implement such a practice for fault detection so an alternative means must be sought. To provide a safe and convenient solution this paper proposes a novel method to predict ABS faults whilst the vehicle is stationary. In this situation a model-based approach is applied to predict various faults from the ABS, especially from its hydraulic subsystem. As such, a mathematic model is developed to describe the operating processes of ABS including possible faulty conditions. An autonomous control strategy is also designed to actuate the control module independently without the knowledge of the control algorithms embedded in an ABS control module. This approach is evaluated through a Simulink simulation.

ID AUTOMATED VEHICLES; BEHAVIOR; DESIGN
AB The advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has the potential to drastically change society and the way we understand, plan and design cities and regions, just as automobiles did a century ago. In the current context of climate change, sustainable urban environments based on active mobility (walking and cycling), urban proximity and green spaces, are increasingly in demand, leading to the emergence of new interventions and urban models. Although these trends may be affected by the arrival of AVs, most decision-makers and planners still do not address these issues in their current planning. This is because of the confusion associated with the diversity of impacts of AVs, but also by the lack of design recommendations and planning tools. To shed light on these aspects, this paper reviews the relationship between mobility and urban public space, the impacts of AVs on urban space and design proposals and strategies aimed at configuring driverless cities, with special focus on street design. The results of the review show that the implementation of AVs can be a great opportunity to liberate urban space and reclaim it for people, in line with new urban models such as the superblocks (Barcelona), the 15-minute city (Paris), or tactical urbanism interventions against COVID-19. However, it may also entail risks such as a reduction in active mobility or public transport use. The magnitude and direction of these impacts will depend on crucial decisions that need to be taken now, such as encouraging shared used over ownership, and establishing citizen-centred urban planning and design objectives and strategies to make AV deployment the most beneficial for all.

TI Requirements for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for scientific

DE Autonomous Underwater Vehicles; Mobile sensor network; Stakeholders
AB Using mobile environmental monitoring can aid in gathering ecological data to meet fish community goals in the Great Lakes. One such approach is the use of large Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to gather data, or the potential use of AUV swarms, where multiple small AUVs work together with each having different data-gathering capabilities. To understand data needs that could be collected by mobile sensor networks to inform decision making, we surveyed Great Lakes professionals involved directly and indirectly in such decision making. Basic data that respondents chose as most important to collect were water temperature, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, turbidity, and blue-green "algae", which seems to align with variables affecting fish directly or indirectly (through identification of harmful algal blooms). Specialized data chosen as most important were mapping of habitat characteristics, sonar of groupings of fish, and images/video. The time of year to collect all data was chosen as all seasons by the majority of respondents, the frequency most chosen was once a season for mapping of habitat characteristics, once a week for sonar detection of groupings of fish, and once per day for images/video and water temperature. Results were very similar when respondents were asked where data should be collected in the Great Lakes (i.e., tributaries, nearshore areas, etc.) except respondents indicated that images/video should be collected most in fish spawning habitats. Understanding data important to inform decisions of resource professionals will help guide the design of mobile and stationary sensor networks in the Great Lakes.

   Simplex method; Function optimization; Path planning; Autonomous

AB The water wave optimization (WWO) algorithm is inspired by shallow water wave theory and mainly simulates propagation, refraction and breaking to obtain the global optimal solution in the search space. Due to its premature convergence and low optimization efficiency, the basic WWO has a slow convergence speed and low calculation accuracy. To improve the overall optimization performance of the basic WWO, an enhanced WWO based on the elite opposition-based learning strategy and the simplex method (ESWWO) is proposed to solve the function optimization problem and path planning problem for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The elite opposition-based learning strategy increases the diversity of the population and enhances the global search ability to avoid falling into the local optimum. The simplex method has a fast search speed and strong local search ability to obtain a very accurate solution. The ESWWO algorithm can not only achieve complementary advantages to improve the optimization efficiency of the basic WWO but can also balance exploration and exploitation to obtain the global optimal solution. For the function optimization problem, the ESWWO has strong stability and robustness, and the fitness values of the ESWWO are better than those of other algorithms. For the AUV path planning problem, the ESWWO can avoid threat areas with a minimum fuel cost to obtain the optimal path. The experimental results show that the overall optimization performance of the ESWWO algorithm is superior to that of other algorithms, and thus, ESWWO is an effective and feasible method for solving the function optimization problem and AUV path planning problem.

AB This article presents a novel thruster fault degree identification method for autonomous underwater vehicle. The novel method is developed from the fuzzy support vector domain description method, which establishes a fault identification model first, and then estimates fault degree according to the model. When establishing fault identification model for thruster based on fuzzy support vector domain description method, it is found that the relative fitting error of the model to the actual fault degree is large, making the model accuracy poor. To reduce the relative fitting error, a homomorphic membership function method is proposed. Different from fuzzy support vector domain description method, which calculates the fuzzy membership degree of fault sample in time domain, the proposed method calculates the fuzzy membership degree in log domain. On estimating thruster fault degree by fuzzy support vector domain description method, it is obtained that the estimated fault degree lags behind the actual fault degree. To shorten the lag time, a low frequency trend prediction method is proposed. Different from fuzzy support vector domain description method, which brings the fault feature extracted from the current surge speed and control voltage into the fault identification model to calculate fault degree, the proposed method firstly forward predicts surge speed and control voltage, and then takes the fault feature extracted from the predicted surge speed and control voltage into the model to acquire fault degree. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified by pool experiments of the experimental prototype.

AB This article explores the challenges and solutions of using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to observe internal waves in the ocean. Internal waves are highly dynamic and complex, and their rapid spatial and temporal variability makes it difficult to accurately observe them using AUVs due to Doppler smearing and aliasing effects. To overcome these challenges, the article proposes a Sparse Approximation (SA) method that reconstructs the sectional field of internal tides using AUV sampling data on horizontal-reciprocating vertical-dimension sawtooth (i.e., yo-yo) trajectories. The SA method is validated by numerical simulations in a temperature field of internal tides, and a series of reconstructions comparing the SA and linear interpolation method are conducted. The results show that the SA method produces accurate results if the signal frequency of the field is less than the Nyquist frequency of the water column sampling near the horizontal sides of the section. Notably, it reveals that the Doppler smearing and aliasing effects in the SA reconstructions can be effectively suppressed in the vertical isotherm fluctuation frequency range which is less than the Nyquist frequency of the water column sampling near the horizontal sides of the section. Additionally, the article evaluates the robustness of the SA method under different conditions, including AUV sampling behaviors, temperature field variation, AUV sensing and navigation errors. The findings demonstrate that the SA reconstruction method can be effectively used to observe internal tides with AUVs, and provide a design principle for an AUV reciprocating yo-yo sampling trajectory to achieve feasible field reconstruction of internal tides.

AB In the recent years, visual navigation has been considered an effective mechanism for achieving an autonomous landing of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Nevertheless, with the limitations of visual cameras, the effectiveness of visual algorithms is significantly limited by lighting conditions. Therefore, a novel vision-based autonomous landing navigation scheme is proposed for night-time autonomous landing of fixed-wing UAV. Firstly, due to the difficulty of detecting the runway caused by the low-light image, a strategy of visible and infrared image fusion is adopted. The objective functions of the fused and visible image, and the fused and infrared image, are established. Then, the fusion problem is transformed into the optimal situation of the objective function, and the optimal solution is realized by gradient descent schemes to obtain the fused image. Secondly, to improve the performance of detecting the runway from the enhanced image, a runway detection algorithm based on an improved Faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) is proposed. The runway ground-truth box of the dataset is statistically analyzed, and the size and number of anchors in line with the runway detection background are redesigned based on the analysis results. Finally, a relative attitude and position estimation method for the UAV with respect to the landing runway is proposed. New coordinate reference systems are established, six landing parameters, such as three attitude and three positions, are further calculated by Orthogonal Iteration (OI). Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm can achieve 1.85% improvement of AP on runway detection, and the reprojection error of rotation and translation for pose estimation are 0.675 degrees and 0.581%, respectively.

AB Given the impending introduction of self-driving cars to Japan within the next several years, gaining a better understanding of public opinion and risk perception of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is crucial. Though AVs have numerous potential social and economic benefits, including reduced travel time and environmental impacts, their implementation will depend on public acceptance. This study expanded on existing work by directly examining which aspects of AV use and function most affect risk perception. Participants were shown short animated video clips depicting the introduction of AVs into society at large, as well as three specific possible risk factors: system error, external interference with car controls (i.e., hacking), and the inability of the car to cope with unexpected events. Participants were then surveyed about their attitudes toward AVs and other potentially risky activities and technologies. The study established that the perceived advantages of all AV types (cars and buses, different automation levels) outweighed their perceived risks. Consistent with prior research, the two major aspects of perceived risk were dread and unfamiliarity. The results showed compared with other technologies, AV scores were neutral for dread risk but higher for unfamiliarity risk. The finding of high unfamiliarity indicates that public acceptance and perceived risks are likely to change as the public's knowledge increases. We also found that receiving information about a potential system error indirectly reduced AV acceptability, where dread and unfamiliarity to the AV risks served as mediators. The results suggest that proper management on the diffusion of information, which includes public information campaigns, test-ride events and transparency about safety options, will likely influence the ultimate social acceptability of AVs and will be crucial towards its successful introduction on the market.

AB Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications is an important technology in vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) to support autonomous data exchange among vehicles. Multiple V2V communications modes have been investigated for VANET, including dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) based on IEEE 802.11p and LTE-V2X, which are suitable for different packet transmission cases. In order to fully exploit the strengths of various modes, hybrid V2V communications strategies are designed in this paper, where each vehicle is allowed to choose different modes for different kinds of transmissions in separate frequency bands for transmission throughput improvement. Furthermore, since it is usually impractical to decide all the vehicles' communications strategies globally due to high computational complexity and heavy overhead to broadcast the decisions, we model the selection of hybrid V2V communications strategies for vehicles as an evolutionary game. A strategy selection algorithm is then proposed, where each vehicle can select its hybrid V2V communications strategy locally based on its evaluation of the payoffs for different strategies and limited signalling from the base station. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can converge to an asymptotic stable state, which can improve the transmission throughput of vehicles, and is robust to the slight evaluation errors of payoffs and the strategy mutations of a few vehicles.

AB Safety assessment is an active research subject for autonomous vehicles (AVs) that have emerged as a new mode of mobility. In particular, scenario-based safety assessments have garnered significant attention. AVs can be tested on how they safely avoid hypothetical situations leading to accidents. However, scenarios written by humans based on their expert knowledge and experience may only partially reflect real-world situations. Instead, we are keen on a different technique of extracting statistically significant and more detailed scenarios from sensor data captured during the critical moments when AVs become vulnerable to potential accidents. Specifically, we first render the three-dimensional space around an AV with fixed-sized voxels. Then, we modeled the aggregate kinetics of the objects in each voxel detected by 3D-LiDAR sensors mounted on real test AVs. The Vision Transformer we used to model the kinetics helped us quickly pinpoint critical voxels containing objects that threatened the AV's safety. We traced the trajectory of the critical voxels on a visual attention map to describe in detail how AVs become vulnerable to accidents according to the logical scenario format defined by the PEGASUS Project. We tested our novel method with 250 h of 3D-LiDAR recordings capturing critical moments. We devised an inference model that detected critical situations with an F1-score of 98.26%. For each type of scenario, our model consistently identified the critical objects and their tendency to influence AVs. Given the evaluation results, we can ensure that our data-driven approach yields an AV safety assessment scenario with high representativeness, coverage, expansion, and computational feasibility.

AB Visual positioning is very significant for underwater robot autonomous manipulation. However, visual positioning feedbacks are often ineffective with unstable and discontinuous matching information during small target capture in underwater environment. Therefore, the low-cost sea organism object positioning process should be applied with self-navigation and matching system in order to guide the underwater vehicle manipulator systems (UVMS) manipulation control. In order to improve the matching robustness and accuracy, this study established the underwater refraction and intrinsic and extrinsic parameter optimization model accurate calibration, and designed an improved oriented features from accelerated segment test (FAST) and rotated binary robust independent elementary feature (ORB) feature matching method, with adaptive threshold to extract FAST feature points and nonmaximum suppress to remove feature point blocks in the feature extraction stage. Moreover, the comparison of three-pixel blocks norm values is proposed in the feature point description stage to improve the robustness of the descriptor. This article has proposed a novel tightly coupled binocular vision-Doppler velocity log (DVL) fusion positioning feedback optimization algorithm with multistate constraint invariant extended Kalman filter to improve accurate real-time measurement for the capture of sea organism with limited features. Systematic tank and oceanic experiments have been performed to prove and analyze the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the algorithm can provide reliable positioning information in tank and complex seabed environment, which is effective for the underwater robot to realize accurate capture of marine organisms.

AB In this paper we develop a continuous-time stochastic dynamic model for the optimal parking management of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in the presence of multiple parking lots within a given area. Inspired by the well-known Lotka-Volterra equations, a mathematical model is developed to explicitly incorporate the interactions among those parking garages under consideration. Time-dependent parking space availability is considered as the system state, while the dynamic price of parking is naturally used as the control input which can be properly chosen by the parking garage operators from the admissible set. By regulating parking rates, the total demand for parking can be distributed among the set of parking lots under question. Further, we formulate an optimal control problem (called Bolza problem) with the objective of maintaining the availability (managing the demand) of each parking garage at a desired level, which could potentially reduce traffic congestion as well as fuel consumption of CAVs. Based on the necessary conditions of optimality given by Pontryagin's minimum principle (PMP), we develop a computational algorithm to address the nonlinear optimization problem and formally prove its convergence. A series of Monte Carlo simulations is conducted under various scenarios and the corresponding optimization problems are solved determining the optimal pricing policy for each parking lot. Since the stochastic dynamic model is general and the control inputs, i.e., parking rates, are easy to implement, it is believed that the procedures presented here will shed light on the parking management of CAVs in the near future.

AB Unmanned vehicles (UVs) play a key role in autonomous surveillance scenarios. A major task needed by these UVs in undertaking autonomous patrol missions is to detect the targets and find their locations in real-time. In this paper, a new vision-based target detection and localization system is presented to make use of different capabilities of UVs as a cooperative team. The scenario considered in this paper is a team of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and multiple unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) tracking and controlling crowds on a border area. A customized motion detection algorithm is applied to follow the crowd from the moving camera mounted on the UAV. Due to UAVs lower resolution and broader detection range, UGVs with higher resolution and fidelity are used as the individual human detectors, as well as moving landmarks to localize the detected crowds with unknown independently moving patterns at each time point. The UAVs localization algorithm, proposed in this paper, then converts the crowds' image locations into their real-world positions, using perspective transformation. A rule-of-thumb localization method by a UGV is also presented, which estimates the geographic locations of the detected individuals. Moreover, an agent-based simulation model is developed for system verification, with different parameters, such as flight altitude, number of landmarks, and landmark assignment method. The performance measure considered in this paper is the average Euclidean distance between the estimated locations and simulated geographic waypoints of the crowd. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for autonomous surveillance by UVs.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are predicted to change transportation; however, it is still difficult to maintain robust situation awareness in a variety of driving situations. To enhance AV perception, methods to integrate sensor data from the camera, radar, and LiDAR sensors have been proposed. However, due to rigidity in their fusion implementations, current techniques are not sufficiently robust in challenging driving scenarios (such as inclement weather, poor light, and sensor obstruction). These techniques can be divided into two main groups: (i) early fusion, which is ineffective when sensor data are distorted or noisy, and (ii) late fusion, which is unable to take advantage of characteristics from numerous sensors and hence yields sub-optimal estimates. In this paper, we suggest a flexible selective sensor fusion framework that learns to recognize the present driving environment and fuses the optimum sensor combinations to enhance robustness without sacrificing efficiency to overcome the above-mentioned limitations. The proposed framework dynamically simulates early fusion, late fusion, and mixtures of both, allowing for a quick decision on the best fusion approach. The framework includes versatile modules for pre-processing heterogeneous data such as numeric, alphanumeric, image, and audio data, selecting appropriate features, and efficiently fusing the selected features. Further, versatile object detection and classification models are proposed to detect and categorize objects accurately. Advanced ensembling, gating, and filtering techniques are introduced to select the optimal object detection and classification model. Further, innovative methodologies are proposed to create an accurate context and decision rules. Widely used datasets like KITTI, nuScenes, and RADIATE are used in experimental analysis to evaluate the proposed models. The proposed model performed well in both data-level and decision-level fusion activities and also outperformed other fusion models in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

AB Digital transformation can help to make better use of existing transportation networks that are congested. One solution to the road congestion problem is real-time traffic management, which focuses on enhancing traffic flow conditions. The advantages of real-time traffic management systems have developed significantly as a result of connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) innovations. CAVs can act as enforcers for managing the traffic. This study aims to propose a novel rough numbers-based extended Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique (MACBETH) method for prioritizing real-time traffic management systems. Furthermore, a new approach for defining rough numbers is proposed, based on an improved methodology for defining rough numbers' lower and upper limits. This allows consideration of mutual relations between a set of objects and flexible representation of rough boundary interval depending on the dynamic environmental conditions. In this study, three main alternatives are defined for real-time traffic management systems: real-time traffic management, real-time traffic management integrated with CAVs, and real-time traffic management by using CAVs. For these alternatives, 5 main criteria and 18 sub-criteria are defined and then prioritized using the fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach. The proposed method's performance is validated through scenario analysis. The findings demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and applicable to real-world conditions. According to the study's findings, real-time traffic management with CAVs is the most advantageous alternative, while real-time traffic management integrated with CAVs is the least advantageous

AB This paper focuses on the design of an adaptive second-order fast nonsingular terminal sliding mode control (ASOFNTSMC) scheme for the trajectory tracking of fully actuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and time-varying external disturbances. First, a second-order fast nonsingular terminal sliding mode (SOFNTSM) manifold is designed to achieve a faster convergence rate than the existing second-order nonsingular terminal sliding mode (SONTSM) manifold. Then, by using this SOFNTSM manifold, an ASOFNTSMC scheme is developed for the fully actuated AUVs to track the desired trajectory. The designed SOFNTSM manifold yields local exponential convergence of the position and attitude tracking errors to zero, and the developed ASOFNTSMC scheme ensures that the error trajectories always move toward the SOFNTSM manifold and once they hit the manifold, remain on it in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and time-varying external disturbances. By deriving the expression of the bounding function of the system uncertainty and using adaptive technique to estimate the unknown parameters of the system uncertainty bounds, the ASOFNTSMC scheme does not require the prior knowledge of the upper bound of the system uncertainty. Meanwhile, through involving the discontinuous sign function into the time derivative of the control input, the ASOFNTSMC scheme eliminates the chattering without reducing the tracking precision. Compared with the existing adaptive SONTSM control (ASONTSMC) scheme, the proposed ASOFNTSMC scheme offers a faster convergence rate for the trajectory tracking control of fully actuated AUVs. Two comparative simulation cases performed respectively on two fully actuated AUVs demonstrate the superiority of the ASOFNTSMC scheme over the ASONTSMC scheme.

AB The trajectory tracking control problem is addressed for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in marine environment, with presence of the influence of the uncertain factors including ocean current disturbance, dynamic modeling uncertainty, and thrust model errors. To improve the trajectory tracking accuracy of AUV, an adaptive backstepping terminal sliding mode control based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) is proposed. Firstly, considering the inaccurate of thrust model of thruster, a Taylor's polynomial is used to obtain the thrust model errors. And then, the dynamic modeling uncertainty and thrust model errors are combined into the system model uncertainty (SMU) of AUV; through the RNN, the SMU and ocean current disturbance are classified, approximated online. Finally, the weights of RNN and other control parameters are adjusted online based on the backstepping terminal sliding mode controller. In addition, a chattering-reduction method is proposed based on sigmoid function. In chattering-reduction method, the sigmoid function is used to realize the continuity of the sliding mode switching function, and the sliding mode switching gain is adjusted online based on the exponential form of the sliding mode function. Based on the Lyapunov theory and Barbalat's lemma, it is theoretically proved that the AUV trajectory tracking error can quickly converge to zero in the finite time. This research proposes a trajectory tracking control method of AUV, which can effectively achieve high-precision trajectory tracking control of AUV under the influence of the uncertain factors. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with trajectory tracking simulations and pool-experiments of AUV.

AB The paper presents the main characteristics of an innovative platform which has been conceived and designed to extend the operational capabilities of current unmanned surface vehicles in terms of platform stability in waves and of powering requirement at a relatively high speed. The main idea which rules the project is the realization of a small autonomous surface unit (about 6 m in length) capable of undertaking several tasks in the marine environment even with moderate rough sea conditions. The designed vessel has the ability to locate, recover, and launch other members of the autonomous fleet (like AUVs or other underwater devices) and at the same time could carry out a surveillance service of the surrounding areas. To manage these tasks, the vehicle is designed to provide a fairly good autonomy which is needed to face intermediate-range missions (100 nautical miles). The choice of a small waterplane area twin hull (SWATH) form has been motivated by its excellent properties of seakeeping qualities, combined with a non-conventional low resistance underwater hull shape, currently under patenting process, which is able to reduce to a minimum the resistance of the vessel especially at higher speeds. To obtain the most efficient profile of the underwater bodies, a systematic optimization with an automatic procedure based on a parametric definition of the geometry, a state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics (CFD) flow solver, and a differential evolution global minimization algorithm have been created and used. As expected, all the final CFD computations on the best design have demonstrated the superior efficiency of the developed unconventional SWATH technology with respect to different alternatives of current hull typologies.

AB Robotic unmanned aerial vehicles have great potential as surveying and instrument deployment platforms in the exploration of planets and moons with an atmosphere. Among the various types of planetary aerovehicles proposed, lighter-than-atmosphere (LTA) systems are of particular interest because of their extended mission duration and long traverse capabilities. In this paper, we argue that the unique characteristics of robotic airships make them ideal candidates for exploration of planetary bodies with an atmosphere. Robotic airships extend the capabilities of balloons through their flight controllability, allowing (1) precise flight path execution for surveying purposes, (2) long-range as well as close-up ground observations, (3) station-keeping for long-term monitoring of high science value sites, (4) transportation and deployment of scientific instruments and in situ laboratory facilities across vast distances, and (5) opportunistic flight path replanning in response to the detection of relevant sensor signatures. Implementation of these capabilities requires achieving a high degree of vehicle autonomy across a broad spectrum of operational scenarios. The paper outlines some of the core autonomy technologies required to implement the capabilities listed above, drawing on work and results obtained in the context of AURORA (Autonomous Unmanned Remote Monitoring Robotic Airship), a research effort that focuses on the development of the technologies required for substantially autonomous robotic airships. We discuss airship modeling and control, autonomous navigation, and sensor-based flight control. We also outline an approach to airborne perception and monitoring which includes mission-specific target acquisition, discrimination and identification, and present experimental results obtained with AURORA.

AB For the vehicle-following scenario, control design of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) needs to care about not only the efficient energy conversion, but also the driving safety by keeping an appropriate distance. Thus, how to obtain the optimal fuel economy under the premise of maintaining a safe following distance, is a challenging and hot issue for researchers, especially in the background of autonomous driving. Aiming at above problem, this paper proposes an efficient vehicle-following energy management strategy (EMS) for PHEVs based on model prediction control (MPC). In this strategy, the values of powertrain torque and vehicle speed are predicted in the given prediction horizon, and an improved sequential quadratic programming (ISQP) algorithm is proposed to solve the receding horizon optimization problem. The real-time efficiency of engine and electric motor are estimated through the calculation from last moment. The proposed EMS is verified by using the parameters of a real-world cargo truck equipped with parallel hybrid powertrain. The results show that the proposed strategy can ensure the vehicle driving safety while obtaining excellent fuel economy. Finally, the real-time capability of proposed strategy is verified in hardware-in-loop test environment. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
DE Information-centric vehicular networking; urban sensing and monitoring
AB Today, vehicles are becoming powerful sensor platforms capable of collecting, storing, and sharing large amounts of sensory data by constant monitoring of urban streets. It is quite challenging to upload such data from all vehicles to the infrastructure due to limited bandwidth resources and high cost. This invokes the need to identify the appropriate vehicles, important for different urban sensing tasks based on their natural mobility. This paper address this problem of leveraging the self-decision making ability of a "smart vehicle" to measure its relative importance in the network. To do so, we present InfoRank as an information-centric algorithm for a vehicle to first autonomously rank different location-aware information. It then uses the information importance along its mobility pattern to find its importance in the network. We also present a selection algorithm to find the best ranked vehicles for urban sensing and vicinity monitoring to achieve a desired coverage within a limited budget. Our vehicle ranking system is the first step toward identifying the best information hubs to be used in the network for the efficient collection, storage, and distribution of urban sensory information. We evaluate InfoRank under a scalable simulation environment using realistic vehicular mobility traces. Results show that the proposed ranking system efficiently identified socially important vehicles in comparison to other ranking schemes.

AB Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAV), or robotaxis, are expected to be commercially available within this decade. This new transport mode has the potential to revolutionize travel, offering a level of service comparable to traditional taxis with much lower prices. This may attract travelers currently using other modes, impacting the economic sustainability of public transport as well as car ownership levels. We investigate this potential demand using a scalable SAV simulation framework. We do not establish a future equilibrium considering the interaction between all users on a detailed road network, but establish the potential demand for a large metropolitan area. Travelers can choose between their current mode and the new SAV mode, with fare and waiting times which depend on real-time demand. For our input data we train a statistical model on a large transport survey from Germany for an urban region, allowing us to generate a large number of trips with realistic characteristics. We conduct a sensitivity analysis to study the effect of several key parameters on the modal shift. We find that SAVs can be attractive to many active mode and public transport users unless regulations are put in place. Our results also show that due to SAV fleet constraints, changes in incentives for travelers currently using cars may have significant consequences on the behavior of other travelers. We further calculate key economic indicators for the fleet, which can inform the discussion on the fleet size and fare level that operators are likely to choose when maximizing their own profit.
