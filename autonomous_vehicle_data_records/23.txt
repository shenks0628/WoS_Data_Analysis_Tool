AB Autonomous underwater vehicle measurements are used to quantify lateral dispersion of a continuously released Rhodamine WT dye plume within the stratified interior of shelf waters in northern Monterey Bay, California. The along-shelf evolution of the plume's cross-shelf (lateral) width provides evidence for scale-dependent dispersion following the 4/3 law, as previously observed in both surface and bottom layers. The lateral dispersion coefficient is observed to grow to 0.5 m(2) s(-1) at a distance of 700 m downstream of the dye source. The role of shear and associated intermittent turbulent mixing within the stratified interior is investigated as a driving mechanism for lateral dispersion. Using measurements of time-varying temperature and horizontal velocities, both an analytical shear-flow dispersion model and a particle-tracking model generate estimates of the lateral dispersion that agree with the field-measured 4/3 law of dispersion, without explicit appeal to any assumed turbulence structure.

AB Mobile manipulators are one of the most complicated types of mechatronics systems. The performance of these robots in performing complex manipulation tasks is highly correlated with the synchronization and integration of their low-level components. This paper discusses in detail the mechatronics design of a four wheel steered mobile manipulator. It presents the manipulator's mechanical structure and electrical interfaces, designs low-level software architecture based on embedded PC-based controls, and proposes a systematic solution based on code generation products of MATLAB and Simulink. The remote development environment described here is used to develop real-time controller software and modules for the mobile manipulator under a POSIX-compliant, real-time Linux operating system. Our approach enables developers to reliably design controller modules that meet the hard real-time constraints of the entire low-level system architecture. Moreover, it provides a systematic framework for the development and integration of hardware devices with various communication mediums and protocols, which facilitates the development and integration process of the software controller.

ID ALGORITHMS
AB A shadow cast by an object on the seafloor is important information for target recognition in synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) images. Synthetic aperture imaging causes a fundamental limitation to shadow clarity because the illuminator is moved during the data collection. This leads to a blend of echo and shadow, or geometrical fill-in in the shadow region. The fill-in is most dominant for widebeam synthetic aperture imaging systems. By treating the shadow as a moving target and compensating for the motion during the synthetic aperture imagery, we avoid the geometrical shadow fill-in. We show this to be equivalent to fixing the focus at the range of the shadow caster. This novel technique, referred to as fixed focus shadow enhancement (FFSE) can be used directly as an imaging method on hydrophone data or as a postprocessing technique on the complex SAS image. We demonstrate the FFSE technique on simulated data and on real data from a rail-based SAS, and on two different SAS systems operated on a HUGIN autonomous underwater vehicle.

AB In this paper, a visual servo control for a mobile robot evolving in intensive farming environments consisting of rows of fruit trees is presented. The calculation of the current position of the robot is based on the perspective lines that define the navigation's path. These lines are obtained through the processing of visual images captured by the robot. The image is segmented using statistical techniques based on the analysis of the color characteristics and the spatial distribution of the descriptive points of the path. The perspective lines are determined through the Hough transform, which describe mathematically the navigation environment. Based on these lines, the relative position of the vehicle in the grove alleyway is calculated and a kinematics control algorithm is designed for the autonomous navigation along the corridor. The stability of the resulting control system is proved based on the Lyapunov theory. The experimental results in an environment of growing olive trees shows a good performance of the system design.

AB The Real Time Specification for Java (RTSJ) is an augmentation of Java for real time applications of various degrees of hardness. The central features of RTSJ are real time threads; user defined schedulers, asynchronous events, handlers, and control transfers; a priority inheritance based default scheduler; non-heap memory areas such as immortal and scoped, and non-heap real time threads whose execution is not impeded by garbage collection. The Robust Software Systems group at NASA Ames Research Center has JAvA PATHFINDER (JPF) under development, a Java model checker. JPF at its core is a state exploring JVM which can examine alternative paths in a Java program (e.g., via backtracking) by trying all nondeterministic choices, including thread scheduling order. This paper describes our implementation of an RTSJ profile (subset) in JPF, including requirements, design decisions, and current implementation status. Two examples are analyzed: jobs on a multiprogramming operating system, and a complex resource contention example involving autonomous vehicles crossing an intersection. The utility of JPF in finding logic and timing errors is illustrated, and the remaining challenges in supporting all of RTSJ axe assessed.

AB This paper deals with active-vision-based practical control schemes for collision? avoidance as well as maintenance of clearance in a-priori unknown textured environments. These control schemes employ a visual motion cue, called the visual threat cue (VTC) as a sensory feedback signal to accomplish the desired tasks. The VTC provides some measure for a relative change in range as well as clearance between a 3D surface and a moving observer. It is a collective measure obtained directly from the raw data of gray level images, is independent of the type of 3D surface texture. It is measured in [time(-1)]units and needs no 3D reconstruction. The control schemes are based on a set of If-Then fuzzy rules with almost no knowledge about the vehicle dynamics, speed, heading direction, etc. They were implemented in real-time using a 486-based Personal Computer and a camera capable of undergoing 6-DOF motion.

AB Compared to traditional sidescan sonar, synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) or Interferometric synthetic aperture sonar (InSAS) systems can provide much higher resolution images across the whole swath. Due to the high resolution and fast mapping rate at a given speed, SAS/InSAS technology is gaining increasing interest within the field of underwater engineering. Navigation, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), sonar technolog and electronics have achieved great progress in recent years. Thanks to these developments, the SAS/InSAS has also been pushed into a new stage. Firstly, the lightweight and compact SAS can be mounted on ever smaller, highly flexible platforms. Secondly, current algorithms are computationally more efficient. Thirdly, the SAS/InSAS images are further improved based on various methods. Last but not least, SAS/InSAS technology is preferred by underwater mapping users due to its high resolution. The current Special Issue is focused on research ideas, articles and experimental studies related to "Recent Advances in Synthetic Aperture Sonar Technology" for development, operating mode, algorithms and applications the various aspects of SAS/InSAS in applications.

AB In recent years, reusable delivery bags (RDB) have attracted considerable attention as a practice of reusable resource allocation schemes. However, little is known regarding the determinants of consumers' behavioral intention to use RDB. This study develops a model for the impact of usefulness-and identity-mediated hierar-chical needs on behavioral intentions using Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the technology acceptance model, and identity-based motivation theory. A questionnaire survey was undertaken in Korea, and 468 samples were collected for analysis using structural equation modeling. The results show that reliability, perceived safety, social influence, and social impression positively impact consumers' behavioral intention through the conduction of perceived usefulness. Simultaneously, through the positive mediating effect of self-identity, social influence and social impression affect the propensity to utilize reusable express bags. These findings offer compelling evidence and make significant contributions to the design of corporate resource allocation methods.

AB This paper addresses the zonotopic observer design for nonlinear systems affected by uncertainties, i.e., state disturbances and measurement noises using Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy technique. The system uncertainties are considered as unknown but bounded, which are handled via a set-membership framework. For state estimation purposes, we develop an algorithm to recursively compute the zonotope containing the mismatching nonlinear term caused by unmeasured nonlinearities. Then, two methods are proposed to design the zonotopic observer gains. The first method is based on the minimization of the F-radius of zonotopes, for which the membership-function-dependent observer gain must be completely computed online. For the second method, an Script capital H-infinity approach is used together with a nonquadratic Lyapunov function to determine the observer gain. Then, the zonotopic observer design is reformulated a convex optimization problem under linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be effectively solved with numerical solvers. An autonomous vehicle application is provided to demonstrate and analyze the effectiveness of both proposed methods.

AB In this paper, a novel output feedback trajectory tracking control scheme is proposed for marine surface vessels (MSVs). A fixed-time extended state observer (FXESO) is developed to estimate unmeasured velocities and lumped disturbances, and their estimation errors converge to the origin in fixed time. Especially, the convergence time of the system is independent of the initial states of an MSV. These lumped disturbances consist of uncertainties and external time-varying disturbances. Considering control accuracy and convergence rate, a finite-time homogeneity control theory (FHC) is employed in the controller design. The proposed scheme can guarantee the tracking errors to converge to zero in finite time. Meanwhile, the point stabilization is considered as a special case of the trajectory tracking, and the superior results can be achieved under the proposed control scheme framework as well. Finally, simulation studies and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed control scheme.

AB In this work, a novel local motion planning algorithm is presented, for underwater vehicle manipulator systems (UVMS) that perform autonomous underwater inspection operations. An optimization problem is formulated considering the collision avoidance, the approximation of the given task curve and critical optimization criteria. The searching method is based on an evolutionary algorithm and it is able to generate a local motion plan using continuously updated sensor information. The working environment is represented by a Bump-surface entity, constantly updated by a parallel algorithm implemented on a graphical processing unit (GPU). A trained artificial neural network is used for the fast approximation of the considered dexterity index. The local planner can cope with unknown obstacles inside the workspace while executing the task and pursuing high performance configurations in the free space. A welding inspection on an underwater tube structure is considered as the validation scenario, while a UVMS with a mounted six degrees of freedom manipulator is assigned to perform the task.

AB Vision-based road detection is one of the key techniques of autonomous driving, intelligent vehicles, and visual navigation. At present, methods based on vanishing point perform best with general roads. However, it is difficult for them to meet the needs of a real-time system due to high time consumption. This paper presents a fast detection method, namely simple road detection, which achieves high efficiency by employing sky segmentation and two new optimization schemes-sample convolution and fast voting. The optimizations are based on lookup tables, sample computing, and computing simplification. The interval sampling in sample convolution makes the proposed method flexible to meet various efficiency and accuracy demands by different sample-step values. Mean filter and vote orientation limitation are also proposed to help improve detection accuracy. Experiments have been conducted with a large number of road images under different environmental conditions, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method is efficient and effective in detecting both structured and unstructured roads.

AB In this paper, we propose an architecture for safe, collision-free formation reconfiguration of a team of autonomous agents. Our approach is based on abstracting the agent formation by a rectangular grid. We develop a discrete-event coordination strategy that plans collision-free transitions between arbitrarily defined formations. The coordination strategy implementation is based on a well-established control design methodology for manufacturing systems. Agent dynamics are modeled taking into account realistic, non-holonomic constraints. Using the concept of leader-to-formation stability, we propose controller tuning guidelines to ensure that the actual multi-agent system behavior conforms to the discrete-event motion plan. Group navigation is achieved by integrating a way point controller with this novel grid-based formation reconfiguration scheme. The proposed hybrid architecture is capable of driving a group of agents through a cluttered environment, while maintaining specified formation constraints. We present simulated and experimental results verifying the validity of our methodology.

AB Bacterial vectors are DNA molecules, that are the basic tool of genetic engineering. They are used as vehicles to transfer and multiply foreign DNA in a target organism. They allow to process genetic modifications in organisms by transfer of genes from one organism to another. Scientists use bacterial vectors to produce proteins, as well as for various types of biological research. The most important criteria to be fulfilled by vectors are: the possibility of autonomous replication within the host cell, posession of selection markers and multiple restriction enzyme site (cloning site), that allow to insert the DNA fragment. Today it is technically possible to construct vectors containing many different properties such as: type of host range, size of DNA fragment that can be inserted into a vector, number of vector copies in the target cell and many types of marker genes that allow to differ between recombinated and not recombinated cells. The most commonly used vectors are plasmids.

AB Unmanned ground vehicles tend to be more and more autonomous, but both complete teleoperation and full autonomy are not efficient enough to deal with all possible situations. To be efficient, the human-robot system must be able to anticipate, react and recover from errors of different kinds, i.e., to be resilient. From this observation, this paper proposes a survey on the resilience of a human-machine system and the means to control the resilience. The resilience of a system can be defined as the ability to maintain or recover a stable state when subject to disturbance. Adjustable autonomy and human-machine cooperation are considered as means of resilience for the system. This paper then proposes three indicators to assess different meanings of resilience of the system: foresight and avoidance of events, reaction to events and recovery from occurrence of events. The third of these metrics takes into consideration the concept of affordances that allows a common representation for the opportunities of action between the automated system and its environment.

ID COLOR; QUALITY
AB Underwater images play an essential role in acquiring and analyzing underwater information. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) highly rely on the quality of the captured underwater images, in order to carry out several activities. Due to the poor lighting conditions and the limited capacity of the optical imaging device, captured underwater images usually contain severe color distortions and contrast reduction. To this end, most existing deep learning-based underwater image enhancement methods synthesize the pseudo ground-truth, or employ the in-air clear images as references to train the models. However, the synthesized or selected reference images are generally unsatisfying due to the lack of diversity and applicability. This paper presents a novel underwater image enhancement approach based on training an end-to-end underwater image enhancement network, without using any reference image. A novel encoder-decoder network structure and a set of non-reference loss functions are designed to measure the enhancement quality. The subjective and objective evaluations show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

AB High-frequency wind measurements from Saildrone autonomous surface vehicles are used to calculate wind stress in the tropical east Pacific. Comparison between direct covariance (DC) and bulk wind stress estimates demonstrates very good agreement. Building on previous work that showed the bulk input data were reliable, our results lend credibility to the DC estimates. Wind flow distortion by Saildrones is comparable to or smaller than other platforms. Motion correction re-sults in realistic wind spectra, albeit with signatures of swell-coherent wind fluctuations that may be unrealistically strong. Fractional differences between DC and bulk wind stress magnitude are largest at wind speeds below 4 m s21. The size of this effect, however, depends on choice of stress direction assumptions. Past work has shown the importance of using current -relative (instead of Earth-relative) winds to achieve accurate wind stress magnitude. We show that it is also important for wind stress direction.

AB In a climate change scenario and under a growing interest in Precision Agriculture, it is more and more important to map and record seasonal trends of the respiration of cropland and natural surfaces. Ground-level sensors to be placed in the field or integrated into autonomous vehicles are of growing interest. In this scope, a low-power IoT-compliant device for measurement of multiple surface CO2 and WV concentrations have been designed and developed. The device is described and tested under controlled and field conditions, showing ready and easy access to collected values typical of a cloud-computing-based approach. The device proved to be usable in indoor and open-air environments for a long time, and the sensors were arranged in multiple configurations to evaluate simultaneous concentrations and flows, while the low-cost, low-power (LP IoT-compliant) design is achieved by a specific design of the printed circuit board and a firmware code fitting the characteristics of the controller.

AB Automation is increasingly being introduced into a variety of consumer products, ranging from vacuum cleaners to autonomous vehicles. While automation provides convenience and efficiency benefits consumers value, related evidence suggests it can also undermine post-purchase consumer product responses of importance to managers (e.g., brand loyalty). Using insights derived from Amazon customer reviews, a survey of product owners, a virtual reality lab, and two vignette experiments, we formally explore this possibility and find that automation is indeed a double-edged sword. That is, we uncover that automation has undesirable effects on post-purchase outcomes because it interferes with psychological ownership formation. We also find that, depending on consumer identity motives (e.g., task-related vs. technology-related) and product design affordances (e.g., a remote access feature), this effect can be strengthened, weakened, or even reversed. Our findings offer managers needed guidance on how to counter automation's dark side through identity-based targeting and product design.

AB 3D object detection from lidar point cloud has an important role in the environment sensing system of autonomous driving vehicles. In this paper, we propose two modules for object detection works by more detailed voxel initial information extraction and full fusion of context information. Additionally, we extract density information as the initial feature of the voxels and fully confuse the coordinate and density information with a point-based method to reduce the loss of original data caused by voxelization. Second, we extract the voxel features with a backbone neural network based on 3D sparse convolution. We propose a Cross-connected Region Proposal Network to integrate multiscale and multidepth regional features and to obtain high-quality 3D proposal regions. In addition, we extend the target generation strategy in the anchor-based 3D object detection algorithm, which stabilizes the network performance for multiple objections. Our modules can be flexibly applied to state-of-the-art models and effectively improves the network performance, which proves the effectiveness of the modules that we proposed.

TI Semantically guided self-supervised monocular depth estimation
SO IET IMAGE PROCESSING
LA English
DT Article
AB Depth information plays an important role in the vision-related activities of robots and autonomous vehicles. An effective method to obtain 3D scene information is self-supervised monocular depth estimation, which utilizes large and diverse monocular video datasets during the training process without the need for ground-truth data. A novel multi-task learning strategy that uses semantic information to guide the monocular depth estimation method while maintaining self-supervision is proposed. An improved differential direct visual odometer (DDVO) combined with Pose-Net is applied for achieving better pose prediction. Minimum reprojection loss with auto-masking and semantic masking is used to remove the effects of low-texture areas and moving dynamic-class objects within scenes. Concurrently, the semantic masking is introduced into the DDVO pose predictor to filter moving objects and reduce the matching error between monocular sequence frames. In addition, PackNet is employed as the backbone of multi-task learning to further improve the accuracy of deep prediction. The proposed method produces state-of-the-art results for monocular depth estimation on the KITTI Eigen split benchmark, even outperforming supervised methods that have been trained using ground-truth depth.

ID BAND ACHROMATIC METALENS; OPTICS; TRANSPARENT; ELEMENTS
AB Image sensors play a critical role in current technologies ranging from smartphones to autonomous vehicles. In these technologies, high-sensitivity image sensors are highly desired because they enable dark-scene/ultra-fast imaging. Unfortunately, a conventional sensor architecture that employs color filters on every pixel fundamentally limits the detected light power per pixel because of the filtering, which has been a long-standing barrier to sensitivity improvement. Here, we demonstrate polarization-insensitive metasurface lenses (metalenses) that sort primary colors on high-density pixels without the use of color filters. The metalenses simultaneously act as pixel-scale color splitters and lenses and are compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor sensor technology. An image sensor with such metalenses significantly enhances the detected light power, while affording high image quality, incident angle tolerance, and sub-micrometer spatial resolution. The demonstrated architecture opens the way to the development of high-sensitivity color image sensors that exceed current limits while maintaining consistency with state-of-the-art sensor technology.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as a powerful tool for various industrial and smart city applications. UAVs coupled with various sensors can perform many cognitive tasks such as object detection, surveillance, traffic management, and urban planning. Deep learning has emerged as a popular technique to speed up the processing of high-dimensional data like images and videos, which has led to several applications in surveillance and autonomous driving. However, the area of aerial object detection has been understudied. This work proposes a deep learning approach for detection of objects in aerial scenes captured by UAVs. Our work first categorizes the current methods for aerial object detection using deep learning techniques and discusses how the task is different from general object detection scenarios. We delineate the specific challenges involved and experimentally demonstrate the key design decisions that significantly affect the accuracy and robustness of models. We further propose an optimized architecture that utilizes these optimal design choices along with the recent Res-NeSt backbone to achieve superior performance in aerial object detection. Lastly, we propose several research directions to inspire further advancement in aerial object detection.

ID TRAJECTORY GENERATION; QUADROTOR
AB Quadrotors with large thrust-to-weight ratios are able to track aggressive trajectories with sharp turns and high accelerations. In this letter, we develop a search-based trajectory planning algorithm that exploits the quadrotor maneuverability to generate sequences of motion primitives in cluttered environments. We model the quadrotor body as an ellipsoid and compute its flight attitude along trajectories in order to check for collisions against obstacles. The ellipsoid model allows the quadrotor to pass through gaps that are smaller than its diameter with nonzero pitch or roll angles. Without any prior information about the location of gaps and associated attitude constraints, our algorithm is able to find a safe and optimal trajectory that guides the robot to its goal as fast as possible. To accelerate planning, we first perform a lower dimensional search and use it as a heuristic to guide the generation of a final dynamically feasible trajectory. We analyze critical discretization parameters of motion primitive planning and demonstrate the feasibility of the generated trajectories in various simulations and real-world experiments.

AB Input design has a dominant role in developing the dynamic model of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) through system identification. Optimal input design is the process of generating informative inputs that can be used to provide a good-quality dynamic model of AUV. In this paper, amplitude-modulated pseudo-random binary signal (APRBS) inputs are optimally designed in order to estimate the hydrodynamic derivatives of an AUV's nonlinear dynamic model. The input controls are designed so as to minimize uncertainty in estimating hydrodynamic derivatives. The employed approach can design multiple inputs and apply constraints on an AUV system's inputs and outputs. The genetic algorithm is utilized to solve the constraint optimization problem. The presented algorithm is used for designing the input signals of Hydrolab300 AUV, and the estimation obtained by these inputs is compared with that of zigzag maneuver. According to the results, the designed APRBS inputs improve the uncertainties that exist in estimating hydrodynamic derivatives better than zigzag inputs.

AB Accurate and safe landing on a predefined area is very important for UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) since it is the most prone to accidents during the flight. Attitude estimation using a variety of sensors is an essential task of an UAV landing. In this paper, a novel data fusion algorithm based on a Fuzzy Complementary Kalman filter (FCKF), which combines IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) data with vision data, is proposed to estimate the attitude of the UAV during autonomous landing. The proposed algorithm operates the error as state variables of the Kalman filter to compensate for the attitude angle obtained from IMU data and vision data, and then uses a complementary filter to estimate the attitude. The fuzzy logic is adopted to adjust the gain of complementary filter to improve the robustness and accuracy of the filter. The good performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulations and experiments. The results show that the proposed algorithm has better performance in accuracy and robustness than CKF and EKF.

AB This paper presents analytical travel time model for the computation of travel (cycle) time for shuttle-based storage and retrieval systems (in continuation SBS/RS). The proposed model considers the operating characteristics of the elevators lifting table and the shuttle carrier, such as acceleration and deceleration and the maximum velocity. Assuming uniform distributed storage rack locations and using the probability theory, the expressions of the cumulative distribution functions with which the mean travel time is calculated, have been determined. The proposed model enables the calculation of the mean travel (cycle) time for the single and dual command cycles, from which the performance of SBS/RS can be evaluated. The approximation model and a simulation model of SBS/RS have been used to compare the performances of the proposed analytical travel time model.

AB This paper addresses the path planning problem for robotic applications using homotopy classes. These classes provide a topological description of how paths avoid obstacles, which is an added value to the path planning problem. Homotopy classes are generated and sorted according to a lower bound heuristic estimator using a method we developed. Then, the classes are used to constrain and guide path planning algorithms. Three different path planners are presented and compared: a graph-search algorithm called Homotopic A* (HA*), a probabilistic sample-based algorithm called Homotopic RRT (HRRT), and a bug-based algorithm called Homotopic Bug (HBug). Our method has been tested in simulation and in an underwater bathymetric map to compute the trajectory of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). A comparison with well-known path planning algorithms has also been included. Results show that our homotopic path planners improve the quality of the solutions of their respective non-homotopic versions with similar computation time while keeping the topological constraints.

TI A Survey of Multicast Routing Protocols for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
LA English
DT Review
AB Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are autonomous and self-configurable wireless ad hoc networks and considered as a subset of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). MANET is composed of self-organizing mobile nodes which communicate through a wireless link without any network infrastructure. A VANET uses vehicles as mobile nodes for creating a network within a range of 100 to 1000 meters. VANET is developed for improving road safety and for providing the latest services of intelligent transport system (ITS). The development and designing of efficient, self-organizing, and reliable VANET are a challenge because the node's mobility is highly dynamic which results in frequent network disconnections and partitioning. VANET protocols reduce the power consumption, transmission overhead, and network partitioning successfully by using multicast routing schemes. In multicasting, the messages are sent to multiple specified nodes from a single source. The novel aspect of this paper is that it categorizes all VANET multicast routing protocols into geocast and cluster-based routing. Moreover, the performance of all protocols is analyzed by comparing their routing techniques and approaches.

AB This paper proposes and experimentally validates a method for driving flapping wings at large wing strokes and high frequencies with a DC motor, based on direct, elastic transmission. The DC motor undergoes reciprocating, rather than rotary, motion avoiding the use of nonlinear transmissions such as slider-crank mechanisms. This is key to compact, easy to fabricate, power efficient, and controllable flapping mechanisms. First, an appropriate motor based on maximum power transfer arguments is selected. Then, a flapping mechanism is prototyped and its experimental performance is compared with simulations, which take into account the full dynamics of the system. Despite inherent nonlinearities due to the aerodynamic damping, the linearity of the direct, elastic transmission allows one to fully exploit resonance. This benefit is best captured by the dynamic efficiency, close to 90% at larger wing strokes in both experimental data and simulations. We finally show a compact flapping mechanism implementation with independent flapping motion control for the two wings, which could be used for future autonomous micro-aerial vehicles.

AB We examine the problem of utilizing an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to collect data from an underwater sensor network. The sensors in the network are equipped with acoustic modems that provide noisy, range-limited communication. The AUV must plan a path that maximizes the information collected while minimizing travel time or fuel expenditure. We propose AUV path planning methods that extend algorithms for variants of the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). While executing a path, the AUV can improve performance by communicating with multiple nodes in the network at once. Such multinode communication requires a scheduling protocol that is robust to channel variations and interference. To this end, we examine two multiple access protocols for the underwater data collection scenario, one based on deterministic access and another based on random access. We compare the proposed algorithms to baseline strategies through simulated experiments that utilize models derived from experimental test data. Our results demonstrate that properly designed communication models and scheduling protocols are essential for choosing the appropriate path planning algorithms for data collection.

AB A 'Moving Window' scheme for detecting lanes, obstacles and corridor environments from the images captured by a CCD camera ill all automobile or mobile robot is proposed. processing the input dynamic images in real time requires high performance hardware as well as efficient software. In order to relieve these requirements for detecting the useful information from the images in real time, a 'Moving Window' scheme is proposed. For each image frame, the 'Moving Window' is newly defined and it is moved in a certain direction that is predicted by the Kalman filtering technique. By detecting (he useful information, it becomes possible to search the obstacles within the driving lane of an automobile or mobile robot. The obstacle call be verified through the correlation between the stochastic characteristics of the suspected obstacle and the actual obstacle in a database. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through the Simulated experiments of the freeway and the corridor driving. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article
AB In the last few years, communication networks for mobiles or personal users are being developed in most industrialized countries and their use is experiencing a rapid growth. Personal communication involves networks with portable and autonomous terminals, such as the Itineris and Bi-Bop systems proposed by France Telecom. Mobiles are terrestrial (cars, trains, trucks, etc.), maritime, and aeronautical vehicles. Most of the systems currently in use are networks with a ground based infrastructure, generally serving towns and major road axes. Only a small fraction of communication for mobiles uses satellite links. This market is small but nevertheless profitable. and an enormous growth in the number of users is expected before the end of the millennium. This is why an unprecedented competition started in this field at beginning of the 90's between a number of private investors and international telecommunication organizations to propose systems based on sets of satellites in low earth orbit (LEO) or medium earth orbit (MEO). These satellite systems should provide services that are complementary to those offered by ground based networks, with continental or worldwide coverage.

AB Place recognition plays a crucial role in simultaneous localization and mapping. Unfortunately, however, changes in viewpoints and conditions in large-scale environments impose tricky challenges for PR. To this end, this article specifically proposes an explicit points-of-interest driven PR method, which consists of a road segmentation module based on grid-wise patch U-transformer and a PR module based on regions of interest siamese transformer NetVLAD (RI_STV). Especially for RI_STV, in the individual dimension, it is dedicated to exploring the local topological features of nonroad regions of interest. In the spatial dimension, an improved Transformer is introduced to capture the global interactions between features of interest. In the cluster dimension, NetVLAD embedded with weighted pooling is created to perform weighted aggregation of feature clusters to generate discriminative and general descriptors. Evaluation on various datasets shows that our customized method is not only impressively competitive, but also strikes the best balance between accuracy and real-time performance.

AB For intelligent transportation systems, moving object segmentation (MOS) provides valuable information for robots and intelligent vehicles, such as collision avoidance, path planning, and static map construction. However, all existing 3D point cloud MOS methods are based on LiDAR-only, which limits the ability to fuse supplementary information from different sensors. In this article, we solve the robust and accurate 3D MOS problem by designing a dual-stream network that integrates point clouds and images. We propose a perspective residual mechanism to mine the spatio-temporal motion information of point clouds, and design a fusion module based on Transformer Attention to extract multi-scale feature information from point clouds and images, improving the segmentation integrity of moving objects. Many experiments on the benchmark dataset show the superiority of our method. On the Semantic-KITTI, we outperform the advanced method by 6.5% mIoU. And we further apply our proposed model to the Semantic-KITTI: Moving Object Segmentation competition and achieve an advanced ranking on the leaderboard.

ID ACCURACY
AB Autonomous technologies are increasingly used in various areas of science. The use of unmanned vehicles for hydrographic surveys in shallow coastal areas requires accurate estimation of shoreline position. This is a nontrivial task, which can be performed using a wide range of sensors and methods. The aim of the publication is to review shoreline extraction methods based solely on data from aerial laser scanning (ALS). This narrative review discusses and critically analyses seven publications drawn up in the last ten years. The discussed papers employed nine different shoreline extraction methods based on aerial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. It should be noted that unambiguous evaluation of shoreline extraction methods is difficult or impossible. This is because not all of the methods reported achieved accuracy, the methods were assessed on different datasets, the measurements were conducted using different devices, the water areas differed in geometrical and optical properties, the shorelines had different geometries, and the extent of anthropogenic transformation. The methods proposed by the authors were compared with a wide range of reference methods.

TI Projection Mapping Segmentation Block: A Fusion Approach of Pointcloud

DE Environment perception; multi-objects classification; data fusion; SVM
AB There is an increasing trend towards multi-modal sensor fusion to improve the perception capability of autonomous vehicles, such as the fusion of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) pointcloud and camera image data. In this work, we proposed the early-fusion method of projection mapping segmentation blocks, which is a method to map spatial pointcloud segmentation blocks and image pixel segmentation blocks to each other according to the projection relationship. The local spatial association feature and the local semi-variance texture feature were additionally designed for feature extraction, and each pair of segmentation blocks is used as a processing unit for feature extraction. Finally, the classification task was completed by Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm. We compared the classification results of the single pointcloud without fusion and pointcloud+image fusion under two segmentation methods: box-based and sector ring hexahedron-based. Our findings suggest that the data fusion classification method based on sector ring hexahedron segmentation not only improves classification accuracy but also reduces computational resources, yielding encouraging results.

AB Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) jamming is an acute problem in the world of modern navigation. As more and more applications rely on GNSS for both position and timing, jamming ramifications are becoming more severe. In this paper we suggest a novel framework to cope with these threats. First, a Bayesian jamming detection algorithm is introduced. The algorithm can both detect and track several jammers in a pre-defined region of interest. Then, a jamming coverage map algorithm is offered. Similar to cellular 3G/4G coverage maps, such a map can detect "weak" GNSS reception spots and handle them. Since jamming interference can be a dynamic phenomenon (e.g., a vehicle equipped with a jammer), the coverage map changes with time. Thus, interference patterns can be detected more easily. Utilizing the offered algorithm, both on simulation and field experiments, we have succeeded to localize an arbitrary jammer(s) within the region of interest. Thus, the results validate the viability of the proposed method.

AB This paper proposes a novel hierarchical framework to achieve real-time path planning and following for a gliding robotic dolphin, including a learning-based path planner and an adaptive following controller. Subsequent to considering higher intelligence in unknown ocean environment, we present a novel hierarchical deep Q-network method to separately plan the collision avoidance path and the approach path, and also design different continuous-states under the kinematic constraints. Next, we adopt an improved line-of-sight method to obtain the desired points from planned path. More importantly, we derive a nonlinear control law based on backstepping technique, and specially avoid singularities in the law derivation using barrier Lyapunov function. In particular, the unknown model parameters are adaptively calculated to make the controller more robust. Finally, extensive simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods, providing a new idea to further ocean exploration.

AB Tracking control is an essential capability for nonholonomic wheeled mobile robots (NWMR) to achieve autonomous navigation. This paper presents a novel hybrid control strategy combined mode-based control and actor-critic based deep reinforcement learning method. Based on the Lyapunov method, a kinematics control law named given control is obtained with pose errors. Then, the tracking control problem is converted to a finite Markov decision process, in which the defined state contains current tracking errors, given control inputs and one-step errors. After training with deep deterministic policy gradient method, the action named acquired control inputs is capable of compensating the existing errors. Thus, the hybrid control strategy is obtained under velocity constraint, acceleration constraint and bounded uncertainty. A cumulative error is also defined as a criteria to evaluate tracking performance. The comparison results in simulation demonstrate that our proposed method have an obviously advantage on both tracking accuracy and training efficiency.

TI Marginalized Point Mass Filter with Estimating Tidal Depth Bias for
   Underwater Terrain-Aided Navigation
SO JOURNAL OF SENSORS
LA English
DT Article
ID PARTICLE FILTER
AB Terrain-aided navigation is a promising approach to submerged position updates for autonomous underwater vehicles by matching terrain measurements against an underwater reference map. With an accurate prediction of tidal depth bias, a two-dimensional point mass filter, only estimating the horizontal position, has been proven to be effective for terrain-aided navigation. However, the tidal depth bias is unpredictable or predicts in many cases, which will result in the rapid performance degradation if a two-dimensional point mass filter is still used. To address this, a marginalized point mass filter in three dimensions is presented to concurrently estimate and compensate the tidal depth bias in this paper. In the method, the tidal depth bias is extended as a state variable and estimated using the Kalman filter, whereas the horizontal position state is still estimated by the original two-dimensional point mass filter. With the multibeam sonar, simulation experiments in a real underwater digital map demonstrate that the proposed method is able to accurately estimate the tidal depth bias and to obtain the robust navigation solution in suitable terrain.

The technological advances directly related to weather modification have primarily been in the decision support and evaluation based software and modeling areas. However, there have been some technological advances in other fields that might now be advanced enough to start considering their usefulness for improving weather modification operational efficiency and evaluation accuracy. We consider the programmatic aspects underlying the development of new technologies for use in weather modification activities, identifying their potential benefits and limitations. We provide context and initial guidance for operators that might integrate unmanned aircraft systems technology in future weather modification operations. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB This paper investigates the adaptive sensing for cooperative target tracking in three-dimensional environments by multiple autonomous vehicles based on measurements from time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) sensors. An iterated filtering algorithm combined with the Gauss-Newton method is applied to estimate the target location. By minimizing the determinant of the estimation error covariance matrix, an adaptive sensing strategy is developed. A gradient-based control law for each agent is proposed and a set of stationary points for local optimum geometric configurations of the agents is given. The proposed sensing strategy is further compared with other sensing strategies using different optimization criteria such as the Cramer-Rao lower bound. Potential modifications of the proposed sensing strategy is also discussed such as to include the formation control of agents. Finally, the proposed sensing strategy is demonstrated and compared with other sensing strategies by simulation, which shows that our method can provide good performance with even only two agents, i.e., one measurement at each time.

AB Bionic flapping wing vehicles have great potential for civil and defense applications due to their flexibility and concealment at low Reynolds numbers. Since traditional flow field pattern recognition methods are difficult to identify effective information from the measured local flow field and deduce the state information of the moving body, this study uses an artificial intelligence method to establish the internal correlation between flow field pattern and state information. Specifically, a fully connected neural network is adopted to recognize the tandem flapping wings' flow field pattern by using different data acquisition methods and detector array distribution methods. Compared with the neural network based on time series data, the neural network based on spatial distribution data can realize the real-time judgment of flow field environment, which is closer to the real-time requirements in practical applications. In the paper, the intelligent perception of multi-flapping wings' flow field environment with sparse detectors is carried out and lays the theoretical foundation for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance of flapping wing aircrafts.

AB The purpose of the study was to determine the bone mineral densities (BMDs) of the C1 and C2 vertebrae and discuss their implications for autonomous vehicle environments and vulnerable road users. Using quantitated computed tomography (QCT), the BMDs were obtained at eight regions for the C1 vertebra and seven regions for the C2 vertebra. The spine surgeon author outlined the boundaries of each region, and nine elderly female human cadaver specimens were used. The regions were based on potential stabilization locations for fracture fixation. In the C1 vertebra, the BMD was greatest at the anterior tubercle, followed by the posterior tubercle, the posterior arch, and the lateral and anterior lateral masses. In the C2 vertebra, the distal odontoid had the greatest BMD, followed by the spinous process, the C2-lateral mass, the odontoid-body interface, and the anterior inferior aspect of the body. Use of these data in female-specific finite element models may lead to a better understanding of load paths, injuries, mechanisms, and tolerance.

TI USV path planning algorithm based on plant growth
SO OCEAN ENGINEERING

DT Article
AB Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have been widely used in patrol, exploration and military applications, replacing manned vessels in dangerous areas of the sea where humans cannot reach or where there is a high risk. When USVs are used for a variety of tasks in the complex and changing marine environment, autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance are essential technologies for USVs to be equipped. In response to the current problems of slow search speed, low collision avoidance efficiency and long paths in path planning, this paper proposes a PGR (Plant Grow Route) algorithm. It is based on the principle of phototropism of plant growth, which guides USVs to avoid obstacles and reach target points through the magnitude of light intensity. Exper-iments show that this algorithm can successfully avoid static obstacles and allow USVs to follow the route with the strongest light intensity to reach the target point safely, and it requires short search time and high efficiency. The improved G-DWA algorithm is used to implement the PGR algorithm for local path planning, and local path planning is used as a key development direction for this experiment in the future.

AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a representative type of deep neural networks, are used in various fields. There are problems that should be solved to operate CNN in the real-world. In real-world operating environments, the CNN's performance may be degraded due to data of untrained types, which limits its operability. In this study, we propose a method for identifying data of a type that the model has not trained on based on the neuron cluster, a set of neurons activated based on the type of input data. In experiments performed on the ResNet model with the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and STL-10 datasets, the proposed method identifies data of untrained and trained types with an accuracy of 85% or higher. The more data used for neuron cluster identification, the higher the accuracy; conversely, the more complex the dataset's characteristics, the lower the accuracy. The proposed method uses only the information of activated neurons without any addition or modification of the model's structure; hence, the computational cost is low without affecting the classification performance of the model.

ID NEURAL-NETWORKS
AB The autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has a problem with feature loss when recognizing small targets underwater. At present, algorithms usually use multi-scale feature extraction to solve the problem, but this method increases the computational effort of the algorithm. In addition, low underwater light and turbid water result in incomplete information on target features. This paper proposes an enhanced dilated convolution framework (EHDC) for underwater blurred target recognition. Firstly, this paper extracts small target features through hybrid dilated convolution networks, increasing the perceptive field of the algorithm without increasing the computational power of the algorithm. Secondly, the proposed algorithm learns spatial semantic features through an adaptive correlation matrix and compensates for the missing features of the target. Finally, this paper fuses spatial semantic features and visual features for the recognition of small underwater blurred targets. Experiments show that the proposed method improves the recognition accuracy by 1.04% compared to existing methods when recognizing small underwater blurred targets.

DT Article
AB Performing stable and safe lane changes can avoid collisions and improve traffic safety. In recent years, most of the research in automated ground transportation was focused on path planning and path tracking. However, this work emphasizes the importance of lane changing time point. Based on traditional safety distance, a novel concept, that is the synthesized safety distance for lane changing (SSDLC), is proposed to study lane changing time point. It consists of the reference safety distance and lane changing safety distance, and the weight coefficient between them is obtained by fuzzy logic control algorithm. Additionally, the joint model predictive control (JMPC) is proposed to follow the reference trajectory. This newly established algorithm not only considers the physical saturation of actuators but the yaw stability characteristics. To overcome the calculation difficulty to obtain the optimal results in the prescribed time, the algorithm adds a relaxation factor in the objective function. Finally, the lane changing time point and path tracking framework is modeled and simulated on a CarSim-Simulink platform. Four scenarios are carried out to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.

AB A positive driving experience, especially for older drivers, increases the attention to the emotional dimensions of driving, such as the driver's perceived safety. Therefore, this study empirically presents factors affecting driver experience and compares them between older and younger drivers. Consequently, we conducted a face-to-face survey on elderly and young drivers and analyzed the data of 246 drivers using structural equation modeling. The analysis presented measurements and structural model evaluations. Considering the analysis, it was found that driving-related information and car-exterior context affect the perceived safety and enjoyment of a driver's experience. Additionally, car-exterior context exerts a greater influence on the perceived safety and enjoyment of the elderly drivers' group than the young drivers' group. The results of this study will empirically contribute to the satisfaction of driver experience and perceived safety improvement in the future. It also provides a basis for the development of driving interfaces to improve the quality of the driving experience of the elderly.

AB Autonomous underwater gliders (AUG) are a class of underwater vehicles that move using a buoyancy engine and forces from wings. Gliders execute turning motion with the help of a rudder or an internal roll control mechanism and the trajectory of the turn is a spiral. This paper analyses the sensitivity of the characteristics of spiral manoeuvre on the hydrodynamic coefficients of the glider. Based on the dynamics model of a gliding fish whose turn is enabled by a rudder, the effect of hydrodynamic coefficients of the hull and the rudder on the spiral motion are quantified. Local sensitivity analysis is undertaken using the indirect method. The order of importance of hydrodynamic coefficients is evaluated. It is observed that the spiral path parameters are most sensitive to the side force created by the rudder and the effect of the drag coefficient is predominant to that of the lift coefficients. This study will aid in quantifying the effect of change of geometry on the manoeuvrability of AUGs.

ID WATER
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) highly depend on the quality of captured underwater images to perform a variety of tasks. However, compared with everyday images taken in air, underwater images are hazy, with color shift, and in relatively low quality, posing significant challenges to available mature vision algorithms to achieve expected performance. There are, currently, two major lines of approaches to tackle these challenges: the physical image formation model-based and the neural-network-based approaches. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach, where the revised underwater image formation model, i.e., the Akkaynak-Treibitz model, is embedded into the network design for the benefit of combining the advantages of these two approaches. The embedded physical model guides for network learning, and the generative adversarial network (GAN) is adopted for coefficients estimation. We conduct extensive experiments and compare with state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and qualitatively on nearly all the available underwater datasets, and our method achieves significant improvements.

DE Systems of concurrent communicating agents; Petri nets; Reachability;

AB This paper provides a true-concurrency approach for the specification and verification of systems of concurrent communicating agents with durable actions. We present high-level Petri nets with durable actions (DaHL) to cope with various details in such complex systems. We define a DaHL module as an open variant of time-dependent colored Petri nets. A DaHL system is a fused set of modules for systems consisting of concurrent agents which can interact with each other. We also introduce hybrid-based reachability graph that covers the entire state space of DaHL systems with a true-concurrency semantics. We show that such reachability graph allows us to check important properties such as deadlock-freeness, liveness, home space, and reversibility, and also to predict timing properties prior to real implementation. A case study is used to model and analyze a simple scenario where autonomous vehicles are able to transport containers freely in an enterprise environment. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we propose several methods to improve the performance of multiple object tracking (MOT), especially for humans, in dynamic environments such as robots and autonomous vehicles. The first method is to restore and re-detect unreliable results to improve the detection. The second is to restore noisy regions in the image before the tracking association to improve the identification. To implement the image restoration function used in these two methods, an image inference model based on SRGAN (super-resolution generative adversarial networks) is used. Finally, the third method includes an association method using face features to reduce failures in the tracking association. Three distance measurements are designed so that this method can be applied to various environments. In order to validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we select two baseline trackers for comparative experiments and construct a robotic environment that interacts with real people and provides services. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods efficiently overcome dynamic situations and show favorable performance in general situations.

AB Transform faults have anomalously low rates of seismicity, but it's not clear whether this reflects persistent earthquake-generating fault patches surrounded by creep, or the presence of creep and earthquakes at different times along the same patch. We use new, autonomous underwater vehicle high-resolution seafloor mapping to image the morphology of and offsets along transform fault segments in the Gulf of California, offshore Mexico. Fault zone structure imaged in this study shows evidence for the initiation and cessation of activity along individual fault splays over geologic time. A series of six identically offset depositional fans evidence 21-23 m of slip along the main transform fault, which could not have been produced by a single earthquake given the length of the transform. Rather, the lack of smaller-magnitude offsets indicates synchronous deposition and an absence of multiple slope failure-inducing earthquakes, which is consistent with the idea that creep and/or small-magnitude events occur asynchronously with large earthquakes in the slip history of a given transform fault segment.

AB The increasing number of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) cooperating in underwater operations has motivated the use of wireless communications. Their modeling can minimize the impact of their limited performance in real-time robotic interventions. However, robotic frameworks hardly ever consider the communications, and network simulators are not suitable for HIL experiments. In this work, the UWSim-NET is presented, an open source tool to simulate the impact of communications in underwater robotics. It gathers the benefits of NS3 in modeling communication networks with those of the underwater robot simulator (UWSim) and the robot operating system (ROS) in modeling robotic systems. This article also shows the results of three experiments that demonstrate the capabilities of UWSim-NET in modeling radio frequency (RF) and acoustic links in underwater scenarios. It also permits evaluating several MAC protocols such as additive links online Hawaii area (ALOHA), slotted floor acquisition multiple access (S-FAMA) and user defined protocols. A third experiment demonstrated the excellent capabilities of UWSim-NET in conducting hardware in the loop (HIL) experiments.

ID PHOTOGRAPHY; CAMERA
AB In this paper, we present a deep nonparametric Bayesian method to synthesize a light field from a single image. Conventionally, light-field capture requires special optical architecture, and the gain in angular resolution often comes at the expense of a reduction in spatial resolution. Techniques for computationally generating the light field from a single image can be expanded further to a variety of applications, ranging from microscopy and materials analysis to vision-based robotic control and autonomous vehicles. We treat the light field as multiple sub-aperture views, and to compute the novel viewpoints, our model contains three major components. First, a convolutional neural network is used for predicting the depth probability map from the image. Second, a multi-scale feature dictionary is constructed within a multi-layer dictionary learning network. Third, the novel views are synthesized taking into account both the probabilistic depth map and the multi-scale feature dictionary. The experiments show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods in delivering good image resolution.

AB Documenting underwater archaeological sites is an extremely challenging problem. Sites covering large areas are particularly daunting for traditional techniques. In this paper, we present a novel approach to this problem using both an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and a diver-controlled stereo imaging platform to document the submerged BronzeAge city at Pavlopetri, Greece. The result is a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction covering 26,600 m2 at a resolution of 2 mm/pixel, the largest-scale underwater optical 3D map, at such a resolution, in the world to date. We discuss the advances necessary to achieve this result, including i) an approach to color correct large numbers of images at varying altitudes and over varying bottom types; ii) a large-scale bundle adjustment framework that is capable of handling upward of 400,000 stereo images; and iii) a novel approach to the registration and rapid documentation of an underwater excavations area that can quickly produce maps of site change. We present visual and quantitative comparisons to the authors' previous underwater mapping approaches. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID URBAN; NAVIGATION; EXTRACTION; ROBOT
AB Many applications in the fields of mobile robotics and autonomous vehicles employ two or more 2D laser rangefinders (LRFs) for different purposes: navigation, obstacle detection, 3D mapping or simultaneous localization and mapping. The extrinsic calibration between such sensors (i.e. finding their relative poses) is required to exploit effectively all of the sensor measurements and to perform data fusion. In the literature, most works employing several LRFs obtain their extrinsic calibration from manual measurements or from ad-hoc solutions. In this paper we present a new method to obtain such calibration easily and robustly by scanning perpendicular planes (typically corners encountered in structured scenes), from which geometric constraints are inferred. This technique can be applied to a rig with any number of LRFs in almost any geometric configuration (a minimum of two LRFs whose scanning planes are not parallel is required). Experimental results are presented with synthetic and real data to validate our proposal. A C++ implementation of this method and a dataset are also provided.

DT Article
AB A receding-horizon cooperative search algorithm is presented that jointly optimizes routes and sensor orientations for a team of autonomous agents searching for a mobile target in a closed and bounded region. By sampling this region at locations with high target probability at each time step, we reduce the continuous search problem to a sequence of optimizations on a finite, dynamically updated graph whose vertices represent waypoints for the searchers and whose edges indicate potential connections between the waypoints. Paths are computed on this graph using a receding-horizon approach, in which the horizon is a fixed number of graph vertices. To facilitate a fair comparison between paths of varying length on nonuniform graphs, the optimization criterion measures the probability of finding the target per unit travel time. Using this algorithm, we show that the team discovers the target in finite time with probability one. Simulations verify that this algorithm makes effective use of agents and outperforms previously proposed search algorithms. We have successfully hardware tested this algorithm in two small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with gimbaled video cameras.

AB This paper describes the design of a Real Time Machine-Vision (MV) Position Sensing System for the problem of Semi-Autonomous Docking within Aerial Refueling (AR) for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In this effort, techniques and algorithms have been developed and extensively tested in the MATLAB/Simulink (R) Soft Real-Time environment as well as in Linux/RTAI Hard Real-Time environment. The overall MV software performs several tasks, such as the image acquisition from a real camera, the Feature Extraction (FE) from the acquired image, the Detection and Labeling (DAL) of the features, and the tanker-UAV Pose Estimation (PE). A Cyclic Asynchronous Buffer (CAB) mechanism was implemented for inter-process communication among Real Time and Non Real Time processes. The entire sensing system was tested using an 800 MHz PC-104 computer. The results confirmed the feasibility of executing image processing algorithms in real-time using off-the-shelf commercial hardware to obtain reliable relative position and orientation estimations.

AB In this paper, we introduce an approach for the efficient solution of motion-planning problems for time-invariant dynamical control systems with symmetries, such as mobile robots and autonomous vehicles, under a variety of differential and algebraic constraints on the state and on the control inputs. Motion plans are described as the concatenation of a number of well-defined motion primitives, selected from a finite library. Rules for the concatenation of primitives are given in the form of a regular language, defined through a finite-state machine called a Maneuver Automaton. We analyze the reachability properties of the language, and present algorithms for the solution of a class of motion-planning problems. In particular, it is shown that the solution of steering problems for nonlinear dynamical systems with symmetries and invariant constraints can he reduced to the solution of a sequence of kinematic inversion problems. A detailed example of the application of the proposed approach to motion planning for a small aerobatic helicopter is presented.

ID MOTION ESTIMATION; VISION; AIRCRAFT; POSITION
AB The problem of navigation system design for autonomous aircraft landing is addressed, New nonlinear filter structures are introduced to estimate the position and velocity of an aircraft with respect to a possibly moving landing site, such as a naval vessel, based on measurements provided by airborne vision and inertial sensors. By exploring the geometry of the navigation problem, the navigation filter dynamics are cast in the framework of linear parametrically varying systems (LPVs), Using this set-up, filter performance and stability are studied in an H-infinity setting by resorting to the theory of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), The design of nonlinear, regionally stable filters to meet adequate H-infinity performance measures is thus converted into that of determining the feasibility of a related set of LMIs and finding a solution to them, if it exists. This is done by using widely available numerical tools that borrow from convex optimization techniques, The mathematical framework that is required for integrated vision/inertial navigation system design is developed and a design example for an air vehicle landing on an aircraft carrier is detailed.

DE deep learning; parking slot detection; surround view images
AB Autonomous vehicles are gaining popularity, and the development of automatic parking systems is a fundamental requirement. Detecting the parking slots accurately is the first step towards achieving an automatic parking system. However, modern parking slots present various challenges for detection task due to their different shapes, colors, functionalities, and the influence of factors like lighting and obstacles. In this comprehensive review paper, we explore the realm of vision-based deep learning methods for parking slot detection. We categorize these methods into four main categories: object detection, image segmentation, regression, and graph neural network, and provide detailed explanations and insights into the unique features and strengths of each category. Additionally, we analyze the performance of these methods using three widely used datasets: the Tongji Parking-slot Dataset 2.0 (ps 2.0), Sejong National University (SNU) dataset, and panoramic surround view (PSV) dataset, which have played a crucial role in assessing advancements in parking slot detection. Finally, we summarize the findings of each method and outline future research directions in this field.

AB Trajectory tracking is a fundamental task of the dynamic positioning (DP) system. This paper studies the problem of trajectory tracking of DP ships constrained by control inputs under environmental disturbances. To solve this problem, we develop a novel anti-disturbance Lyapunov-based model predictive control (ADLMPC) scheme. Firstly, an extended state observer (ESO) is designed to estimate environmental disturbances. By combining the ESO with Lyapunov-based model predictive control, the ADLMPC scheme is devised. Secondly, a virtual controller which satisfies input constraints is developed by backstepping and the auxiliary dynamic system, and it is integrated into the Lyapunov contraction constraint in ADLMPC. We show that if the parameters for the virtual controller are appropriately determined, the recursive feasibility of ADLMPC is theoretically guaranteed, and the uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals in the trajectory tracking control system is achieved. Finally, the simulation results display the efficacy and superiorities of the ADLMPC scheme.

AB Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown promising performance in various application areas (e.g., games and autonomous vehicles). Experience replay buffer strategy and parallel learning strategy are widely used to boost the performances of offline and online deep reinforcement learning algorithms. However, state-action distribution shifts lead to bootstrap errors. Experience replay buffer learns policies with elder experience trajectories, limiting its application to off-policy algorithms. Balancing the new and the old experience is challenging. Parallel learning strategies can train policies with online experiences. However, parallel environmental instances organize the agent pool inefficiently with higher simulation or physical costs. To overcome these shortcomings, we develop four lightweight and effective DRL algorithms, instance-actor, parallel-actor, instance-critic, and parallel-critic methods, to contrast different-age trajectory experiences. We train the contrast DRL according to the received rewards and proposed contrast loss, which is calculated by designed positive/negative keys. Our benchmark experiments using PyBullet robotics environments show that our proposed algorithm matches or is better than the state-of-the-art DRL algorithms.

AB The objective of this study is to evaluate Grassmannian constellations combined with a spread spectrum multiple access scheme for underwater acoustic mobile multiple access communication systems. These communication systems enable the coordination of a fleet of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) from a surface or bottom control unit, e.g., a boat. Due to its robustness against phase rotation, the demodulator of Grassmannian constellations uses non-coherent detection, and the main advantage of such modulation lies in the spectrum efficiency gain with respect to conventional differential modulation. The communication system under study in this paper consists of (i), at the transmitter side, a Grassmannian modulation used in an orthogonal spread spectrum multiple access scheme called Multiuser Hyperbolic Frequency Modulation (MU-HFM) and (ii), at the receiver side, a non-coherent array decoder. The modulation and demodulation are presented as well as the considered spreading sequences. Finally, performances of the proposed transmission scheme are evaluated over replayed underwater acoustic channel responses collected at sea by a multi-sensor acoustic acquisition system.

AB Car sickness is a major concern for car passengers, and with the development of autonomous vehicles, increasing numbers of car occupants are likely to be affected. Previous laboratory studies have used EEG measurements to better understand the cerebral changes linked to symptoms. However, the dynamics of motion in labs/simulators differ from those of a real car. This study sought to identify specific cerebral changes associated with the level of car sickness experienced in real driving conditions. Nine healthy volunteers participated as front passengers in a slalom session inducing lateral movements at very low frequency (0.2 Hz). They were continuously monitored via EEG recordings and subjectively rated their level of symptoms after each slalom, using a 5-point likert scale. Car-sickness symptoms evolved concomitantly with changes in theta and alpha power in the occipital and parietal areas. These changes may reflect altered sensory integration, as well as a possible influence of sleepiness mitigating symptoms.

AB An unmanned autonomous vehicle (UAV) is sent on a mission to explore and reconstruct an unknown environment from a series of measurements collected by Bayesian optimization. The success of the mission is judged by the UAV's ability to faithfully reconstruct any anomalous features present in the environment, with emphasis on the extremes (e.g., extreme topographic depressions or abnormal chemical concentrations). We show that the criteria commonly used for determining which locations the UAV should visit are ill-suited for this task. We introduce a number of novel criteria that guide the UAV toward regions of strong anomalies by leveraging previously collected information in a mathematically elegant and computationally tractable manner. We demonstrate superiority of the proposed approach in several applications, including reconstruction of seafloor topography from real-world bathymetry data, as well as tracking of dynamic anomalies. A particularly attractive property of our approach is its ability to overcome adversarial conditions, that is, situations in which prior beliefs about the locations of the extremes are imprecise or erroneous.

AB The underwater environment is complex and changeable, and it is hard but irreplaceable to research the time-varying noises that have a significant influence on navigation information determination with higher accuracy. To solve the problems of the inaccurate noise information, this paper proposes a novel statistical regression adaptive Kalman filtering (SRAKF) algorithm that makes better use of the merits of the expectation maximization and unscented transformation. The SRAKF is verified from theoretical perspectives, and meanwhile, the stability and accuracy of the algorithm are evaluated by real lake trials. Relying on the properties of the statistical linear regression and the positioning parameter estimation of latent variables, higher precise positioning parameters can be acquired by the SRAKF, even for the measurement noise values with great variation. Hence, the performance of SRAKF is more useful in underwater positioning applications than other traditional algorithms due to its stronger robustness and higher accuracy.

AB To mitigate and address climate change, greener transportation modes and mobility services are in great need. Although Green Information Systems (Green IS)-specifically designed to increase environmental sustainability-can support behavioral changes, there is limited research on whether Green IS usage coincides with sustainable real-world behavior. Against this background, we combine the Theory of Planned Behavior with the Technology Acceptance Model to study the interplay of employees' Green IS usage and actual real-world behavior. Specifically, we surveyed 211 employees of a larger Western European company in the context of a recently introduced company-wide mobile application for business trip ridesharing. We conclude that Green IS can facilitate sustainable mobility adoption; however, not only technology acceptance needs to be considered but also employees' attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control regarding their business travel modes. Thus, decision-making in analog and digital realms coincide and ought to be considered in parallel.

AB In the past two decades, unmanned amphibious robots have proven the most promising and efficient systems ranging from scientific, military, and commercial applications. The applications like monitoring, surveillance, reconnaissance, and military combat operations require platforms to maneuver on challenging, complex, rugged terrains and diverse environments. The recent technological advancements and development in aquatic robotics and mobile robotics have facilitated a more agile, robust, and efficient amphibious robots maneuvering in multiple environments and various terrain profiles. Amphibious robot locomotion inspired by nature, such as amphibians, offers augmented flexibility, improved adaptability, and higher mobility over terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial mediums. In this review, amphibious robots' locomotion mechanism designed and developed previously are consolidated, systematically The review also analyzes the literature on amphibious robot highlighting the limitations, open research areas, recent key development in this research field. Further development and contributions to amphibious robot locomotion, actuation, and control can be utilized to perform specific missions in sophisticated environments, where tasks are unsafe or hardly feasible for the divers or traditional aquatic and terrestrial robots.

AB Recent researches on robotics have shown significant improvement, spanning from algorithms, mechanics to hardware architectures. Robotics, including manipulators, legged robots, drones, and autonomous vehicles, are now widely applied in diverse scenarios. However, the high computation and data complexity of robotic algorithms pose great challenges to its applications. On the one hand, CPU platform is flexible to handle multiple robotic tasks. GPU platform has higher computational capacities and easy-to-use development frameworks, so they have been widely adopted in several applications. On the other hand, FPGA-based robotic accelerators are becoming increasingly competitive alternatives, especially in latency-critical and power-limited scenarios. With specialized designed hardware logic and algorithm kernels, FPGA-based accelerators can surpass CPU and GPU in performance and energy efficiency. In this paper, we give an overview of previous work on FPGA-based robotic accelerators covering different stages of the robotic system pipeline. An analysis of software and hardware optimization techniques and main technical issues is presented, along with some commercial and space applications, to serve as a guide for future work.

TI Dynamic distortion in resonant galvanometric optical scanners
SO OPTICA

DT Article
ID DISPLAY
AB High-speed optical systems are revolutionizing biomedical imaging in microscopy, DNA sequencing, and flow cytometry, as well as numerous other applications, including data storage, display technologies, printing, and autonomous vehicles. These systems often achieve the necessary imaging or sensing speed through the use of resonant galvanometric optical scanners. Here, we show that the optical performance of these devices suffers due to the dynamic mirror distortion that arises from the variation in torque with angular displacement. In one of two scanners tested, these distortions result in a variation of signal-to-noise (Strehl) ratio by an order of magnitude across the field of view, degrading transverse resolution by more than a factor of 2. This mirror distortion could be mitigated through the use of stiffer materials, such as beryllium or silicon carbide, at the expense of surface roughness, as these cannot be polished to the same degree of smoothness as common optical glasses. The repeatability of the dynamic distortion indicates that computational and optical corrective methods are also possible.

AB Quad-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a typical multiple-input-multiple-output underactuated system with couplings and nonlinearity. Usually, the flying environment is very complex, so that it is impossible for the UAV to avoid effects derived from disturbances and uncertainties. In order to improve the reliability of flight control, we established the dynamic model of quad-rotor UAV by Newton-Euler equation in unbalanced load conditions. Considering external disturbances in the attitude, a second-order sliding mode controller was designed with PID sliding mode surface and Extended State Observer (ESO). The simulation experiments have got good control performance, illustrating the effectiveness of our controller. Meanwhile, the controller was implemented in a quad-rotor UAV, which carried a pan-tilt camera for aerial photography. The actual flight experiments proved that this paper dealt with the high stabilization flight control problem for the quad-rotor UAV, which laid a good foundation for autonomous flight of the UAV.

AB Malaysia is one of the countries with the highest car crash fatality rates in Asia. The high implementation cost of in-vehicle driver behavior warning system and autonomous driving remains a significant challenge. Motivated by the large number of simple yet effective inventions that benefitted many developing countries, this study presents the findings of emotion recognition based on skin conductance response using a low-cost wearable sensor. Emotions were evoked by presenting the proposed display stimulus and driving stimulator. Meaningful power spectral density was extracted from the filtered signal. Experimental protocols and frameworks were established to reduce the complexity of the emotion elicitation process. The proof of concept in this work demonstrated the high accuracy of two-class and multiclass emotion classification results. Significant differences of features were identified using statistical analysis. This work is one of the most easy-to-use protocols and frameworks, but has high potential to be used as biomarker in intelligent automobile, which helps prevent accidents and saves lives through its simplicity.

AB To improve the efficiency of multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (multi-AUV) cooperative target search in a Three-Dimensional (3D) underwater workspace, an integrated algorithm is proposed by combining a Self-Organising Map (SOM), neural network and Glasius Bioinspired Neural Network (GBNN). With this integrated algorithm, the 3D underwater workspace is first divided into subspaces dependent on the abilities of the AUV team members. After that, tasks are allocated to each subspace for an AUV by SOM. Finally, AUVs move to the assigned subspace in the shortest way and start their search task by GBNN. This integrated algorithm, by avoiding overlapping search paths and raising the coverage rate, can reduce energy consumption of the whole multi-AUV system. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of guiding multi-AUV to achieve a multiple target search task with higher efficiency and adaptability compared with a more traditional bioinspired neural network algorithm.

AB Wheeled mobile robots are a special class of nonholonomic mechanical systems. The mobility of such highly nonlinear systems is restricted due to the presence of nonholonomic constraints of wheels, also the system severe underactuated nature. These conditions generate major difficulties in system stabilization, i. e. to park or reach a given configuration for the overall system. This leads to a challenging control problem for research that is the focus of this paper. In this paper a new method based on time-varying feedbacks has been developed for a Tractor-trailer wheeled robot (TTWR). First kinematic model of the TTWR is obtained. Next, a novel method using time-varying feedbacks is investigated in order to stabilize the TTWR around the origin. The proposed kinematic control algorithm is developed based on switching between two finite-time controllers. Appropriate control algorithms have been designed for each step based on the stability of the closed loop system. Obtained simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed control law.

AB Academic research has primarily focused on the technical factors of material handling systems, with little or no discussion of human factors. In order to improve the performance of distribution operations, we found that the implementation of material handling systems involves both human and technical factors. These human and technical factors interact over time and go through three somewhat overlapping transitional stages. In the first stage, both human and technical problems exist; however, human problems dominate, and require conflict management skills to resolve. In the second stage, human problems improve, but technical problems persist, requiring formal problem-solving methods to resolve. Finally, in the third stage, both human and technical problems improve. It is important to recognize these transitional stages because they must be effectively managed in order for the material handling functions to perform at the optimal level. Implications of this research, including directions for future research, are also provided. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Crew-reducing exhibits promise for various benefits in the aviation industry. However, there is limited understanding regarding public acceptance. Using an experimental design deployed with a vignette-based online study, we investigated individuals' negative emotion, trust, risk acceptance, and willingness to ride toward Single Pilot Operations (SPO) and Dual Pilot Operations (DPO). Results established that people preferred DPO flights, relying on affect heuristic. Specifically, people's negative emotion associated with SPO decreases their trust, which subsequently results in lower levels of willingness to ride and risk acceptance. Furthermore, we observed that people are less likely to accept risk evoked by intelligent autonomous system in DPO flights, which likely due to their psychological model about two pilots in the cockpit. Findings from this research highlight the importance of users' initially positive affects about intelligent equipment in the cockpit. Other theoretical and practical implications for narrowing the acceptable gap between SPO and DPO are discussed.

AB Global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) are gaining importance as their main applications in localization and navigation particularly for future autonomous vehicle navigation. A drawback of GNSS for spoofing is the simple structure of the GNSS signal and its weak strength on the Earth's surface. These conditions can expose civilian users to GNSS spoofing attacks with the potential to cause significant damage. There are many approaches to detecting GNSS spoofing; one category uses independent sensors, such as inertial sensors. Inertial sensors are typically used as tightly coupled GNSS/INS (inertial navigation system) integration to provide consistency checks for position, velocity, or other parameters. However, in this study, a direct consistency check of the acceleration itself is used to detect spoofing and provide the probability density function (PDF) of a proposed decision variable for a constant-velocity case. The proposed decision variable compares the accelerations of the GNSS and accelerometers for the constant-velocity case. The performance of the proposed spoofing detection method is analyzed based on the detection probability of GNSS spoofing.

DE Aerial systems; Perception and autonomy; Gaussian processes; mapping
AB Unmanned aerial vehicles are rapidly gaining popularity in many environmental monitoring tasks. A prerequisite for their autonomous operation is the ability to perform efficient and accurate mapping online, given limited on-board resources constraining operation time and computational capacity. To address this, we present an online adaptive-resolution approach for field mapping based on Gaussian Process fusion, a strategy in which Bayesian fusion is applied to update a Gaussian Process prior map. A key aspect of our approach is an integral kernel encoding spatial correlation over the areas of grid cells. This enables efficient information compression in uninteresting areas to achieve a compact map representation while maintaining spatial correlations in a theoretically sound fashion. We evaluate the performance of our approach on both synthetic and real-world data. Results show that our method is more efficient in terms of mapping time and memory consumption without compromising on map quality. Further, we integrate our mapping strategy into an adaptive path planning framework to show that it facilitates information gathering efficiency in online settings.

DE Marine robotics; SLAM; range sensing
AB Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a critical capability for any autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). However, robust, accurate state estimation is still a work in progress when using low-cost sensors. We propose enhancing a typical low-cost sensor package using widely available and often free prior information; overhead imagery. Given an AUV's sonar image and a partially overlapping, globally-referenced overhead image, we propose using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate a synthetic overhead image predicting the above-surface appearance of the sonar image contents. We then use this synthetic overhead image to register our observations to the provided global overhead image. Once registered, the transformation is introduced as a factor into a pose SLAM factor graph. We use a state-of-the-art simulation environment to perform validation over a series of benchmark trajectories and quantitatively show the improved accuracy of robot state estimation using the proposed approach. We also show qualitative outcomes from a real AUV field deployment. datasets, quantitatively demonstrating its accuracy, stability, and data-efficiency.

AB Consider one special closed loop system structure with one unknown plant and two unknown controllers,i.e. feed forward controller and feedback controllers, our missions are to identify this plant and design these two controllers without any physical principles. Based on the measured input-output data sequence, direct data driven scheme is proposed to achieve these dual goals. For the case of parameterized plant and two parameterized controllers, two kinds of unknown parameter vectors are estimated from the data sequence, and the iterative idea is applied to identify them recursively until to be convergence. In addition, controller validation modular is added to testify whether the designed controllers are satisfied, being from the idea of model validation in system identification. Then theoretical analysis on direct data driven scheme can be implemented to guarantee UAV flight control structure work well, bringing the detailed UAV flight control performance.

AB The ability to make educated predictions about their surroundings, and associate them with certain confidence, is important for intelligent systems, like autonomous vehicles and robots. It allows them to plan early and decide accordingly. Motivated by this observation, in this letter we utilize information from a video sequence with a narrow field-of-view to infer the scene at a wider field-of-view. To this end, we propose a temporally consistent field-of-view extrapolation framework, namely FoV-Net, that: (1) leverages 3D information to propagate the observed scene parts from past frames; (2) aggregates the propagated multi-frame information using an attention-based feature aggregation module and a gated self-attention module, simultaneously hallucinating any unobserved scene parts; and (3) assigns an interpretable uncertainty value at each pixel. Extensive experiments show that FoV-Net does not only extrapolate the temporally consistent wide field-of-view scene better than existing alternatives, but also provides the associated uncertainty which may benefit critical decision-making downstream applications.

AB Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are extensively used for multiple purposes, such as infrastructure inspections or surveillance. This paper presents a real-time path planning algorithm in indoor environments designed to perform contact inspection tasks using UAVs. The only input used by this algorithm is the point cloud of the building where the UAV is going to navigate. The algorithm is divided into two main parts. The first one is the pre-processing algorithm that processes the point cloud, segmenting it into rooms and discretizing each room. The second part is the path planning algorithm that has to be executed in real time. In this way, all the computational load is in the first step, which is pre-processed, making the path calculation algorithm faster. The method has been tested in different buildings, measuring the execution time for different paths calculations. As can be seen in the results section, the developed algorithm is able to calculate a new path in 8-9 milliseconds. The developed algorithm fulfils the execution time restrictions, and it has proven to be reliable for route calculation.

TI Alternate Strategies for Optimal Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Thermaling
SO JOURNAL OF AIRCRAFT

DT Article
AB This paper investigates optimal glider trajectories for gaining altitude from thermal updraft columns ("thermaling"). Thermal updraft columns provide a natural energy resource that can be beneficial for enabling long-term autonomous soaring objectives. In this paper, computational optimal control is used to investigate possible alternatives to the common strategy of circularly orbiting the thermal to harvest potential energy. The Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto pseudospectral method is applied to a simulated glider in multiple scenarios over a range of thermal sizes, thermal intensities, and glider start conditions. Results for the Gedeon thermal model, which simulates dropoff in wind intensity with distance from the thermal core and additionally incorporates external downdrafts, are considered. These are then compared in performance to centered circular orbiting as well as two other alternate heuristic strategies suggested by the optimal control results: off-centered circular orbiting and "figure eights". Results suggest benefits to using alternatives to centered circular orbiting when encountering small-diameter thermal updrafts. Results also support the utility of centered circular orbiting for medium-to large-diameter thermals while providing new insights into the optimal parameters of the circular orbit.

AB Subsea engineering has become a thriving field that received a lot of attention from researchers and educators in recent years. The reason for the attention could be economical since many oil and gas fields are offshores, ecological due to pollution, or geological due to earthquakes and Tsunamis. The subsea environment is difficult to conquer and requires sophisticated tools to monitor such as Autonomous or Remote Underwater Vehicles (AUVs or ROVs), submersible sensors, and very skilled manpower. In this work, the focus is on how to supply power indefinitely to stationary sensors at the bottom of the sea. Therefore, an energy harvesting device is designed and simulated to validate its efficacy in supplying the necessary power to charge submersible sensors and their accessories. The device is actuated using water currents and the output voltage is fed through a voltage rectifier to convert it to the required DC input of the sensors. Simulations results showed that the designed device can successfully provide the necessary power for submersible sensors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nowadays, the quadrotor is becoming a popular platform in the academic field and the commercial area. Many prototypes have been developed for different applications. In this paper, we present the design and development of a quadrotor system with the function of aerial surveillance for trajectory tracking. Kinematics and dynamics models of the quadrotor are given by Newton-Euler method. A nonlinear controller based on trajectory linearization control approach is designed to stabilize the quadrotor. This controller is divided into two parts as the guidance controller and the attitude controller, which control the translational motion and rotational motion, respectively. A quadrotor prototype is developed to implement the controller. A control strategy is provided for the autonomous flight with procedures of mission planning, trajectory generation, control, and hardware. Simulation tests are used to validate the robustness and the performance of the controller. Several flight experiments have been implemented outdoors. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed controller performs well in trajectory tracking mission, and the appointed functions of this quadrotor system also work well.

AB Mobile data collection is one of research highlights for sparse three-dimensional underwater sensor networks. Therein, optimal or near-optimal cruise trajectory planning of mobile sink is very crucial. A 3D Dubins curves based continuous path programming algorithm (GA-3DTSP in short) for underwater mobile sink with non-holonomic constraints such as well-known autonomous underwater vehicle is proposed. The objective of GA-3DTSP algorithm is to trace sparsely deployed sensor nodes by mobile sink so as to achieve near-optimal energy conservation efficiency. First, an extended 3D Dubins curve is proposed and the length calculation formulae for 3D Dubins curve are investigated. Furthermore, genetic algorithm is used to tackle this difficult NP-complete problem of planning shortest paths in a heuristic manner. Finally, simulation results verify that the proposed GA-3DTSP method can conserve cruise energy of mobile sink effectively.

AB Rapidly evolving information and communications technology (ICT) poses a risk to the accuracy of long-distance travel (LDT) demand forecasts. The nature of this risk is multifaceted: ICT could reduce demand if people substituted virtual for physical travel, or it could serve as a complement and thereby induce more demand. This paper presents two conceptual models for better understanding the nature of those relationships. Both models start from an existing LDT model and envision how that model can be adapted to capture ICT effects, with one considering the effects explicitly and the other implicitly. When the effects of future technology are being forecast, data collected in the past or in the present, when the future technology does not exist, are inherently limited. In such situations, conceptual models such as these can be applied by using a scenario-based approach to explore a range of reasonable outcomes. This strategy can be an important tool not just for ICT, but also for understanding the risks posed by other future technologies, such as autonomous vehicles.

DE Hydrodynamics derivatives; Captive model test; Numerical modeling; AUV;

AB Coefficients or hydrodynamic derivatives of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) play a key role in their design and maneuverability. Using a suitable method to estimate these coefficients serves as a time efficient approach to raise the achievable precision in the design and control of AUVs. This paper estimates hydrodynamic derivatives of an AUV using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for the wings and body. CFD modeling was performed to simulate captive model tests including straight line and planar motion mechanism (PMM). In such runs, the process was implemented separately for the wing and body. Experimental tests for the same AUV in the water tunnel were carried out for CFD validation. Comparing the numerical results to the experimental data, it was shown that the modeling method is able to estimate these coefficients at reasonable accuracy. The proposed modeling method was proved to be efficient in estimating hydrodynamic derivatives and hence can reduce associated computational costs with the process of detail design of AUVs.

ID MECHANISM
AB Unmanned ground vehicles are mostly wheeled, tracked, or legged. These locomotion mechanisms have a limited ability to traverse rough terrain and obstacles that are higher than the robot's center of mass. In order to improve the mobility of small robots it is necessary to expand the variety of their motion gaits. Jumping is one of nature's solutions to the challenge of mobility in difficult terrain. The desert locust is the model for the presented bio-inspired design of a jumping mechanism for a small mobile robot. The basic mechanism is similar to that of the semilunar process in the hind legs of the locust, and is based on the cocking of a torsional spring by wrapping a tendon-like wire around the shaft of a miniature motor. In this study we present the jumping mechanism design, and the manufacturing and performance analysis of two demonstrator prototypes. The most advanced jumping robot demonstrator is power autonomous, weighs 23 gr, and is capable of jumping to a height of 3.35 m, covering a distance of 1.37 m.

AB Although nonlinear H infinity (NH infinity) filters offer good performance without requiring assumptions concerning the characteristics of process and/or measurement noises, they still require additional tuning parameters that remain fixed and that need to be determined through trial and error. To address issues associated with NH infinity filters, a new SINS/GPS sensor fusion scheme known as the Fuzzy Adaptive Nonlinear H infinity (FANH infinity) filter is proposed for the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) localization problem. Based on a real-time Fuzzy Inference System (FIS), the FANH infinity filter continually adjusts the higher order of the Taylor development thorough adaptive bounds (delta(i)) and adaptive disturbance attenuation (gamma), which significantly increases the UAV localization performance. The results obtained using the FANH infinity navigation filter are compared to the NH infinity navigation filter results and are validated using a 3D UAV flight scenario. The comparison proves the efficiency and robustness of the UAV localization process using the FANH infinity filter.

DE Motion and path planning; field robotics; robotic information gathering
AB We propose three sampling-based motion planning algorithms for generating informative mobile robot trajectories. The goal is to find a trajectory that maximizes an information quality metric (e. g. variance reduction, information gain, or mutual information) and also falls within a pre-specified budget constraint (e. g. fuel, energy, or time). Prior algorithms have employed combinatorial optimization techniques to solve these problems, but existing techniques are typically restricted to discrete domains and often scale poorly in the size of the problem. Our proposed rapidly exploring information gathering (RIG) algorithms combine ideas from sampling-based motion planning with branch and bound techniques to achieve efficient information gathering in continuous space with motion constraints. We provide analysis of the asymptotic optimality of our algorithms, and we present several conservative pruning strategies for modular, submodular, and time-varying information objectives. We demonstrate that our proposed techniques find optimal solutions more quickly than existing combinatorial solvers, and we provide a proof-of-concept field implementation on an autonomous surface vehicle performing a wireless signal strength monitoring task in a lake.

AB Rhythmic motion employed in animal locomotion is ultimately controlled by neuronal circuits known as central pattern generators (CPGs). It appears that these controllers produce efficient, oscillatory command signals by entraining to an efficient or economic gait via sensory feedback. This property is of great interest in the control of autonomous vehicles. The objective of this study is to experimentally validate synthesized CPG control of a tensegrity swimmer. The prestressed cables in a tensegrity structure provide a method of simultaneous actuation and sensing, analogous to the biological motor control mechanism of regulating muscle stiffness through motoneuron activation and sensing the resulting motion by stretch receptors. A three cell, class 2 tensegrity swimmer is designed and built, and open-loop control tests characterize its swimming performance. We then determine gaits for desired entrainment, and use a graphical design method to construct and test the closed-loop system. Lastly, we perform perturbed tests of the swimmer to illustrate the robustness of CPG control.

AB The focus of marine autonomous vehicles has largely been for offshore applications. The use of such observational platforms in estuaries and coastal embayments has been limited by the designs of the widely used AUVs, which are mostly for open ocean studies. Here we discuss the development and testing of an automated unmanned boat for shallow water use for (1) current velocities using an acoustic Doppler current profiler, (2) bathymetry using an echo sounder, (3) seabed configuration using a side-scan sonar, or (4) shallow, sub-bottom stratigraphy using a chirp sonar. After 91 h and 453 km of total distance surveyed, results demonstrate the numerous advantages this automated boat (Auto-boat) possesses over manned survey vessels. For example, the Auto-boat had the advantage in the accuracy of repeating a planned route continuously over at least a tidal cycle to resolve tidal and subtidal current velocity profiles. It provides endurance, energy efficiency, ease of operation, and capability of coverage of shallow areas close to shore.

AB Over a 29-day time series in July 1999, an ocean surface current radar (OSCR) in very high frequency (VHF) mode mapped the surface velocity field at 250-m resolution at 700 cells off Fort Lauderdale, Florida. During the experiment, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), equipped with upward- and downward-looking 1.2-MHz acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), measured subsurface current structure over four to six radar cells during two mixed layer patterns on 9 and 27 July 1999. As these AUV sampling patterns were conducted over 500 m x 500 m and 500 m x 750 m areas, these missions required about 80-90 min (four radar sample intervals) to form four and seven synoptic snapshots, respectively.
   Based on autocorrelation analyses of the profiler data, along-AUV-track subsurface profiles were averaged at 10-s intervals, mapped to a surface from 1.5-6.5 m, and compared to surface currents at more than 500 points for each snapshot. Comparisons between the surface and subsurface currents from the AUV revealed spatially averaged differences ranging from 4 to 26 cm s(-1) during these two experiments. The largest differences occurred when the surface and subsurface current vectors were orthogonal; otherwise, differences were O(10 cm s(-1)). Scatterplots between 2-m and radar-derived surface currents indicated a consistent relationship with mooring data. From the seven spatial snapshots acquired during the second experiment, current profiles suggested a time-dependent oscillation that was corroborated by radar and moored ADCP data. Least squares fits of these profiles from sequential AUV snapshots to a simple model isolated an similar to9.2+/-1 h oscillation where the along-shelf current was O(50 cm s(-1)).
   Spatially averaged current profiles from four and seven snapshots were subsequently time averaged to form a mean profile from each experiment. In the downwind directions, these mean profiles were compared to a wind-driven, logarithmic layer profile in the upper 6.5 m based on a 10-m surface winds. Regression analyses suggest a slope of approximate to1.16 between the theoretical and observed mean profiles with a bias of about 3 cm s(-1). In this context, the averaged winds played a role in driving the coastal ocean circulation. These results further suggest that the spatial averaging by the radar is consistent when subsurface current variations are averaged over similar time and space scales.

AB In this paper, impulsive consensus tracking for a leader-following multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (multi-AUV) system with sampled information is studied. Two novel impulsive consensus protocols are proposed to address both the multi-AUV system recovery problem with the static leader and the formation tracking problem with the dynamic leader. It is worth noting that the proposed control protocols do not require continuous information exchange between AUVs. For the static leader case, each AUV only needs to exchange position information with its neighbors at sampling instants. For the dynamic leader case, only partial follower AUVs can obtain position information of the leader AUV at sampling instants. By using the stability theory of impulsive systems and algebraic graph theory, sufficient conditions to guarantee the leader-following consensus of the multi-AUV system are obtained. Furthermore, both the proposed algorithms can save the bandwidth of underwater acoustic communication and improve the robustness of the system. Finally, two numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical analysis.

AB Evading collisions in three-dimensional underwater environments is critical in exploration of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). In underwater environments, AUV measures an obstacle surface by utilizing a three-dimensional active sonar. This article addresses reactive collision evasion control by considering extended obstacles. Here, an extended obstacle is an arbitrary obstacle that can generate any number of measurements and not a point target generating at most one measurement. Considering 3D environments, our manuscript considers collision evasion with both moving obstacles and static obstacles. The proposed reactive collision evasion controllers are developed by considering hardware limits, such as the maximum speed or acceleration limit of an AUV. We further address how to make an AUV move towards a goal, while avoiding collision with extended obstacles. As far as we know, the proposed collision evasion controllers are novel in handling collision avoidance with an extended obstacle, in the case where an AUV measures 3D-obstacle boundaries by utilizing sonar sensors. The effectiveness of the proposed controllers is demonstrated by MATLAB simulations.

ID TIMING-DEPENDENT PLASTICITY; SYNAPSE; IMPLEMENTATION; FREQUENCY
AB Polarization is a common and unique phenomenon in nature, which reveals more camouflage features of objects. However, current polarization-perceptual devices based on conventional physical architectures face enormous challenges for high-performance computation due to the traditional von Neumann bottleneck. In this work, a novel polarization-perceptual neuro-transistor with reconfigurable anisotropic vision is proposed based on a two-dimensional ReS2 phototransistor. The device exhibits excellent photodetection ability and superior polarization sensitivity due to its direct band gap semiconductor property and strong anisotropic crystal structure, respectively. The fascinating polarization-sensitive neuromorphic behavior, such as polarization memory consolidation and reconfigurable visual imaging, are successfully realized. In particular, the regulated polarization responsivity and dichroic ratio are successfully emulated through our artificial compound eyes. More importantly, two intriguing polarization-perceptual applications for polarized navigation with reconfigurable adaptive learning abilities and three-dimensional visual polarization imaging are also experimentally demonstrated. The proposed device may provide a promising opportunity for future polarization perception systems in intelligent humanoid robots and autonomous vehicles.

AB Magmatic and tectonic processes can contribute to discontinuous crustal accretion and play an important role in hydrothermal circulation at ultraslow-spreading ridges, however, it is difficult to accurately describe the processes without an age framework to constrain crustal evolution. Here we report on a multi-scale magnetic survey that provides constraints on the fine-scale evolution of a detachment faulting system that hosts hydrothermal activity at 49.7 degrees E on the Southwest Indian Ridge. Reconstruction of the multi-stage detachment faulting history shows a previous episode of detachment faulting took place 0.76 similar to 1.48 My BP, while the present fault has been active for the past similar to 0.33 My and is just in the prime of life. This fault sustains hydrothermal circulation that has the potential for developing a large sulfide deposit. High resolution multiscale magnetics allows us to constrain the relative balance between periods of detachment faulting and magmatism to better describe accretionary processes on an ultraslow spreading ridge.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Occupancy grids are common tools used in robotics to represent the robot environment, and that may be used to plan trajectories, select additional measurements to acquire, etc. However, deriving information about those occupancy grids from sensor measurements often induce a lot of uncertainty, especially for grid elements that correspond to occluded or far away area from the robot. This means that occupancy information may be quite uncertain and imprecise at some places, while being very accurate at others. Modelling finely this occupancy information is essential to decide the optimal action the robot should take, but a refined modelling of uncertainty often implies a higher computational cost, a prohibitive feature for real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce the notion of credal occupancy grids, using the very general theory of imprecise probabilities to model occupancy uncertainty. We also show how one can perform efficient, real-time inferences with such a model, and show a use-case applying the model to an autonomous vehicle trajectory planning problem.

AB A search method for uncertain targets using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is studied. To improve search efficiency, a cooperative search method based on target clustering and path optimization is proposed to reduce reactive consumption and obtain more revenue. Firstly, all the target grids are connected and the target areas are clustered according to the theory of minimum spanning tree. Secondly, the moving paths of AUVs are studied and divided into two stages: transferring to a target area and detecting in a target grid. And both of the stages are then optimized. Finally, a series of experiments in different cases are carried out, and the cooperative search method through target clustering and path optimization is compared with another two algorithms. Results show that the cooperative search method proposed in this paper can obtain a larger amount of total revenue in the same period of time with more stable performance than the other algorithms. It is proved that this method conduces to a more thorough search of the target areas.

ID MELTING PROBE; ICES; EXPLORATION
AB Exploring the ice surface of Europa and other icy moons will be scientifically exciting, but very challenging for mobile autonomous robotics. This paper presents a new concept to address the challenge of moving across vacuum-exposed cryogenic ice terrains - a thermal pick that functions both as a thermal drill and an ice anchor.
   Earlier investigators demonstrated that cryogenic ice can be thermally drilled in simulated planetary conditions, but the efficiency was found to be a hindrance for power-limited systems. A rover on Europa may need to drill and anchor many times throughout the lifetime of the vehicle, so the primary focus of this work is reducing the energy cost of operation. Using the thermal drill as an anchor also adds a new requirement, maintaining the structural integrity of the ice. This work demonstrates a highly efficient (up to 50%) intermittent mode of operation for thermal drilling as well as an approach to avoiding degradation of the ice structure. This allows for anchoring strengths in excess of 130 N, which is the weight of 100 kg on Europa.

AB Multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (multi-AUV) target search is the important element to realise underwater rescue, underwater detection. To improve the efficiency of the multi-AUV target search in three-dimensional underwater environments, a potential field hierarchical reinforcement learning approach is proposed in this paper. Unlike other algorithms that need repeated training in the choice of parameters, the proposed approach obtains all the required parameters automatically through learning. By integrating segmental options with the traditional hierarchy reinforcement learning (HRL) algorithm, the potential field hierarchy is built. The potential field is implemented in the parameters of the HRL, which provides with reasonable paths of the target search for the unexplored environments. In search tasks, the designed method can control the multi-AUV system to find the target effectively. The simulation results show that the proposed approach is capable of controlling multi-AUV to achieve search task of multiple targets with higher efficiency and adaptability compared with the HRL algorithm and the lawn-mowing algorithm.

ID EDGE-DETECTION; UNDERWATER; REDUCTION
AB Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) is a sensor that was designed for hydrographic survey of the seabed. It detects small targets, enabling high geometric resolution images. However, the images generated by SAS are susceptible to speckle noise, which makes digital processing difficult, since the noises are confused with the targets of interest. The goal of this study was to develop a semi-automatic routine for SAS image processing to verify the structural integrity of submarine pipelines. The method presented incorporates four stages: pre-processing to reduce noise and highlight the targets of interest; extraction of features aiming to recognize features related to the pipelines; post-processing to reduce the fragmentation generated during feature extraction; validation to quantify the results from the reference images to estimate the performance of the proposed methodology. The results showed that more than 80% of the submarine pipelines were mapped in the semi-automatic mode, which considerably reduced the time needed to manually identify a large number of pipelines operating on offshore oilfields.

DE Motion and path planning; deep learning in robotics and automation
ID TRACKING
AB Pedestrian motion prediction is a fundamental task for autonomous robots and vehicles to operate safely. In recent years many complex approaches based on neural networks have been proposed to address this problem. In this work we show that - surprisingly - a simple Constant Velocity Model can outperform even state-of-the-art neural models. This indicates that either neural networks are not able to make use of the additional information they are provided with, or that this information is not as relevant as commonly believed. Therefore, we analyze how neural networks process their input and how it impacts their predictions. Our analysis reveals pitfalls in training neural networks for pedestrian motion prediction and clarifies false assumptions about the problem itself. In particular, neural networks implicitly learn environmental priors that negatively impact their generalization capability, the motion history of pedestrians is irrelevant and interactions are too complex to predict. Our work shows how neural networks for pedestrian motion prediction can be thoroughly evaluated and our results indicate which research directions for neural motion prediction are promising in future.

ID REGISTRATION; MANIPULATION; NAVIGATION; LOCALIZATION
AB This paper presents experimental results using a newly developed 3D underwater laser scanner mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for real-time simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The algorithm consists of registering point clouds using a dual step procedure. First, a feature-based coarse alignment is performed, which is then refined using iterative closest point. The robot position is estimated using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) that fuses the data coming from navigation sensors of the AUV. Moreover, the pose from where each point cloud was collected is also stored in the pose-based EKF-SLAM state vector. The results of the registration algorithm are used as constraint observations among the different poses within the state vector, solving the full-SLAM problem. The method is demonstrated using the Girona 500 AUV, equipped with a laser scanner and inspecting a 3D sub-sea infrastructure inside a water tank. Our results prove that it is possible to limit the navigation drift and deliver a consistent high-accuracy 3D map of the inspected object.

AB With the advent of autonomous vehicles imminent, a solid-state approach to beam steering is necessary for more affordable lidar tracking systems. Capable of dynamic control of light with subwavelength components, electrically tunable metamaterials show potential in this field as well as other applications. Here, we demonstrate a nanopillar-based metamaterial composed of Ge and Al-doped ZnO (AZO), whose optical properties can be modulated by the field effect and whose fabrication process is compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. From reflectance spectra, wavelength shifts up to 240 nm of the optical resonances are measured in our fabricated device with gate biases from 4 to 4 V. A high differential reflectance of more than 40% in this voltage range is experimentally shown. Then, through an effective medium approximation, we can describe the nanopillar array as a macroscopic metamaterial and calculate the phase shift of this device. With optimization of the nanopillar parameters, a large phase modulation approaching 270 is possible according to simulations, which is promising for beam steering applications.

AB Due to the changes in the soil, speed and hitch forces, the dynamics of a farm tractor are constantly changing making the design of an autonomous lane-tracking controller a very complex task. To be able to react to those changes, this paper presents a new adaptive system based on a self-tuning regulator made up of a recursive least squares parameter identification algorithm for the plant combined with a minimum-degree pole placement (MDPP) method for changing the parameters of a digital RST controller in real time. The MDPP is computed by solving the Diophantine equation for the desired closed-loop reference model. The results presented show how the system is able to adapt the control parameters for different speeds and changes in the hitch cornering stiffness. As future work, this method could also be applied and assessed as a general controller, covering different sizes and different types of steering systems for off-road vehicles.

AB Autonomous planetary landing is a critical phase in every exploratory space mission. Autopilots have to be safe, reliable, energy saving, and as light as possible. The 2-D guidance, navigation, and control strategy presented here makes use of biologically inspired landing processes. Based solely on the relative visual motion known as optic flow (OF), assessed with minimalistic 6-pixel 1-D OF sensors and inertial measurement unit measurements, an optimal reference trajectory in terms of the mass was defined for the approach phase. Linear and nonlinear control laws were then implemented to track the optimal trajectory. To deal with the demanding weight constraints, a new method of OF estimation was applied, based on a nongimbaled OF sensor configuration and a linear least-squares algorithm. The promising results obtained with software-in-the-loop simulations showed that the present full guidance, navigation, and control solution combined with our OF bio-inspired sensors is compatible with soft, fuel-efficient lunar spacecraft landing and might also be used as a backup solution in case of conventional-sensor failure.

AB Image montage (or mosaic) rinds a great deal of applications in ophthalmology, digital terrain mapping, and in autonomous navigation of re-entry vehicles. However, there is no direct method available for image montage preparation. Image registration methods may be used to solve this problem, but most of these methods are not useful, because they require either specific feature points in images or a great deal of overlapping between images of neighboring regions.
   A normalized correlation method is used for the preparation of montages when there is no rotational shirt between neighboring images. A pyramidal approach is developed to reduce the computation. Further, a new method is developed for montage preparation when there is also a relational shift between two neighboring regions.
   Different sets of subimages, which have both rotational and translational shifts with the subimages of neighboring regions, are taken for preparing image montages. The proposed method does not require any human supervision and the results are found to be very accurate.

AB This study investigated the squeal mechanism induced by friction in a lead screw system. The dynamic instability in the friction noise model of the lead screw was derived through a complex eigenvalue analysis via a finite element model. A two degree of freedom model was described to analyze the closed solutions generated in the lead screw, and the friction noise sensitivity was examined. The analysis showed that the main source of friction noise in the lead screw was the bending mode pair, and friction-induced instability occurred when the ratio of the stiffness of the bending pair modes was 0.9-1. We also built an architecture to predict multiple outputs from a single model using deep neural networks and demonstrated that friction-induced instability can be predicted by deep neural networks. In particular, instability with nonlinearity was predicted very accurately by deep neural networks with a maximum absolute difference of about 0.035.

AB AI-based technology in our everyday lives is an emerging issue in business research with a lot of potential for businesses and users. However, there is a lack of frameworks that enable UX designers and product developers to create AI-based products with elements of appearance that induce desired emotions and institute effective human-machine communication. Drawing on the AI archetype concept, this research advances a four-stage personality-grounded framework for forming the specific AI-based product appearance with six dimensions that evoke specific emotions incorporating the stakeholders' input. The framework application is illustrated using a single classical case study of the rescue and accident robot. The profile of an AI-based rescue robot that elicits trust and is recognized by human unconsciousness is generated through in-depth interviews with United Arab Emirates citizens. The application of the proposed personality-grounded framework can be extended not only to robots helping in different contexts in airports, police stations, and response centers but to broader categories of AI-based products.

AB This paper studies an integrated human-robot routing problem arising in collaborative order picking systems. Travelling routes of pickers and robots interact with each other and simultaneously determine the start time of tasks. A mixed-integer programming model is proposed which aims to minimize the total task completion time by optimizing both pickers' and robots' routes. Moreover, a variable neighborhood search and dynamic programming -based heuristic algorithm is developed for solving the problem in large-scale environments. Numerical experiments are conducted to prove the necessity of the proposed model and also validate the efficiency of the proposed heuristic algorithm. The results indicate the methodology can yields solutions with smaller optimality gap within a reasonable period of time, in comparison with an intuitive but common decision rule. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to derive a number of managerial implications regarding the configuration of pickers and robots and robots' speed setting.

AB Deep neural networks provide excellent performance in pattern recognition, audio classification, and image recognition. It is important that they accurately recognize input data, particularly when they are used in autonomous vehicles or for medical services. In this study, we propose a data correction method for increasing the accuracy of an unknown classifier by modifying the input data without changing the classifier. This method modifies the input data slightly so that the unknown classifier will correctly recognize the input data. It is an ensemble method that has the characteristic of transferability to an unknown classifier by generating corrected data that are correctly recognized by several classifiers that are known in advance. We tested our method using MNIST and CIFAR-10 as experimental data. The experimental results exhibit that the accuracy of the unknown classifier is a 100% correct recognition rate owing to the data correction generated by the proposed method, which minimizes data distortion to maintain the data's recognizability by humans.

DE Automotive networks safety-critical mode-change
ID REAL-TIME SYSTEMS
AB Application of Ethernet-based networks in the autonomous and automated vehicles requires safe and efficient resource management policy. The network components must not only handle high volume of sensor data but also safely accommodate dynamics in system behavior, e.g. detect permanent failures, switch between different driving modes (city/highway), incorporate car-2-x communication etc. This is currently manageable only by using static network configuration, due to the safety concerns, leading to resource overprovisioning under almost all conditions or unfulfilled design requirements. In this work we present an alternative solution which, through protocol-based synchronization and fine-grained re-configuration, allows traffic isolation, fault recovery and controlled adjustments of network performance. This enables cost saving, multi-mode network functionality at low overhead as well as new system functions and improved user experience by dynamic over-the-air network operation. We offer a detailed evaluation of our approach in a demonstrator setup as well as a simulation and comparison with state-of-the-art approaches.

AB The flight of monarch butterflies is characterized by a relatively large wing, flapping at a relatively low frequency coupled with abdomen undulation. This paper presents the dynamics of a flapping wing flyer that can be applied to the coupled motion of the wing, body, and abdomen at the monarch butterfly scale, which is formulated directly on the configuration manifold. The resulting thorax and abdomen motion as well as the resultant forces are consistent with the flight of a live monarch butterfly. Based on these, beneficial effects of the abdomen undulation in the flight of monarch butterflies are illustrated. For both hover and forward-climbing trajectories, the abdomen undulation results in a reduction of the energy and power consumption. Furthermore, the Floquet stability analysis shows that the periodic orbits associated with both flight modes are stable. In particular, the abdomen undulation improves the stability. Compared to the dynamics of hawkmoth, bumblebee, and fruitfly models, the monarch possesses superior stability properties.

DT Article
DE Motion and path planning; autonomous vehicle navigation; aerial systems;
   applications
AB Gradient-based planners are widely used for quadrotor local planning, in which a Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) is crucial for evaluating gradient magnitude and direction. Nevertheless, computing such a field has much redundancy since the trajectory optimization procedure only covers a very limited subspace of the ESDF updating range. In this letter, an ESDF-free gradient-based planning framework is proposed, which significantly reduces computation time. The main improvement is that the collision term in penalty function is formulated by comparing the colliding trajectory with a collision-free guiding path. The resulting obstacle information will be stored only if the trajectory hits new obstacles, making the planner only extract necessary obstacle information. Then, we lengthen the time allocation if dynamical feasibility is violated. An anisotropic curve fitting algorithm is introduced to adjust higher order derivatives of the trajectory while maintaining the original shape. Benchmark comparisons and real-world experiments verify its robustness and high-performance. The source code is released as ros packages.

AB High accuracy and reliable navigation in the underwater environment is very critical for the operations of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). This paper proposes an adaptive federated interacting multiple model (IMM) filter, which combines adaptive federated filter and IMM algorithm for AUV in complex underwater environments. Based on the performance of each local system, the information sharing coefficient of the adaptive federated IMM filter is adaptively determined. Meanwhile, the adaptive federated IMM filter designs different models for each local system. When the external disturbances change, the model of each local system can switch in real-time. Furthermore, an AUV integrated navigation system model is constructed, which includes the dynamic model of the system error and the measurement models of strapdown inertial navigation system/Doppler velocity log (SINS/DVL) and SINS/terrain aided navigation (SINS/TAN). The integrated navigation experiments demonstrate that the proposed filter can dramatically improve the accuracy and reliability of the integrated navigation system. Additionally, it has obvious advantages compared with the federated Kalman filter and the adaptive federated Kalman filter.

AB This article presents the experimental assessment of a hash-based loop closure detection methodology for visualsimultaneous localization and mapping(SLAM), addressed to underwater autonomous vehicles. This methodology uses a new global image descriptor callednet hash-based loop closure(NetHALOC), which is learned with a simple and fastconvolutional neural network. The results using NetHALOC have been compared with the results using three different top-quality state-of-the-art global image descriptors:Net vector of locally aggregated descriptors,hash-based loop closureanddeep loop closure. The transformation from images to hashes implies a considerable reduction of data to be processed, shared, compared and transmitted in global navigation, localization or mapping tasks. Complete tests with an extensive set of real underwater imagery were done to compare the performance of the defined loop closure detection approach using the aforementioned four hashing techniques, in order to conclude which of them is the more adequate for visual SLAM applications under the sea.

AB Wireless solar blind ultraviolet (UV) scattering communication is a new type of atmosphere optics communication technology with the important and potential advantages of all-weather, non-line-of-sight and secret communication, which is suitable for the needs of cluster security of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) formation flight. UV communication technology can be applied to share UAVs status information, combined with efficient formation control method can achieve autonomous assembly, collision avoidance and formation keeping in UAV formation flight. In order to avoid the collision avoidance problem between the UAVs in the classic formation control algorithm. In this paper, the artificial potential function of the formation control algorithm is improved and the improved algorithm is applied to a single virtual leader UAV and multi-virtual leader UAVs. The simulation results show that the algorithm can ensure that the UAVs speed in the formation is consistent with the speed of the virtual leader UAV. In the course of the flight, the UAVs can avoid collision. Finally, the formation flight is completed with the desired formation.

AB In this work, we develop a novel decentralized coordination algorithm for a team of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to surveil an aggressive forest wildfire. For dangerous environmental processes that occur over very large areas, like forest wildfires, multi-agent systems cannot rely on long-range communication networks. Therefore, our framework is formulated for very restrictive communication constraints: UAVs are only able to communicate when they are physically close to each other. To accommodate this constraint, the UAVs schedule a time and place to meet in the future to guarantee that they will be able to meet up again and share their belief of the wildfire state. In contrast with prior work, we allow for a discrete time, discrete space Markov model with a large state space as well as restrictive communication constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using simulations of a wildfire model that has 10(298) total states.

AB Aiming at the difficulty in locating and identifying the faults of oil-immersed transformers, a new spherical submersible transformer inspection robot is designed. The robot has a spherical structure with a zero turn radius, which ensures its flexible motion. It is a difficult problem for the underactuated spherical robot to realize the hovering control for identifying transformer fault points. To address the problem, the dynamic model and kinematics equations of the robot are derived by the hydrodynamic theory at first. Then, an adaptive sliding mode backstepping control (ASMBC) is used to design the cascade control system. The cascade control system consists of the depth control and the yaw control. The performance of the controller is verified by both simulation and real experiments. The simulation experimental results demonstrate that ASMBC controller is superior to the single neuron PID. The tank trials results show that the movement of the robot is flexible, and the hover control can satisfy the requirement of fault observation tasks.

AB Deliberative capabilities are essential for intelligent aerial robotic applications in modern life such as package delivery and surveillance. This paper presents a real-time 3D path planning solution for multirotor aerial robots to obtain a feasible, optimal and collision-free path in complex dynamic environments. High-level geometric primitives are employed to compactly represent the situation, which includes self-situation of the robot and situation of the obstacles in the environment. A probabilistic graph is utilized to sample the admissible space without taking into account the existing obstacles. Whenever a planning query is received, the generated probabilistic graph is then explored by an A discrete search algorithm with an artificial field map as cost function in order to obtain a raw optimal collision-free path, which is subsequently shortened. Realistic simulations in V-REP simulator have been created to validate the proposed path planning solution, integrating it into a fully autonomous multirotor aerial robotic system.

AB A comprehensive algorithm to compute the minimum distance between a given point in the plane and an assigned clothoid spiral curve is herein proposed. The projection of the point on the curve is also solved. The solution is relevant in many applications ranging from robotics to autonomous vehicles. The minimization is formulated as a root-finding problem which typically has multiple solutions associated to local minima. A proper interval for the curvilinear abscissa, that contains the global solution is recognized. Due to its spiraling path, the clothoid has a low curvature region near the inflection point and a high curvature region around points at infinity, where the revolving curve shows many potential solutions. The transition from a clothoid to an arc of circle and from an arc of circle to a straight line-which are particular cases of clothoids-is smoothly computed. The present algorithm is validated with extensive numerical tests and is proved much better than brute force algorithms. The present results confirm the better efficiency of the proposed method in terms of accuracy, convergence and computational times.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB Automatic detection of underwater objects by sonar images is an important and challenging topic in applications of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) under the complex marine environment. A detection method is proposed based on Multi-Scale Multi-Column Convolution Neural Networks (MSMC-CNNs). Firstly, the Multi-Scale Multi-Column CNNs is used to form an encoder network for extracting multi-scale features of the sonar image. Secondly, the bicubic linear interpolation algorithm is used as the deconvolution process of the decoder networks to restore the sonar image size and resolution. Moreover, a novel transfer learning manner based on progressive fine-tuning to accelerate the model training. Finally, the proposed method is validated on the sonar image dataset and is compared with other existing detection methods. The pixel accuracy (PA) of MSMC-CNNs for different categories sonar image is over 95. The experiment results show that the MSMC-CNNs model has better detection effect and more robustness to noise.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Real-time traffic sign detection and recognition has been receiving increasingly more attention in recent years due to the popularity of driver-assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes an accurate and efficient traffic sign detection technique by exploring AdaBoost and support vector regression (SVR) for discriminative detector learning. Different from the reported traffic sign detection techniques, a novel saliency estimation approach is first proposed, where a new saliency model is built based on the traffic sign-specific color, shape, and spatial information. By incorporating the saliency information, enhanced feature pyramids are built to learn an AdaBoost model that detects a set of traffic sign candidates from images. A novel iterative codeword selection algorithm is then designed to generate a discriminative codebook for the representation of sign candidates, as detected by the AdaBoost, and an SVR model is learned to identify the real traffic signs from the detected sign candidates. Experiments on three public data sets show that the proposed traffic sign detection technique is robust and obtains superior accuracy and efficiency.

AB Voluntary movement is a result of signals transmitted through a communication channel that links the internal world in our minds to the physical world around us. Intention can be considered the desire to effect change on our environment, and this is contained in the signals from the brain, passed through the nervous system to converge on muscles that generate displacements and forces on our surroundings. The resulting changes in the world act to generate sensations that feed back to the nervous system, closing the control loop. This Perspective discusses the experimental and theoretical underpinnings of current models of movement generation and the way they are modulated by external information. Movement systems embody intentionality and prediction, two factors that are propelling a revolution in engineering. Development of movement models that include the complexities of the external world may allow a better understanding of the neuronal populations regulating these processes, as well as the development of solutions for autonomous vehicles and robots, and neural prostheses for those who are motor impaired.

AB This paper describes the use of an optimization method to effectively reduce the required bathymetric sampling for forcing a numerical forecast model by using the model's sensitivity to this input. A genetic algorithm is developed to gradually evolve the survey path for a ship, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), or other measurement platform to an optimum, with the resulting effect of the corresponding measured bathymetry on the model used as a metric. Starting from an initial simulated set of possible random or heuristic sampling paths over the given bathymetry using certain constraints like limited length of track, the algorithm can be used to arrive at the path that would provide the best possible input to the model under those constraints. This suitability is tested by a comparison of the model results obtained by using these new simulated observations, with the results obtained using the most recent and complete bathymetric data available. Two test study areas were considered, and the algorithm was found to consistently converge to a sampling pattern that best captured the bathymetric variability critical to the model prediction.

ID NONHOLONOMIC SYSTEMS
AB While the nonholonomic robots with no-slipping constraints are studied extensively nowadays, the slipping effect is inevitable in many practical applications and should be considered necessarily to achieve autonomous navigation and control purposes especially in outdoor environments. In this paper the robust point stabilization problem of a tracked mobile robot is discussed in the presence of track slipping, which can be treated as model perturbation that violates the pure nonholonomic constraints. The kinematic model of the tracked vehicle is created, in which the slipping is assumed to be a time-varying parameter under certain assumptions of track-soil interaction. By transforming the original system to the special chained form of nonholonomic system, the integrator backstepping procedure with a state-scaling technique is used to construct the controller to stabilize the system at the kinematic level. The global exponential stability of the final system can be guaranteed by Lyapunov theory. Simulation results with different initial states and slipping parameters demonstrate the fast convergence, robustness and insensitivity to the initial state of the proposed method.

ID MOBILE ROBOTS; BEHAVIOR; ARCHITECTURE; VEHICLE; MODEL
AB In this paper we show how non-linear attractor dynamics can be used as a framework to control teams of autonomous mobile robots that should navigate according to a predefined geometric formation. The environment does not need to be known a priori and may change over time. Implicit to the control architecture are some important features such as establishing and moving the formation, split and join of formations (when necessary to avoid obstacles). Formations are defined by a formation matrix. By manipulating this formation matrix it is also possible to switch formations at run time. Examples of simulation results and implementations with real robots (teams of Khepera robots and medium size mobile robots), demonstrate formation switch, static and dynamic obstacle avoidance and split and join formations without the need for any explicit coordination scheme. Robustness against environmental perturbations is intrinsically achieved because the behaviour of each robot is generated as a time series of asymptotically stable states, which contribute to the asymptotic stability of the overall control system.

AB In order to apply "eyes" to an autonomous running vehicle, a real-time range finder has been developed that can measure both the distance to every point on a plane without any pattern and its inclination. Although it seems contrary to the fact that the parallax is inversely proportional to the distance, this paper derives the mathematical ground that a plane in a real 3-D space (X, Y, Z) is mapped also into the plane in a spatial parallax (x, y, Deltax). On this basis, an electronic circuit has been manufactured which can compute in video rate the interpolation value between the parallaxes at two characteristic points by using several programmable logic devices. It has also been demonstrated that this device is applicable to the measurements of the slant angles of and the directions normal to a simple plane or a slightly curved surface.

AB The emerging field of service robots demands new systems with increased flexibility. The flexibility of a robot system can be increased in many different ways. Mobile manipulation-the coordinated use of manipulation capabilities and mobility-is an approach to increase robots flexibility with regard to their motion capabilities. Most mobile manipulators that are currently under development use a single arm on a mobile platform. The use of a two-arm manipulator system allows increased manipulation capabilities, especially when large, heavy, or non-rigid objects must be manipulated. This article is concerned with motion control for mobile two-arm systems. These systems require new schemes for motion coordination and control. A coordination scheme called transparent coordination is presented that allows for an arbitrary number of manipulators on a mobile platform. Furthermore, a reactive control scheme is proposed to enable the platform to support sensor-guided manipulator motion. Finally, this article introduces a collision avoidance scheme for mobile two-arm robots. This scheme surveys the vehicle motion to avoid platform collisions and arm collisions caused by self-motion of the robot. (C) 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB Under complex underwater conditions, multiple AUVs work in one area and they need to cooperate for complicated missions. In this study, a design method was applied for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that are distributed in an area and suddenly receive a command. Using this method, the AUVs work according to their own state and reach the target while avoiding obstacles automatically in the process of collection. A new optimal control method is proposed that achieves the consensus of multiple AUVs as well as offering obstacle avoidance capability with minimal control effort. A non-quadratic obstacle avoidance cost function was constructed from the perspective of inverse optimal control. The distributed analytic optimal control law depends only on the local information that can be generated by the communication topology, which guarantees the proposed behavior, so that the control law does not require information from all AUVs. A simulation and an experiment were performed to verify the consensus and obstacle avoidance effect.

AB In this paper, an event-triggered finite-time controller is proposed for solving the formation control problems of underactuated multiple autonomous surface vessels (ASVs), including asymmetric mass matrix, collision avoidance, maintaining communication distances and prescribed performance. First, to not only avoid collisions between the follower and leader but also maintain an effective communication distance, a desired tracking distance is designed to be maintained. Second, an improved barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is proposed to implement the tracking error constraint. In addition, the relative threshold event-triggering strategy effectively solves the communication pressure problem and greatly saves communication resources. Finally, based on coordinate transformation, line of sight (LOS) and dynamic surface control (DSC), a comprehensive finite-time formation control method is proposed to avoid collisions and maintain communication distance. All the signals of the proposed control system can be stabilized in finite time (PFS). The numerical simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control system.

AB In many industrial practices, it needs a permanent magnet synchronous motor to provide enough torque, such as autonomous vehicle driving. In the operation of a permanent magnet synchronous motor, the nonlinearly parameterized-uncertainties degrade control performances, causing the instability of motor speed and output torques. Based on the analysis of temperature effects and friction torque model, a composite controller is proposed in this paper which considers model uncertainties and external disturbances. An adaptive controller involving an online time-varying scaling gain is employed to eliminate the influence of nonlinearly parameterized-uncertainties. In addition, an extended state observer (ESO) is used to estimate the disturbance in the control system in which the estimated value is used to compensate for the feed-forward. Numerical simulation and experiment are performed and the results show that the proposed method may alleviate the performance degradation due to nonlinearly parameterized-uncertainties and disturbances. Simultaneously, it may improve the stability and anti-disturbance capacities of the system.

AB Accurate estimation of timing is essential for positioning in cellular systems because propagation delays from neighboring base stations are used to calculate the position of a mobile station. A preamble design technique for accurate timing estimation in cellular systems with high mobility, such as autonomous driving and unmanned aerial vehicles, is proposed herein. A generalized Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence is defined and decomposed into multiple short subsequences to reduce the Doppler effect on the timing estimation. The performance loss caused by the short sequence length is compensated by combining the subsequences using the repetition property of the ZC sequence. The properties of autocorrelation and cross-correlation of the generalized ZC sequence that employs a receiver processing (RP) scheme (subsequence decomposition and combining) are analyzed in the presence of Doppler. Finally, the suitability of the proposed sequence with the RP scheme, for accurate timing estimation in multicell environments with a high Doppler, is demonstrated using simulation results.

Findings from a large-scale survey of 1,006 adult Singaporeans indicate that public willingness to use driverless cars was strongly related to value predispositions, especially affect. Aside from having a direct relationship with willingness to use driverless cars, this study found that affect also had an indirect relationship with willingness to use driverless cars via benefit perceptions. Meanwhile, findings failed to reveal significant relationships between two types of science knowledge and willingness to use driverless cars. The findings shed light on the current public opinion on driverless cars in Singapore and lend support to the cognitive miser model over the scientific literacy model. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work addresses the problem of information distribution in multi-robot systems, with an emphasis on multi-UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) applications. We present an analytical model that helps evaluate and compare different information distribution schemes in a robotic mission. It serves as a unified framework to represent the usefulness (utility) of each message exchanged by the robots. It can be used either on its own in order to assess the information distribution efficacy or as a building block of solutions aimed at optimizing information distribution. Moreover, we present multiple examples of instantiating the model for specific missions. They illustrate various approaches to defining the utility of different information types. Finally, we introduce a proof of concept showing the applicability of the model in a robotic system by implementing it in Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) and performing a simple simulated mission using a network emulator. We believe the introduced model can serve as a basis for further research on generic solutions for assessing or optimizing information distribution.

AB In deep ocean scenario where drift of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle(AUV) localization system can be fast since no bottom tracking data can be obtained by Doppler Velocity Logger(DVL), missions for AUV are either hardly to be carried out or depended on expensive inertial instruments. This paper presents a multi-AUVs cooperative ocean current estimation method by formulating factor graphs and solving nonlinear optimization problems which can be used for typical applications such as formation maneuvering and cooperative target searching. Considering that only intermittent information is broadcasted by acoustic modems, observability of the system in each case is analyzed with designed simple formation switching strategies. With the help of water tracking velocity acquired by Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler(ADCP) and estimation of ocean current, accuracy of AUV localization system can be improved to an acceptable level for formation control and reliable position of the target can be obtained even with accumulated clock error. At last, field data based simulations have been carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed methodology.

AB A mathematical description of the intersection of a transmitted beam and a beam-like field of view between two stationary, coplanar, circularly scanning light detection and ranging (lidar) devices is presented. This beam intersection information establishes when scattered signal interference between two lidar devices can occur. Such interference may result in erroneous range data. The fraction of time over which the scanners' beams intersect is analyzed as a function of rotational frequencies and their reference phases. It is shown that the minima and maxima of this fraction are 0 and 1/2, with most configurations resulting near 1/4. A procedure to adjust the scan rates and phases to minimize this intersection time (including zero intersection) thus reducing the risk of mutual interference is also outlined. Four configurations that produce zero intersection between two scanners are presented. Configurations of three and four scanners are also presented for which no intersections between the scanners' transmission paths occur.

AB This paper presents a system capable of autonomous surveillance and analysis of coral reef ecosystems using natural lighting. We describe our strategy to safely and effectively deploy a small marine robot to inspect a reef using its digital cameras. Image analysis using a (RBF-SVM) radial basis function-support vector machines in combination with (LBP) local binary pattern, Gabor and Hue descriptors developed in this work are able to analyze the resulting image data automatically and reliably by learning from the annotations of expert marine biologists. Our primary evaluation is performed on a novel coral data set that we collected during a series of robotic ocean deployments, the MRL Coral Identification Challenge. We have also applied our algorithms to a data set of coral imagery previously published by other researchers. Our algorithms recognize coral images in our own challenging data with 88.9% accuracy, while being sufficiently efficient to run online on our vehicle. This demonstrates the feasibility of such a system for practical use for the preservation of this crucial ecological resource. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

DE Underwater acoustic sensor network; harmony search algorithm;
   multi-population; dynamic optimization
ID DEPLOYMENT
AB Like wireless sensor networks, lifetime of sensors is the main constraint for performance of underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs). Most previous works on UASNs did not consider dynamics of networks, i.e., as time goes by, in practice, part of sensors may be malfunctioned, deplete their battery power, or get lost due to violent underwater environment changes. Therefore, this paper considers a UASN in ocean and proposes a sleep scheduling scheme in which sensor nodes and autonomous underwater vehicles in this network can dynamically choose to sleep or work to adapt to the environmental change. The concerned problem is to dynamically determine a sufficient number of active nodes in the UASN at different times, such that the targets required to be detected are covered. A special static scenario of the problem has been shown to be NP-complete. Hence, this paper proposes an improved multi-population harmony search algorithm to solve this dynamic problem. By simulation, the proposed algorithm shows high performance in terms of extending network lifetime, robustness, and computing time.

AB It presents a method of multi-objective optimization, applied to energy consumption of open kinematic chains, analyzing the case of the movement of an extremity of a walking electro-hydraulic robot. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, it is applied in two cases of displacement. The first case shows the movement of the extremity without obstacles in its workspace and the second includes the evasion of an obstacle. The minimization of angular displacement of the links with higher energy consumption and the minimization of the maximum absolute value of the angular acceleration of the links are used as optimization criteria. In both cases a trajectory that reduces energy consumption by more than 25% over the other methods proposed in the literature, at the same time the dynamic behavior of the system by avoiding variations in the speed and the acceleration is improved during the phase of transference, besides increasing the precision and accuracy of the foot position.

AB This paper introduces a comparison of training algorithms of radial basis function (RBF) neural networks for classification purposes. RBF networks provide effective solutions in many science and engineering fields. They are especially popular in the pattern classification and signal processing areas. Several algorithms have been proposed for training RBF networks. The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is a new, very simple and robust population based optimization algorithm that is inspired by the intelligent behavior of honey bee swarms. The training performance of the ABC algorithm is compared with the Genetic algorithm, Kalman filtering algorithm and gradient descent algorithm. In the experiments, not only well known classification problems from the UCI repository such as the Iris, Wine and Glass datasets have been used, but also an experimental setup is designed and inertial sensor based terrain classification for autonomous ground vehicles was also achieved. Experimental results show that the use of the ABC algorithm results in better learning than those of others.

DT Article
DE Localization; SLAM; deep learning methods
AB High-precision vehicle localization with commercial setups is a crucial technique for high-level autonomous driving tasks. As a newly emerged approach, monocular localization in LiDAR map achieves promising balance between cost and accuracy, but estimating pose by finding correspondences between such cross-modal sensor data is challenging, thereby damaging the localization accuracy. In this letter, we address the problem by proposing a novel Transformer-based neural network to register 2D images into 3D LiDAR map in an end-to-end manner. We first implicitly represent poses as high-dimensional feature vectors called pose queries and gradually optimize poses by interacting with the retrieved relevant information from cross-modal features using attention mechanism in a proposed POse Estimator Transformer (POET) module. Moreover, we apply a multiple hypotheses aggregation method that estimates the final poses by performing parallel optimization on multiple randomly initialized pose queries to reduce the network uncertainty. Comprehensive analysis and experimental results on public benchmarks conclude that the proposed image-to-LiDAR map localization network could achieve state-of-the-art performances in challenging cross-modal localization tasks.

However, the single-camera 3D object detection algorithm in the roadside monitoring scenario provides stereo perception of traffic objects, offering more accurate collection and analysis of traffic information to ensure reliable support for urban traffic safety. In this paper, we propose the YOLOv7-3D algorithm specifically designed for single-camera 3D object detection from a roadside viewpoint. Our approach utilizes various information, including 2D bounding boxes, projected corner keypoints, and offset vectors relative to the center of the 2D bounding boxes, to enhance the accuracy of 3D object bounding box detection. Additionally, we introduce a 5-layer feature pyramid network (FPN) structure and a multi-scale spatial attention mechanism to improve feature saliency for objects of different scales, thereby enhancing the detection accuracy of the network. Experimental results demonstrate that our YOLOv7-3D network achieved significantly higher detection accuracy on the Rope3D dataset while reducing computational complexity by 60%.

AB Active illumination systems which have the ability to selectively image photons that arrive from a specified surface geometry some distance away have several applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and surveillance. In this paper, we present a new technique for sloped disparity gating utilizing a synchronized projector-camera system consisting of a raster scanning laser projector and a rolling shutter camera. This system enables disparitybased triangulation of light from specific sloped planar surfaces in the imaging volume. We demonstrate how to control the slope and thickness of these planar surfaces using hardware parameters of pixel clock, synchronization delay, and exposure. Using our system, we present a new decomposition of the light transport matrix in a scene as a function of disparity. We perform applications including real-time image masking and imaging and relighting in scattering media. We also demonstrate applications of the proposed light transport probing technique like novel disparity-dependent relighting, light transport-aware foreground/background separation and green screening, and improved visualization and relighting in scattering media.

AB Point cloud is an emerging data format useful for various applications such has holographic display, autonomous vehicle, and augmented reality. Conventionally, communications of point cloud data have relied on digital compression and digital modulation for three-dimensional (3D) data streaming. However, such digital-based delivery schemes have fundamental issues called cliff and leveling effects, where the 3D reconstruction quality is a step function in terms of wireless channel quality. We propose a novel scheme of point cloud delivery, called HoloCast+, to overcome cliff and leveling effects. Specifically, our method utilizes hybrid digital-analog coding, integrating digital compression and analog coding based on graph Fourier transform (GFT), to gracefully improve 3D reconstruction quality with the improvement of channel quality. We demonstrate that HoloCast+ offers better 3D reconstruction quality in terms of the symmetric mean square error (sMSE) by up to 183 dB and 10.5 dB, respectively, compared to conventional digital-based and analog-based delivery methods in wireless fading environments.

AB This work presents DMPC (Data-and Model-Driven Predictive Control) to solve control problems in which some of the constraints or parts of the objective function are known, while others are entirely unknown to the controller. It is assumed that there is an exogenous "black box'' system, e.g. a machine learning technique, that predicts the value of the unknown functions for a given trajectory. DMPC (1) provides an approach to merge both the model-based and black-box systems; (2) can cope with very little data and is sample efficient, building its solutions based on recently generated trajectories; and (3) improves its cost in each iteration until converging to an optimal trajectory, typically needing only a few trials even for nonlinear dynamics and objectives. Theoretical analysis of the algorithm is presented, proving that the quality of the trajectory does not worsen with each new iteration. We apply the DMPC algorithm to the motion planning of an autonomous vehicle with nonlinear dynamics. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The development of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology plays an important role in robot navigation and autonomous vehicle innovation. The ORB-SLAM2 is a unified SLAM solution for monocular, binocular, and RGBD cameras which constructs a sparse feature point map for real-time positioning. However, a sparse map based approach cannot effectively meet the requirements of robot navigation, environment reconstruction, and other tasks. In this paper, a dense mapping thread is added to the existing ORB-SLAM2 system. The depth map and color image obtained by the stereo matching of a binocular camera are used to generate a three-dimensional point cloud for keyframes; then, the point cloud is fused by tracking and optimizing the motion track of a feature frame to obtain a real-time point cloud map. Through the experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset and the real environment under the ROS, it is proved that the proposed system constructs a clear three-dimensional point cloud map while constructing an accurate trajectory.

AB Contemporary shifts in technology are celebrated for empowering human rights defenders and generating prosperity, but they also enable new forms of human rights violations. This article traces the evolving legal and regulatory challenges posed by drones across two distinct waves of debate. The first involved questions about the legality of weaponized drones in foreign airspaces. The second has centered on the domestication of the technology in American and European airspaces. This article argues that the legal gaps exposed in both waves are not an inevitable side effect of drone technology but are the result of key actors opportunistically using new capabilities to exploit existing rules or even to produce new ones-a process known as lawfare. This linkage between technology and lawfare is important because the drone debates encapsulate many of the core challenges surrounding emerging technologies such as algorithmic decision-making, autonomous vehicles, and big data. Lawfare over unpiloted aircraft is a prelude to the struggles ahead.

ID TARGET RECOGNITION
AB In this article, we tackle the problem of developing a visual framework to allow the autonomous landing of an unmanned aerial vehicle onto a platform using a single camera. Specifically, we propose a vision-based helipad detection algorithm in order to estimate the attitude of a drone on which the camera is fastened with respect to target. Since the algorithm should be simple and quick, we implemented a method based on curvatures in order to detect the heliport marks, that is, the corners of character H. By knowing the size of H mark and the actual location of its corners, we are able to compute the homography matrix containing the relative pose information. The effectiveness of our methodology has been proven through controlled indoor and outdoor experiments. The outcomes have shown that the method provides high accuracies in estimating the distance and the orientation of camera with respect to visual target. Specifically, small errors lower than 1% and 4% have been achieved in the computing of measurements, respectively.

AB This paper presents a novel approach to the design of globally asymptotically stable (GAS) position and velocity filters for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) based directly on the sensor readings of an Ultra-short Baseline (USBL) acoustic array system and a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL). The proposed methodology is based on an equivalent linear time-varying (LW) system that fully captures the dynamics of the nonlinear system, allowing for the use of powerful linear system analysis and filtering design tools that yield GAS filter error dynamics. Numerical results using Monte Carlo simulations and comparison to the Bayesian Cramer Rao Bound (BCRB) reveal that the performance of the proposed filter is tight to this theoretical estimation error lower bound. In comparison with other approaches, the present solution achieves the same level of performance of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which does not offer GAS guarantees, and outperforms other classical filtering approaches designed in inertial coordinates instead of the body-fixed coordinate frame.

AB We report on the development of a multi-purpose active visual sensor system for real-world application. The Cable-Drive Active-Vision Robot, CeDAR, has been designed for use on a diverse range of platforms to perform a diverse range of tasks. The novel, biologically inspired design has evolved from a systems-based approach. The mechanism is compact and lightweight and is capable of motions that exceed human visual performance and earlier mechanical designs. The control system complements the mechanical design to implement the basic visual behaviours of fixation, smooth pursuit and saccade, with stability during high-speed motions, high precision and repeatability. Real-time algorithms have been developed that process stereo colour images, resulting in a suite of basic visual competencies. We have developed a scheme to fuse the results of the visual algorithms into robust task-oriented behaviours by adopting a statistical framework. CeDAR has been successfully used for experiments in autonomous vehicle guidance, object tracking and visual sensing for mobile robot experiments.

AB Multispectral image pairs can provide independent and complementary information to more comprehensively describe detection targets, thereby improving the robustness and reliability of object detectors. The performance of an object detector depends on how cross-modality features are extracted and fused. To exploit the different modalities fully, we propose a lightweight yet effective cross-modality feature fusion approach named gated weighted normative feature fusion. In the feature extraction stage, our proposed dual-input backbone network can extract richer and more useful features. In the feature fusion stage, the fusion module can eliminate redundant features, dynamically weigh the importance of two image features, and further normalize fused features. Experiments and ablation studies on several publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our proposed method achieved better performance in terms of mAP50 with 80.3%, mAP with 41.8%, and mAP50 with 98.0%, mAP with 68.0% on the FLIR and LLVIP datasets, respectively. In particular, the inference speed of our method is twice as fast as the current state-of-the-art method.

AB In this study, we address the challenge of 3D human motion prediction from motion capture data, which has become critical in various applications such as autonomous vehicles and human-robot interaction. Previous deep learning-based methods have improved prediction accuracy, but require significant network parameters and do not effectively consider independent joint movements. To overcome the limitations, we propose two lightweight network structures for human motion prediction: LG-Net and LGT-Net, which focus on the individual movements of distinct human limbs and their inter-dependencies. The LG-Net comprises local and global networks, while the LGT-Net combines the proposed LG-Net structure with Long and Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells to exploit temporal information. Our networks, designed to be extremely lightweight with only 0.08M and 0.5M parameters, achieve higher prediction performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. In addition, this study is the first to consider the root joint to improve motion prediction performance. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential for efficient and accurate human motion prediction in various applications.

AB The motion control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is affected by waves near the ocean surface or in shallow-water areas. Therefore, to counteract the influence of waves, we need to remove them by designing a filter. The wave peak frequency is important in wave filter design. This paper focuses on the identification of the wave peak frequency using the least-squares parameter estimation algorithm. The input-output expression of the wave disturbance model is derived by eliminating the intermediate variable. Based on the obtained identification model, an auxiliary model-based recursive extended least-squares identification algorithm is developed to estimate the model parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified with simulated tests of the heading control system of an AUV. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for the identification of the wave peak frequency, and an observer with a wave peak frequency tracker can significantly reduce invalid steering.

AB In this research, an intelligent control architecture for an experimental Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) bearing unconventional inverted V-tail design, is presented. To handle UAV's inherent control complexities, while keeping them computationally acceptable, a variant of distinct Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm, namely Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) is proposed. Conventional DDPG algorithm after being modified in its learning architecture becomes capable of intelligently handling the continuous state and control space domains besides controlling the platform in its entire flight regime. Nonlinear simulations were then performed to analyze UAV performance under different environmental and launch conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is further demonstrated by comparing the results with the linear controller for the same UAV whose feedback loop gains are optimized by employing technique of optimal control theory. Results indicate the significance of the proposed control architecture and its inherent capability to adapt dynamically to the changing environment, thereby making it of significant utility to airborne UAV applications.

AB Accurate location information is essential for many emerging applications of the Internet of Things. Compared with absolute positions, relative positions of nodes are often more relevant in tasks such as formation control and autonomous driving. In this article, we propose a relative localization scheme for terminals aided by unmanned aerial vehicles. We first derive the performance limit of the relative position error as the constrained Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB), and proved that the equivalent Fisher information of a subnetwork retains all the information for its relative localization. We then develop a distributed localization algorithm based on local geometry transforming for the proposed scheme with low computation complexity. Moreover, an iterative descent algorithm is designed for joint power and spectrum allocation for relative localization. Numerical results show that the proposed localization algorithm significantly outperforms existing algorithms and the optimal allocation scheme can reduce the relative CRLB by about 50% compared with the uniform allocation scheme.

AB To measure the distance of an object, we propose a distance sensor that combines a tunable aperture operated by the thermal expansion of silicon chevron beams with a commercial camera similar to the automotive black box. The distance sensor is composed of a tunable aperture, a lens with an 8 mm focal length, and a 1/4-inch full high definition image sensor, where a tunable aperture is attached to the camera lens. To estimate the distance to the object, the blur difference is expressed in the form of a depth map using the depth from defocus algorithm. The mean error of distance estimation was 0.29 m. The area of the tunable aperture in the distance sensor is 1.18 mm(2) at OFF state and 2.79 mm(2) when the voltage is applied. The distance sensor can display an image and a distance simultaneously and can be applied to autonomous vehicles, drones, and robots.

ID CENTROIDAL VORONOI TESSELLATIONS
AB This paper studies the problems of static coverage and autonomous exploration of unknown three-dimensional environments with a team of cooperating aerial vehicles. Although these tasks are usually considered separately in the literature, we propose a common framework where both problems are formulated as the maximization of online acquired information via the definition of single-robot optimization functions, which differs only slightly in the two cases to take into account the static and dynamic nature of coverage and exploration respectively. A common derivative-free approach based on a stochastic approximation of these functions and their successive optimization is proposed, resulting in a fast and decentralized solution. The locality of this methodology limits however this solution to have local optimality guarantees and specific additional layers are proposed for the two problems to improve the final performance. Specifically, a Voronoi-based initialization step is added for the coverage problem and a combination with a frontier-based approach is proposed for the exploration case. The resulting algorithms are finally tested in simulations and compared with possible alternatives.

AB Optical wireless power transmission has many possible applications in daily life, such as for supplying power to unmanned autonomous vehicles and charging implantable medical devices. System efficiencies of optical wireless power transmissions through atmosphere, water, optical fiber, and human skin are numerically calculated and analyzed. Silicon photovoltaic is used as the optical-to-electrical power converter. By assuming that the electrical-to-optical power conversion efficiency of laser diode to be 40% and does not have wavelength dependency, it is found that maximum system efficiency of 22.1% at 940 nm and 1.36% at 960 nm for 1-km distance power transmission through air with 30-km visibility and 1-km visibility, respectively, can be achieved while for optical power transmission through water, system efficiency around 5.5% at 400 nm for 100-m depth of water. For the optical power transmission through skin, the maximum system efficiency for 2-mm thickness of human skin is 14% at 910-nm wavelength.

TI Alternative Activity Pattern Generation for Stated Preference Surveys
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB We present a systematic method for generating activity-driven, multi-day alternative activity patterns that form choice sets for stated preference surveys. An activity pattern consists of information about an individual's activity agenda, travel modes between activity episodes, and the location and duration of each episode. The proposed method adjusts an individual's observed activity pattern using a hill-climbing algorithm, an iterative algorithm that finds local optima, to search for the best response to hypothetical system changes. The multi-day approach allows for flexibility to reschedule activities on different days and thus presents a more complete view of demand for activity participation, as these demands are rarely confined to a single day in reality. As a proof-of-concept, we apply the method to a multi-day activity-travel survey in Singapore and consider the hypothetical implementation of an on-demand autonomous vehicles service. The demonstration shows promising results, with the algorithm exhibiting overall desirable behavior with reasonable responses. In addition to representing the individual's direct response, the use of observed patterns also reveals the propagation of impacts, that is, indirect effects, across the multi-day activity pattern.

AB This paper presents a collaborative control strategy designed to enable a team of robots to track attracting Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) and unstable manifolds in two-dimensional flows. Tracking LCS in flows is important for many applications such as planning energy optimal paths in the ocean and for predicting the evolution of various physical and biological processes in the ocean. The proposed strategy which tracks attracting LCS and unstable manifolds in real-time through direct computation of the local finite time Lyapunov exponent field, does not require global information about the dynamics of the surrounding flow, and is based on local sensing, prediction, and correction. The collaborative control strategy is implemented on a team of robots and theoretical guarantees for the tracking and formation keeping strategies are presented. We demonstrate the performance of the tracking strategy in simulation using actual ocean flow data and experimental flow data generated in a tank. The strategy is validated experimentally using a team of micro autonomous surface vehicles in an actual fluid environment.

AB Hydrocarbons are among the most dangerous pollutants for the marine environment. The creation of smart systems to detect hydrocarbon spills in the marine environment is often complex and involves many issues. This paper presents an innovative approach based on a sensor system capable of detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by hydrocarbons. The system was composed of an array of photo ionization detectors, lodged in a flow chamber and arranged in radial symmetry, in order to receive the same amount of air flow. The air inlet was placed on the upper face of the chamber, while the air outlet was on the lower face. The sensor characterization at the laboratory bench was performed using different kinds of hydrocarbons, such as gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene, and crude oil, and their response was acquired using a smart electronic system based on an Arduino electronic board. With this approach, it was possible to detect mild-to-high concentrations of VOCs with a portable, lightweight, smart system, placed in an autonomous underwater vehicle and in a moored buoy.

ID OUTPUT-FEEDBACK CONTROL; CONTROL DESIGN; DELAY SYSTEMS; STABILIZATION
AB This article considers the development of constructive sliding-mode control strategies based on measured output information only for linear, time-delay systems with bounded disturbances that are not necessarily matched. The novel feature of the method is that linear matrix inequalities are derived to compute solutions to both the existence problem and the finite time reachability problem that minimise the ultimate bound of the reduced-order sliding-mode dynamics in the presence of state time-varying delay and unmatched disturbances. The methodology provides guarantees on the level of closed-loop performance that will be achieved by uncertain systems which experience delay. The methodology is also shown to facilitate sliding-mode controller design for systems with polytopic uncertainties, where the uncertainty may appear in all blocks of the system matrices. A time-delay model with polytopic uncertainties from the literature provides a tutorial example of the proposed method. A case study involving the practical application of the design methodology in the area of autonomous vehicle control is also presented.

DT Article
AB We have designed and implemented a system for real-time detection of 2-D image features on a reconfigurable computer based on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA's). We envision this device as the front-end of a system able to track image features in real-time vision applications like autonomous vehicle navigation and "structure from motion". The algorithm employed to select good features is inspired by the method of Tomasi and Kanade. Compared to the original method, the algorithm that we have devised does not require any floating point or transcendental operations, and maps efficiently into a highly pipelined architecture, well suited to be implemented in FPGA technology. We have implemented the algorithm on a low-cost reconfigurable computer equipped with video decoder and encoder interfaces. Reliable operation has been observed on an image stream generated by a standard NTSC commercial video camera at 30 Hz on different scenes and under different light conditions. This result compares favorably to the implementation of the same algorithm on a system based on the TI C80 DSP, able to process at most 5 frames/second.

AB This study presents the design of an underwater superlimb as a wearable robot, providing divers with mobility assistance and freeing their hands for manipulating tools underwater. The wearable design features a thrust vectoring system with two 3D-printed, waterproofed modules. The module with adjustable connections and strapping holes is designed to enable reconfiguration for multiple purposes, including regular use as an underwater superlimb for divers, manually operated as a handheld glider for swimmers, combined with an amphibian, legged robot as a quadruped superlimb, and coupled as a dual-unit autonomous underwater vehicle for underwater navigation. The kinematics and dynamics of the prototype and all of its reconfigured modes are developed. A sliding-mode controller is also introduced to achieve stable simulation in PyBullet. Field tests further support the feasibility of the underwater superlimb when worn on a test diver in a swimming pool. As the first underwater superlimb presented in the literature, this study opens new doors for supernumerary robotic limbs in underwater scenarios with multifunctional reconfiguration.

ID TRACKING CONTROL; PERFORMANCE; QUADROTOR; OBSERVER
AB This paper models a point-mass load tethered to a single autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and proposes a quantitative control strategy, which is able to drive the load to track the desired trajectory closely. The AUV-tow-load system is modeled as three connected subsystems: load position subsystem, cable direction subsystem, and AUV attitude subsystem. Improving on the current prescribed performance control methods, where the transient-state and steady-state tracking behaviors cannot be preassigned accurately, a quantitative controller is designed for the point-mass load position, achieving predefined tracking performance without violating user-defined quantitative indices including overshoot, convergence time, and steady-state accuracy. An uncertainties and disturbances estimator (UDE) is designed and incorporated into the control inputs to compensate for the effects of uncertain dynamics and external disturbances. Rigorous theoretical proof is presented, showing that all tracking errors converge to the neighborhood of zero with quantitatively designed tracking behaviors, obtaining uniformly ultimately boundedness. Simulation results are provided to validate the efficiency of the proposed method.

AB This article investigates the problem of state estimation for guarded semi-Markov switching systems with soft constraints. We first construct the switching system in a multiple model manner and derive the recursive Bayesian filter compatible with the sojourn time and base state dependent mode transitions. To solve the intractable conditioned mode transition probabilities, we develop deep learning based classifiers with long short-term memory networks capturing the temporal dependencies. Various network structures are designed to handle different situations where knowledge of the transition probability matrix is available or deficient. Furthermore, we incorporate sequential Monte Carlo techniques into the multiple model framework to resolve the local filtering task. A novel particle refinement procedure exploiting the constraint information is proposed to improve the efficiency of particle propagation and prevent the exponential increase of particle number simultaneously. Simulations on a robotic manipulator and an autonomous vehicle tracking task validate the effectiveness of the proposed state estimation method.

AB Generally, air track planning is conducted in real time and takes modified track distance minimization as objective. Next-generation air transport systems provide aircrafts with more flexibility in track planning and more responsibilities in self-separation, which present a great challenge for aircraft optimal track planning, especially in some high-density airspaces and some complex conflict scenarios. This paper proposes a novel aircraft track planning method by taking aircraft conflict probability into consideration. First, the concepts of aircraft potential motion space and the estimation method for aircraft conflict probability is introduced. Then, taking conflict probability minimization as the objective, the classical ant colony algorithm (ACA) algorithm is improved to solve the model. Finally, an experimental study is conducted to illustrate the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method is able to provide a scientific and effective track planning approach considering the potential conflict probability of aircrafts, which is able to provide fundamental to the safety of entire air transport system.

ID RAIN REMOVAL
AB Image deraining aims to restore the clean scenes of rainy images, which facilitates a number of outdoor vision systems, such as autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles and surveillance systems. This paper proposes a high-resolution detail-recovering image deraining network (HDRD-Net) to effectively remove rain streaks and recover lost details, as well as improving the quality of derained images. HDRD-Net consists of three sub-networks. First, we combine the residual network and Squeeze-and-Excitation block for rain streak removal. Second, we integrate the Structure Detail Context Aggregation block into the detail-recovering network to extract detail features form rainy images. Third, a dual super-resolution reconstruction network is utilized to enhance the quality of derained images. In addition, we extend the Rain100 dataset by incorporating low-resolution rainy images to construct a new Rain100++ dataset for high-resolution image deraining. Experimental results on several datasets show that HDRD-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of rain removal, detail preservation and visual quality.

AB Computers and smartphones have become indispensable parts of human daily life. Driven by various modern applications, the demand for high-speed Internet connection is always growing. Because Internet speed strongly depends on signal strength and quality, a great deal of effort has been spent to increase the number of "bars" displayed on the screen of wireless devices. One effective approach toward "more bars" is deploying microwave relay systems to provide stronger signals, and thus higher data rates, to end users. Microwave relay links facilitate the transmission of signals from one point to another by receiving, recovering, and retransmitting wireless signals with enhanced quality and strength. With more bars on the end-user side, handheld wireless devices also become smaller because of reduced power consumption in their receivers. With the help of sophisticated radio relay links in the last mile of communications networks [1], wireless data can be efficiently communicated among a variety of devices, such as home appliances, smart Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, and autonomous vehicles [2], [3].

ID INTERFACE
AB The underwater environment is characterized by hazardous conditions that make it difficult to manage and monitor even the simplest human operation. The introduction of a robot companion with the task of supporting and monitoring the divers during their activities and operations underwater can help to solve some of the problems that usually arise in this scenario. In this context, a proper communication between the diver and the robot is imperative for the success of the dive. However, the underwater environment poses a set of technical challenges which are not readily surmountable thus limiting the spectrum from which possibilities can be chosen. This paper presents the design and development of a gesture-based communication language which has been employed for the entire duration of the European project CADDY (Cognitive Autonomous Diving Buddy). This language, the Caddian, was built upon consolidated and standardized underwater gestures that are commonly used in recreational and professional diving. Its use and integration during field tests with a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) is also shown.

AB This paper presents a literature overview of factors, both internal and external, modelled for improving the shift-quality in automobiles through the development of a robust electronic transmission control unit (TCU). Such robustness, designed with considerations of internal and external factors, are essential for safety and driving comfort. As automobiles are becoming more sophisticated, the application of electronics and embedded systems is increasing for different functional control system designs, including the gear-shifting mechanism. An automotive transmission system equipped with electronic or electrohydraulic actuators, controlled by an electronic control unit, provides clutch-less driving experience to the driver for the shifting operation. TCU is used for automatic speed and torque control in different driving situations, and reduces the human error in gear selection for facilitating safe and comfortable driving. In the development of such a mechatronic controller, it is critical to find a robust control strategy in the context of semi-autonomous vehicles.

AB To achieve fast adaption in submarine hovering condition, the water level control of hovering ballast tank is crucial for quick adjustment of tank mass, and thus to exert extra hovering force on submarine. Based on the analysis of ballast tank system mechanism, mathematical model of blowing/venting process is firstly established. Since nonlinearity presents in tank system model, input-output feedback linearization is applied to deduce the exact linearized form of state law equations. Sliding mode control is then introduced to counteract parameter uncertainties in the transformed linearized system, and double exponential reaching law and sigmoid function are used in controller design to guarantee smooth transfer and rapid responses. Numerical simulation is conducted in Matlab to test performance of presented control scheme, and multidomain physical system Simscape is utilized for system modelling to enhance accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the control system is of satisfactory performance on water level control, as to fast tracking of set output and low air consuming.

AB Monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques implicitly estimate camera ego-motion while incrementally building a map of the environment. In monocular SLAM, when the number of features in the system state increases, maintaining a real-time operation becomes very difficult. However, it is easy to remove old features from the state to maintain a stable computational cost per frame. If features are removed from the map, then previously mapped areas cannot be recognized to minimize the robot's drift; alternatively, in the context of a real-time virtual sensor that emulates typical sensors as laser for range measurements and encoders for dead reckoning, this limitation should not be a problem. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to build in real time a consistent map of the environment using the virtual-sensor estimations. At the same time, the proposed approach allows minimizing the drift of the camera-robot position. Experiments with real data are presented to show the performance of this frame of work.

AB Augmented Reality (AR) has the potential to help drivers become aware of invisible hazards through an Augmented Reality Head-Up Display (AR-HUD). However, this issue is still underexplored. To address it, a novel warning system for invisible dangers in AR-HUD user interfaces has been designed as a carrier for agents' cognitive information to enhance driver perception. This design was created by using a team cooperation perception model that combined the perception cycle of a human driver with a computational agent. Furthermore, user experiments were conducted to investigate the impact of this design on safe driving in two typical scenarios. The experimental results showed that this design can significantly improve drivers' situation awareness and reaction time in both human-driving and auto-pilot modes, and enhance human drivers' trust in the auto-pilot system. The model and design can be generalized to more AR-HUD scenarios requiring human-machine perception and cognitive cooperation.

AB The present paper studies a distributed leaderless multi-autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) system under a heterogeneous topology network where multiplicative faults and input saturation affect actuators, and the actuator fault severity could not be equal in each AUV. For this system, an adaptive event-driven fault-tolerant consensus control protocol is proposed. The present paper also introduces adaptive parameters in the trigger function to improve the self-regulation capability of the event-driven mechanism system. The proposed fully distributed event-driven fault-tolerant consensus strategy depends on the adaptive coupling gain of the system, and it eliminates the global information restriction. It was found that the designed event-driven controller has a good fault tolerance effect on multiplicative faults of actuators. The states of the multi-AUV system could asymptotically converge to the same conditions without Zeno behavior. Finally, the Lyapunov functional method proves the system's astringency and stability, and the numerical simulation presents the strategy's effectiveness.

AB High-resolution imagery of the morphological character of modern active turbidite systems are critical for understanding the complexity of turbidity current processes occurring on the seafloor. Here, we describe a 30 cm-resolution autonomous underwater vehicle repeat bathymetric dataset that allows to significantly increase the geomorphological detail of crescentic bedforms in turbidite systems. This repeat imagery shows the erosion produced by dense basal layers at the base of turbidity currents, the inception of plunge pools, and the controls that hydraulic jump troughs have on subsequent flow path of weaker turbidity currents. Transverse small-scale scours located in cyclic step troughs suggest that weak flows follow local relief, therefore explaining the wide variability of turbidity current flow indicators observed in outcrops. This imagery demonstrates that turbidite systems are formed by the superimposition of erosion surfaces and depositional patterns recording contrasted flow behavior and provides new views on turbidity current behavior in natural environments.

AB In this article, to improve navigation performance, observability-based navigation using optical and radiometric measurements for asteroid approach phase is proposed in tandem with the optimization of the configuration of spacecraft formation. By introducing the relative range and range-rate between spacecraft measured by radiometric sensors, the position and velocity of the two spacecraft are estimated, and the estimation performance degradation at the end of asteroid approach phase is reduced. A better observability of the integrated navigation system has been proven based on a novel geometry measurement model. Furthermore, a configuration optimization method is developed based on the lower bound of the Cramer-Rao inequality and the observability degree of the navigation system. By optimizing the configuration of spacecraft formation, the observability and estimation accuracy of the navigation system have been improved. Three cases of different configurations of spacecraft formation are established for numerical simulation, demonstrating the improvement in the accuracy of the navigation method.

ID DYNAMICS
AB This letter presents a solution for the state estimation and control problems for a class of unconventional vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) UAVs operating in forward-flight conditions. A tightly-coupled state estimation approach is used to estimate the aircraft navigation states, sensor biases, and thewind velocity. State estimation is done within a matrix Lie group framework using the Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF), which offers several advantages compared to standard multiplicative EKFs traditionally used in aerospace and robotics problems. AnSO(3)-based attitude controller is employed, leading to a single attitude control law without a separate sideslip control loop. A control allocator is used to determine how to use multiple, possibly redundant, actuators to produce the desired control moments. The wind velocity estimates are used in the attitude controller and the control allocator to improve performance. A numerical example is considered using a sample VTOL tailsitter-type UAV with four control surfaces. Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate robustness of the proposed control and estimation scheme to various initial conditions, noise levels, and flight trajectories.

ID AUTONOMOUS RECONFIGURATION; OPTIMIZATION
AB Applying free space optical (FSO) in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) relay networks has emerged as a promising technology due to high throughput, long transmission range, and the negligible interference incurred by FSO communications. However, FSO links are vulnerable in free space because of atmospheric turbulence, thus significantly reducing the reliability of the network. Thus, how to construct the FSO-based UAVs relay network topology to achieve a high network reliability is critical. This paper studies the network topology formation problem by considering the network resilience, where the resilience is referred to the ability of a network topology to defend against link failures. The network topology formation problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem with the objective of maximizing network resilience. To solve this problem, two network resilience aware topology formation (NRATF) methods, i.e., centralized-NRATF and distributed-NRATF, are investigated to solve the topology designing problem efficiently. The performance of the proposed algorithms are evaluated via extensive simulations.

AB Despite the long history of automotive head-up displays (HUDs), what information they should display in different situations to best serve the driver remains unanswered. The lack of understanding hinders designing useful automotive HUD systems. In an effort to address this, the current study investigated the developer, researcher and user perspectives on the functional requirements of automotive HUDs through literature review. The review results indicated that: 1) the existing commercial HUDs perform largely the same functions as the conventional in-vehicle displays, 2) past research studies proposed various HUD functions for improving driver situation awareness and driving safety, 3) autonomous driving and other new technologies are giving rise to new HUD information, and 4) little research is currently available on HUD users' perceived information needs. Based on the review results, this study provides insights into the functional requirements of automotive HUDs and also suggests some future research directions for automotive HUD design.

DE Deep learning; high-speed objects; Kalman filter; localization
ID TRACKING ESTIMATOR; CONSUMER DEVICES
AB This paper addresses a novel deep learning technique for localization systems of high-speed mobile objects such as autonomous vehicles. The presented localization method consists of rough and fine localizations. The rough localization exploits the modified Kalman filtering, which produces the rough location estimates of a high-speed object. Due to an inappropriate threshold value, the rough estimates often lead to a divergence in the modified Kalman filtering. In this paper, the fine localization suppresses the divergence. The proposed fine localization is based on a deep learning technique. Using the rough estimates, the deep learning method classifies the current position of the high-speed object into an appropriate region. Based on the classified region, the rough location estimates are refined into the fine location estimates in the fine-localization step. The experimental results verify that the deep learning approach overcomes the weakness of the modified Kalman method in the localization. The results also show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional Kalman approach in the localization of high-speed objects.

AB In this paper, a novel nonlinear hybrid observers (HOB) based dynamic surface control (DSC) system, which integrates nominal and compensation controller, is designed for autonomous quadrotor robot perturbed by the uncertainties, e.g., external disturbances and measurement-delay. In this hybrid control system, the nominal controller based on dynamic surface control superior to the backstepping technique is the main controller, and the disturbance observer (DOB) is incorporated as the compensation controller to eliminate the effect of uncertainties caused by model mismatch and external disturbances. In addition, in order to relax the impact of measurement-delay induced by sensors of poor quality and heavy computation burden, the measurement-delay observer (MOB) is derived. Next, stability of the closed-loop control system is analytically proved based on Lyapunov theorem. Finally, comparative controllers are evaluated on simulation and experimental environments to demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed controller for quadrotor robot against the uncertainties.

AB This paper considers dynamic coverage control of multiple power-constrained agents subject to 3D rigid body kinematics. The agents are deployed to patrol a domain until the entire space has reached a satisfactory level of coverage. This is achieved through the gathering of information by a forward-facing sensor footprint, modelled as an anisotropic spherical sector. Coverage and collision avoidance guarantees are met by a hybrid controller consisting of four operating modes: local coverage, global coverage, waypoint scan and subdomain transfer. Energy-aware methods are encoded into the global coverage state to shift the bulk of spatial redistribution onto less constrained agents. Additionally, a novel domain partitioning strategy is used that directs individual agents to explore within concentric hemispherical shells around a centralized charging station. This results in flight paths that are guaranteed to terminate at the charging station in the limit that agent batteries expire. The efficacy of this algorithm is presented through experimental trials with three agents in an indoor environment. Simulations are provided for ten agents.

AB Smart transportation safety (STS) envisions improving public safety through a significant paradigm shift for police authority responses on crimes toward a pro-active one. The application of smart surveillance in STS is critical for automatic and accurate identification of events in case of security threats in target environments. Cloud computing reduces costs and high resource consumption of smart surveillance capable STS systems, at the cost of introducing additional latency through far away centralized systems. In this paper, the fog-framework for intelligent public safety in vehicular environment (FISVER) framework applies fog computing in smart video surveillance-based STS to enhance crime assistance in a cost-efficient way. Through fog-FISVER, in-vehicle and fog infrastructures support autonomous and real-time crime detection on public bus services. A fog-FISVER laboratory testbed prototype was created and extensive evaluations in a real testbed were performed. Results show that fog-FISVER delivers outstanding system performance and device survivability behavior over typical STS use cases.

ID THRUST ALLOCATION
AB An autonomous dynamic positioning scheme for a novel triangular floating marine platform is developed, that stabilizes its linear and angular velocities as well as its position and orientation. For this platform, the required closed-loop forces and moments are provided by three rotating pump-jets, located at the bottom of three partly submerged cylinders, located at the corners of the platform. With this control configuration, the platform is over-actuated, i.e., it has more control inputs than degrees of freedom (DOF). Design guidelines leading to balanced actuator loading are identified. A control allocation scheme is developed that allows for station keeping under realistic constraints, disturbances and hardware limitations, without violating thruster dynamics. Furthermore, a model-based controller is proposed that aims at the reduction of fuel consumption. Simulation results, in the presence of realistic environmental disturbances, are presented that demonstrate the performance of the controller and of the allocation scheme developed. Preliminary Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) real time experiments are conducted and presented, showing effective platform station keeping. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID UNDERWATER DOCKING; SYSTEM
AB The hydrodynamic interaction between an AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) and a recovery device, such as a real-scale submarine, is a crucial factor affecting the safe recovery of the AUV. This paper employs the CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) method to investigate the hydrodynamic interaction of the AUV and the submarine during the recovery process. Both the AUV and the submarine are considered to be relatively stationary. The results indicate that the submarine has a significant impact on the AUV during the recovery process, with sailing speed and relative positions identified as key influential factors. Due to the influence of the submarine, it can be difficult for the AUV to approach the submarine and be recovered safely. This study provides valuable insights into the hydrodynamic interaction between the AUV and the recovery device, and offers guidance for future submarine recovery operations involving AUVs. By considering the influence of the submarine's position and motion, as well as other relevant factors, it may be possible to improve the stability, safety, and efficiency of AUV recovery operations.

AB In this paper, we propose a hierarchical visual servo control scheme for following visual paths with quadcopters in indoor environments. The control scheme is able to deal with three tasks simultaneously, considering as order of hierarchy: first, collision avoidance task, second visibility task (keep point features in the camera's field of view), and finally, visual servoing task. The strategy allows a commitment of active tasks (also the smooth deactivation of tasks) for avoiding conflicts between them. The proposed scheme uses a monocular RGB front-facing camera as single sensor, i.e., only 2D information is required for the control law computation. That information is used for online reactive visual path following, i.e., no 3D reconstruction of the environment is required, and no path or motion planning for obstacle avoidance is performed while the robot follows the visual path. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is supported by a stability analysis and experiments with a low-cost commercial quadcopter in scenarios with static obstacles.

AB This article presents the design and the experimental tests of a bioinspired robot mimicking the cownose ray. These fish swim by moving their large and flat pectoral fins, creating a wave that pushes backward the surrounding water so that the fish is propelled forward due to momentum conservation. The robot inspired by these animals has a rigid central body, housing motors, batteries, and electronics, and flexible pectoral fins made of silicone rubber. Each of them is actuated by a servomotor driving a link inside the leading edge, and the traveling wave is reproduced thanks to the flexibility of the fin itself. In addition to the pectoral fins, two small rigid caudal fins are present to improve the robot's maneuverability. The robot has been designed, built, and tested underwater, and the experiments have shown that the locomotion principle is valid and that the robot is able to swim forward, perform left and right turns, and do floating or diving maneuvers.

AB Abandoned objects detection is one of the most important tasks of intelligent visual surveillance systems. In this paper, a method, based on dual background and gradient is presented for abandoned objects detection. The temporal median filter and temporal minimum filter are used to extract foreground and static objects respectively. In order to enable our algorithm to detect precisely at night, a gradient-based image processing algorithm is proposed to eliminate the interference of vehicle lights. This method can detect abandoned objects in a short time. It is robust under various lighting conditions, and it has low computational costs compared to other widely used methods.This image processing algorithm can also be used in other tasks, such as obstacle detection in autonomous driving. We compare the algorithm with other abandoned object detection algorithms on the well-known ABODA dataset and our video dataset in highway scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that the method we proposed outperforms the widely used abandoned objects detection methods.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB Geometric and semantic contexts are essential to solving the ill-posed problem of monocular depth estimation (MDE). In this paper, we propose a deep MDE framework that can aggregate dual-modal structural contexts for monocular depth estimation (DSC-MDE). First, a cross-shaped context (CSC) aggregation module is developed to globally encode the geometric structures in depth maps observed under the fields of vision of robots/autonomous vehicles. Next, the CSC-encoded geometric features are further modulated with semantic context in an object-regional context (ORC) aggregation module. Finally, to train the proposed network, we present a focal ordinal loss (FOL), which pays more attention to distant samples to avoid the issue of over-relaxed constraints on these samples occurring in the ordinal regression loss (ORL). We compare the proposed model to recent methods with geometric and multi-modal contexts, and show that the proposed model obtains state-of-the-art performance on both indoor and outdoor datasets, including NYU-Depth-V2, Cityscapes and KITTI.

AB Navigating unknown environments is an ongoing challenge in robotics. Processing large amounts of sensor data to maintain localization, maps of the environment, and sensible paths can result in high compute loads and lower maximum vehicle speeds. This paper presents a bio-inspired algorithm for efficiently processing depth measurements to achieve fast navigation of unknown subterranean environments. Animals developed efficient sensorimotor convergence approaches, allowing for rapid processing of large numbers of spatially distributed measurements into signals relevant for different behavioral responses necessary to their survival. Using a spatial inner-product to model this sensorimotor convergence principle, environmentally relative states critical to navigation are extracted from spatially distributed depth measurements using derived weighting functions. These states are then applied as feedback to control a simulated quadrotor platform, enabling autonomous navigation in subterranean environments. The resulting outer-loop velocity controller is demonstrated in both a generalized subterranean environment, represented by an infinite cylinder, and nongeneralized environments like tunnels and caves.

AB In this paper, the adaptive prescribed performance tracking control of nonlinear asymmetric input saturated systems in strict-feedback form is addressed under the consideration of model uncertainties and external disturbances. A radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) is utilized to handle the model uncertainties. By prescribed performance functions, the transient performance of the system can be guaranteed. The continuous Gaussian error function is represented as an approximation of asymmetric saturation nonlinearity such that the backstepping technique can be leveraged in the control design. Based on the Lyapunov synthesis, residual function approximation inaccuracies and external disturbances are compensated by constructed adaptive control laws. As a consequence, all the signals in the closedloop system are uniformly ultimately bounded and the tracking errors bounded by prescribed functions converge to a small neighbourhood of zero. The proposed method is applied to the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with extensive simulation results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. (c) 2021 The Franklin Institute.

AB We propose a new algorithm for real-time detection and tracking of elliptic patterns suitable for real-world robotics applications. The method fits ellipses to each contour in the image frame and rejects ellipses that do not yield a good fit. The resulting detection and tracking method is lightweight enough to be used on robots' resource-limited onboard computers, can deal with lighting variations and detect the pattern even when the view is partial. The method is tested on an example application of an autonomous UAV landing on a fast-moving vehicle to show its performance indoors, outdoors, and in simulation on a real-world robotics task. The comparison with other well-known ellipse detection methods shows that our proposed algorithm outperforms other methods with the F1 score of 0.981 on a dataset with over 1500 frames. The videos of experiments, the source codes, and the collected dataset are provided with the letter.

AB A novel method is described for adaptive filtering of light fields to enhance objects at a given depth. Using the frequency domain of an epipolar-plane image (EPI) to select the minimum and maximum depths of an object of interest (OOI) allows greater selectivity over traditional methods and the ability to re-focus a light field as the scene changes. This method is executed on real light fields, where depth information is extracted and used for depth filtering. A light field video is used to show that as an OOI moves to varying depths in a scene, the performance of a fixed-depth filter decreases when compared to an adaptive-depth filter. This method is shown to be robust in an environment where an OOI is moving to different depths in relation to the camera, and has implications in tasks where objects must be identified by their depth, such as in robotics or autonomous vehicles.

AB In a rapidly changing world, transportation is a big determinant of quality of life, financial growth and progress. New challenges (such as the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic) and opportunities (such as the three revolutions of shared, electric and automated mobility) are expected to drastically change the future mobility landscape. Researchers, policy makers and practitioners are working hard to prepare for and shape the future of mobility that will maximize benefits. Adopting a human perspective as a guiding principle in this endeavour is expected to help prioritize the "right" needs as requirements. In this special issue, eight research papers outline ways in which transportation research can contribute to a better tomorrow. In this editorial, we position the research within the state-of-the-art, identify the needs for future research, and then outline how the included contributions fit in this puzzle. Naturally, the problem of sustainable future transportation systems is way too complicated to be covered with a single special issue. We thus conclude this editorial with a discussion about open questions and future research topics.

AB The position tracking and attitude monitoring are essential for marine equipment's survival in the boundless ocean. The power solution for aforementioned monitoring system became the bottleneck once its own equipped traditional battery pack run out of the power. Hence, a self-powered and self-functional tracking system has been proposed to meet the technique gap, which consists of a triboelectric-functioned inertial module and an electromagnetic powered global position system (GPS) module. A sophisticated-designed rotating gyro structure, together with triboelectric-electromagnetic working principal, established a battery-less tracking system successfully. Specially, the remarkable gyro rolling mode solution of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) features its sensitivity, multiple directions and robustness. Finally, the triboelectric-electromagnetic hybridized module was well validated in an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the Huanghai Sea. This work not only provides an effective and sustainable way toward large-scale blue energy scavenging, but also reveals TENG0 promising potential on inertial sensing capability for marine equipment.

AB Following striking developments in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology, the use of UAVs has been researched in various industrial fields. Furthermore, a number of studies on operating multiple autonomous networking UAVs suggest a potential to use UAVs in large-scale environments. To achieve efficiency of performance in multi-UAV operations, it is essential to consider a variety of factors in UAV network conditions, such as energy efficiency, network overhead, and so on. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that improves the energy efficiency and network throughputs by controlling the topology of the network. Our proposed network topology control scheme functions between the data link layer (L3) and the network layer (L2). Accordingly, it can be considered to be layer 2.5 in the network hierarchy model. In addition, our methodology includes swarm intelligence, meaning that whole topology control can be generated with less cost and effort, and without a centralized controller. Our experimental results confirm the notable performance of our proposed method compared to previous approaches.

AB As an autonomous vehicle that moves on the space orbit, a space robot needs to be carefully treated on the motion planning and control method. In this article, the optimal impact and postimpact motion control of a flexible dual-arm space robot capturing a spinning object are considered. Firstly, the dynamic model of the robot systems is built by using Lagrangian formulation. The flexible links are modeled as Euler-Bernoulli beams of two bending modes. Through simulating the system's postimpact dynamics response, the initial conditions are obtained from the impact model. Next, the initial velocities of base and joint are adjusted to minimize the velocity of the base after the capture according to generalized momentum conservation. After the capture, a proportional-derivative controller is designed to keep the robot system's stabilization. The simulation results show that joint angles of base and manipulators reach stable state quickly, and motions of the space robots also induce vibrating motions of the flexible manipulators.

AB In this paper, we present "Cool Interconnect," a 1024-bit wide bus that we have developed to provide a standardized method of interconnecting chips in 3-D integrated circuits (3DICs). This wide bus chip-to-chip interconnect can be used to realize low-power high-performance multicore systems to meet the increasing demand for advanced electronics to enable autonomous vehicles and Internet of Things devices. The bus has been implemented using a 40 x 40 fine-pitch array of through-silicon vias and bump joints. In addition, we have developed a testing methodology based on the boundary scan method to confirm the electrical performance of wide bus chip-to-chip interconnect in 3DICs. Cool Interconnect test chips were designed, fabricated, and flip-chip stacked. Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) and electrical connection tests were used to confirm the successful operation of the test chips, including the chip-to-chip interconnect.

AB This paper has studied the impact of safety assistance driving systems (SADS) on the oscillation magnitude, the fuel consumption and emission of a car platoon, in which the car-following dynamics are depicted by an improved two-dimensional intelligent driver model. It is shown that while the simple one-regime SADS is able to suppress the oscillation magnitude, the fuel consumption and emission increase. This is due to many small high frequency oscillations of velocities. We have proposed a two-regime SADS, in which "very dangerous" regime and "not so dangerous" regime have been classified. Simulation shows that with the introduction of the two-regime SADS, both the fuel consumption and emission decrease, since the deceleration of vehicles is pretty gentle. We further showed that performance of the multi-regime SADS is the same as that of the two-regime SADS in terms of the fuel consumption and emission. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article reports the development of flexible arrays of soft membrane microelectromechanical system pressure sensors that are inspired by the functional implications of the lateral line organ present in the blind cavefish. Being blind, this fish relies on the lateral line of pressure gradient sensors present on its body to sense the surrounding obstacles. A flexible, low-powered, lightweight, sensitive yet robust microelectromechanical system sensor array is fabricated using liquid crystal polymer material. Such arrays can guide an autonomous underwater vehicle to navigate in unsteady and dirty-water environments. The object detection abilities of the blind cave characin fish are investigated through proof-of-concept experiments conducted on the live fish. Similarly, the abilities of the microelectromechanical system array in determining the velocity and distance of an underwater object are investigated by testing them in water tunnel. Experimental results demonstrate the array's ability to detect the velocity of moving underwater objects with a high accuracy and an average error of only 2.5%.

AB We are interested in coordinating a team of autonomous mobile sensor agents in performing a cooperative information gathering task while satisfying mission-critical spatial-temporal constraints. In particular, we present a novel set of constraint formulations that address inter-agent collisions, collisions with static obstacles, network connectivity maintenance, and temporal-coverage in a resource-efficient manner. These constraints are considered in the context of the target search problem, where the team plans trajectories that maximize the probability of target detection. We model constraints continuously along the agents' trajectories and integrate these constraint models into decentralized team planning using a computationally efficient solution method based on the Lagrangian formulation and decentralized optimization. We validate our approach in simulation with five UAVs performing search, and through hardware experiments with four indoor mobile robots. Our results demonstrate team planning with spatial-temporal constraints that preserves the performance of unconstrained information gathering and is feasible to implement with reasonable computational and communication resources.

AB This paper introduces Simulation of Intelligent TRAnsport Systems (SITRAS), a massive multi-agent simulation system in which driver-vehicle objects are modelled as autonomous agents. The simulation outputs can be used for the evaluation of Intelligent Transport Systems applications such as congestion and incident management, public transport priority and dynamic route guidance. The model concepts and specifications, and the first applications of the model in the area of incident modelling in urban arterial networks were described in previous publications. This paper presents the details of the lane changing and merging algorithms developed for the SITRAS model. These models incorporate procedures for 'forced' and 'co-operative' lane changing which are essential for lane changing under congested (and incident-affected) traffic conditions. The paper describes the algorithms and presents simulation examples to demonstrate the effects of the implemented models. The results indicate that,only the forced and cooperative lane changing models can produce realistic flow-speed relationships during congested conditions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In this article, a compact and high-gain, wide steering range and very low cross-polarization level holographic metasurface for beam steering is presented. The triangular modulated impedance surface is used for radiating the desired wave. The direction of the radiated beam is controlled through the varactor diode by changing the surface impedance of the device. The two prototypes of the designed device have been fabricated with two different varactor diodes. A higher gain of 11.7 dBi with a lower beam steering range of 25(degrees) and a radiation efficiency above 70% has been obtained from the device with a varactor diode SMV1405-079LF having lower parasitic resistance and larger capacitance properties. However, another fabricated device with higher parasitic resistance and lower capacitance property varactor diode SMV2201-40LF gives a lower gain of 9.1 dBi, a radiation efficiency below 55%, and a larger beam steering range of 61(degrees). The experimental results are in good agreement with the simulation ones. The proposed device can be used for various applications like autonomous vehicles, toll plazas, and satellite communication.

AB This paper proposes a novel automotive radar waveform involving the theory behind M-ary frequency shift key (MFSK) radar systems. Along with the MFSK theory, coding schemes are studied to provide a solution to mutual interference. The proposed MFSK waveform consists of frequency increments throughout the range of 76 GHz to 81 GHz with a step value of 1 GHz. Instead of stepping with a fixed frequency, a triangular chirp sequence allows for static and moving objects to be detected. Therefore, automotive radars will improve Doppler estimation and simultaneous range of various targets. In this paper, a binary coding scheme and a combined transform coding scheme used for radar waveform correlation are evaluated in order to provide unique signals. AVs have to perform in an environment with a high number of signals being sent through the automotive radar frequency band. Efficient coding methods are required to increase the number of signals that are generated. An evaluation method and experimental data of modulated frequencies as well as a comparison with other frequency method systems are presented.

AB Singe-beacon localization technology can help Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to obtain precise positions by deploying only one beacon. It is considered as a promising way, benefiting from saving much time and labor compared with traditional Long-Baseline Localization (LBL). A typical single-beacon localization scheme contains two essential questions: the initial observability problem and long-endurance trajectory tracking problem. Aiming at these core problems, a comprehensive solution for single-beacon localization is described in this paper. An multi-hypothesis initial position discriminant method is proposed firstly, which helps to achieve accurate initial location based on observability analysis. Then, an Adaptive Network Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)-improved Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) method is proposed, in which single-beacon measuring information is fused with off-the-shelf sensors, including DVL, Compass, etc. ANFIS-EKF can help to improve trajectory tracking precisions by restraining the heavy loss of linearization in conventional EKF. Both simulation and field tests are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed algorithms.

AB Infrared (IR) cameras have been important surveillance sensors for autonomous surface vessels; however, their detection ranges are limited by low resolution. In this study, we collect maritime IR images, analyze the characteristics of those images, and develop datasets for training and testing. Then, a new maritime IR image super-resolution network, maritime infrared super-resolution using cascaded residual network, is developed to reconstruct IR images using a scale of 4. Moreover, different loss functions have different effects on output images; a loss function is set to be a combination of three loss functions, including mean absolute error, mean squared error, and perceptual loss. Peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index measure cannot effectively describe super-resolution performance. As the novel evaluation metric, Canny edge detection method is used because edges are important for human and target detection algorithms. Finally, experiments are conducted and the results demonstrate that the developed residual network can achieve high-quality reconstructed maritime IR images.

AB The task assignment and path planning of a multi-AUVs system has now attracted considerable attention and become a hotspot in the research. In this paper, a novel algorithm of multi-AUVs task assignment and path planning based on Biologically Inspired Neural Network Map (BINN) is proposed. Firstly, the grid map is built by discretizing the three-dimensional underwater environment into many equal grids. Secondly, the activity values of all AUVs in the BINN maps of each target are calculated. Then, the AUV with the highest activity value in the BINN map of the target is selected as the winning AUV for the target. Finally, the winning AUV performs path planning according to the BINN strategy.

TI Deep Compression for Dense Point Cloud Maps
SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Deep learning methods; mapping
AB Many modern robotics applications rely on 3D maps of the environment. Due to the large memory requirements of dense 3D maps, compression techniques are often necessary to store or transmit 3D maps efficiently. In this work, we investigate the problem of compressing dense 3D point cloud maps such as those obtained from an autonomous vehicle in large outdoor environments. We tackle the problem by learning a set of local feature descriptors from which the point cloud can be reconstructed efficiently and effectively. We propose a novel deep convolutional autoencoder architecture that directly operates on the points themselves so that we avoid voxelization. Additionally, we propose a deconvolution operator to upsample point clouds, which allows us to decompress to an arbitrary density. Our experiments show that our learned compression achieves better reconstructions at the same bit rate compared to other state-of-the-art compression algorithms. We furthermore demonstrate that our approach generalizes well to different LiDAR sensors. For example, networks learned on maps generated from KITTI point clouds still achieve state-of-the-art compression results for maps generated from nuScences point clouds.

AB Recently a large number of 3D object tracking methods have been extensively investigated and applied in a variety of applications using convolutional neural networks. Although most of them have made great progress in partial occlusion, the intricate interweaving of moving agents (e.g. pedestrians and vehicles) may lead to inferior performance of 3D object tracking in complex traffic scenes. To boost the performance of 3D object tracking in cases of severe occlusions, we present an end-to-end deep learning framework with a driving behavior-aware model that takes full advantage of spatial-temporal details in consecutive frames and learns the driving behavior from object variations in 2D center point, depth, rotation and translation in parallel. In contrast to prior work, our novelty formulates driving behavior that reasons about the possible motion trajectories of the investigated target for autonomous systems. We show in experiments that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on 3D object tracking in the challenging nuScenes dataset.

AB Guaranteeing safety is always a prerequisite in the process of realizing various automotive applications. However, the automotive functional safety design has been challenged by multiple factors, such as the complexity of the new generation automotive electrical and electronic (E/E) architecture, the continuous release and update of automotive functional safety standard International Standardization Organization (ISO) 26262, the release of new AUTOSAR adaptive platform standard, and the increase in different types of costs. In this article, we summarize the recent advances of automotive functional safety design methodologies through analysis, design, optimization, and runtime phases, respectively: 1) functional safety analysis; 2) functional safety guarantee; 3) safety-aware cost optimization; and 4) safety-critical multifunctional scheduling. Then, we provide the future trends in functional safety design methodologies that will be directly oriented to autonomous vehicles and adapt to the next generation functional safety standard ISO 21448.

AB This paper proposes a method to perform on-line multi-class segmentation of Side-Scan Sonar acoustic images, thus being able to build a semantic map of the sea bottom usable to search loop candidates in a SLAM context. The proposal follows three main steps. First, the sonar data is pre-processed by means of acoustics based models. Second, the data is segmented thanks to a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network which is fed with acoustic swaths gathered within a temporal window. Third, the segmented swaths are fused into a consistent segmented image. The experiments, performed with real data gathered in coastal areas of Mallorca (Spain), explore all the possible configurations and show the validity of our proposal both in terms of segmentation quality, with per-class precisions and recalls surpassing the 90%, and in terms of computational speed, requiring less than a 7% of CPU time on a standard laptop computer. The fully documented source code, and some trained models and datasets are provided as part of this study.

DE Legged robots; autonomous vehicle navigation; motion and path planning
AB Long-range locomotion planning is an important problem for the deployment of legged robots to real scenarios. Current methods used for legged locomotion planning often do not exploit the flexibility of legged robots, and do not scale well with environment size. In this letter we propose the use of navigation meshes for deployment in large-scale multi-floor sites. We leverage this representation to improve long-term locomotion plans in terms of success rates, path costs and reasoning about which gait-controller to use when. We show that NavMeshes have higher planning success rates than sampling-based planners, but are 400x faster to construct and at least 100x faster to plan with. The performance gap further increases when considering multi-floor environments. We present both a procedure for building controller-aware NavMeshes and a full navigation system that adapts to changes to the environment. We demonstrate the capabilities of the system in simulation experiments and in field trials at a real-world oil rig facility.

AB Recently, to obtain three-dimensional depth information from a set of stereo images, stereo matching processors are widely used in intelligent robots, autonomous vehicles, and the Internet of things environment, all of which require real-time processing capability with minimal hardware resources. In this paper, we propose a modified adaptive support weight scheme with rectangular ring-type window configurations that minimize hardware resources while maintaining matching accuracy. In addition, to reduce the computational overhead of window-based local stereo matching algorithms, we present a robust disparity search range estimation scheme based on stretched depth histograms. To evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes, we implemented them using C language and performed experiments. In addition, to show the feasibility of the hardware implementation of the proposed schemes, we also describe them using Verilog hardware description language and implemented them using a field-programmable gate array-based platform. Experimental results show that compared to conventional method, the proposed schemes reduced up to 57% of hardware resources and 33% of computational overhead, respectively.

AB The Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center deploys the Modular Optical Underwater Survey System (MOUSS) to estimate the species-specific, size-structured abundance of commercially-important fish species in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands. The MOUSS is an autonomous stereo-video camera system designed for the in situ visual sampling of fish assemblages. This system is rated to 500 m and its low-light, stereo-video cameras enable identification, counting, and sizing of individuals at a range of 0.5-10 m. The modular nature of MOUSS allows for the efficient and cost-effective use of various imaging sensors, power systems, and deployment platforms. The MOUSS is in use for surveys in Hawaii, the Gulf of Mexico, and Southern California. In Hawaiian waters, the system can effectively identify individuals to a depth of 250 m using only ambient light. In this paper, we describe the MOUSS's application in fisheries research, including the design, calibration, analysis techniques, and deployment mechanism.

AB In the conventional integrated navigation system, the statistical information of the process and measurement noises is considered constant. However, due to the changing dynamic environment and imperfect knowledge of the filter statistical information, the process and measurement covariance matrices are unknown and time-varying. In this paper, a multirate adaptive Kalman filter is proposed to improve the performance of the Error State Kalman Filter (ESKF) for a marine navigation system. The designed navigation system is composed of a strapdown inertial navigation system along with Doppler velocity log and inclinometer with different sampling rates. In the proposed filter, the conventional adaptive Kalman filter is modified by adaptively tuning the measurement covariance matrix of the auxiliary sensors that have varying sampling grates based on the innovation sequence. The performance of the proposed filter is evaluated using real measurements. Experimental results show that the average root mean square error of the position estimated by the proposed filter can be decreased by approximately 60% when compared to that of the ESKF.

ID CITY; WALKABILITY
AB Circumambulation paths are special circle streets where road users travel not only for destinations but also for pilgrimage practices. Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region in China, has many streets of this type, such as Nangkhor, Barkhor, Tsekhor, and Lingkhor. The recent sharp rise in car ownership in Lhasa has brought conflicts between drivers and pedestrians and pilgrimage practitioners. Because the situations on these streets are so unique, three customized survey methods were proposed and applied on Lingkhor Street as a case study to investigate problems of the walking environment: (a) the passing-passenger-unit method, which quantifies the right-of-way distribution between road users; (b) the quick-sketch method, which stratifies pedestrians' needs into four levels basic space, commute, rest, and religion; and (c) the poker game method, which identifies the most needed improvements, including limiting the vehicle right-of-way, planting trees, offering rest areas, and providing Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity) coverage. From the survey results, a plan to improve the walking environment in Lhasa was proposed.

ID COVERING LOCATION MODEL; SYSTEM
AB The main objective of emergency medical assistance (EMA) services is to attend patients with sudden diseases at any possible location within an area of influence. This usually consists in providing "in situ" assistance and, if necessary, the transport of the patient to a medical center. The potential of such systems to reduce mortality is directly related to the travel times of ambulances to emergency patients. An efficient coordination of the ambulance fleet of an EMA service is crucial for reducing the average travel times. In this paper we propose mechanisms that dynamically improve the allocation of ambulances to patients as well as the redeployment of available ambulances in the region under consideration. We test these mechanisms in different experiments using historical data from the EMA service of the Autonomous Region of Madrid in Spain: SUMMA112. The results empirically confirm that our proposal reduces the average response times of EMA services significantly. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The first phase of active lunar exploration, which peaked over 20 yr ago with the Apollo program, answered many scientific and engineering questions about our planet's closest neighbor in the solar system. However, it also raised many new ones (i.e. what is the distribution of He-3, can oxygen and other resources be feasibly extracted from the regolith, why is the far side more heavily cratered than the near side?) that need to be addressed before humans return for more extended stays on the lunar surface. Many of these issues can be resolved by a new series of robotic probes, ranging from polar orbiters to surface landers and autonomous revers. This paper presents one concept for such a mission-a lunar lander/rover project that utilizes international cooperation to minimize cost and maximize data return. Using a Delta II launch vehicle, a Russian planetary rover and a cooperatively developed lander that is designed specifically for such revers, it appears that such a mission can be developed quickly and within the $150 million target established for NASA's Discovery program.

AB This study aims to address the three-dimensional path planning problem of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the environment of ocean current and seabed terrain obstacles, based on five biological swarm intelligent algorithm. Firstly, a three-dimensional seabed environment model and a Lamb vortex current environment model are established. Subsequently, a three-dimensional path planning mathematical model is established by considering the navigation distance, seabed terrain constraints and ocean current constraints. Furthermore, five biological swarm intelligent optimization algorithms are applied to solve the multi-objective nonlinear optimization problem. Finally, the experimental results show that the optimal path performance of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is better than other algorithms. The planning speed of PSO algorithm is the fastest, and the robustness of WPA algorithm is the best. However, the planning time is the longest. The PSO algorithm is more suitable for three-dimensional path planning of AUV under the influence of seabed terrain obstacles and ocean currents.

AB AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) coordinated formation can expand the detection range, improve detection efficiency, and complete complex tasks, which requires each AUV to have the ability to track and locate. A wake detector provides a new technical approach for AUV cooperative formation warfare. Now, most of the existing artificial lateral line detectors are for one-dimensional flow field applications, which are difficult to use for wake detection of AUVs. Therefore, based on the pressure gradient sensing mechanism of the canal neuromasts, we apply Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) technology to develop a lateral line-inspired MEMS wake detector. The sensing mechanism, design, and fabrication are demonstrated in detail. Experimental results show the detector's sensitivity is 147 mV.(m/s)(-1), and the detection threshold is 0.3 m/s. In addition, the vector test results verify it has vector-detecting capacity. This wake detector can serve AUVs wake detection and tracking technology, which will be promising in AUV positioning and coordinated formation.

AB In this work, a Detect and Avoid system is presented for the autonomous navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) applications. The current implementation is designed for the operation of multirotor UAVs in UAM corridors. During the operations, unauthorized flying objects may penetrate the corridor airspace posing a risk to the aircraft. In this article, the feasibility of using a solid-state LiDAR (Light Detecting and Ranging) sensor for detecting and positioning these objects was evaluated. For that purpose, a commercial model was simulated using the specifications of the manufacturer along with empirical measurements to determine the scanning pattern of the device. With the point clouds generated by the sensor, the system detects the presence of intruders and estimates their motion to finally compute avoidance trajectories using a Second Order Cone Program (SOCP) in real time. The method was tested in different scenarios, offering robust results. Execution times were of the order of 50 milliseconds, allowing the implementation in real time on modern onboard computers.

AB The formation control problem for a group of first-order agents with model uncertainty and actuator saturation is investigated in this manuscript. An algorithm-and-observer-based formation controller is developed to ensure the semi-global boundedness of the formation tracking error with actuator saturation. First, a fully local-error-related cooperative weight tuning procedure is proposed for the adaptive uncertainty estimation of each agent. The effect of actuator saturation on both the cooperative adaptive estimation and the controller design part is then analysed and discussed. A three-layer neural-based observer is further constructed to achieve finite-time uncertainty approximation with actuator saturation. Besides, the reverse effect led by coupled and saturated control inputs is defined and a new control input distribution algorithm is presented to attenuate the potential oscillation in system states. Finally, comparative simulations based on a multiple omnidirectional robot system are conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed formation controllers and the new algorithm.

Vision-based action recognition and prediction from videos are such tasks, where action recognition is to infer human actions (present state) based upon complete action executions, and action prediction to predict human actions (future state) based upon incomplete action executions. These two tasks have become particularly prevalent topics recently because of their explosively emerging real-world applications, such as visual surveillance, autonomous driving vehicle, entertainment, and video retrieval, etc. Many attempts have been devoted in the last a few decades in order to build a robust and effective framework for action recognition and prediction. In this paper, we survey the complete state-of-the-art techniques in action recognition and prediction. Existing models, popular algorithms, technical difficulties, popular action databases, evaluation protocols, and promising future directions are also provided with systematic discussions.

ID DEPLOYMENT
AB Tethered UAV is composed of a UAV platform, tethered cable and winch. The UAV platform and tethered cable are an interactive whole, and the movement of the UAV platform will change the configuration and tension of the tethered cable. Under extreme external conditions (such as strong airflow) or unprofessional operation, the UAV platform will be prone to extreme movement, which will impact the tethered cable, and in serious cases, the tethered UAV will not work normally. To study the influence on the tethered UAV due to impact, equations for the relation between impact stress and impact parameters are derived and numerically solved to determine the dangerous area of the tethered UAV based on two failure criteria. The obtained results reveal that a smaller elastic modulus and cross-sectional area will lead to less failure of the tethered UAV, and the breaking strength of the cable is vital to the tethered UAV when it is impacted. Engineering suggestions are also provided to make tethered UAVs safer.

TI Polarization-driven semantic segmentation via efficient

SO OPTICS EXPRESS
LA English
DT Article
AB Semantic segmentation (SS) is promising for outdoor scene perception in safety-critical applications like autonomous vehicles, assisted navigation and so on. However, traditional SS is primarily based on RGB images, which limits the reliability of SS in complex outdoor scenes, where RGB images lack necessary information dimensions to fully perceive unconstrained environments. As a preliminary investigation, we examine SS in an unexpected obstacle detection scenario, which demonstrates the necessity of multimodal fusion. Thereby, in this work, we present EAFNet, an Efficient Attention-bridged Fusion Network, to exploit complementary information coming from different optical sensors. Specifically, we incorporate polarization sensing to obtain supplementary information, considering its optical characteristics for robust representation of diverse materials. By using a single-shot polarization sensor, we build the first RGB-P dataset which consists of 394 annotated pixel-aligned RGB-polarization images. A comprehensive variety of experiments shows the effectiveness of EAFNet to fuse polarization and RGB information, as well as its flexibility to be adapted to other sensor combination scenarios.

SO TRANSACTIONS IN GIS

DT Article
AB Accurate and robust positioning of vehicles in urban environments is of high importance for autonomous driving or mobile mapping. In mobile mapping systems, a simultaneous mapping of the environment using laser scanning and an accurate positioning using global navigation satellite systems are targeted. This requirement is often not guaranteed in shadowed cities where global navigation satellite system signals are usually disturbed, weak or even unavailable. We propose a novel approach which incorporates prior knowledge (i.e., a 3D city model of the environment) and improves the trajectory. The recorded point cloud is matched with the semantic city model using a point-to-plane iterative closest point method. A pre-classification step enables an informed sampling of appropriate matching points. Random forest is used as classifier to discriminate between facade and remaining points. Local inconsistencies are tackled by a segmentwise partitioning of the point cloud where an interpolation guarantees a seamless transition between the segments. The general applicability of the method implemented is demonstrated on an inner-city data set recorded with a mobile mapping system.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools play a significant role in the recent evolution of smart systems. AI solutions are pushing towards a significant shift in many fields such as healthcare, autonomous airplanes and vehicles, security, marketing customer profiling and other diverse areas. One of the main challenges hindering the AI potential is the demand for high-performance computation resources. Recently, hardware accelerators are developed in order to provide the needed computational power for the AI and ML tools. In the literature, hardware accelerators are built using FPGAs, GPUs and ASICs to accelerate computationally intensive tasks. These accelerators provide high-performance hardware while preserving the required accuracy. In this work, we present a systematic literature review that focuses on exploring the available hardware accelerators for the AI and ML tools. More than 169 different research papers published between the years 2009 and 2019 are studied and analysed.

AB In the Fourth Industrial Revolution environment, plenty of automatic and smart software in diverse fields will come out, such as virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR), autonomous robots and vehicles, smart factoring, and so on. In Korea, especially, one important issue is the cyber-physical system (CPS), used for monitoring and controlling the smart and automatic system in a smart city. This kind of system, therefore, needs to have good performance; otherwise, it may not respond in time. To solve this, we propose a code visualization approach to reduce code complexity based on a static analysis, which identifies bad codes against performance. To ensure better performance, we make our queries identify performance degradation factors, store statically analyzed data into database (DB) tables, and visualize bad operation patterns. For performance improvement, we can refactor with them. As a result, we reduce the code complexity of CPS-based software to obtain good performance. With this approach, we expect to have better performance and a reduction in the complexity of CPS software without even power consumption.

AB Increasingly complex research questions and global challenges (e.g., climate change and biodiversity loss) are driving rapid development, refinement, and uses of technology in ecology. This trend is spawning a distinct sub-discipline, here termed technoecology. We highlight recent ground-breaking and transformative technological advances for studying species and environments: bio-batteries, low-power and long-range telemetry, the Internet of things, swarm theory, 3D printing, mapping molecular movement, and low-power computers. These technologies have the potential to revolutionize ecology by providing next-generation ecological data, particularly when integrated with each other, and in doing so could be applied to address a diverse range of requirements (e.g., pest and wildlife management, informing environmental policy and decision making). Critical to technoecology's rate of advancement and uptake by ecologists and environmental managers will be fostering increased interdisciplinary collaboration. Ideally, such partnerships will span the conception, implementation, and enhancement phases of ideas, bridging the university, public, and private sectors.

AB Intelligent Environments (IEs) are physical spaces where Information Technology (IT) and other pervasive computing technologies are combined in order to achieve specific goals for the users and the environment. IEs have the goal of enriching user experience, increasing awareness of the environment. A number of applications are currently being deployed in domains ranging from smart homes to e-health and autonomous vehicles. Quite often IE support human activities, thus essential requirements to be ensured are correctness, reliability, safety and security. In this paper we present how a set of techniques and tools that have been developed for the verification of software can be employed in the verification of IE described by means of event-condition-action rules. More precisely, we reduce the problem of verifying key properties of these rules to satisfiability and termination problems that can be addressed using state-of-the-art Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers and program analysers. Our approach has been implemented in a tool called vIRONy. Our approach has been validated on a number of case studies from the literature.

AB Gliding robotic fish, which is a hybrid of underwater gliders and robotic fish, is energy efficient and highly maneuverable and holds strong promise for long-duration monitoring of underwater environments. In this paper, a novel scheme is proposed for autonomously sampling multiple water columns using gliding robotic fish. The scheme exploits energy-efficient spiral-down motion to sample each water column, followed by sagittal-plane glide-up toward the direction of the next water column. Once surfacing, the robot uses Global Positioning System guidance to reach the next column location through swimming. To enhance the path-tracking performance, a two-degree-of-freedom controller involving H-infinity control is used in the spiral motion, and a sliding-mode controller is employed to regulate the yaw angle during glide-up. The sampling scheme has been implemented on a gliding robotic fish prototype, "Grace," and verified first in pool experiments and then in field experiments involving the sampling of harmful algae concentration in the Wintergreen Lake, Michigan.

AB This paper presents a nonlinear adaptive aggressive controller to provide the small scale helicopter with full authority of a variety of flight conditions. Adaptive backstepping technique is employed to systematically synthesize the proposed controller with the online parameter adaptation rule to the vehicle mass variations and with the recurrent neural network (RNN) approximation to the coupling effect between the force and moment controls. This single and systematic design methodology is shown to achieve the semi-global ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop helicopter dynamics and accommodate the aggressive control of flight maneuvers from hovering to trajectory tracking. The high-fidelity and well-validated nonlinear model of a small scale helicopter incorporating with unmodeled dynamics and measurement uncertainties is adopted in the numerical simulations. The performance and merits of the proposed controller are exemplified by conducting three simulation scenarios including the slalom maneuver described in the ADS33. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, a vision-based system for underwater object detection is presented. The system is able to detect automatically a pipeline placed on the sea bottom, and some objects, e.g. trestles and anodes, placed in its neighborhoods. A color compensation procedure has been introduced in order to reduce problems connected with the light attenuation in the water. Artificial neural networks are then applied in order to classify in real-time the pixels of the input image into different classes, corresponding e.g. to different objects present in the observed scene. Geometric reasoning is applied to reduce the detection of false objects and to improve the accuracy of true detected objects. The results on real underwater images representing a pipeline structure in different scenarios are shown. The presence of seaweed and sand, different illumination conditions and water depth, different pipeline diameter and small variations of the camera tilt angle are considered to evaluate the algorithm performances.

ID SCHEME
AB To achieve autonomous all-day flight by high-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle (HALE UAV), a new navigation method with deep integration of strapdown inertial measurement unit (SIMU) and triple star sensors based on atmospheric refraction correction is proposed. By analysing the atmospheric refraction model, the stellar azimuth coordinate system is introduced and the coupling relationship between attitude and position is established. Based on the geometric relationship whereby all the stellar azimuth planes intersect on the common zenith direction, the sole celestial navigation system (CNS) method by stellar refraction with triple narrow fields of view (FOVs) is studied and a loss function is built to evaluate the navigation accuracy. Finally, the new SIMU/triple star sensors deep integrated navigation method with refraction correction upgraded from the traditional inertial navigation system (INS)/CNS integrated method can be established. The results of simulations show that the proposed method can effectively restrain navigation error of a HALE UAV in 24 h steady-state cruising in the stratosphere.

AB The active detection of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is a challenging task because the echoes from targets are seriously weak under a monostatic configuration. In this work, a forward scattering detection scheme was developed for the active sensing of AUV intruders. A linear frequency modulation pulse was transmitted periodically for the acquisition of multipath propagation responses in a harbor environment. The least mean square algorithm after matched filtering was employed for direct blast suppression. A cumulative index was defined for detection on the basis of the error sequence of the adaptive filter. Sea experiments using an AUV as an intruder in crossing events were conducted to demonstrate the ability of the proposed scheme. The time of each crossing event was determined. The detection scheme was found to have a detection capability with a low source level. The performance was determined by the signal-to-direct blast ratio, which was correlated with the source-target-receiver geometry. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A novel paradigm that combines federated learning with blockchain to empower edge intelligence over vehicular networks (FBVN) can enable latency-sensitive deep neural network-based applications to be executed in a distributed pattern. However, the complex environments in FBVN make the system latency much harder to minimize by traditional methods. In this article, we model the training and transmission latency of each autonomous vehicle (AV) and consensus latency of the blockchain in-edge side in FBVN. Considering the dynamic and time-varying wireless channel conditions, unpredictable packet error rate, and unstable data sets quality, we adopt duel deep Q-learning (DDQL) as the solving approach. We propose a federated DDQL algorithm, in which the learning agent is deployed on each AV side, and the sensing states on each AV do not need to be shared so that it increases scalability and flexibility for practical implementation. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has better performance in reducing system latency compared with the other schemes.

DE Deep learning; Pose estimation; Heading prediction
AB Information transmission in underwater conditions cannot depend on various media, thus an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is imperative to assist divers with conducting underwater operations and information transmission. However, little work has been done to promote the interaction between AUV and divers. To help resolve this issue, this paper proposes a method to help the navigation guidance of AUV by predicting the divers' headings. In this work, the visual method is chosen to estimate pose of divers since it can adapt to complex underwater environment conditions at a lower cost than other methods. The contour information is used to obtain the keypoints of the diver which are input into the Long-Short Term Memory Network to predict the headings. The dataset which redefines the skeleton of divers in our work is original and open for future researches. Compared with the original method, the accuracy of pose estimation on this dataset is 85%, an increase of 9%, and with a small error of diver's heading prediction, which indicates that our method can obtain competitive prediction results.

AB At present, the method of using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with traditional navigation equipment for inspection of overhead transmission lines has the limitations of expensive sensors, difficult data processing, and vulnerable to weather and environmental factors, which cannot ensure the safety of UAV and power systems. Therefore, this paper establishes a mathematical model of spatial distribution of transmission lines to study the field strength distribution information around transmission lines. Based on this, research the navigation and positioning algorithm. The data collected by the positioning system are input into the mathematical model to complete the identification, positioning, and safety distance diagnosis of the field source. The detected data and processing results can provide reference for UAV obstacle avoidance navigation and safety warning. The experimental results show that the positioning effect of the positioning navigation algorithm is obvious, and the positioning error is within the range of use error and has good usability and application value.

AB This paper proposes an adaptive tracking control scheme for multi-spacecraft formation with inter-collision avoidance, obstacle dodging, and connectivity preservation. The proposed scheme is distributed, i.e., each spacecraft only needs to communicate with its neighbours. Both connectivity preservation and distributed networking are critical features for small spacecraft formation with limited computation and communication capacities. New artificial potential functions are defined to preserve the connectivity of neighbour spacecraft while avoiding their inter-collision as well as collision with obstacles. An adaptive sliding-mode controller is designed for reaching and maintaining the predetermined formation configuration while satisfying the safety assurance requirements, including inter-collision avoidance, obstacle dodging, and connectivity preservation. The stability of the controller is proven through the Lyapunov analysis, in the presence of gravitational, solar radiation pressure, and atmosphere drag perturbations and dynamic uncertainties. The performance of the control scheme is demonstrated through several comparative simulation studies.

AB Featured Application A potential application of the work is research and design of autonomous underwater vehicle, especially the development of bionicfish-robots. A multi-medium motion capture system based on markers' visual detection is developed and experimentally demonstrated for monitoring underwater intelligent agents such as fish biology and bionic robot-fish. Considering the refraction effect between air and water, a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction model is established, which can be utilized to reconstruct the 3D coordinate of markers underwater from 2D data. Furthermore, the process of markers matching is undertaken through the multi-lens fusion perception prediction combined K-Means clustering algorithm. Subsequently, in order to track the marker of being occluded, according to the kinematics information of fish, an improved Kalman filtering algorithm is proposed. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of proposed system are verified through experimental results. The main models and methods in this paper can provide a reference and inspiration for measurement of underwater intelligent agents.

AB Visual place recognition plays an increasingly important role in robot navigation, autonomous flight of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), personal navigation, and so on. However, some texture-less scenarios and computational cost are still challenging. In order to improve the performance of visual place recognition with low computational complexity in the texture-less Manhattan world, this article proposes a fast and reliable method using bag-of-words of structural lines represented by the Extended Line Band Descriptors with Pose estimation capability, namely ELBDP. Furthermore, a robust method that only uses one pair of vanishing points and one structural line to estimate the relative pose between image pairs is proposed. The results show that proposed method outperforms point-based approaches such as oriented features from accelerated segment test and rotated binary robust independent elementary features (ORB)-based place recognition, in terms of efficiency, precision, recall, and accuracy of relative pose estimation.

DE Target tracking; Inequality constraints; Maneuvering target tracking;

ID PARTICLE FILTER; ALGORITHM
AB This paper addresses the problem of enabling a constant velocity observer to track a maneuvering target using inequality constraints. In this paper, an observer measures the bearing of sound emitted from the target at each time step. We consider an observer which can access the inequality constraints imposed on target's speed, range, target's course, or target location. As far as we know, this paper is unique in making a constant velocity observer, which measures the bearing angle of a maneuvering target, track the target assisted by range, course, speed, or target location constraints. The observer restarts the filter using inequality constraints to reduce the estimation error considerably, even after the filter diverges. As the observer restarts the filter, stored target information is reused by running the filter backward in time. We verify the effectiveness of our filter restart approach by comparing it with the interacting multiple model (IMM) Kalman filter using MATLAB simulations.

AB Cooperative hunting with multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) not only needs the AUVs to cooperate, but also demands real-time path planning to catch up with evading targets. In this paper a time-based alliance mechanism to form efficient dynamic hunting alliances is proposed. After that, during the active hunting stage, an improved neural network model based on a Glasius Bio-inspired Neural Network (GBNN) is presented for path planning to immediately achieve tracking of an intelligent target. This study shows that the improved GBNN model has good performance in real-time hunting path planning. From the simulation studies as described in this paper, both the hunting alliance formation mechanism and the proposed real-time hunting path planning strategy show their advantages. The results show that the improved GBNN model proposed in this paper can work well in the control of multiple AUVs to hunt for intelligent evading targets in environments containing obstacles.

ID WEAPON-TARGET ASSIGNMENT; ALGORITHM
AB This paper proposes a multi-objective decision-making model for underwater countermeasures based on a multi-objective decision theory and solves it using the multi-objective discrete particle swarm optimization (MODPSO) algorithm. Existing decision-making models are based on fully allocated assignment without considering the weapon consumption and communication delay, which does not conform to the actual naval combat process. The minimum opponent residual threat probability and minimum own-weapon consumption are selected as two functions of the multi-objective decision-making model in this paper. Considering the impact of the communication delay, the multi-objective discrete particle swarm optimization (MODPSO) algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal solution of the distribution scheme with different weapon consumptions. The algorithm adopts the natural number coding method, and the particle corresponds to the confrontation strategy. The simulation result shows that underwater communication delay impacts the decision-making selection. It verifies the effectiveness of the proposed model and the proposed multi-objective discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm.

AB High-resolution geophysical data have been collected using the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Sentry over the ASHES (Axial Seamount Hydrothermal Emission Study) high-temperature (similar to 348 degrees C) vent field at Axial Seamount, on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Multiple surveys were performed on a 3-D grid at different altitudes above the seafloor, providing an unprecedented view of magnetic data resolution as a function of altitude above the seafloor. Magnetic data derived near the seafloor show that the ASHES field is characterized by a zone of low magnetization, which can be explained by hydrothermal alteration of the host volcanic rocks. Surface manifestations of hydrothermal activity at the ASHES vent field are likely controlled by a combination of local faults and fractures and different lava morphologies near the seafloor. Three-dimensional inversion of the magnetic data provides evidence of a vertical, pipe-like upflow zone of the hydrothermal fluids with a vertical extent of similar to 100 m.

AB With wider investigations and applications of autonomous robotics and intelligent vehicles, the inverted pendulum on a cart (IPC) system has become more attractive for numerous researchers due to its concise and representative structure. In this article, the tracking-control problem of the IPC system is considered and investigated. Based on Zhang dynamics (ZD) and gradient dynamics (GD), a novel kind of ZG controllers are developed and investigated for achieving the tracking-control purpose, which contains controllers of z2g0 and z2g1 types according to the number of times of using the ZD and GD methods. Besides, theoretical analyses are presented to guarantee the global and exponential convergence performance of both z2g0 and z2g1 controllers. Computer simulations are further performed to substantiate the feasibility and effectiveness of ZG controllers. More importantly, comparative simulation results demonstrate that controllers of z2g1 type can conquer the singularity problem (i.e. the division-by-zero problem).

DT Article
DE DVL-aided; in-motion alignment; AUKF; measurement noise covariance
AB In-motion alignment of Strapdown Inertial Navigation Systems (SINS) without any geodetic-frame observations is one of the toughest challenges for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV). This paper presents a novel scheme for Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) aided SINS alignment using Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) which allows large initial misalignments. With the proposed mechanism, a nonlinear SINS error model is presented and the measurement model is derived under the assumption that large misalignments may exist. Since a priori knowledge of the measurement noise covariance is of great importance to robustness of the UKF, the covariance-matching methods widely used in the Adaptive KF (AKF) are extended for use in Adaptive UKF (AUKF). Experimental results show that the proposed DVL-aided alignment model is effective with any initial heading errors. The performances of the adaptive filtering methods are evaluated with regards to their parameter estimation stability. Furthermore, it is clearly shown that the measurement noise covariance can be estimated reliably by the adaptive UKF methods and hence improve the performance of the alignment.

TI ENABLING MOBILITY IN HETEROGENEOUS WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS COOPERATING
   WITH UAVS FOR MISSION-CRITICAL MANAGEMENT
SO IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB Wireless sensor networks have the promise of revolutionizing the capture, processing, and communication of mission-critical data for the use of first operational forces. Their low cost, low power, and size make it feasible to embed them into environment monitoring tags in critical care regions, first responders uniform gear, and data collector sinks attached to unmanned aerial vehicles. The ability to actively change the location of sensors can be used to mitigate some of the traditional problems associated with static sensor networks. On the other hand, sensor mobility brings its own challenges. These include challenges associated with in-network aggregation of sensor data, routing, and activity monitoring of responders. Moreover, all different mobility patterns (e.g., sink mobility, sensor mobility) have their special properties, so that each mobile device class needs its own approach. In this article, we present a platform which benefits from both static and mobile sensors and addresses these challenges. The system integrates WSNs, UAVs, and actuators into a disaster response setting, and provides facilities for event detection, autonomous network repair by UAVs, and quick response by integrated operational forces.

AB Automatic construction of high-resolution topographical maps, or determining the shape of man-made objects, targets, and obstacles for localization, identification, and/or recognition, is an important capability in the application of autonomous or intelligent underwater vehicles. In this paper, we investigate the application of underwater image models for the reconstruction of three-dimensional object shapes from the shading cues in two-dimensional optical images. We first present the results of a sensitivity analysis in support of a simplified model for a Lambertian surface illuminated by a point source in an attenuating medium, proposed in earlier work. We then generalize a closed-form solution for planar scenes, previously proposed for negligible source-camera baseline, to the case where the baseline may be increased to minimize backscatter effects. For curved surfaces, we propose two techniques based on different iterative updating strategies to recursively improve the recovered surface shape. We study the performance of various methods using synthetic data and real images acquired under different turbidity conditions.

   (ISSS); multibeam echosounder (MBES); rapid environment assessment (REA)
AB Building an accurate and large digital terrain model (DTM) of the seabed is a key issue in various applications, especially for covert rapid environment assessment using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). New AUV generations are capable of acquiring bathymetry with multiple acoustic sensors: singlebeam echosounder, Doppler velocity log, multibeam echosounder (MBES), interferometric sidescan sonar (ISSS), etc. As these sensors acquire the seabed with different geometries, they can be combined to produce a DTM in shorter time. For example, ISSS can reach a wide swath in shallow water but it shows an information gap at nadir, which is usually covered by completing an additional track. Simultaneously using the MBES to acquire the nadir removes the need for this additional track and reduces the energy consumption of the whole survey. This paper focuses on fusion algorithms to extract best information of the two sensors (MBES and ISSS) to feed DTM production software with optimal bathymetric information. This problem may be solved by taking into account the average information of the two sensors. However, the sensors do not always give accurate information and the average information therefore becomes biased. Another way to tackle the problem is to select a priori information given by the better of the two sensors based on a given geometric parameter (e. g., grazing angle). In this case, when the assumed best sensor fails, the information produced by the second sensor cannot be used to compensate for the erroneous information. Our approach consists in using all the available information and fuses it ahead of producing the DTM. Based on the theory of belief functions, this paper presents a framework to fuse the information coming from the two swath bathymetric sensors (MBES and ISSS). The belief theory, applied successfully to other fields, has been extended to handle the bathymetric information. The reliability and the uncertainty of each sonar are introduced in the fusion process to improve the estimation and the accuracy of the final terrain model. First, simulated sonar data, with perfectly known ground truth, are used to quantitatively assess the performance of the fusion process by comparing DTM obtained with and without fusion. Then, the experimental validation is conducted on actual data, acquired simultaneously by the two sonars systems (Klein K5000 ISSS, Reson 8125 MBES) mounted on the DAURADE AUV. Our evaluation of the fusion method shows significant quantitative and qualitative improvement in the production of the final DTM.

AB This paper addressed the problems in UUV dynamic base recovery, such as limited mission time, high control accuracy requirements and many uncertainties. The entire recycling process has been designed in sections to address these issues. A new sliding mode surface with predictive ideas based on the original fast terminal sliding mode control is designed for each phase, and a neural network (RBF) is introduced to compensate for the deviation between the actuator output and the controller command in practice. A new sliding-mode surface based on the compensated sliding-mode surface can be used to compensate for the failure of the original actuator due to faults and other factors, and a corresponding adaptive controller is derived. Simulation and experimental verification show that the designed controller not only has good convergence quality, but also can quickly adjust the position to the recovery mother ship after the original actuator failure, meeting the requirements of dynamic base recovery, and the feasibility in practice has been effectively proved.

AB To exploit richer spectrum resources for even better service quality, millimeter wave (mmWave) communication has been considered for high-speed railway (HSR) communication systems. In this paper, we focus on scheduling as many flows as possible while satisfying their QoS requirements. Due to interference, eavesdropping, or other problems, some flows may not be directly transmitted from the track-side BS. In this paper, we propose an UAV-assisted scheduling scheme which utilizes a UAV to serve as relay for such flows. The proposed scheme also utilize two mmWave bands, one for the BS links and the other for the UAV links. The proposed algorithm aims to maximize the number of flows with their QoS requirements satisfied. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a superior performance on the number of completed flows and the system throughput over two baseline schemes.

AB Traditional direct SLAM methods formulate the camera pose and map estimation as minimization of the photometric error, which is tackled by the Gauss-Newton algorithm or the Leven berg-Marquardt algorithm in the optimization. However, the convexity of the photometric error only holds in a small region due to the characteristics of the convexity for grayscale images. Thus, the system may be stuck in sub-optimal local minima when tracking points have large displacement. Unlike grayscale images, the semantic probabilities omit the details inside the semantic objects while mainly reforming on the boundary of semantic objects, which has better convexity for large displacement. In this letter, we propose a novel semantic-direct visual odometry (SDVO), exploiting the direct alignment of semantic probabilities. By constructing the joint error function based on grayscale images and semantic probabilities, the joint error function achieves better convexity contrary to the photometric error. Consequently, the proposed system moves towards optima with steady steps in the optimization iterations. Experimental results on the challenging real-world dataset demonstrate a significant improvement over the baseline by integrating the direct alignment of semantic probabilities.

AB One of the problems encountered in the field of computer vision and video data analysis is the extraction of information from low-contrast images. This problem can be addressed in several ways, including the use of histogram equalisation algorithms. In this work, a method designed for this purpose-the Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) algorithm-is implemented in hardware. An FPGA platform is used for this purpose due to the ability to run parallel computations and very low power consumption. To enable the processing of a 4K resolution (UHD, 3840 x 2160 pixels) video stream at 60 fps (frames per second) by using the CLAHE method, it is necessary to use a vector data format and process multiple pixels simultaneously. The algorithm realised in this work can be a component of a larger vision system, such as in autonomous vehicles or drones, but it can also support the analysis of underwater, thermal, or medical images both by humans and in an automated system.

AB This research integrates Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) (Performance Expectancy [PE], Effort Expectancy [EE], and Social Influence) with Diffusion of Innovation Theory (TRialability [TR] and OBservability [OB]) as well as Perceived Risk (PR) to identify a wider set of latent factors affecting acceptance of fully automated AVs. Although research on AVs acceptance has been conducted in developed countries, it is a rather new topic in developing countries, where it has only been introduced as a promising technology to come. Structural equation modeling on stated preference surveys data of 641 Tehran residents in 2019 justifies the proposed integration of two theories and PR. Only PR shows an expected negative sign (-0.2); Among UTAUT variables, PE (0.33) and EE (0.25) were the most and least influential factors, respectively. Regression weights of DOI-related variables show that TR (0.17) and OB (0.16) have almost equal effect.

AB In the post Moore's era, conventional electronic digital computing platforms have encountered escalating challenges to support massively parallel and energy-hungry artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. Intelligent applications in data centers, edge devices, and autonomous vehicles have restricted requirements in throughput, power, and latency, which raises a high demand for a revolutionary neurocomputing solution. Optical neural network (ONN) is a promising hardware platform that could represent a paradigm shift in efficient neurocomputing with its ultra-fast speed, high parallelism, and low energy consumption. In recent years, efforts have been made to facilitate the ONN design stack and push forward the practical application of optical neural accelerators. In this tutorial, we give an overview of state-of-the-art cross-layer co-design methodologies for scalable, robust, and self-learnable ONN designs across the circuit, architecture, and algorithm levels. Besides, we analyze challenges and highlight emerging directions targeting next-generation optics for AI.

AB We synthesize shared control protocols subject to probabilistic temporal logic specifications. Specifically, we develop a framework in which a human and an autonomy protocol can issue commands to carry out a certain task. We blend these commands into a joint input to a robot. We model the interaction between the human and the robot as a Markov decision process representing the shared control scenario. Using inverse reinforcement learning, we obtain an abstraction of the human's behavior. We use randomized strategies to account for randomness in human's decisions, caused by factors such as the complexity of the task specifications or imperfect interfaces. We design the autonomy protocol to ensure that the resulting robot behavior satisfies given safety and performance specifications in probabilistic temporal logic. Additionally, the resulting strategies generate behavior as similar to the behavior induced by the human's commands as possible. We solve the underlying problem efficiently using quasiconvex programming. Case studies involving autonomous wheelchair navigation and unmanned aerial vehicle mission planning showcase the applicability of our approach.

AB Pedestrian detection is a particular case of object detection that helps to reduce accidents in advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. It is not an easy task because of the variability of the objects and the time constraints. A performance comparison of object detection methods, including both GPU and non-GPU implementations over a variety of on-road specific databases, is provided. Computer vision multi-class object detection can be integrated on sensor fusion modules where recall is preferred over precision. For this reason, ad hoc training with a single class for pedestrians has been performed and we achieved a significant increase in recall. Experiments have been carried out on several architectures and a special effort has been devoted to achieve a feasible computational time for a real-time system. Finally, an analysis of the input image size allows to fine-tune the model and get better results with practical costs.

ID VEHICULAR NETWORKS; 5G
AB Led by industrialization of smart cities, numerous interconnected mobile devices, and novel applications have emerged in the urban environment, providing great opportunities to realize industrial automation. In this context, autonomous driving is an attractive issue, which leverages large amounts of sensory information for smart navigation while posing intensive computation demands on resource constrained vehicles. Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a potential solution to alleviate the heavy burden on the devices. However, varying states of multiple edge servers as well as a variety of vehicular offloading modes make efficient task offloading a challenge. To cope with this challenge, we adopt a deep Q-learning approach for designing optimal offloading schemes, jointly considering selection of target server and determination of data transmission mode. Furthermore, we propose an efficient redundant offloading algorithm to improve task offloading reliability in the case of vehicular data transmission failure. We evaluate the proposed schemes based on real traffic data. Results indicate that our offloading schemes have great advantages in optimizing system utilities and improving offloading reliability.

AB In most areas where weight reduction is crucial, carbon fiber reinforced composites (CFRPs) are an excellent choice. Carbon fiber, besides its structural role, can be applied for several secondary functions as well, based on its electrical properties; for example, it can be used for crosslinking, welding, as a sensor and it can also facilitate self-healing. By merging these functions, a multifunctional part or structure can be created. In this article, we review multifunctional application examples of reinforcing carbon fiber. The focus is on utilization: which additional function and what physical layout can be used with CFRP. In a summarizing table (Table 1), we classified the presented examples according to their secondary function, the material used and the physical layout. With the combination of different functions, important materials can be created for the energy and transportation industry, for autonomous vehicles and for Industry 4.0.

AB This brief addresses the blanket coverage problem, in which it is desired to cover a long region by moving the blanket within the boundaries representing the main region. To this purpose, a group of autonomous mobile sensors are deployed aiming at maximizing the sensing performance. The blanket coverage area, which is considered to be a region with changing boundaries, is directed to move along the boundaries of the region. Throughout this process, the agents adapt to the varying coverage area by imposing the dynamics of the boundaries on their respective control law. The presented control law ensures that the agents move toward the centroid of their respective Voronoi cell while taking into account the effect of the moving boundaries. The proposed coverage method deploys the agents within the boundaries of coverage area and ensures the (locally) optimal partitioning for the moving coverage area. Performance of the proposed blanket coverage method is examined via numerical examples that use sections of Ohio river and a border buffer zone.

AB A hierarchical approach for modelling the adaptability features of complex systems is introduced. It is based on a structural level S, describing the adaptation dynamics of the system, and a behavioural level B accounting for the description of the admissible dynamics of the system. Moreover, a unified system, called S[B], is defined by coupling S and B. The adaptation semantics is such that the S level imposes structural constraints on the B level, which has to adapt whenever it no longer can satisfy them. In this context, we introduce weak and strong adaptability, i.e. the ability of a system to adapt for some evolution paths or for all possible evolutions, respectively. We provide a relational characterisation for these two notions and we show that adaptability checking, i.e. deciding if a system is weakly or strongly adaptable, can be reduced to a CTL model checking problem. We apply the model and the theoretical results to the case study of a motion controller of autonomous transport vehicles. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The analysis of high-resolution vector magnetic data acquired by deep-sea submersibles (DSSs) requires the development of specific approaches adapted to their uneven tracks. We present a method that takes advantage of (1) the varying altitude of the DSS above the seafloor and (2) high-resolution multibeam bathymetric data acquired separately, at higher altitude, by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle, to estimate the absolute magnetization intensity and the magnetic polarity of the shallow subseafloor along the DSS path. We apply this method to data collected by DSS Nautile on a small active basalt-hosted hydrothermal site. The site is associated with a lack of magnetization, in agreement with previous findings at the same kind of sites: the contrast between nonmagnetic sulfide deposits/stockwork zone and strongly magnetized basalt is sufficient to explain the magnetic signal observed at such a low altitude. Both normal and reversed polarities are observed in the lava flows surrounding the site, suggesting complex history of accumulating volcanic flows.

AB In this paper, the autonomous in-orbit-self-assembly of multiple satellites is exploited in close proximity operations. Guidance and control algorithms are developed based on the closed-form analytical solution of relative motion equations that is completely explicit in time in a general Keplerian orbit. The guidance algorithm is based on a modified version of the inbound glideslope transfer that was used in the past for rendezvous and proximity operations of the space shuttle with other vehicles. The control algorithm is based on a discrete multipulse technique that was used to track the guidance trajectory efficiently while avoiding collisions between satellites during maneuvers. These algorithms are general, and can translate each satellite in the assembly in any direction and decelerate while approaching the desired target location in the final assembly configuration. Numerical nonlinear simulations that illustrate the performance and accuracy of the proposed algorithms are performed in a cubic formation assembly. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB We present a novel multi-frame structure from motion algorithm in which camera motion and object structure are calculated from optical flow probability distributions instead of a single optical flow estimate at each feature point. Optical flow distributions of the selected feature points allow us to quantify the accuracy of the optical flow estimate in any direction. With this additional knowledge, a more accurate structure from motion algorithm is created which relies on this more accurate optical flow data. This novel method is designed to use the optical flow values taken from multiple frames of video or an image sequence. It is an optimal solution to the structure from motion problem with respect to a chosen norm. We will demonstrate that this new method performs significantly better than similar methods which do not use optical flow distributions or which do not use multiple frames. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB In autonomous applications for mobility and transport, a high-rate and highly accurate vehicle-state estimation is achieved by fusing measurements of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and inertial sensors. The state estimation and its protection-level generation often suffer from satellite-signal disturbances in urban environments and subsequent poor parametrization of the satellite observables. Thus, we propose an innovative scheme involving an extended H-infinity filter (EHF) for robust state estimation and zonotope for the protection-level generation. This scheme is shown as part of a tightly coupled navigation system based on an inertial navigation system and aided by the GPS/Galileo dual-constellation satellite navigation system. Specifically, GNSS pseudorange and deltarange observables are utilized. The experimental results of post-processing a real-world dataset show significant advantages of EHF against a conventional extended Kalman filter regarding the navigation accuracy and robustness under various GNSS measurement parametrizations and environmental circumstances. The zonotope-based protection-level calculation is proven valid, computationally affordable, and feasible for real-time implementations.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) play an important role in deep-sea exploration, in which AUV self-localization is a key component. However, due to poor visibility caused by challenging marine environments, AUVs are often equipped with high-cost and heavy-weight acoustic sensors to accomplish localization tasks. We propose a robust real-time AUV self-localization method based on stereo camera and inertial sensor, which merges point and diagonal features, as well as inertial measurements to overcome the challenges of poor visibility. Our method also includes an underwater loop detection algorithm based on the combination of points and diagonal segments, which can extract effective binary descriptors in low-textured underwater scenarios. Furthermore, we develop an AUV self-localization system based on a real-time, portable, low-cost, and small volume sensor suite. Finally, we test the proposed method in a real underwater environment using our sensor suite, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method under dramatically changing underwater scenarios.

AB Burning forests, petrochemical installations and material warehouses generate very large fields and thermal gradients, which means human intervention to extinguish the fire is greatly limited. For that reason, the use of robots is recommended, but because of high temperature, they have to be equipped with protective thermal shields. This article is an analytical, numerical, and experimental study on how a double-wall, stainless steel heat shield influenced the thermal gradients acting on a firefighting robot. Following the analytical analysis at a maximum temperature of 350 degrees C, it was possible to identify the parameters that must be measured to be correlated with those from finite element analysis (FEM) analysis. Experimental tests showed a decrease in temperature behind the shield due to the stainless steel and the double-walled. The main conclusions and contributions of this paper consist of the realization of a finite difference model with FEM that takes into account conduction, convection, and radiation. It also highlights the benefits of using a multilayer shield.

AB Increasing use of lasers in many different fields, from ultraviolet to near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, requires the development of efficient broadband optical protections to ensure safety during their utilizations. Among the available technologies, nonlinear optical limiting appears as the most versatile and efficient one. Earlier research has focused on optical limiting materials for visible wavelengths. NIR wavelengths used in telecommunication or optical sensors such as for autonomous vehicles represent a highly challenging area with very few reports in particular in the solid state. This work discusses the preparation of efficient NIR optical filters combining azabodipy dyes with plasmonic nanoparticles in sol-gel monoliths. This strategy allows us to strongly enhance the nonlinear performance of the dyes, creating a synergy effect never observed on such a system in the NIR region.

AB In five experiments (N = 1,490), participants were asked to imagine themselves as programmers of self-driving cars who had to decide how to program the car to respond in a potential accident: spare the driver or spare pedestrians. Alternatively, participants imagined that they were a mayor grappling with difficult moral dilemmas concerning COVID-19. Either they, themselves, had to decide how to program the car or which COVID-19 policy to implement (high-agency condition) or they were told by their superior how to act (low-agency condition). After learning that a tragic outcome occurred because of their action, participants reported their felt culpability. Although we expected people to feel less culpable about the outcome if they acted in accordance with their superior's injunction than if they made the decision themselves, participants actually felt more culpable when they followed their superior's order. Some possible reasons for this counterintuitive finding are discussed.

AB An autonomous surface vehicle, known as a wave glider, was used to record refracted and reflected signals from a seismic source penetrating the shallow subsurface. An integrated survey system consisting of a wave gilder and a human-operated source vessel was deployed. These survey systems are used to acquire wide-offset seismic survey data from specific areas, such as offshore structures. The wave gliders can collect seismic refraction and reflection data, which can be used to estimate subsurface information, e.g., acoustic wave velocity and subsurface structure. We processed raw data collected by a receiver equipped with the wave glider and used the relationship between travel time and offset distance to calculate the velocities of shallow sedimentary deposits and the acoustic basement. The velocities of the sedimentary deposits and basement were estimated to be 1557 and 3507 m/s, respectively. We then overlaid the velocities on subsurface data measured using a single-channel streamer. Our results indicate that unmanned equipment can be used for ocean exploration to aid offshore energy development.

AB In the area of traffic sign detection (TSD) methods, deep learning has been implemented and achieves outstanding performance. The detection of a traffic sign, as it has a dual function in monitoring and directing the driver, is a big concern for driver support systems. A core feature of autonomous vehicle systems is the identification of the traffic sign. This article focuses on the prohibitive sign. The objective is to detect in real-time and reduce processing time considerably. In this study, we implement the spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) principle to boost Yolo V3's backbone network for the extraction of functionality. Our work uses SPP for more comprehensive learning of multiscale object features. Then, perform a comparative investigation of Yolo V3 and Yolo V3 SPP across various scales to recognize the prohibitory sign. Comparisons with Yolo V3 SPP models reveal that their mean average precision (mAP) is higher than Yolo V3. Furthermore, the test accuracy findings indicate that the Yolo V3 SPP model performs better than Yolo V3 for different sizes.

AB The need to recognize long-term dependencies in sequential data, such as video streams, has made long short-term memory (LSTM) networks a prominent artificial intelligence model for many emerging applications. However, the high computational and memory demands of LSTMs introduce challenges in their deployment on latency-critical systems such as self-driving cars, which are equipped with limited computational resources on-board. In this article, we introduce a progressive inference computing scheme that combines model pruning and computation restructuring leading to the best possible approximation of the result given the available latency budget of the target application. The proposed methodology enables mission-critical systems to make informed decisions even in early stages of the computation, based on approximate LSTM inference, meeting their specifications on safety and robustness. Our experiments on a state-of-the-art driving model for autonomous vehicle navigation demonstrate that the proposed approach can yield outputs with similar quality of result compared to a faithful LSTM baseline, up to 415x faster (198x on average, 76x geo. mean).

AB Semantic segmentation is a challenging task in computer vision systems. A lot of methods have been developed to tackle this problem ranging from autonomous vehicles, human-computer interaction, to robotics, medical research, agriculture and so on. Many of these methods have been built using the deep learning paradigm that has shown a salient performance. For this reason, we propose to survey these methods by, first categorizing them into ten different classes according to the common concepts underlying their architectures. Second, by providing an overview of the publicly available datasets on which they have been assessed. In addition, we present the common evaluation matrix used to measure their accuracy. Moreover, we focus on some of the methods and look closely at their architectures in order to find out how they have achieved their reported performances. Finally, we conclude by discussing some of the open problems and their possible solutions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The multi-autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) distributed task allocation model of a contract net, which introduces an equilibrium coefficient, has been established to solve the multi-AUV distributed task allocation problem. A differential evolution quantum artificial bee colony (DEQABC) optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the multi-AUV optimal task allocation scheme. The algorithm is based on the quantum artificial bee colony algorithm, and it takes advantage of the characteristics of the differential evolution algorithm. This algorithm can remember the individual optimal solution in the population evolution and internal information sharing in groups and obtain the optimal solution through competition and cooperation among individuals in a population. Finally, a simulation experiment was performed to evaluate the distributed task allocation performance of the differential evolution quantum bee colony optimization algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that the DEQABC algorithm converges faster than the QABC and ABC algorithms in terms of both iterations and running time. The DEQABC algorithm can effectively improve AUV distributed multi-tasking performance.

AB The coverage rate of the underwater sensor networks directly influences on the monitoring efficiency in underwater environment, and it can be effectively improved by adjusting the positions of the mobile nodes reasonably for a 3D underwater sensor network which consists of mobile nodes as underwater robots like Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. An optimal deployment method can quickly set up a reasonable topology of the sensor networks and achieve a higher efficiency for detecting or investigating. An optimal algorithm of coverage enhancing for 3D Underwater sensor networks based on improved Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (UFOA) is proposed in this paper. This method realizes the global optimal coverage based on foraging behavior of fruit flies, and it has the features of higher speed of convergence, few parameters to set up and stronger global searching ability. Simulation result indicates that the proposed UFOA method can significantly improve the effective coverage rate of the sensor networks compared with some widely studied PSO and IPSO algorithms.

AB This paper presents an analysis of cycle times and throughput performances of Shuttle-Based Storage and Retrieval Systems (SBS/RSs), a relatively new technology that is becoming an important part of automated warehouses. A parametric simulation model was developed for the purposes of this research. The model enables calculation of Single Command (SC) and Dual Command (DC) cycle times and throughput performances of SBS/RS. The model was tested on a case study, which is based on a real type of SBS/RS. Experiments were designed to evaluate the following factors, such as number of bays n(x) and minimum warehouse volume Q. Our research uses Design of Experiment (DOE) analysis and helps to achieve the proper dimension of the SBS/RS, which gives us the best possible performance of the SBS/RS. The simulation based on the presented model delivers the best SBS/RS designs.

AB Jellyfish have become a topic of interest of many marine scientists and managers alike due to their conspicuous socio-economic and environmental impacts. However, our knowledge about their "everyday life" remains limited. While electronic tags (transmitters and loggers) have been extensively used to study marine vertebrates for the past 50 years, tagging is still in its infancy for marine invertebrates and jellyfish in particular. Progress has been hampered by the difficulty and limited knowledge of attaching tags to soft-bodied animals. We argue that there is huge potential to use tagging to gather basic information on the ecology and behaviour of these species. Here, we give an overview of what has been learned so far by deploying tags on jellyfish, and why tagging is an appropriate method to study their behaviour and ecology. We then describe different tagging techniques, their advantages, disadvantages and challenges, and the steps to ensure future successful jellyfish tagging studies.

AB Hydrocarbon pollution represents one of the most serious issues for the health of the extremely fragile marine ecosystem, and strategies for its monitoring have been growing in number and complexity in the last decades. Therefore, the realization of systems able to detect the presence of pollutants in the marine environment has become extremely complex, involving different figures and integrated technologies. This paper presents an innovative model for the real-time assessment of pollutants on the sea surface based on a network of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), which are able to sail the sea surface, equipped with sensors capable of detecting volatile organic compounds produced by hydrocarbons. In particular, within this context, an AUV equipped with an electronic nose-like system is proposed, with the sensors employed that were characterized both on the laboratory bench and at sea. The results obtained confirmed the feasibility of the approach proposed as well as good reliability of the data acquired, confirming the likely employment of this system within an integrated marine monitoring tool.

AB For advanced features of next generation vehicles, the real-time programs in automotive embedded systems are dramatically increasing. For such large volume program codes, this paper proposes a novel framework to use high-density and low-cost nonvolatile memory, i.e., NAND flash memory, as a low-cost means of storing and executing hard real-time programs. Regarding this, one challenge is that NAND flash memory allows only 2 KB page-based read operations not per-byte random accesses, which requires RAM as working storage for code executions. This paper proposes two solutions, i.e., partitioned RAM solution and shared RAM solution, that minimize the RAM size required to deterministically guarantee the deadlines of all the hard real-time tasks. The proposed solutions are verified with the actual real-time programs for unmanned autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that allows us to use NAND flash memory for hard real-time program executions with the minimal usage of RAM.

AB This work is concerned with time simulations of the response of flying flexible aircraft to initial conditions and external excitations, such as gusts. The simulations are based on a unified formulation of the problem of dynamics and control of maneuvering flexible aircraft developed recently by the authors. The formulation represents a seamless integration of pertinent material from the areas of analytical dynamics, structural dynamics, aerodynamics, and controls. It incorporates both the aircraft rigid-body motions and elastic deformations and it includes the aerodynamic, propulsion, gravity, and control forces, all in a rigorous manner. The formulation lends itself to efficient computer processing of the aircraft response. The formulation contains improvements over the earlier formulation by the authors in the form of a reduced-order structural model and newly designed, easier-to-implement controller and state observer. The corresponding time simulations are entirely new, and no similar results have been obtained by other investigators. The developments should help with the design of the new generation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and in particular with the design of autonomous UAVs controlled by autopilots.

TI Effects of metallic system components on marine electromagnetic loop
   data
SO GEOPHYSICAL PROSPECTING
LA English
DT Article
DE Electromagnetics; Modelling; Numerical study; Signal processing
AB Electromagnetic loop systems rely on the use of non-conductive materials near the sensor to minimize bias effects superimposed on measured data. For marine sensors, rigidity, compactness and ease of platform handling are essential. Thus, commonly a compromise between rigid, cost-effective and non-conductive materials (e.g. stainless steel versus fibreglass composites) needs to be found. For systems dedicated to controlled-source electromagnetic measurements, a spatial separation between critical system components and sensors may be feasible, whereas compact multi-sensor platforms, remotely operated vehicles and autonomous unmanned vehicles require the use of electrically conductive components near the sensor. While data analysis and geological interpretations benefit vastly from each added instrument and multidisciplinary approaches, this introduces a systematic and platform-immanent bias in the measured electromagnetic data. In this scope, we present two comparable case studies targeting loop-source electromagnetic applications in both time and frequency domains: the time-domain system trades the compact design for a clear separation of 15 m between an upper fibreglass frame, holding most critical titanium system components, and a lower frame with its coil and receivers. In case of the frequency-domain profiler, the compact and rigid design is achieved by a circular fibreglass platform, carrying the transmitting and receiving coils, as well as several titanium housings and instruments. In this study, we analyse and quantify the quasi-static influence of conductive objects on time- and frequency-domain coil systems by applying an analytically and experimentally verified 3D finite element model. Moreover, we present calibration and optimization procedures to minimize bias inherent in the measured data. The numerical experiments do not only show the significance of the bias on the inversion results, but also the efficiency of a system calibration against the analytically calculated response of a known environment. The remaining bias after calibration is a time/frequency-dependent function of seafloor conductivity, which doubles the commonly estimated noise floor from 1% to 2%, decreasing the sensitivity and resolution of the devices. By optimizing size and position of critical conductive system components (e.g. titanium housings) and/or modifying the transmitter/receiver geometry, we significantly reduce the effect of this residual bias on the inversion results as demonstrated by 3D modelling. These procedures motivate the opportunity to design dedicated, compact, low-bias platforms and provide a solution for autonomous and remotely steered designs by minimizing their effect on the sensitivity of the controlled-source electromagnetic sensor.

AB Surveillance in antisubmarine warfare has traditionally been carried out by means of submarines or frigates with towed arrays. These techniques are manpower intensive. Alternative approaches have recently been suggested using distributed stationary and mobile sensors, such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In contrast with the use of standard assets, these small, low-power, and mobile devices have limited processing and wireless communication capabilities. However, when deployed in a spatially separated network, these sensors can form an intelligent network achieving high performance with significant features of scalability, robustness, and reliability. The distributed information FUSION (DIFFUSION) strategy, in which the local information is shared among sensors, is one of the key aspects of this intelligent network. In this paper, we propose two DIFFUSION schemes, in which the information shared among sensors consists of: 1) contacts, generated by the local detection stage and 2) tracks, generated by the local tracking stage. In the first DIFFUSION scheme, contacts are combined at each nodes using the optimal Bayesian tracking based on the random finite set formulation. In the second DIFFUSION scheme, tracks are combined using the track-to-track association/fusion procedure, then a sequential decision based on the association events is exploited. A full validation of the DIFFUSION schemes is conducted by the NATO Science and Technology Organization-Center for maritime research and experimentation during the sea trials Exercise Proud Manta 2012-2013 using real data. Performance metrics of DIFFUSION and of local tracking/detection strategies are also evaluated in terms of time-on-target (ToT) and false alarm rate (FAR). We demonstrate the benefit of using DIFFUSION against the local noncooperative strategies. In particular DIFFUSION improves the level of TOT (FAR) with respect to the local tracking/detection strategies. In particular, the TOT is increased over 90%-95% while the FAR is reduced of two order of magnitude. The problem of communication failures, data not available from the collaborative AUV during certain periods of time, is also investigated. The robustness of DIFFUSION with respect to these communication failures is demonstrated, and the related performance results are reported here. In particular, with 75% of communication failures the ToT is over 90%-95% with a relatively small increase of the FAR with respect to the case of perfect communication.

AB Classifications of fish swimming are reviewed as a prelude to discussing functional design and performance in an ecological context. Webb (1984a, 1998) classified fishes based on body shape and locomotor mode into three basic categories: body and Caudal fin (BCF) periodic, BCF transient (fast-starts, turns) and median and paired fin (MPF) swimmers. Swimming performance and functional design is discussed for each of these categories. Webb hypothesized that specialization in any given category would limit performance in any other. For example, routine MPF swimmers should be penalized in BCF transient (fast-start propulsion). Recent Studies offer Much support for Webb's construct but also suggest some necessary amendments. In particular, design and performance compromises for different swimming modes are associated with fish that employ the same propulsor for more than one task (Coupled, e.g. the same propulsor for routine steady swimming and fast-starts). For example, pike (BCF transient specialist) achieve better acceleration performance than trout (generalist). Pike steady (BCF periodic) performance, however, is inferior to that Of trout. Fish that employ different propulsors for different tasks (decoupled, e.g. MPF propulsion for low-speed routine swimming and BCF motions for fast-starts) do not show Serious performance compromises. For example, certain MPF low-speed swimmers show comparable fast-start performance to BCF forms. Arguably, the evolution of decoupled locomotor systems was a major factor underlying the adaptive radiation of teleosts. Low-speed routine propulsion releases MPF swimmers from the morphological constraints imposed by streamlining allowing for a high degree of variability in form. This contrasts with BCF periodic swimming specialists where representatives of four vertebrate classes show evolutionary convergence on a single, optimal 'thunniform' design. However, recent experimental studies on the comparative performance of carangiform and thunniform swimmers contradict some of the predictions of hydromechanical models. This is addressed in regard to the swimming performance, energetics and muscle physiology of tuna. The concept of gait is reviewed in the context of coupled and decoupled locomotor systems. Biomimetic approaches to the development of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles have given a new context and impetus to research and this is discussed in relation to Current views of fish functional design and swimming performance. Suggestions are made for possible future research directions. (C) 2004 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

AB The open-world deployment of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles needs to address a variety of ML vulnerabilities such as interpretability, verifiability, and performance limitations. Research explores different approaches to improve ML dependability by proposing newmodels and training techniques to reduce generalization error, achieve domain adaptation, and detect outlier examples and adversarial attacks. However, there is a missing connection between ongoing ML research and well-established safety principles. In this article, we present a structured and comprehensive review of ML techniques to improve the dependability ofML algorithms in uncontrolled open-world settings. From this review, we propose the Taxonomy of ML Safety that maps state-of-the-art ML techniques to key engineering safety strategies. Our taxonomy of ML safety presents a safety-oriented categorization of ML techniques to provide guidance for improving dependability of the ML design and development. The proposed taxonomy can serve as a safety checklist to aid designers in improving coverage and diversity of safety strategies employed in any given ML system.

AB This paper presents a real-time driver characterisation algorithm that models the driver based on 10 parameters governing their control of vehicle longitudinal speed and acceleration. It utilises an open-loop longitudinal model in conjunction with an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The algorithm can operate in real-time using velocity and acceleration measurements, in addition to a-priori knowledge of the path curvature and road features such as speed limit locations. The UKF also enables a system identification process to estimate average response of each driver. These identified parameters are subsequently fitted to independent measures of fuel economy and safety to demonstrate possible uses for the characterisations. In addition to the comprehensive characterisation of the drivers' behaviour the work is also novel in its unique approach to identifying time-based parameters within a time-varying dynamic system (UKF). Possible applications include insurance black box assessments of driver aggressiveness and safety, and in autonomous driving algorithms by providing a model to closely replicate the specific driving styles of various users.

ID COLLISION-AVOIDANCE
AB With the emergence of a large number of smart devices, the radio environment in which unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) take tasks is becoming more and more complex, which puts forward higher requirements for UAVs' situational awareness and autonomous obstacle avoidance capabilities. To tackle this issue, we propose a three-dimension (3D) UAV path planning method under communication connectivity constraints guided by radio environment maps (REMs), which are distributed by ground edge servers in the form of compressed global REMs and detailed local REMs. An interfered fluid dynamic system (IFDS) model is deployed on UAVs to allow them to avoid obstacles and plan paths. We propose a twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient- (TD3-) based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to optimize the reaction coefficients of UAVs to avoid obstacles and improve the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR). The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively avoid static obstacles and dynamic interference under communication connectivity constraints, significantly improve the communication stability with a higher receive signal SINR and reduce the cost of UAV performing tasks with the shortest path.

AB This paper overviews emerging technology development by emphasizing Connected, Automated, Shared, and Electric (CASE) technologies. Existing literature on 15 CASE technologies is reviewed, and adds to the literature by consolidating important predictions of CASE-related technologies, services, and policies. Connected and automated technologies have not yet matured, and there remain many gaps in its abilities. Predictions include that shared mobility will have a large market share, electric technologies will replace internal combustion engines, and CASE-related services and policies will be used in more cities. A survey with 1,036 respondents conducted in April 2021 helps gauge how Americans make mode choices under various scenarios. Data analysis indicates that safety issues are the main factor that hinder people's willingness to use CASE-related technologies, and the low cost encourages more users to choose shared mobility. Challenges that remain, and their associated impacts, are important to consider.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

DT Article
AB An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) was deployed in Lake Biwa from 2000 to 2012. In December 2009, ebullition of turbid water was first found in the deepest area (>90 m) of the North Basin. Follow-up investigations in April and December 2010 and January 2012 confirmed the existence of benthic vents similar to the vents observed in other deep lakes. Importantly, vent numbers per unit travel distance in Lake Biwa dramatically increased from only two vents (0.37 vents km(-1)) in December 2009 to 54 vents (5.28 vents km(-1)) in January 2012, which could be related to recent tectonic activity in Japan, e.g., the M9.1 Tohoku earthquake in March 2011 and slow earthquakes along the Nankai Trough from 2006 to 2018. Continuous back-up investigations from 2014 to 2019 revealed additional benthic vents in the same area. The sudden increase in benthic vent activity (liquid and gaseous ebullitions) have significant potential to alter lake biogeochemistry and, ultimately, degrade Japan's major drinking water source and may be a harbinger of major crustal change in the near future.

AB The sixth generation (6G) networks are expected to provide a fully connected world with terrestrial wireless and satellite communications integration. The design concept of 6G networks is to leverage artificial intelligence (Ai) to promote the intelligent and agile development of network services. intelligent services inevitably involve the processing of large amounts of data, such as storage, computing, and analysis, such that the data may be vulnerable to tampering or contamination by attackers. in this article, we propose a blockchain-based data security scheme for Ai applications in 6G networks. Specifically, we first introduce the 6G architecture (i.e., a space-air-ground-underwater integrated network). Then we discuss two Ai-enabled applications, indoor positioning and autonomous vehicle, in the context of 6G. Through a case study of an indoor navigation system, we demonstrate the effectiveness of blockchain in data security. The integration of Ai and blockchain is developed to evaluate and optimize the quality of intelligent service. Finally, we discuss several open issues about data security in the upcoming 6G networks.

AB The next generation of connected and autonomous vehicles will be equipped with high numbers of antennas operating in a wide frequency range for communications and environment sensing. The study of 3D spatial angular responses and the radiation patterns modified by vehicular structure will allow for better integration of the associated communication and sensing antennas. The use of near-field monostatic focusing, applied with frequency-dimension scale translation and differential imaging, offers a novel imaging application. The objective of this paper is to theoretically and experimentally study the method of obtaining currents produced by an antenna radiating on top of a vehicular platform using differential imaging. The experimental part of the study focuses on measuring a scaled target using an imaging system operating in a terahertz band-from 220 to 330 GHz-that matches a 5G frequency band according to frequency-dimension scale translation. The results show that the induced currents are properly estimated using this methodology, and that the influence of the bandwidth is assessed.

AB This paper focuses on the design of modular Robotic Mobile Fulfillment Systems. A Robotic Mobile Fulfillment System is an automated storage and retrieval system, in which mobile robots are deployed to deliver storage shelves for picking operation. This paper proposes a modular robotic system with aisle-captive robots for small and medium-sized logistics warehouses. Then analytical models, including a bottleneck-based model and an open queueing network model, are developed to estimate system throughput and average order flow time. Last, a two-stage design framework is proposed to rapidly identify an optimal system configuration. The main contributions are that: first, the proposed modular robotic system is free of traffic congestion and blocking; second, the comprehensive framework highlights some significant guidelines for warehouse developers during the "conceptualization" phase of system development. Simulation experiments indicate that the open queueing network model can provide accurate system performance estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed design framework is validated through practical application in real cases.

AB We review the history of human-automation interaction research, assess its current status and identify future directions. We start by reviewing articles that were published on this topic in the International Journal of Human-Computer Studies during the last 50 years. We find that over the years, automated systems have been used more frequently (1) in time-sensitive or safety-critical settings, (2) in embodied and situated systems, and (3) by non-professional users. Looking to the future, there is a need for human-automation interaction research to focus on (1) issues of function and task allocation between humans and machines, (2) issues of trust, incorrect use, and confusion, (3) the balance between focus, divided attention and attention management, (4) the need for interdisciplinary approaches to cover breadth and depth, (5) regulation and explainability, (6) ethical and social dilemmas, (7) allowing a human and humane experience, and (8) radically different human-automation interaction.

TI Visual IoT: Enabling Internet of Things Visualization in Smart Cities

DT Article
AB With advanced IoT, visualization has become an integral part of smart city services in our daily life ranging from building management, property maintenance, autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and shopping to tourism. In visual IoT, visualized sensors like cameras are a key component to smart cities. However, requirements of large bandwidth for visual data and the gap between computation and communication challenge the development of visual IoT. This article presents a systemic analysis for the requirements of visual IoT from the perspective of smart cities. Moreover, this study proposes a novel visual IoT architecture to improve end-to-end performance of next generation smart cities, namely A-VIoT. The proposed system includes six key components: intelligent awareness to sense complex environments, smart video analysis for reducing the amount of visual data, software defined video to generate elastic visual streams, flexible controls to produce optimal adaptation, economic transmission to enhance utilization of resource, and crowd coordination to improve the performance of cooperation. Finally, several open issues are identified to provide directions for further research, particularly in smart city applications.

ID UNDERWATER
AB A new algorithm called the Mondrian detector has been developed for object detection in high-frequency synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) imagery. If a second (low) frequencyband image is available, the algorithm can seamlessly exploit the additional information via an auxiliary prescreener test. This flexible single-band and multiband functionality fills an important capability gap. The algorithm's overall prescreener component limits the number of potential alarms. The main module of the method then searches for areas that pass a subset of pixel-intensity tests. A new set of reliable classification features has also been developed in the process. The overall framework has been kept uncomplicated intentionally in order to facilitate performance estimation, to avoid requiring dedicated training data, and to permit delayed real-time detection at sea on an autonomous underwater vehicle. The promise of the new algorithm is demonstrated on six substantial data sets of real SAS imagery collected at various geographical sites that collectively exhibit a wide range of diverse seafloor characteristics. The results show that-as with Mondrian's art-simplicity can be powerful.

AB We conducted four dives using the Urashima autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) over three hydrothermal vent fields (Snail, Archean, and Pika) within the South Mariana Trough in July 2009, and measured the echo intensity (EI) with an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) mounted on the AUV. The ADCP data produced 3D structures of the EI over the vents, which clearly showed higher EI anomalies over the Pika and Archean vents. The characteristics of the higher EI anomalies were carefully examined and described in terms of their relationships with turbidity that was simultaneously observed with a single point turbidity sensor. It is plausible that the higher EI anomaly indicates the thickness of the plumes at some locations (i.e., 230 m thickness at the Pika site, 140 m at the Archean, and 160 m at the Snail) where both the turbidity and EI have a signal. The results also explain the long-term southwestward advection of the higher anomaly water by the local mean current.

AB We address the problem of detecting vehicle targets on the ground by means of an autonomous polarimetric sensor on board a high-altitude air- or spaceborne platform. We studied a sensor system that incorporates a micropolarizer array, a microscanner, and digital signal processors that host algorithms for detecting small targets. These algorithms use statistical techniques to fuse a target's Stokes-vector infrared signature measurements. Fusion is achieved by constructing the joint statistical measures for the target's polarization states. Those states are expressed in terms of the intensity, the percentage of linear polarization, and the angle of the polarization plane. The performance of the sensor system on synthetic polarimetric infrared imagery was evaluated. Relatively good detection and low false-alarm probabilities were achieved even when the number of pixels on targets is as small as four. This is the first report of the development and evaluation of automatic detection in polarimetric imagery containing targets subtencling only a small number of pixels.

AB Progress in the design, construction and packaging of small portable mass spectrometers for operation on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is described. Our first deployable version consists of a membrane introduction interface coupled with a linear quadrupole mass filter for in situ detection and quantification of dissolved gases and volatile organic compounds. We present laboratory results which demonstrate that sub-parts-per-billion detection limits have been achieved for toluene. The mass-spectrometer system is compatible with AUV constraints and operates on 24 V dc, consuming of the order of 100 W of power. Technical challenges of performing underwater mass spectrometry are addressed, in particular sample introduction from the water column and the maintenance of a vacuum system. Initial operation will be in shallow water of 30 m depth or less. Alternative versions of interfaces and mass spectrometers are also discussed. We anticipate that providing the capability of performing in situ underwater mass-spectrometric analysis will have a significant impact in the areas of marine science and environmental monitoring.

AB Model predictive control (MPC) is a common approach to the control of trajectory-following systems. For nonlinear plants such as car-like robots, methods for path planning and following have the advantage of concurrently solving problems of obstacle avoidance, feasible trajectory selection, and trajectory following. A prediction function for the plant is used to simulate the trajectory with a candidate stream of inputs. Constraints on control inputs and state values, used to ensure safe trajectories and to avoid obstacles, are encoded into a cost function, and optimization routines (at runtime) compute the trajectories and their corresponding control inputs. Such approaches are computationally intensive, and in the nonlinear case the computational burden generally grows as a predictive model more closely approximates a nonlinear plant. In situations where system safety is paramount, guaranteeing model accuracy (in order to achieve more accurate behavior) comes at the cost of increased computation time, which results in increased travel time without a new solution. While the computational burden of predictive methods can be addressed through model reduction, the cost of modeling error over the prediction horizon is high and can lead to unfeasible results. In this paper, we consider the problem of controlling a ground vehicle under constraints and propose an algorithm that employs two models of the vehicle for model predictive control, one coarse and the other more accurate. We introduce a metric called uncontrollable divergence and, using this metric, propose a mechanism to select the model to use in the predictive controller. The novel property of the metric is that it reveals the divergence between predicted and true states caused by return time and model mismatch. More precisely, a map of uncontrollable divergence plotted over the state space gives the criterion to judge where coarse models can be tolerated when a high update rate is preferred (e.g., at high speed and small steering angles), and where high-fidelity models are required to avoid obstacles or make tighter curves (e.g., at large steering angles). With this metric, we design a controller that switches at runtime between predictive controllers in which respective models are deployed. The algorithm is a hybrid controller, which evaluates the proposed metric to select the discrete vehicle model to use for prediction and optimization. We say that the approach is computationally aware, in that the optimization time of each predictive model is dependent on the computation substrate used (chipset, machine architecture, etc.); if a different computational platform is used, then the uncontrollable divergence calculations will lead to a hybrid controller suitable to meet the computation demands for that platform. While the ideas are presented for the solution of a vehicle control problem, the approach has the potential to impact other computationally-demanding cyber-physical systems. The paper extends (Zhang et al., Proceedings of the international conference on cyber-physical system, Seattle, 2015) in a significant way, by demonstrating the calculation of uncontrollable divergence on a physical platform, by characterizing MPC return time as a function of the number of obstacles, and by simulating performance with trajectories that must navigate more obstacles.

AB While many countries and international organizations with maritime security interests and rights at sea have developed new security strategies or policies in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States of America, they have accordingly changed or created new maritime security strategies or doctrines with appropriate Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) models as well. Maritime deterioration, climate change, cyberattacks, serious and organized crime, epidemics, and state-made threats are just some of the new and growing concerns affecting maritime security. The sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea has given maritime security doctrines and frameworks a new dimension. In this article, the current maritime security approaches and maritime domain or situational awareness (MDA/MSA) model examples of some countries and international organizations from different geographic regions and also the ones that are located in the maritime choke point regions where global maritime trade routes are located and also the effects of the Nord Stream Pipelines sabotages on these are examined in light of the new threats and risks. The principle result reached in this study is that countries and international structures should have a cross governmental maritime security strategy, or at least a doctrine, in order to guide their own maritime situational awareness models and identify information sharing architectures. The most important result of the sabotages on Nord Stream Pipelines for MSA models in this study is that the fastest and most cost-effective method for protecting critical infrastructure under the seas is the concept of systems such as Mothership controlled autonomous and unmanned underwater vehicles, extra large unmanned undersea vehicles and Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) satellites.

AB As the number of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) and the market size have been expanding rapidly in recent years, projects such as NextGen and SESAR aim to include UAVs in air traffic. Therefore, different perspectives on understanding flight patterns can contribute to more effective management of future air traffic. Analysis of flight data offers an important insight into the operations of a UAV. In this study, it is aimed to extract a flight fingerprint using different machine learning techniques by means of a public dataset and the data obtained from our experimental flights. To get the individual flight pattern, multidimensional UAV sensor data has been reduced using manifold learning methods. By comparison, the most proper manifold method that allows highest classification accuracy (CA) has been investigated. Their performances are compared using both different manifold types and different classification methods. Then, the obtained manifold is used as flight fingerprints and validated by classification techniques. Various unsupervised manifold learning techniques such as t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), Isometric Feature Mapping (ISOMAP) were tried for dimension reduction. For flight fingerprint classification, supervised machine learning techniques such as k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Adaboost, Neural Network, Bayes, etc., were tested. It has been observed that the highest classification accuracy is achieved with the t-SNE manifold and k-NN classification pair. The extracted fingerprint can find many application areas such as performance tests in production lines, air traffic control, risk analysis, anomaly detection, observing pilot performance, drone efficiency over time.

AB The underwater glider (UG) is a new type of long-endurance marine vehicle that is currently widely used in marine environment surveillance. However, the limited capability of underwater communication and the uncertainty of the marine environment leads to a large deviation between the dead-reckoned trajectory and the real trajectory of UG. Therefore, a localization and navigation method based on ocean current data is proposed in this study. Firstly, the working principle and configuration of UG are illustrated, and the dynamic model is also analyzed. Then, the depth-averaged current is derived with motion parameters of UG, and the ocean current data from the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model is also introduced and processed. Meanwhile, to make an accurate localization, the DAC is stratified according to the layer weight extracted from the processed ocean current model to obtain layered DAC (LDAC). Subsequently, because the sample intervals of sensors are asynchronous with LDAC, a new matching algorithm based on sample time difference is presented to match the information of sensors and LDAC. Furthermore, the matched data is applied to localization for accurate dead reckoning. Finally, based on the data collected from two experiments, the LDAC-aided localization method proposed in this paper is compared with other benchmark positioning methods, including dynamic model-aided localization, sea current-aided localization, and acoustic beacon-aided localization methods. The results indicate that the proposed new method achieves better localization performance than other benchmark methods. In addition, the proposed method could be applied to other autonomous vehicles with communication constraints.

AB The online estimation of battery state-of-health (SOH) is an ever significant issue for the intelligent energy management of the autonomous electric vehicles. Machine-learning based approaches are promising for the online SOH estimation. This paper proposes a machine-learning based algorithm for the online SOH estimation of Li-ion battery. A predictive diagnosis model used in the algorithm is established based on support vector machine (SVM). The support vectors, which reflects the intrinsic characteristics of the Li-ion battery, are determined from the charging data of fresh cells. Furthermore, the coefficients of the SVMs for cells at different SOH are identified once the support vectors are determined. The algorithm functions by comparing partial charging curves with the stored SVMs. Similarity factor is defined after comparison to quantify the SOH of the data under evaluation. The operation of the algorithm only requires partial charging curves, e.g., 15 min charging curves, making fast on-board diagnosis of battery SOH into reality. The partial charging curves can be intercepted from a wide range of voltage section, thereby relieving the pain that there is little chance that the driver charges the battery pack from a predefined state-of-charge. Train, validation, and test are conducted for two commercial Li-ion batteries with Li(NiCoMn)(1/3) O-2 cathode and graphite anode, indicating that the algorithm can estimate the battery SOH with less than 2% error for 80% of all the cases, and less than 3% error for 95% of all the cases.

ID TCP; VEHICLES
AB As the capacity and reliability of mobile networks increases, so does the demand for more responsive end-to-end services: applications such as augmented reality, live video conferencing, and smart or autonomous vehicles require reliable, throughput-intensive end-to-end communications with strict delay constraints. Only consistently reliable delivery of data flows well within human interactivity deadlines will enable a truly immersive user experience. To enable data delivery within pre-defined deadlines, controlled on demand by an application or its user, we propose and demonstrate a novel transport-layer protocol for explicit latency control called latency-controlled end-to-end aggregation protocol (LEAP). The LEAP splits a data flow with quality of service (QoS) constraints into multiple subflows that are delivered over multiple parallel links (e.g., Wi-Fi and LTE in a standard smartphone, WiGig, and 5G in the near future). The subflow data rates are set based on a novel proactive forecasting of the achievable channel capacity, subject to application-specific QoS constraints. Cross-path encoding and redundancy adaptation are then used to deliberately balance the trade-off between maximum throughput, required delay, and minimum reliability as function of application/user-specific input parameters. When compared to leading state-of-the-art transport protocols in live network experiments, LEAP exhibits a superior capacity to reliably provide a high and stable throughput with bounded latency, both in wired and wireless scenarios. The LEAP is also the first protocol to allow applications to explicitly set their priorities, giving them the freedom to set the operating point in the trade-off between throughput, latency, and reliability.

AB Drone/UAV systems are used for the solution of different problems that exist in different fields, in a way that pushes the limits of the human imagination. The services provided by UAV systems are used in the process of many sectors and in daily life. Security is one of the areas UAV systems are used, in line with the historical origin of the system. Undoubtedly, as in every technological innovation, in parallel with the increase in the use of UAV systems for the benefit of humanity, there is also an increase and diversification in illegal activities. Due to the fact that UAV systems offer cheaper, risk-free and cost-effective solutions, there is a global increase in the frequency and diversity of the use of them by terrorist organizations. It would not be an exaggeration that the airspaces, which have been under the sovereignty of states until today and where terrorist organizations did not exist much, are now used by them. Despite the complex and expensive detection, identification, warning and prevention systems that states continue to develop to prevent air threats, the fact that terrorist organizations can carry out attacks with simple and inexpensive UAV systems confirms this determination. Based on the assumption that an UAV-based method can be developed for the solution of the identified problem, in this study an autonomous system has been tried to be developed that can perform control, surveillance and safety flight in a certain airspace, detect intruder systems during flight and lock on them with its software.

AB The multi-hop unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network can serve as data relays where ground users (GUs) do not have reliable direct connections to the base station (BS). Existing works mainly focus on simple dual-hop system. In this paper, we investigate the packet routing problem in a multi-hop UAV relay network to minimize the data transmission time and enhance the network throughput. However, the dynamic network topology due to UAV mobility makes the packet routing challenging since the limited communication range of each UAV leads to volatile wireless connection. Moreover, the line-of-sight communication links may cause strong interference among UAVs. Towards this end, we propose a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning based algorithm, named as multi-agent QMIX (MAQMIX) to: 1) design proper UAVs' trajectories to serve the moving GUs while maintaining the network connection; 2) allocate frequency resource properly among UAVs to alleviate the impact of interference; and 3) choose a proper next hop UAV for each data packet to reduce the transmission time and probability of network congestion. The proposed MAQMIX has two novel training mechanisms, i.e., intra-UAV and inter-UAV training mechanisms, which can tackle the large action space issue and coordinate the training among UAVs in the multi-hop UAV relay network. Simulation results demonstrate that the MAQMIX outperforms baseline schemes in terms of the network congestion avoidance, throughput, and transmission time.

ID CONTACT; ALGORITHM; MOBILITY; MODEL
AB Mecanum wheels (MWs) are valuable components to automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) for their versatile motion capabilities. Such characteristics are associated with the series of rubber-covered rollers obliquely attached around the circumference of the wheel rim. The rollers take turns in contact with the ground while MW is rotating. Even though MWs were designed and appear perfectly circular, vehicles equipped with MWs often exhibit periodic bouncing motion. Such a phenomenon hinders the application of MW in factories, such as panel manufacturing. This article sought the cause of the non-uniform contact stiffness associated with MWs and attempted to improve its design to mitigate the vibration problem. A hard-kill topology optimization scheme was proposed where interfacial elements between the steel core and the rubber layer can switch the material property to steer the contact stiffness toward the desired value. Nonlinear finite element analyses on the detailed 3D geometry of the roller system involving neo-Hookean material and contact simulation were performed for accurate numerical estimation in the optimization process. Due to elastic deformation, dual contacts occur at the transition of adjacent rollers; as a result, the total contact stiffness increases significantly compared to the other regions. The proposed optimization scheme successfully reached a design of uniform contact stiffness for the entire circumference of MW, including transition zones between adjacent rollers. Prototypes of the optimized MW were fabricated. Experiments on the vibration of an AGV with the old and the new MWs were conducted. The new MWs effectively reduced vibration amplitudes by approximately 30%.

AB Intelligent mobile sensors, such as uninhabited aerial or underwater vehicles, are becoming prevalent in environmental sensing and monitoring applications. These active sensing platforms operate in unsteady fluid flows, including windy urban environments, hurricanes and ocean currents. Often constrained in their actuation capabilities, the dynamics of these mobile sensors depend strongly on the background flow, making their deployment and control particularly challenging. Therefore, efficient trajectory planning with partial knowledge about the background flow is essential for teams of mobile sensors to adaptively sense and monitor their environments. In this work, we investigate the use of finite-horizon model predictive control (MPC) for the energy-efficient trajectory planning of an active mobile sensor in an unsteady fluid flow field. We uncover connections between trajectories optimized over a finite-time horizon and finite-time Lyapunov exponents of the background flow, confirming that energy-efficient trajectories exploit invariant coherent structures in the flow. We demonstrate our findings on the unsteady double gyre vector field, which is a canonical model for chaotic mixing in the ocean. We present an exhaustive search through critical MPC parameters including the prediction horizon, maximum sensor actuation, and relative penalty on the accumulated state error and actuation effort. We find that even relatively short prediction horizons can often yield energy-efficient trajectories. We also explore these connections on a three-dimensional flow and ocean flow data from the Gulf of Mexico. These results are promising for the adaptive planning of energy-efficient trajectories for swarms of mobile sensors in distributed sensing and monitoring.

AB 5G-Vehicle-to-Everything (5G-V2X) supports high-reliability and low latency autonomous services and applications. Proposing an efficient security solution that supports multi-zone broadcast authentication and satisfies the 5G requirement is a critical challenge. In The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 16 standard, for Cellular- Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) single-cell communication is suggested to reuse the IEEE1609.2 security standard that utilizes the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) cryptography. PKI-based solutions provide a high-security level, however, it suffers from high communication and computation overhead, due to the large size of the attached certificate and signature. In this study, we propose a light-weight Multi-Zone Authentication and Privacy-Preserving Protocol (MAPP) based on the bilinear pairing cryptography and short-size signature. MAPP protocol provides three different authentication methods that enable a secure broadcast authentication over multiple zones of large-scale base stations, using a single message and a single short signature. We also propose a centralized dynamic key generation method for multiple zones. We implemented and analyzed the proposed key generation and authentication methods using an authentication simulator and a bilinear pairing library. The proposed methods significantly reduce the signature generation time by 16 times-80 times, as compared to the previous methods. Additionally, the proposed methods significantly reduced the signature verification time by 10 times-16 times, as compared to the two previous methods. The three proposed authentication methods achieved substantial speed-up in the signature generation time and verification time, using a short bilinear pairing signature.

AB Before the introduction of positioning technologies in agriculture practices such as global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), data collection and management were time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks. Today, due to the introduction of advanced technologies, precise information on the performance of agricultural machines, and smaller autonomous vehicles such as robot mowers, can be collected in a relatively short time. The aim of this work was to track the performance of a robot mower in various turfgrass areas of an equal number of square meters but with four different shapes by using real-time kinematic (RTK)-GNSS devices, and to easily extract data by a custom built software capable of calculating the distance travelled by the robot mower, the forward speed, the cutting area, and the number of intersections of the trajectories. These data were then analyzed in order to provide useful functioning information for manufacturers, entrepreneurs, and practitioners. The path planning of the robot mower was random and the turfgrass area for each of the four shapes was 135 m(2) without obstacles. The distance travelled by the robot mower, the mean forward speed, and the intersections of the trajectories were affected by the interaction between the time of cutting and the shape of the turfgrass. For all the different shapes, the whole turfgrass area was completely cut after two hours of mowing. The cutting efficiency decreased by increasing the time, as a consequence of the increase in overlaps. After 75 minutes of cutting, the efficiency was about 35% in all the turfgrass areas shapes, thus indicating a high level of overlapping.

AB We provide an extensive high-resolution geophysical, sediment core, and radiocarbon dataset to address late Pleistocene and Holocene fault activity of the San Gregorio fault zone (SGFZ), offshore central California. The SGFZ occurs primarily offshore in the San Andreas fault system and has been accommodating dextral strike-slip motion between the Pacific and North American plates since the mid-Miocene. Our study focuses on the SGFZ where it has been mapped through the continental slope north of Monterey Canyon. From 2009 to 2015, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute collected high-resolution multibeam bathymetry and chirp sub-bottom profiles using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Targeted samples were collected using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to provide radiocarbon age constraints. We integrate the high-resolution geophysical data with radiocarbon dates to reveal Pleistocene seismic horizons vertically offset less than 5 m on nearly vertical faults. These faults are buried by continuous reflections deposited after similar to 17.5 ka and likely following erosion during the last sea-level lowstand similar to 21 ka, bracketing the age of faulting to similar to 32-21 ka. Clearly faulted horizons are only detected in a small area where mass wasting exhumed older strata to within similar to 25 m of the seafloor. The lack of clearly faulted Holocene deposits and possible highly distributed faulting in the study area are consistent with previous interpretations that late Pleistocene and Holocene activity along the SGFZ may decrease to the south. This study illustrates the complexity of the SGFZ, offshore central California, and demonstrates the utility of very high-resolution data from combined AUV (geophysical)-ROV (seabed sampling) surveys in offshore studies of fault activity.

AB Background
   There is growing interest in mining polymetallic nodules from the abyssal ClarionClipperton Zone (CCZ) in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Despite being the focus of environmental studies for decades, the benthic megafauna of the CCZ remain poorly known. In order to predict and manage the environmental impacts of mining in the CCZ, baseline knowledge of the megafauna is essential. The ABYSSLINE Project has conducted benthic biological baseline surveys in the UK Seabed Resources Ltd polymetallic-nodule exploration contract area (UK-1). Prior to these research cruises in 2013 and 2015, no biological studies had been done in this area of the eastern CCZ.
   New information
   Using a Remotely Operated Vehicle and Autonomous Underwater Vehicle, the megafauna within the UKSRL exploration contract area (UK-1) and at a site similar to 250 km east of the UK-1 area were surveyed, allowing us to make the first estimates of megafaunal morphospecies richness from the imagery collected. Here, we present an atlas of the abyssal echinoderm megafauna observed and collected during the ABYSSLINE cruises to the UK-1 polymetallic-nodule exploration contract area in the CCZ. There appear to be at least 62 distinct morphospecies (13 Asteroidea, 5 Crinoidea, 9 Echinoidea, 29 Holothuroidea and 6 Ophiuroidea) identified mostly by imagery but also using molecular barcoding for a limited number of animals that were collected. This atlas will aid the synthesis of megafaunal presence/absence data collected by contractors, scientists and other stakeholders undertaking work in the CCZ, ultimately helping to decipher the biogeography of the megafauna in this threatened habitat.

AB The observed changes in physical properties of sea ice such as decreased thickness and increased melt pond cover severely impact the energy budget of Arctic sea ice. Increased light transmission leads to increased deposition of solar energy in the upper ocean and thus plays a crucial role for amount and timing of sea-ice-melt and under-ice primary production. Recent developments in underwater technology provide new opportunities to study light transmission below the largely inaccessible underside of sea ice. We measured spectral under-ice radiance and irradiance using the new Nereid Under-Ice (NUI) underwater robotic vehicle, during a cruise of the R/V Polarstern to 83 degrees N 6 degrees W in the Arctic Ocean in July 2014. NUI is a next generation hybrid remotely operated vehicle (H-ROV) designed for both remotely piloted and autonomous surveys underneath land-fast and moving sea ice. Here we present results from one of the first comprehensive scientific dives of NUI employing its interdisciplinary sensor suite. We combine under-ice optical measurements with three dimensional under-ice topography (multibeam sonar) and aerial images of the surface conditions. We investigate the influence of spatially varying ice-thickness and surface properties on the spatial variability of light transmittance during summer. Our results show that surface properties such as melt ponds dominate the spatial distribution of the under-ice light field on small scales (<1000 m(2)), while sea ice-thickness is the most important predictor for light transmission on larger scales. In addition, we propose the use of an algorithm to obtain histograms of light transmission from distributions of sea ice thickness and surface albedo.

AB Tropical deforestation continues to be a major driver of biodiversity loss and greenhouse gas emissions. Remote sensing technology is increasingly used to assess changes in forest cover, species distributions and carbon stocks. However, satellite and airborne sensors can be prohibitively costly and inaccessible for researchers in developing countries. Here, we describe the development and use of an inexpensive (<$2,000) unmanned aerial vehicle for surveying and mapping forests and biodiversity (referred to as 'Conservation Drone' hereafter). Our prototype drone is able to fly pre-programmed missions autonomously for a total flight time of similar to 25 minutes and over a distance of similar to 15 km. Non-technical operators can program each mission by defining waypoints along a flight path using an open-source software. This drone can record videos at up to 1080 pixel resolution (high definition), and acquire aerial photographs of <10 cm pixel resolution. Aerial photographs can be stitched together to produce real-time geo-referenced land use/cover maps of surveyed areas. We evaluate the performance of this prototype Conservation Drone based on a series of test flights in Aras Napal, Sumatra, Indonesia. We discuss the further development of Conservation Drone 2.0, which will have a bigger payload and longer range. Initial tests suggest a flight time of similar to 50 minutes and a range of similar to 25 km. Finally, we highlight the potential of this system for environmental and conservation applications, which include near real-time mapping of local land cover, monitoring of illegal forest activities, and surveying of large animal species.

AB As a way of providing users flexible computing services, networks exist that can make full use of air and ground computing resources. Such networks are called air-ground collaborative mobile edge computing (AGC-MEC) networks. AGC-MEC supports numerous emerging real-time applications for which timely computed results are critical. Researchers have developed a novel metric "age of information (AoI)" that can capture the freshness of computed results. This is the first paper to study the problem of AoI-aware scheduling for Air-ground Collaborative mobile Edge computing (i.e., IACE). So as to minimize the weighted AoI of all the terrestrial user equipments (UEs), we have jointly optimized task scheduling, computing resource allocation, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory taking into account the constraints on the computing resources and the available energy of the UAV. The formulated problem, which is a challenge to solve, is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To obtain an effective solution, we propose an iterative algorithm based on the alternating optimization approach, which entails dividing the considered problem into three subproblems. Extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithm can achieve lower weighted AoI than five benchmark algorithms, while satisfying the resource constraints. Furthermore, simulation results demonstrate two interesting insights. First, the introduction of an aerial MEC server facilitates a flexible offloading design of the UEs which is critical to guaranteeing the freshness of computed results. Second, by optimizing the scheduling, the proposed design can unlock performance gains, especially in the resource-limited regime.

AB In wireless sensor networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be employed to collect data from sensor nodes (SNs) efficiently. In this article, we consider a dual-UAV-enabled (long-distance) data collection system, where one UAV is dispatched to collect data from distributed SNs, while the other UAV is employed to relay data from the data-collection UAV to a fusion center (FC) that locates far from the SNs. To shorten the time duration for the FC to collect all data, we propose to minimize the completion time of the data collection task by jointly optimizing the transmit power and bandwidth of all SNs and the UAVs, as well as the three-dimensional trajectories of the two UAVs. Instead of assuming the simplified line-of-sight UAV-ground channel model as in most existing works, we model the channels between the UAVs and SNs as well as that between the UAVs and FC by applying the practically more accurate elevation-angle-dependent Rician fading channel model. The resulting optimization problem is nonconvex and thus is difficult to solve in general. Nevertheless, we propose an algorithm to solve it efficiently by using the techniques of block coordinate descent, slack variable substitution, and successive convex approximation. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve higher communication efficiency than other benchmark schemes and greatly reduce the task completion time for data collection.

AB The importance of road safety is felt nowadays more than ever, where various technologies, including self-driving cars, have become abundant. Nowadays, it has more demand to build autonomous and electrical vehicles with information retrieval systems within the received sensory data not only from the local sensors but also the online and live streaming data over networks. To increase road safety dissemination of critical information, including the possibility of an obstacle or danger being in the middle of the road, automotive navigation and control systems are required. A novel method is proposed to make this critical communication possible over a specially designed vehicular ad-hoc network, where natural or urban barriers can prevent signal propagation. The network is implemented using the LoRaWAN interface and SX127x LoRa Radio module. The SX1272MB2xAS is fitted with the SX1272 transceiver, which added to a high-performance FSK/OOK RF transceiver modem. Additionally, LoRa long-range modem provides highly power-efficient communication. For this aim, two new mechanisms have been proposed. The first mechanism enables the nodes to receive data from a suggested communication link. While the second mechanism is designed to extract vital information such as establishing the connection, closing the connection, successful data transmission, errors, etc. The findings demonstrate that the proposed mechanisms have successfully enabled LoRaWAN to operate in IoV environment. The evaluation reveals that metrics such as battery consumption and covering range outperform similar technologies. Finally, this paper proposes a message-passing strategy based on Belief Propagation (BP) which provides more accurate marginal probabilities to overcome the low data rate as a foundation for our future work.

AB This paper presents an efficient control allocation (CA) strategy which significantly improves the flight performance of a planar hexacopter. This allocation maps the desired control vector composed of the thrust and torques in roll, pitch, and yaw axis, respectively, to propellers' speed. This paper shows that a CA strategy based on the classical approach of pseudo-inverse matrix only exploits a limited range of the vehicle capabilities to generate thrust and moments. A novel approach is presented, which is based on a weighted pseudo-inverse matrix method, called WCA, capable of exploiting a much larger domain in the control vector. The three weights involved in WCA are adapted online according to nonlinear laws which are analytically derived by solving symbolically the equivalent constraint least-squares problem, thus removing the need for online-optimization calculations. This solution allows for very fast real-time operations, suitable for autopilots with limited computing resources. This paper provides 1) a detailed analysis of the limitations of the classical control allocation scheme, 2) the mathematical development of the WCA algorithm, 3) simulations and real experiments which show that this WCA strategy outperforms the classical CA approach in terms of a) capability to generate the maximum roll and pitch torques possible, without generating undesired yaw torques, b) prioritizing the generation of thrust over attitude torques, thus achieving better altitude tracking despite aggressive maneuvers or the presence of a payload, and c) better behavior in case of actuator saturation, faults or even failures.

AB Power line collisions pose a significant threat to the safety of drones. This is because it is difficult for drone pilots to recognize power lines at long distances, even on sunny days, and power lines are less visible in rainy or foggy weather. Therefore, power line detection is necessary for safe drone flight. This article proposes an algorithm that can recognize various shapes and locations of multiple power lines while improving the recognition performance of power lines compared to previous studies. YOLO, a deep learning technology used for object detection, is used to recognize power lines as multiple bounding boxes, and center points of these bounding boxes are sorted and integrated. This algorithm improves the power line detection performance by excluding incorrectly detected power lines and restoring undetected parts of the power lines. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using the intersection-over-union (IoU) and F1-score, which were 0.674 and 0.528, respectively. This performance was superior to those of U-Net, LaneNet and BiSeNet V2 which are deep learning technologies for segmentation. The proposed method was mounted on the embedded system of the test drone, and tests were conducted indoor and outdoor. Then, the average frames per second (FPS) value was calculated as 10.05. Various shapes and locations of multiple power lines can be recognized in real-time using the power line recognition method proposed in this paper.

AB The development of automatic underwater vehicles (AUVs) has brought about unprecedented profits and opportunities. In order to discover the hidden valuable data detected by an AUV swarm, it is necessary to aggregate the data detected by AUV swarm to generate a powerful machine learning model. Traditional centralized machine learning generates a large number of data exchanges and faces problems of enormous training data, large-scale models, and communication. In underwater environments, radio waves are strongly absorbed, and acoustic communication is the only feasible technology. Unlike electromagnetic wave communication on land, the bandwidth of underwater acoustic communication is extremely limited, with the transmission rate being only 1 /10(5) of the electromagnetic wave. Therefore, traditional centralized machine learning cannot support underwater AUV swarm training. In recent years, federated learning could only interact with model parameters without interacting with data, which greatly reduced communication costs. Therefore, this paper introduces federated learning into the collaboration of an AUV swarm. In order to further reduce the constraints of underwater scarce communication resources on federated learning and alleviate the straggler effect, in this work, we designed an asynchronous federated learning method. Finally, we constructed the optimization problem of minimizing the weighted sum of delay and energy consumption, relying on jointly optimizing the AUV CPU frequency and signal transmission power. In order to solve this complex optimization problem of high-dimensional non-convex time series accumulation, we transformed the problem into a Markov decision process (MDP) and use the proximal policy optimization 2 (PPO2) algorithm to solve this problem. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

AB Nowadays, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) are used in environmental studies, ocean floor mapping, and measuring water properties. Navigation of these vehicles is one of the most challenging issues due to the unavailability of global positioning system (GPS) signal underwater. Inertial navigation is a method commonly used for underwater navigation. If a low-cost Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is used, navigation quality will decline rapidly due to sensor inherent error. Although using a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) speedometer sensor helps limit this error to some extent, it does not yield acceptable accuracy in low-cost IMUs. Filtering the gyro based on the AUV rotational dynamics model can improve the quality of angular velocity measurements and increase the Inertial Navigation System (INS)-DVL navigation accuracy. The presence of uncertainty in the rotational model parameters reduces the navigation algorithm's performance. In this paper, at first, a simplified rotational model of AUV is presented, and its parameters are identified utilizing data acquired in real experiments. Then a robust Kalman filter for gyro output is proposed to enhance the navigation algorithm performance in the presence of model parameter uncertainty. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, non-robust and robust filtered gyro outputs are used in the INS-DVL algorithm, and the results are compared with each other. Two types of the robust Kalman filter, stationary and finite horizon, are invoked. According to the field tests, navigation error decreases by 50% using the stationary robust Kalman filter compared to the non-robust Kalman filter.

AB This work addresses the task of electric vehicle (EV) charging inlet detection for autonomous EV charging robots. Recently, automated EV charging systems have received huge attention to improve users' experience and to efficiently utilize charging infrastructures and parking lots. However, most related works have focused on system design, robot control, planning, and manipulation. Towards robust EV charging inlet detection, we propose a new dataset (EVCI dataset) and a novel data augmentation method that is based on image-to-image translation where typical image-to-image translation methods synthesize a new image in a different domain given an image. To the best of our knowledge, the EVCI dataset is the first EV charging inlet dataset. For the data augmentation method, we focus on being able to control synthesized images' captured environments (e.g., time, lighting) in an intuitive way. To achieve this, we first propose the environment guide vector that humans can intuitively interpret. We then propose a novel image-to-image translation network that translates a given image towards the environment described by the vector. Accordingly, it aims to synthesize a new image that has the same content as the given image while looking like captured in the provided environment by the environment guide vector. Lastly, we train a detection method using the augmented dataset. Through experiments on the EVCI dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. We also show that the proposed method is able to control synthesized images using an image and environment guide vectors.

AB Today, due to the complexity of systems and interactions among their subsystems, the design optimization of a system is highly difficult and costly. Multidisciplinary optimization is an approach, in which interactions among different disciplines are taken into account, and it attempts to optimize all disciplines, simultaneously. In the design process of a system, there is usually some uncertainty in parameters. This uncertainty creates some challenges in the design process and affects the systems performance. To cope with the uncertainty, robust design and reliability-based design approaches are developed. In this paper, a reliability-based multidisciplinary design optimization is presented, in which some of the problem parameters are uncertain. In this regard, it is assumed that some of the problem parameters are in the form of fuzzy numbers. Moreover, in this problem cost is considered as one of the design disciplines, due to its importance in engineering problems. To solve the proposed model, a solution method named the sequential optimization and reliability assessment is presented in which Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization are used to solve the deterministic problem in each iteration. Finally, the design of an autonomous underwater vehicle including cost analysis is investigated and two solution methods are applied. The obtained results from two methods are compared and some conclusion are made. The results show that improving the reliability between 0.5 and 0.85 is more cost-effective. However, some other factors besides the cost play a role in choosing the reliability level that must be considered.

AB The increasing availability of autonomous small-size Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has provided a promising way for data gathering from Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) with the advantages of high mobility, flexibility, and good speed. However, few works considered the situations that multiple UAVs are collaboratively used and the fine-grained trajectory plans of multiple UAVs are devised for collecting data from network including detailed traveling and hovering plans of them in the continuous space. In this paper, we investigate the problem of the Fine-grained Trajectory Plan for multi-UAVs (FTP), in which m UAVs are used to collect data from a given WSN, where m >= 1 . The problem entails not only to find the flight paths of multiple UAVs but also to design the detailed hovering and traveling plans on their paths for efficient data gathering from WSN. The objective of the problem is to minimize the maximum flight time of UAVs such that all sensory data of WSN is collected by the UAVs and transported to the base station. We first propose a mathematical model of the FTP problem and prove that the problem is NP-hard. To solve the FTP problem, we first study a special case of the FTP problem when m = 1, called FTP with Single UAV (FTPS) problem. Then we propose a constant-factor approximation algorithm for the FTPS problem. Based on the FTPS problem, an approximation algorithm for the general version of the FTP problem when m > 1 is further proposed, which can guarantee a constant factor of the optimal solution. Afterwards, the proposed algorithms are verified by extensive simulations.

AB Body caudal fin (BCF) locomotion aquatic unmanned vehicles (AUVs) are making critical transitions to full autonomous systems but have challenge in endurance. Therefore, engineering solutions need to be found to maximize the mission capability of these systems. The body actuation of these AUVs offers a platform for a piezoelectric energy harvester to scavenge electrical energy from the mechanical motion. The motion of the animals which these AUVs are inspiring from can be represented in a spatio-temporal function with different envelope constraints to represent an Anguilliform, Subcarangiform, Carangiform, and Thunniform motion. A better approximation of the strain is accounted for by considering the higher-order nonlinear terms due to the large deformation of these systems. Gibbs function is utilized to better approximate the nonlinear constitutive relations of the piezoelectric material. Parametric studies are carried out to investigate how the nonlinear strain and nonlinear piezoelectric material properties affects the performance of the BCF energy harvesters under each motion for various length and placement conditions. The results show that considering the higher-order strain is needed due to the underestimation of the harvested power when linear assumptions are employed for these types of undulatory motion. It is shown that assuming that load resistance, R-opt approximate to 1/C-p omega, over-approximates the resistance for the nonlinear piezoelectric material model. This analysis shows the importance of including the nonlinearities due to the piezoelectric material and large deformations in order to accurately estimate the levels of the harvested power and its optimal configuration.

AB Ultrashort baseline positioning systems are used to localize manned deep-sea submersibles. A long baseline positioning system is a significant supplement to an ultrashort baseline positioning system and provides more precise positioning. The long baseline beacon array design applied is a primary factor affecting the accuracy of long baseline positioning. However, beacon array designs have mainly been studied in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Because the characteristics and dive tasks between AUVs and manned deep-sea submersibles are different, the simple beacon array formations used in AUVs cannot be directly used in manned deep-sea submersibles. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to present the optimal design of a beacon array for a long baseline positioning system used in manned deep-sea submersibles. In this paper, based on the characteristics of a manned deep-sea submersible, the seven basic principles used for the optimal design of a long baseline beacon array are presented. First, the dive tasks of a JIAOLONG manned deep-sea submersible are analyzed, including the relationship between the dive survey lines, and the depth and distance of each line. Second, we explore the minimum beacon number to cover the dive site and its vicinity. Third, we adjust the beacon position based on the seven optimal design principles. The beacon array is designed to satisfy manned deep-sea submersible dive requirements during the JIAOLONG Test Applications Voyage 2013. A sea trial demonstrates that the long baseline positioning results are reliable if at least three beacons are not blocked, and the accuracy of the long baseline positioning system is better than that of an ultrashort baseline.

AB Continuous, robust, and precise localization is pivotal in enabling the autonomous operation of robots and aircraft in intricate environments, particularly in the absence of GNSS (global navigation satellite system) signals. However, commonly employed approaches, such as visual odometry and inertial navigation systems, encounter hindrances in achieving effective navigation and positioning due to issues of error accumulation. Additionally, the challenge of managing extensive map creation and exploration arises when deploying these systems on unmanned aerial vehicle terminals. This study introduces an innovative system capable of conducting long-range and multi-map visual SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) using monocular cameras equipped with pinhole and fisheye lens models. We formulate a graph optimization model integrating GNSS data and graphical information through multi-sensor fusion navigation and positioning technology. We propose partitioning SLAM maps based on map health status to augment accuracy and resilience in large-scale map generation. We introduce a multi-map matching and fusion algorithm leveraging geographical positioning and visual data to address excessive discrete mapping, leading to resource wastage and reduced map-switching efficiency. Furthermore, a multi-map-based visual SLAM online localization algorithm is presented, adeptly managing and coordinating distinct geographical maps in different temporal and spatial domains. We employ a quadcopter to establish a testing system and generate an aerial image dataset spanning several kilometers. Our experiments exhibit the framework's noteworthy robustness and accuracy in long-distance navigation. For instance, our GNSS-assisted multi-map SLAM achieves an average accuracy of 1.5 m within a 20 km range during unmanned aerial vehicle flights.

AB 3-D building change detection (CD) methods detect more accurate multiple change maps than 2-D ones. Recent technologies, such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems and dense image matching have made it much easier to obtain 3-D data nowadays. Developing a solution which produces an accurate map of multiple building changes, including unclassified, no building change, newly built, demolished, and taller, at an acceptable speed is a challenging issue. In this article, we address a novel 3-D building CD method based on an encoder-decoder network to detect accurate multiple changes maps automatically, in the presence of highly unbalanced remote sensing datasets. The proposed method consists of three main parts: the preprocessing and mixed augmentation (MA) step; the encoder-decoder network training; and finally the prediction step. The data are augmented by the MA method to manipulate highly unbalanced datasets. The encoder-decoder network is constructed by the Yolov7 network as the encoder path and the decoder path equipped with the convolutional layers of modified Unet). Two datasets are used in this article. The first dataset is the point clouds and orthophotos obtained from the UAV of Mashhad City in 2011 and 2016. The second dataset consists of stereo images of the GeoEye-1 satellite and the point clouds obtained from dense image matching of Tehran city in 2009 and 2013. The results show that the proposed method achieved accuracy and kappa coefficients above 94% and 0.90 for both datasets, respectively.

AB With the exponential growth of data traffic in wireless networks, edge caching has been regarded as a promising solution to offload data traffic and alleviate backhaul congestion, where the contents can be cached by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and user terminal (UT) with local data storage. In this article, a cooperative caching architecture of UAV and UTs with scalable video coding (SVC) is proposed, which provides the high transmission rate content delivery and personalized video viewing qualities in hotspot areas. In the proposed cache-enabling UAV-D2D networks, we formulate a joint optimization problem of UT caching placement, UAV trajectory, and UAV caching placement to maximize the cache utility. To solve this challenging mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, the optimization problem is decomposed into three sub-problems. Specifically, we obtain UT caching placement by a many-to-many swap matching algorithm, then obtain the UAV trajectory and UAV caching placement by approximate convex optimization and dynamic programming, respectively. Finally, we propose a low complexity iterative algorithm for the formulated optimization problem to improve the system capacity, fully utilize the cache space resource, and provide diverse delivery qualities for video traffic. Simulation results reveal that: i) the proposed cooperative caching architecture of UAV and UTs obtains larger cache utility than the cache-enabling UAV networks with same data storage capacity and radio resource; ii) compared with the benchmark algorithms, the proposed algorithm improves cache utility and reduces backhaul offloading ratio effectively.

AB A comparative experiment on machine learning (ML)-based pedestrian trajectory prediction was conducted in this study. The study was aimed at improving functional capabilities, where pedestrian safety is the key, such as in relation to intelligent transportation, autonomous vehicles, and automated-guided vehicles. In this article, the effects of integrating social and posture features into pedestrian trajectory prediction are explored. The experimental results show that incorporating social and posture features can improve the accuracy of pedestrian trajectory prediction. Furthermore, various deep learning (DL) models were adopted and compared to deal with these different types of features. Our work shows that a DL approach can handle complex features better than conventional ML. To enable the neural network process different types of data, four types of networks are designed, namely, C-network, S-network, P-network, and SP-network, which are a 2-D convolutional neural network (CNN) with only coordinates, 2-D CNN with the social feature, 2-D CNN with posture features, and 3-D CNN with social and posture features, respectively. The angle mean square errors (MSEs) of SP-network are 4.99, 1.31, and 0.05 less than those of C-network, S-network, and P-network, respectively. The scalar MSEs of SP-network are 0.204, 0.024, and 0.154 less than those of C-network, S-network, and P-network, respectively. Moreover, feature visualization and importance are discussed. It is concluded that the posture features make it possible to separate features with different scalars and angles. It is also shown that the most important posture feature is the edge of the shoulders.

AB Proactive lane-changing (LC) risk prediction can assist driver's LC decision-making to ensure driving safety. However, most previous studies on LC risk prediction did not consider the driver's intention recognition, which made it difficult to guarantee the timeliness and practicability of LC risk prediction. Moreover, the difference in driving risks and its influencing factors between LC to left lane (LCL) and LC to right lane (LCR) have rarely been investigated. To bridge the above research gaps, this study proposes a proactive LC risk prediction framework which integrates the LC intention recognition module and LC risk prediction module. The Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural network with time-series input was employed to recognize the driver's LC intention. The Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) algorithm was then applied to predict the LC risk. Feature importance analysis was lastly conducted to obtain the key features that affect the LC risk. The highD trajectory dataset was used for framework validation. Results show that the recognition accuracy of the driver's LCL, LCR and lane-keeping (LK) intentions based on the proposed LSTM model are 97%, 96% and 97%, respectively. Meanwhile, the LGBM algorithm outperforms other machine learning algorithms in LC risk prediction. The results from feature importance analysis show that the interaction characteristics of the LC vehicle and its preceding vehicle in the current lane have the greatest impact on the LC risk. The proposed framework could potentially be implemented in advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) or autonomous driving system for improved driving safety.

AB Autonomous driving support systems and self-driving cars require the determination of reliable vehicle positions with high accuracy. The real time kinematic (RTK) algorithm with global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is generally employed to obtain highly accurate position information. Because RTK can estimate the fix solution, which is a centimeter-level positioning solution, it is also used as an indicator of the position reliability. However, in urban areas, the degradation of the GNSS signal environment poses a challenge. Multipath noise caused by surrounding tall buildings degrades the positioning accuracy. This leads to large errors in the fix solution, which is used as a measure of reliability. We propose a novel position reliability estimation method by considering two factors; one is that GNSS errors are more likely to occur in the height than in the plane direction; the other is that the height variation of the actual vehicle travel path is small compared to the amount of movement in the horizontal directions. Based on these considerations, we proposed a method to detect a reliable fix solution by estimating the height variation during driving. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, an evaluation test was conducted in an urban area of Tokyo. According to the evaluation test, a reliability judgment rate of 99% was achieved in an urban environment, and a plane accuracy of less than 0.3 m in RMS was achieved. The results indicate that the accuracy of the proposed method is higher than that of the conventional fix solution, demonstratingits effectiveness.

AB The trend towards the usage of battery-electric unmanned aerial vehicles needs new strategies in mission planning and in the design of the systems themselves. To create an optimal mission plan and take appropriate decisions during the mission, a reliable, accurate and adaptive energy model is of utmost importance. However, most existing approaches either use very generic models or ones that are especially tailored towards a specific UAV. We present a generic energy model that is based on decomposing a robotic system into multiple observable components. The generic model is applied to a swarm of quadcopters and evaluated in multiple flights with different manoeuvres. We additionally use the data from practical experiments to learn and generate a mission-agnostic energy model which can match the typical behaviour of our quadcopters such as hovering; movement in x, y and z directions; landing; communication; and illumination. The learned energy model concurs with the overall energy consumption with an accuracy over 95% compared to the training flights for the indoor use case. An extended model reduces the error to less than 1.4%. Consequently, the proposed model enables an estimation of the energy used in flight and on the ground, which can be easily incorporated in autonomous systems and enhance decision-making with reliable input. The used learning mechanism allows to deploy the approach with minimal effort to new platforms needing only some representative test missions, which was shown using additional outdoor validation flights with a different quadcopter of the same build and the originally trained models. This set-up increased the prediction error of our model to 4.46%.

AB The United States (US) population is aging and an increasing number of older adults (aged 65 and older) will experience chronic health issues that can threaten quality of life. We investigated older adults' willingness to use six distinct emerging technologies, which can allow older adults to better manage their health and maintain independence. Data were collected by using a large-scale cross-sectional online survey, which we designed and administered using Qualtrics. The analytical sample (N = 1148) reflected the sociodemographic characteristics of the US older adult population (aged 65 and older) based on the 2010 Census. A series of nested binary logistic regression models were used to assess the willingness to use each type of emerging technology. Our descriptive findings indicated that 19% of participants were willing to use autonomous vehicles, 24% were willing to use assistive robots, 37% were willing to use Internet-connected home appliances, 48% were willing to use Internet-connected cameras for home monitoring, 29% were willing to use a smart home with a built-in personal digital assistant, and 15% were willing to use virtual reality. Our binary logistic regression results revealed that health variables, e.g., limitations with instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and self-reported health status (SRHS), had statistically significant associations with willingness to use some emerging technologies, such as assistive robots. Our study provides novel insights regarding US older adults' willingness to use a range of emerging technologies. The findings may help guide future interventions aimed at enhancing health and independence for older adults.

AB In the steer-by-wire system of an intelligent vehicle, the steering feel feedback system provides accurate and real-time steering feel for a driver by precisely controlling the output torque of the steering feel feedback motor. The precision of output torque depends on the control effect of motor current, which is mainly affected by the key factors, including the dynamic performance of the control system, sampling error, and motor parameter variation. To provide accurate and real-time steering feel, how to design a control method considering the above influence factors has been an acknowledged challenging issue. To solve this problem, a synergistic predictive fusion (SPF) control method is proposed in this article. First, to improve the dynamic performance of the control system, the combined synergistic current control algorithm with the deadbeat predictive (DP) control principle and the synergistic predictive (SP) current control is proposed. Under this framework, a current correction algorithm is designed for the sampling error, and a weighting factor is obtained from the current ratio to adjust the weight of the sampling current. Meanwhile, considering the influence of parameter variation on current control error, an improved Adaline network parameter estimation algorithm is constructed to dynamically adjust motor parameters, and an input signal feedback adjustment step factor is added to enhance the parameter tracking ability. Finally, the simulation and test prove that using the proposed method can track steering feel more quickly (up to 10.61%) and more accurately (up to 13.56%) than using the traditional DP control method.

AB Submarine pipelines have provided an important approach to transport marine oil and gas resources because of their simplicity and efficiency. However, natural or man-made causes can easily lead to pipeline damage and thus result in waste of resources and environmental pollution. At present, the manual routine inspection of submarine pipelines is mainly completed by the survey vessels, which requires a large workload and high cost. The use of autonomous underwater vehicles with multibeam sonar system for real-time surveys is a good solution to this problem. Yet, the accumulation of errors in the integrated navigation system of the vehicle over a long period of operation can cause relatively large position deviations, since the signals of global positioning system cannot be received in the deep sea. To deal with it, the forward looking sonar is adopted in this study to obtain the precise position of the submarine pipeline and a tracking algorithm is proposed to track it. Firstly, the software development kit of the forward looking sonar is used to continuously obtain the pseudo-color images of the submarine pipeline, which are converted into 8-channel gray-scale images for image segmentation and binarization. Secondly, the optimized Rosenfeld algorithm is applied to thin the binary images, after which the submarine pipeline is identified and the corresponding function is fitted to determine the location of the target point to be tracked. Finally, the geodetic coordinates of the target point are determined through coordinate conversion to position the submarine pipeline. A sea trial is carried out and the results prove that accurate and stable pipeline tracking can be achieved by combining the integrated navigation system and the proposed algorithm.

AB What will the future of UAV cellular communications be? In this tutorial article, we address such a compelling yet difficult question by embarking on a journey from 5G to 6G and expounding a large number of case studies supported by original results. We start by overviewing the status quo on UAV communications from an industrial standpoint, providing fresh updates from the 3GPP and detailing new 5G NR features in support of aerial devices. We then dissect the potential and the limitations of such features. In particular, we demonstrate how sub-6GHz massive MIMO can successfully tackle cell selection and interference challenges, we showcase encouraging mmWave coverage evaluations in both urban and suburban/rural settings, and we examine the peculiarities of direct device-to-device communications in the sky. Moving on, we sneak a peek at next-generation UAV communications, listing some of the use cases envisioned for the 2030s. We identify the most promising 6G enablers for UAV communication, those expected to take the performance and reliability to the next level. For each of these disruptive new paradigms (non-terrestrial networks, cell-free architectures, artificial intelligence, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, and THz communications), we gauge the prospective benefits for UAVs and discuss the main technological hurdles that stand in the way. All along, we distil our numerous findings into essential takeaways, and we identify key open problems worthy of further study.

AB Some structures in the harbour environment need to be inspected regularly. However, these scenarios present a major challenge for the accurate estimation of a vehicle's position and subsequent recognition of similar images. In these scenarios, visibility can be poor, making place recognition a difficult task as the visual appearance of a local feature can be compromised. Under these operating conditions, imaging sonars are a promising solution. The quality of the captured images is affected by some factors but they do not suffer from haze, which is an advantage. Therefore, a purely acoustic approach for unsupervised recognition of similar images based on forward-looking sonar (FLS) data is proposed to solve the perception problems in harbour facilities. To simplify the variation of environment parameters and sensor configurations, and given the need for online data for these applications, a harbour scenario was recreated using the Stonefish simulator. Therefore, experiments were conducted with preconfigured user trajectories to simulate inspections in the vicinity of structures. The place recognition approach performs better than the results obtained from optical images. The proposed method provides a good compromise in terms of distinctiveness, achieving 87.5% recall considering appropriate constraints and assumptions for this task given its impact on navigation success. That is, it is based on a similarity threshold of 0.3 and 12 consistent features to consider only effective loops. The behaviour of FLS is the same regardless of the environment conditions and thus this work opens new horizons for the use of these sensors as a great aid for underwater perception, namely, to avoid degradation of navigation performance in muddy conditions.

AB Studies in the residential self-selection literature, which use attitudinal factors to model the jointness of residential and travel-related choices, assume a unidirectional impact from attitudes to behavior; however, such an assumption may be violated under several circumstances. In this current study, we allow the error terms of the attitudinal factors to be correlated with the main outcomes as we jointly model residential choice, auto-ownership level, and rank-based modal preferences. In our joint model, we use green lifestyle propensity and luxury lifestyle propensity as the two stochastic latent constructs. The empirical data for this study is drawn from the 2019 multi-city Transformative Technologies in Transportation survey for the city of Austin that elicited information with respect to individuals' residential location, auto-ownership, and modal preferences through a stated preference experiment in a futuristic autonomous vehicle environment. Results indicate significant unobserved correlations between the latent constructs and the main outcomes; ignoring such endogeneity leads to underestimations of the "true" causal effect of high-density neighborhood (HDN) living on travel-related choices, which can have consequences for policy-making. In our analysis, the "true" causal effect of HDN living on auto-ownership suggests that, on average, the auto-ownership level would reduce by about 29% when an individual is shifted from a non-HDN to a HDN. Furthermore, the probability of using the bicycle mode for non-work pursuits is estimated to increase by 8%, and that of using a private vehicle is estimated to decrease by 3.1%, when individuals are moved from a non-HDN to a HDN.

AB The study of long-distance recreational travel is limited, despite its importance in both travel behavior and tourism literature. To aid the literature, this study validates the existing satisfaction with travel scale (STS)-which has been mostly used and validated for commute and daily travel-and investigates the factors affecting travel satisfaction. The data was collected from a questionnaire survey of visitors to US national parks conducted in the Summer of 2022, and a structural equation modeling framework was used for analyses. Confirmatory factor analysis suggested a three-factor structure with two affect-related factors-positive deactivation and positive activation-and a third factor (cognitive evaluation) related to valence and cognitive assessment of travel experience. The proposed measurement scale for long-distance recreational travel satisfaction could be used by tourism studies to investigate the interrelationships between travel satisfaction and tourism satisfaction, which could offer ways to increase the sustainability of tourism destinations. Structural equation model results show that socio-demographics, general travel attributes, trip-specific characteristics, travel-based activities, travel time perception, and attitudes are directly related to travel satisfaction. In addition to these direct effects, socio-demographic and general travel attributes are related to travel satisfaction indirectly through attitudinal characteristics (driving enjoyment and polychronicity). This investigation revealed a few differences in commute and long-distance travel behaviors: mostly the impacts of age, in-come, and travel duration on travel satisfaction. Based on the study results, it is also speculated that future autonomous vehicles would be a favorable choice for long-distance recreational travelers only if the option of manual driving is possible in those vehicles.

ID INFRARED THERMOGRAPHY IRT
AB Delamination is one of the most critical defects assessed during bridge deck inspections. Recently, infrared (IR) thermography has gained more attention for delamination detection since it provides fast and effective inspections with reasonable accuracy. However, point-by-point inspections with handheld IR cameras and manual data interpretation are still time consuming. In addition, manual data interpretation is highly dependent on the inspectors' experiences. To tackle these concerns, this study conducted investigations from two perspectives to improve IR-based delamination detection: (1) data collection and (2) data interpretation. In this study, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with IR sensors have been deployed to perform automated inspection data collection. Various factors have been considered to develop a preliminary UAV-based IR data collection plan. The developed data collection plan has been implemented on a full-scale bridge deck specimen at the Bridge Evaluation and Accelerated Structural Testing (BEAST) facility. Discussions and suggestions based on the results have been provided. A pixel-level deep learning method is developed for automatic delamination detection and quantification of the bridge deck. IR data collected from four real bridge decks are pixel-wise labeled and used for model calibration. The accuracy and mean intersection over union achieve 99.36%, 97.96%, 97.83% and 0.98, 0.96, 0.95 for training, validation, and testing datasets, respectively. Furthermore, an easy-to-use tool is developed based on the proposed method for practical implementation. The developed tool is validated using the BEAST specimen data. The fast and accurate implementation of the developed tool makes it a promising option for autonomous bridge deck inspection.

AB In this paper, stochastic geometry tools are utilized to analyze the performance of a wireless network with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The evaluation is based on the concept of a truncated octahedron that is the fundamental three-dimensional (3D) shape that models the basic cell in an entirely aerial cellular structure with UAV nodes only. The spatial locations of the aerial users, are modeled as a 3D Binomial Point Process (BPP). Subsequently, stochastic geometry analysis in a reference truncated octahedron located at the origin is performed and exact expressions for the distances between aerial users, are derived. To this end, expressions for evaluating the volume of the regions of the 3D cell in which an aerial user may fall, are derived. Then, by defining the signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) ratio at the reference UAV-base station (UAV-BS) receiver, a performance analysis in terms of coverage probability is conducted under two interference scenarios, i.e., a pure intra-cell interference and an intra- plus inter-cell interference case. As intermediate step in the coverage probability analysis, expressions for relevant distance distributions and the Laplace transform of the aggregate interference power distribution are derived. For the sake of completeness, coverage probability analysis under intra-cell interference is also performed and compared to a 3D cell modeled as a sphere. The analytical expressions are also compared to simulation results to validate the accuracy of the proposed framework and reveal valuable insights.

ID ALLOCATION
AB We present H-TD2: Hybrid Temporal Difference Learning for Taxi Dispatch, a model-free, adaptive decision-making algorithm to coordinate a large fleet of automated taxis in a dynamic urban environment to minimize expected customer waiting times. Our scalable algorithm exploits the natural transportation network company topology by switching between two behaviors: distributed temporal-difference learning computed locally at each taxi and infrequent centralized Bellman updates computed at the dispatch center. We derive a regret bound and design the trigger condition between the two behaviors to explicitly control the trade-off between computational complexity and the individual taxi policy's bounded sub-optimality; this advances the state of the art by enabling distributed operation with bounded-suboptimality. Additionally, unlike recent reinforcement learning dispatch methods, this policy estimation is adaptive and robust to out-of-training domain events. This result is enabled by a two-step modelling approach: the policy is learned on an agent-agnostic, cell-based Markov Decision Process and individual taxis are coordinated using the learned policy in a distributed game-theoretic task assignment. We validate our algorithm against a receding horizon control baseline in a Gridworld environment with a simulated customer dataset, where the proposed solution decreases average customer waiting time by 50% over a wide range of parameters. We also validate in a Chicago city environment with real customer requests from the Chicago taxi public dataset where the proposed solution decreases average customer waiting time by 26% over irregular customer distributions during a 2016 Major League Baseball World Series game.

AB High-resolution multibeam bathymetry data collected with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) complemented by compressed high-intensity radar pulse (Chirp) profiles and remotely operated vehicle (ROV) observations and sediment sampling reveal a distinctive rough topography associated with seafloor gas venting and/or near-subsurface gas hydrate accumulations. The surveys provide 1 m bathymetric grids of deep-water gas venting sites along the best-known gas venting areas along the Pacific margin of North America, which is an unprecedented level of resolution. Patches of conspicuously rough seafloor that are tens of meters to hundreds of meters across and occur on larger seafloor topographic highs characterize seepage areas. Some patches are composed of multiple depressions that range from 1 to 100 m in diameter and are commonly up to 10 m deeper than the adjacent seafloor. Elevated mounds with relief of > 10 m and fractured surfaces suggest that seafloor expansion also occurs. Ground truth observations show that these areas contain broken pavements of methane-derived authigenic carbonates with intervening topographic lows. Patterns seen in Chirp profiles, ROV observations, and core data suggest that the rough topography is produced by a combination of diagenetic alteration, focused erosion, and inflation of the seafloor. This characteristic texture allows previously unknown gas venting areas to be identified within these surveys. A conceptual model for the evolution of these features suggests that these morphologies develop slowly over protracted periods of slow seepage and shows the impact of gas venting and gas hydrate development on the seafloor morphology.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) navigation in the presence of Human-driven vehicles (HVs) is challenging, as HVs continuously update their policies in response to AVs. In order to navigate safely in the presence of complex AV-HV social interactions, the AVs must learn to predict these changes. Humans are capable of navigating such challenging social interaction settings because of their intrinsic knowledge about other agents' behaviors and use that to forecast what might happen in the future. Inspired by humans, we provide our AVs the capability of anticipating future states and leveraging prediction in a cooperative reinforcement learning (RL) decision-making framework, to improve safety and robustness. In this paper, we propose an integration of two essential and earlier-presented components of AVs: social navigation and prediction. We formulate the AV's decision-making process as a RL problem and seek to obtain optimal policies that produce socially beneficial results utilizing a prediction-aware planning and social-aware optimization RL framework. We also propose a Hybrid Predictive Network (HPN) that anticipates future observations. The HPN is used in a multi-step prediction chain to compute a window of predicted future observations to be used by the value function network (VFN). Finally, a safe VFN is trained to optimize a social utility using a sequence of previous and predicted observations, and a safety prioritizer is used to leverage the interpretable kinematic predictions to mask the unsafe actions, constraining the RL policy. We compare our prediction-aware AV to state-of-the-art solutions and demonstrate performance improvements in terms of efficiency and safety in multiple simulated scenarios.

AB This article investigates a hierarchical aerial computing system, where both high-altitude platforms (HAPs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provision computation services for ground devices (GDs). Different from the existing works which ignored UAV task offloading to HAPs and suffered long transmission delay between HAPs and GDs, in our system, UAVs are responsible for collecting the tasks generated by GDs. Considering limited resources and constrained coverage, UAVs need to cooperatively allocate their resources (including spectrum, caching, and computing) to GDs. After collecting GD tasks, UAVs are allowed to offload part of these tasks to the HAP, in order to minimize task processing delay and then better satisfy GD delay requirement. Our objective is to maximize the amount of computed tasks while satisfying tasks' heterogeneous Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements through the joint optimization of UAV resource allocation and task offloading. To this end, a joint optimization problem is first formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) under the constraints of available resources, UAV energy, and collision avoidance. Then, we design a multiagent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO)-based algorithm to solve the optimization problem. By introducing the centralized training with decentralized execution framework, UAVs acting as agents can cooperatively make decisions on GDs association, resource allocation, and task offloading according to their local observations. In addition, state normalization and action mask are also adopted to improve training efficiency. Experimental results verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm and the system performance is also analyzed by the numerical results.

AB Wildfires are among the biggest problems faced worldwide. They are increasing in severity and frequency, causing economic losses, human death, and significant environmental damage. Environmental factors, such as wind and large forest areas, contribute to the fire spreading over multiple fire spots, all of which grow continuously, making fire suppression extremely difficult. Therefore, fire spots should be coverage simultaneously to contain the spread and prevent coalescence. Therefore, this study presents a new model based on the principles of nature-inspired metaheuristics that uses Swarm Intelligence (SI) to test the effectiveness of using an autonomous and decentralized behaviour for a swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones to detect all distributed fire spots and extinguishing them cooperatively. To achieve this goal, we used the improved random walk algorithm to explore the distributed fire spots and a self-coordination mechanism based on the stigmergy as an indirect communication between the swarm drones, taking into account the collision avoidance factor, the amount of extinguishing fluid, and the flight range of the drones. Numerical analysis and extensive simulations were performed to investigate the behaviour of the proposed methods and analyze their performance in terms of the area-coverage rate and total energy required by the drone swarm to complete the task. Our quantitative tests show that the improved model has the best coverage (95.3%, 84.3% and 65.8%, respectively) compared to two other methods Levy Flight (LF) algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which use the same initial parameter values. The simulation results show that the proposed model performs better than its competitors and saves energy, especially in more complicated situations.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), as a recently emerging technology, enabled a new breed of unprecedented applications in different domains. This technology's ongoing trend is departing from large remotely-controlled drones to networks of small autonomous drones to collectively complete intricate tasks time and costeffectively. An important challenge is developing efficient sensing, communication, and control algorithms that can accommodate the requirements of highly dynamic UAV networks with heterogeneous mobility levels. Recently, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in learning-based networking has gained momentum to harness the learning power of cognizant nodes to make more intelligent networking decisions by integrating computational intelligence into UAV networks. An important example of this trend is developing learning powered routing protocols, where machine learning methods are used to model and predict topology evolution, channel status, traffic mobility, and environmental factors for enhanced routing. This paper reviews AI-enabled routing protocols designed primarily for aerial networks, including topology predictive and self-adaptive learning-based routing algorithms, with an emphasis on accommodating highly dynamic network topology. To this end, we justify the importance and adaptation of AI into UAV network communications. We also address, with an AI emphasis, the closely related topics of mobility and networking models for UAV networks, simulation tools and public datasets, and relations to UAV swarming, which serve to choose the right algorithm for each scenario. We conclude by presenting future trends, and the remaining challenges in AI-based UAV networking, for different aspects of routing, connectivity, topology control, security and privacy, energy efficiency, and spectrum sharing.(1)

AB Due to the correlation between friction reduction and the road-covering water film height, knowledge about the current wetness level is of relevance for drivers and autonomous systems. A promising approach for wetness quantification is based on capacitive transducer arrays that enable to detect water spray ejected by the tires. Even though previous studies on this approach have shown the feasibility of wetness classification, optimization opportunities exist. While these previous investigations were limited to one feature selection algorithm, we study various algorithms and demonstrate the potential for optimization. Besides an application-specific algorithm that is capable of determining class-dependent features resulting in a performance improvement of more than 0.03 for the considered evaluation metrics, sequential forward floating selection in particular yields the most significant performance increase of more than 0.06. In addition, prior studies were limited to a test track with constrained conditions. Thus, in order to study the transferability of the preceding results, we present investigations on new experimental data acquired on public roads. The unknown and varying environmental conditions on public roads as well as a larger wheel speed range and steering angle effects are shown to significantly decrease classifier performance. We demonstrate that fusing two transducer arrays of different wheel arch liners increases performance by around 0.02. Here, a considerable information benefit can be attributed to the different transducer positions with design-related advantages. Furthermore, we show that the fusion with additional sensor data available in the vehicle results in a further performance improvement of more than 0.02.

AB In recent years, Vehicle-To-Everything (V2X) applications have been actively developing, and the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements are becoming more stringent. To support V2X applications, IEEE developed the IEEE 802.11p standard in 2010. However, systems based on this standard fail to fulfill requirements on very low frame transmission delay and packet loss ratio imposed by modern V2X applications, such as applications for autonomous driving and platooning. To satisfy new requirements, IEEE has launched a new IEEE 802.11bd project to design the next generation of IEEE 802.11p. An important feature of IEEE 802.11bd is the channel bonding technique, which allows transmitting data in two adjacent channels simultaneously. Thus, it increases data rates and may reduce delays and packet loss ratio. The current version of IEEE 802.11bd specifies two channel bonding techniques, which differ from that used in modern Wi-Fi networks. This work evaluates the performance of the three aforementioned techniques from the IEEE 802.11 family of standards considering frame transmission delays and packet loss ratio. With rigorous simulations, it is shown that, in most cases, the channel bonding techniques highly decrease the percentage of both IEEE 802.11bd and legacy stations with unsatisfied QoS requirements on delays and packet loss ratio. Unfortunately, sometimes, the IEEE 802.11bd channel bonding techniques significantly worsen performance. Moreover, the work highlights that the choice of the primary channel for channel bonding techniques significantly affects the network performance. As a result, the paper provides a recommendation for selecting both the most suitable channel access method and primary channel.

AB Dramatic increase in road traffic volume has made driving safety and traffic efficiency more challenging, but smart transportation has been spotlighted as a promising technology for improving driving safety and efficiency. This paper surveys safe and efficient driving in the smart transportation with a focus on the aspects of systems, protocols, applications, and security, especially for autonomous vehicles. This smart transportation requires to monitor road surfaces precisely and identify hazards, and vehicles also need to share sensing information to avoid dangerous situations or environments through wireless communication in vehicular networks. For this purpose, dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) have achieved the international standards of the IEEE Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE), and applications are now common that use the global positioning systems (GPS) for a dedicated navigation system navigator or smartphone application. This combination of vehicular networking and navigation enables systems and applications not only to enhance driving safety, but also to increase traffic efficiency. To support the vehicular systems and applications efficiently, the protocols need to be designed carefully and implemented effectively. This paper summarizes and analyzes the state-of-the-art research based on standardization activities for smart transportation systems, protocols, applications, and security. This paper also provides the comparison between the different technologies composing vehicular systems, protocols, applications, and security in terms of advantages, disadvantages, analysis, simulation, implementation, and complexity to provide a trend of overall technologies. Lastly, this paper suggests research directions for the smart transportation. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Emerging bioinspired underwater systems, such as autonomous ocean mapping and surveillance vehicles, that maneuver through their environment by mimicking the swimming motion of aquatic animals, can benefit from soft monolithic actuators and control surfaces capable of undergoing complex deformations. Herein, an electrically driven ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) artificial muscle with uniquely patterned electrodes for creating complex deformations is presented. The surface electrode pattern on the IPMC is created using a simple surface machining process. By selectively activating specific regions of the IPMC, bending, twisting, flapping, and other bioinspired locomotive behavior can be achieved. For instance, the bending and twisting response of an example 50 mm 25 mm 0.5 mm patterned IPMC actuator is characterized to determine its range of motion, output force and torque, as well as its effectiveness as a fish-fin-like propulsor. The experimental results show that the twisting angle exceeds 8 degrees; the blocking tip force and torque can be as high as 16.5 mN (at 3 V) and 0.83 N.mm (at 4 V), respectively (driven at 0.05 Hz); and an average thrust force of approximately 0.4 mN (driven by 4-V sinusoidal input at 1 Hz) can be generated. These newly developed IPMC fins can be exploited to create novel and efficient propulsors for next-generation underwater robotic vehicles. An example bioinspired robotic fish is presented which exploits the capabilities of the patterned IPMCs for propulsion and maneuvering, where an average maximum swimming speed of approximately 28 mm/s is reported.

AB Autonomous driving is a key vehicle capability for future mobility solutions that relies on the reliability of its high-performance vehicle computer. As for any electronics for automotive applications, thermal management is a crucial point. A very extensively employed approach for improving heat removal is the usage of heat spreaders in the form of a package lid, especially for flip-chip applications. The usage of a lid in flip-chip ball grid array (BGA) packages improves heat removal based on the heat spreading capabilities of the lid, and reduces package warpage, since with a lid the package becomes stiffer. However, adding a lid also increases stresses at solder interconnects. When selecting a material for the lid, the most intuitive criterion is to focus on the material's thermal conductivity. Sometimes overlooked, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the lid also plays an important role regarding package warpage and reliability of thermal interface materials (TIM) as well as solder interconnects, such as solder bumps. This work focuses on the influence of different lid materials at package level for flip-chip applications. Consequently, the influence of three alternative materials is investigated and compared to the performance of a standard copper lid. For the quantification of the effects, a validated finite element model of a flip-chip package is presented, with the thermo-mechanical performance of the studied lid materials validated based on package warpage, peel strains and plastic strain energy density at the bumps, as well as on peel and shear strains at the TIM.

AB Despite its advantages of flexility and low-cost networking, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications face various attacks such as eavesdropping. Existing studies on secure UAV communications assume fixed-location eavesdroppers and rarely consider interactions between legitimate nodes and eavesdroppers. In this paper, we investigate eavesdropping and anti-eavesdropping interaction between a UAV-enabled eavesdropper (UAV-E) and a UAV-enabled base station (UAV-BS) in a downlink wiretap system. The UAV-E aims to wiretap downlink signals by adaptively adjusting its trajectory while the UAV-BS aims to maximize secrecy-sum-rate with minimum power consumption by jointly optimizing user scheduling, power control, and trajectory. Dynamic differential equations are formulated to characterize motions of UAVs, following which a zero-sum differential game is formulated to model the "pursuit-evasion" interaction between the UAV-BS and the UAV-E. Definition and existence of Nash equilibrium (NE) are provided. To obtain the NE, Pontryagins minimum principle is leveraged to solve the trajectory design problem. Further, Gauss-Seidel-like implicit finite-difference method is leveraged to obtain saddle-point strategies at NE. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed game model. It is revealed that the differential game can well-characterize the strategy interactions between UAVs. Moreover, results show that the initial positions and weights of UAVs, the energy consumption factor, and the user scheduling have key impacts on motion interactions between the UAV-BS and the UAV-E and further on UAV-BS's power control.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted a lot of research attention because of their high mobility and low cost in serving as temporary aerial base stations (BSs) and providing high data rates for next-generation communication networks. To protect user privacy while avoiding detection by a warden, we investigate a jammer-aided UAV covert communication system, which aims to maximize the user's covert rate with optimized transmit and jamming power. The UAV is equipped with multi-antennas to serve multi-users simultaneously and enhance the Quality of Service. By considering the general composite fading and shadowing channel models, we derive the exact probability density (PDF) and cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The obtained PDF and CDF are used to derive the closed-form expressions for detection error probability and covert rate. Furthermore, the covert rate maximization problem is formulated as a Nash bargaining game, and the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) is introduced to investigate the negotiation among users. To solve the NBS, we propose two algorithms, i.e., particle swarm optimization-based and joint two-stage power allocation algorithms, to achieve covertness and high data rates under the warden's optimal detection threshold. All formulated problems are proven to be convex, and the complexity is analyzed. The numerical results are presented to verify the theoretical performance analysis and show the effectiveness and success of achieving the covert communication of our algorithms.

AB Due to the high volume of documents in the pedestrian safety field, the current study conducts a systematic bibliometric analysis on the researches published before October 3, 2021, based on the science-mapping approach. Science mapping enables us to present a broad picture and comprehensive review of a significant number of documents using co-citation, bibliographic coupling, collaboration, and co-word analysis. To this end, a dataset of 6311 pedestrian safety papers was collected from the Web of Science Core Collection database. First, a descriptive analysis was carried out, covering whole yearly publications, most-cited papers, and most productive authors, as well as sources, affiliations, and countries. In the next steps, science mapping was implemented to clarify the social, intellectual, and conceptual structures of pedestrian-safety research using the VOSviewer and Bibliometrix R-package tools. Remarkably, based on intellectual structure, pedestrian safety demonstrated an association with seven research areas: "Pedestrian crash frequency models", "Pedestrian injury severity crash models", "Traffic engineering measures in pedestrians' safety", "Global reports around pedestrian accident epidemiology", "Effect of age and gender on pedestrians' behavior", "Distraction of pedestrians", and "Pedestrian crowd dynamics and evacuation". Moreover, according to conceptual structure, five major research fronts were found to be relevant, namely "Collision avoidance and intelligent transportation systems (ITS)", "Epidemiological studies of pedestrian injury and prevention", "Pedestrian road crossing and behavioral factors", "Pedestrian flow simulation", and "Walkable environment and pedestrian safety". Finally, "autonomous vehicle", "pedestrian detection", and "collision avoidance" themes were identified as having the greatest centrality and development degrees in recent years.

AB Low-cost positioning system usually consists of Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) and Miniature Inertial Measurement Unit (MIMU). For urban applications, RTK signals are often poor or lost in dense high buildings, bridges, and tunnels. In that situation, only Dead Reckoning (DR) would be used. However, DR fails to provide satisfactory accuracy limited by the parameter errors of low-cost MIMU. To address this challenge, we propose a positioning method based on traversal optimization for MIMU calibration parameters. More specifically, First, the time difference between RTK and IMU is determined by comparing accelerated velocity and angular velocity (namely motion information). For RTK, a B-spline is applied to get the motion information by calculating the derivative of the RTK position and azimuth angle. Secondly, under the criterion of minimum accumulative errors of synchronized motion information between RTK and IMU, a novel calibration method is designed based on binary tree traversal thought to obtain the optimal MIMU calibration parameters and the accurate initial navigation information. Then, using the calculated parameters and information, the DR algorithm is employed to realize high-precision lane-level positioning. We conduct extensive experiments, and the results demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve a high positioning accuracy of 0.56 m (RMSE) when RTK signals are lost for 45s, which is almost equivalent to the performance of the positioning system equipped with high-cost sensors. Our method can significantly reduce system costs and realize high accuracy for urban applications. Moreover, our method is the potential to be extended into other fields such as advanced driving assistance systems, autonomous vehicles, and mapping systems.

AB Pressure on deep-sea ecosystems continues to increase as anthropogenic activities move into ever deeper waters. To mitigate impacts on vulnerable habitats, various conservation measures exist, such as the designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). So far, however, little evidence is available about their effectiveness. This paper presents a unique follow-up study assessing the status and recovery of a deep-sea fisheries closure and MPA at similar to 1000 m water depth in the NE Atlantic, eight years after designation. The Darwin Mounds cold-water coral ecosystem was discovered in 1998, and closed to all bottom contact fisheries, especially trawling, in 2003. Our repeat survey in 2011 used both high-resolution sidescan sonar data collected by Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) and video footage from a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) to evaluate recovery. The results demonstrate that (1) protection was successful and fishing impact was largely avoided in the Western Darwin Mounds, which contained similar proportions of live cold-water coral occurrence in 2011 as observed in 1998-2000; however (2) the Eastern Darwin Mounds suffered severe damage pre-closure, and by 2011 showed no coral recolonisation and very little re-growth. These results are further evidence for the low resilience and slow recovery potential of deep-sea ecosystems, and underline once again the importance of the precautionary principle in deep-sea conservation.

TI Interaction Mechanics Model for Rigid Driving Wheels of Planetary Rovers
   Moving on Sandy Terrain with Consideration of Multiple Physical Effects
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

AB Predicting wheel-terrain interaction with semiempirical models is of substantial importance for developing planetary wheeled mobile robots (rovers). Primarily geared toward the design of manned terrestrial vehicles, conventional terramechanics models do not provide the sufficient fidelity required for application on autonomous planetary rovers. To develop a high-fidelity interaction mechanics model, in this study the physical effects of wheel lug, slip sinkage, wheel dimension, and load are analyzed based on experimental results, including wheel sinkage, drawbar pull, normal force, and moment, which are measured on a single-wheel test bed. The mechanism of lug-terrain interaction is investigated systematically to clarify the principle of increasing shear stress, conditions of forming successive shearing among adjacent lugs, and the influence on shear displacement of soil. A mathematical model for predicting the concentrated forces and torque of rigid wheels with lugs for planetary rovers moving on sandy terrain is derived by integrating the improved models of normal and shearing stress distributions. In addition to the wheel parameters, terrain parameters, and motion state variables, wheel-terrain interaction parameters, such as the linear varying sinkage exponent, the soil displacement radius, and load effect parameters, were proposed and explicitly included in the model. In the single-wheel experiments, the slip ratio was increased approximately from 0.05 to 0.6, and the relative errors of the predicted results using the proposed model are less than 10% for all the wheels when compared with the experimental data. The proposed model has been used in the simulation of a four-wheeled rover, and its effectiveness is evaluated by comparing the simulation results with experimental results.

AB The increasing world population makes it necessary to fight challenges such as climate change and to realize production efficiently and quickly. However, the minimum cost, maximum income, environmental pollution protection and the ability to save water and energy are all factors that should be taken into account in this process. The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in agriculture to meet all of these criteria serves the purpose of precision agriculture. As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can easily obtain real-time data, they have a great potential to address and optimize solutions to the problems faced by agriculture. Despite some limitations, such as the battery, load, weather conditions, etc., UAVs will be used frequently in agriculture in the future because of the valuable data that they obtain and their efficient applications. According to the known literature, UAVs have been carrying out tasks such as spraying, monitoring, yield estimation, weed detection, etc. In recent years, articles related to agricultural UAVs have been presented in journals with high impact factors. Most precision agriculture applications with UAVs occur in outdoor environments where GPS access is available, which provides more reliable control of the UAV in both manual and autonomous flights. On the other hand, there are almost no UAV-based applications in greenhouses where all-season crop production is available. This paper emphasizes this deficiency and provides a comprehensive review of the use of UAVs for agricultural tasks and highlights the importance of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for a UAV solution in the greenhouse.

AB Autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance technology are growing exponentially, and vehicles equipped with conditional automation, which has features like Traffic Jam Pilot and Highway Assist, are already available in the market. And this could expose the driver to a stressful driving condition during the takeover mission. To identify stressful takeover situations and better interact with automated systems, the relationship and effect between drivers' physiological responses, situational factors (e.g., takeover request [TOR] lead time, takeover frequencies, and scenario types), and takeover criticality were investigated.34 participants were involved in a series of takeover events in a simulated driving environment, which are varied by different TOR lead time conditions and driving scenes. The situational factors, drivers' skin conductance (SC), heart rate (HR), gaze behaviors, and takeover criticality ratings were collected and analyzed. The results indicated that drivers had a higher takeover criticality rating when they experienced a shorter TOR lead time level or at first to fourth take-overs. Besides, drivers who encountered a dynamic obstacle reported higher takeover criticality ratings when they were at the same Time to collision (TTC). We also observed that the takeover situations of higher criticality have larger driver's maximum HR, mean pupil size, and maximum change in the SC (relative to the initial value of a takeover stage). Those findings of situational factors and physiological responses can provide additional support for the designing of adaptive alert systems and environmental soothing technology in conditionally automated driving, which will improve the takeover performances and drivers' experience.

TI Transfer Beyond the Field of View: Dense Panoramic Semantic Segmentation
   via Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS

DE Semantic segmentation; domain adaptation; panoramic segmentation; scene
   parsing; intelligent vehicles
ID ATTENTION; NETWORK
AB Autonomous vehicles clearly benefit from the expanded Field of View (FoV) of 360 degrees sensors, but modern semantic segmentation approaches rely heavily on annotated training data which is rarely available for panoramic images. We look at this problem from the perspective of domain adaptation and bring panoramic semantic segmentation to a setting, where labelled training data originates from a different distribution of conventional pinhole camera images. To achieve this, we formalize the task of unsupervised domain adaptation for panoramic semantic segmentation and collect DENSEPASS - a novel densely annotated dataset for panoramic segmentation under cross-domain conditions, specifically built to study the PINHOLE -> PANORAMIC domain shift and accompanied with pinhole camera training examples obtained from Cityscapes. DENSEPASS covers both, labelled- and unlabelled 360 degrees images, with the labelled data comprising 19 classes which explicitly fit the categories available in the source (i.e. pinhole) domain. Since data-driven models are especially susceptible to changes in data distribution, we introduce P2PDA - a generic frame-work for PINHOLE -> PANORAMIC semantic segmentation which addresses the challenge of domain divergence with different variants of attention-augmented domain adaptation modules, enabling the transfer in output-, feature-, and feature confidence spaces. P2PDA intertwines uncertainty-aware adaptation using confidence values regulated on-the-fly through attention heads with discrepant predictions. Our framework facilitates context exchange when learning domain correspondences and dramatically improves the adaptation performance of accuracy- and efficiency-focused models. Comprehensive experiments verify that our framework clearly surpasses unsupervised domain adaptation- and specialized panoramic segmentation approaches as well as state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods.

AB To achieve effective management and understanding of risks associated with increasing anthropogenic pressures in the ocean, it is essential to successfully and efficiently collect data with high spatio-temporal resolution and coverage. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are an example of technological advances with potential to provide improved information on ocean processes. We demonstrate the capabilities of a low -power AUV buoyancy glider for performing long endurance biological and environmental data acquisition in Northern Norway. We deployed a passive acoustic sensor system onboard a SeagliderTM to investigate presence and distribution of cetaceans while concurrently using additional onboard sensors for recording environmental features (temperature, salinity, pressure, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll a). The hydrophone recorded over 108.6 h of acoustic data during the spring months of March and April across the continental shelf break and detected both baleen and odontocete species. We observed a change in cetacean detections throughout the survey period, with humpback whale calls dominating the soundscape in the first weeks of deployment, coinciding with the migration toward their breeding grounds. From mid-April, sperm whales and delphinids were the predominant species, which coincided with increasing chlorophyll a fluorescence values associated with the spring phytoplankton blooms. Finally, we report daily variations in background noise associated with fishing activities and traffic in the nearby East Atlantic shipping route. Our results show that gliders provide excellent platforms for collecting information about ecosystems with minimal disturbance to animals, allowing systematic observations of our ocean biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics in response to natural variations and industrial activities.

AB Obstacle detection in autonomous navigation involves the processing of the environment information obtained from sensors, such as LIDAR, radar, ultrasonic, magnetic and capacitive. Imaging techniques like stereoscopy, optical flux, and deep image, have been used for precise object detection but with a high computational cost. These sensors also have disadvantages like weight, its size or power consumption. The case of systems with lasers added like in LIDAR can be harmful to people. Ultrasonic sensors are safer for people but the signal to noise ratio decreases in outdoors. IR sensors are cheap and can be clustered to strength signal, however, additional sources of radiation can affect the measurement especially in outdoors. In this work, we propose an IR system with adequate spatial configuration and electronic filters to detect objects indoors and outdoors by means of scattered IR radiation centered at 940 nm. The developed sensor has the following specs: Front area dimensions is 5x5 cm that includes 10 IR LEDs at the center and a Si detector in each corner. The approximated detection volume is 17,000 cm(3), considering a detection cone length of 300 cm and a solid angle of 30 degrees. Total system weight is 40 g. System was tested with four experiments to evaluate signal filtering, effect of object surface roughness, repeatability and working sensitivity region. This evaluation allowed to make a comparison with traditional Obstacle Detection System techniques, giving advantages in almost all parameters considered, allowing us to conclude that developed system can detect objects in indoors and outdoors, in a region suitable for aerial and surface vehicles or blind persons.

AB DC microgrid is supposed to be a feasible solution to reduce the negative impact of electric vehicle (EV) fast charging on the electric grid and improve the penetration of photovoltaics (PV) generation. In this paper, an improved decentralized Virtual-battery based droop control with the capability of bus voltage maintenance, load power dispatch and SOC balance of the energy storage system (ESS) is proposed to ensure the autonomous and stable operation of the DC microgrid. The reference output voltage and virtual resistance in the droop control loop are altered dynamically based on the Virtual-battery model of the ESS. The coordinated control among the PV-ESS-Grid integrated system is realized through the primary Bus-Signaling control, where the reference voltages at which the control modes of the PV array and the grid are switched are designed based on the VirtualOCV of the ESS. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated in MATLAB/Simulink environment with an equivalent bus capacitance-based model where the EV charging profile is obtained from real-world charging data of a fast charging station. The merits of the control strategy including higher PV utilization, less frequent connection of the grid and more precise voltage tracking are highlighted in comparison with the conventional droop control strategy. Finally, the sizing of the ESSs is optimized based on the total cost of the DC microgrid, including the daily electricity cost purchased from the grid and the depreciation cost of the ESSs based on the expanded capacity degradation model of Li-ion batteries.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based spraying systems have recently become important for the precision application of pesticides, using machine learning approaches. Therefore, the objective of this research was to develop a machine learning system that has the advantages of high computational speed and good accuracy for recognizing spray and non-spray areas for UAV-based sprayers. A machine learning system was developed by using the mutual subspace method (MSM) for images collected from a UAV. Two target lands: agricultural croplands and orchard areas, were considered in building two classifiers for distinguishing spray and non-spray areas. The field experiments were conducted in target areas to train and test the system by using a commercial UAV (DJI Phantom 3 Pro) with an onboard 4K camera. The images were collected from low (5 m) and high (15 m) altitudes for croplands and orchards, respectively. The recognition system was divided into offline and online systems. In the offline recognition system, 74.4% accuracy was obtained for the classifiers in recognizing spray and non-spray areas for croplands. In the case of orchards, the average classifier recognition accuracy of spray and non-spray areas was 77%. On the other hand, the online recognition system performance had an average accuracy of 65.1% for croplands, and 75.1% for orchards. The computational time for the online recognition system was minimal, with an average of 0.0031 s for classifier recognition. The developed machine learning system had an average recognition accuracy of 70%, which can be implemented in an autonomous UAV spray system for recognizing spray and non-spray areas for real-time applications.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a localisation system for an indoor rotary-wing micro aerial vehicle (MAV) that uses three onboard LEDs and base station mounted active vision unit.
   Design/methodology/approach - A pair of blade mounted cyan LEDs and a tail mounted red LED are used as on-board landmarks. A base station tracks the landmarks and estimates the pose of the MAV in real time by analysing images taken using an active vision unit. In each image, the ellipse formed by the cyan LEDs is used for 5 degree of freedom (DoF) pose estimation with yaw estimation from the red LED providing the 6th DoF.
   Findings - About 1-3.5 per cent localisation error of the MAV at various ranges, rolls and angular speeds less than 45 degrees/s relative to the base station at known location indicates that the MAV can be accurately localised at 9-12 Hz in an indoor environment.
   Research limitations/implications - Line-of-sight between the base station and MAV is necessary while limited accuracy is evident in yaw estimation at long distances. Additional yaw sensors and dynamic zoom are among future work.
   Practical implications - Provided an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) as the base station equipped with its own localisation sensor, the developed system encourages the use of autonomous indoor rotary-wing MAVs in various robotics applications, such as urban search and rescue.
   Originality/value - The most significant contribution of this paper is the innovative LED configuration allowing full 6 DoF pose estimation using three LEDs, one camera and no fixed infrastructure. The active vision unit enables a wide range of observable flight as the ellipse generated by the cyan LEDs is recognisable from almost any direction.

AB The optimization of urban traffic efficiency and reduction of pollution through minimizing the number of taxis has become a topic of increasing interest. However, the problem of determining the minimum fleet that considers both time and distance efficiency has received limited attention. Furthermore, little research has been done on how this problem is influenced by factors such as city size and travel demand (i.e., the number of trips). This study extends the minimum fleet problem to the min-cost minimum fleet problem, and proposes a method to address the problem by constructing a "dispatch network" and finding the minimum weight and minimum path cover of it. A comparative analysis of the method is conducted with the taxi trajectory data of three cities, New York, Chengdu, and Chicago, and the results show a 60% reduction in the off-load travel time of vehicles compared to the previous method, while maintaining the same fleet size. With the introduction of an emissions model and its combination with our methodology, emissions can also be minimized. Moreover, the relationship between min-cost minimum fleet and city size and travel demand (number of trips) is studied. Experimental results indicate that fleet size and idle time (distance) vary linearly with the number of trips. Meanwhile, city size also has an essential impact on the algorithm's performance. Furthermore, these results indicate that the min-cost minimum fleet will help small cities to achieve higher efficiency (smaller fleet and less connection time) than large cities. The acceleration of urbanization is driving changes in the transportation system. Our findings are expected to have significant implications for transport planning, resource conservation, and reducing pollution.

AB The roads we travel daily are exposed to several energy sources (mechanical load, solar radiation, heat, air movement, etc.), which can be exploited to make common systems and apparatus for roadways (i.e., lighting, video surveillance, and traffic monitoring systems) energetically autonomous. For decades, research groups have developed many technologies able to scavenge energy from the said sources related to roadways: electromagnetism, piezoelectric and triboelectric harvesters for the cars' stress and vibrations, photovoltaic modules for sunlight, thermoelectric solutions and pyroelectric materials for heat and wind turbines optimized for low-speed winds, such as the ones produced by moving vehicles. Thus, this paper explores the existing technologies for scavenging energy from sources available on roadways, both natural and related to vehicular transit. At first, to contextualize them within the application scenario, the available energy sources and transduction mechanisms were identified and described, arguing the main requirements that must be considered for developing harvesters applicable on roadways. Afterward, an overview of energy harvesting solutions presented in the scientific literature to recover energy from roadways is introduced, classifying them according to the transduction method (i.e., piezoelectric, triboelectric, electromagnetic, photovoltaic, etc.) and proposed system architecture. Later, a survey of commercial systems available on the market for scavenging energy from roadways is introduced, focusing on their architecture, performance, and installation methods. Lastly, comparative analyses are offered for each device category (i.e., scientific works and commercial products), providing insights to identify the most promising solutions and technologies for developing future self-sustainable smart roads.

AB Fog computing, which is an extension of cloud computing is one of the cornerstone for Internet of Things, that witnessed rapid growth because of its ability to enhance several difficult problems such as network congestion, latency, and the lack of regional autonomy. However, privacy concerns and the resulting inefficiency are causing the performance of fog computing to suffer. While suffering from poisoning attacks, the vast majority of current works do not take into consideration of proper balance between them. Specifically, we present blockchain-enabled secure federated learning in vehicle network (BSFLVN) system model for traffic flow prediction in urban computing to overcome the aforementioned difficulties and narrow the gap. When vehicle devices trade local learning updates, BSFLVN enables them to be exchanged with a blockchain-based global learning model, which is confirmed by miners. To improve accuracy of classification we proposed federated learning-based gated recurrent unit for local model update using FL-GRNN algorithm and global model update using FL-AGG algorithm. The BSFLVN, which is built on top of this, allows autonomous deep learning-based GRU to take place without the need for a centralized authority to maintain the global model and coordinate by using the PoW consensus mechanism of blockchain. For preserving privacy and security of local and global model updates we employ the LDP mechanism. For the analysis of the latency performance of BSFLVN, as well as the derivation of the best block production rate we consider communication, consensus delays, and computing cost. The results of a thorough examination demonstrate that BSFLVN outperforms its competitors in terms of privacy protection, efficiency, and resistance to poisoning attacks, among other areas. Various deadline time iteration process is simulated for result evaluation using Fashion MINIST data in which over 93% of accuracy is obtained.

AB As a promising and noncontact detection technique, machine vision has been widely used in fault diagnosis of substation equipment. The rapid and accurate detection of substation equipment in infrared images is one of the key steps for automatic fault diagnosis. However, the complexity of image background, the low contrast of infrared images, and the rotational targets in infrared images pose a great challenge to detection task. This study aims to improve the detection accuracy of the model while having real-time detection speed and propose a lightweight power equipment detection network (PEDNet) based on You Only Look Once (YOLOv4)-tiny. First, a novel global information aggregation module (GIAM) is constructed to guide the network to focus on the salient regions where the target equipment is located. Second, an improved spatial transformer network (ISTN) is introduced to reduce the impact of rotational targets on detection accuracy. Finally, a feature enhanced fusion network (FEFN) is designed through the use of a multiscale feature cross-fusion structure. It can fully fuse the feature information of the salient region, the rotational targets, and the strong semantic information. The experimental results show that the proposed PEDNet can reach 92.66% detection accuracy and 107.07 frames/s real-time detection speed on the testing datasets. Compared with YOLOv4-tiny, there is a small sacrifice in detection speed, but the detection accuracy is improved and significantly higher than the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) object detection models.

AB Understanding the hidden patterns of tacit communication between drivers and pedestrians is crucial for improving pedestrian safety. However, this type of communication is a result of the psychological processes of both pedestrians and drivers, which are very difficult to understand thoroughly. This study utilizes a naturalistic field study dataset and explores the hidden patterns from successful and failed communication events using a pattern recognition method known as Taxicab Correspondence Analysis (TCA). The successful communication scenarios indicate the combinations of variable attributes such as eye contact, facial expression, the assertion of crossing, and effective traffic control devices are strongly associated with successful scenarios. The patterns for failed scenarios are most likely to be on the roadway with a relatively higher speed limit (e.g., 35 mph) and a relatively lower speed limit (e.g., 15 mph) under different conditions. On roadways with a higher speed limit, the failed scenarios are highly associated with passive and undecisive pedestrians, pedestrians far away from the crosswalk, regardless of pedestrian-driver eye contact and facial expression of the pedestrians. Instead of waiting for pedestrians to making a crossing decision, overspeeding drivers are more likely to speed up and pass the crosswalk. On roadways with a lower speed limit, the failed scenarios are often associated with distracted pedestrians, vehicles having the right of way, and the absence of effective traffic control devices. These findings could help transportation agencies identify appropriate countermeasures to reduce pedestrian crashes. The findings on driver-pedestrian communication patterns could provide scopes for improvement in computer vision-based algorithms designed for autonomous vehicle industries.

AB Deploying long-range autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) mid-water column in the deep ocean is one of the most challenging applications for these submersibles. Without external support and speed over the ground measurements, dead-reckoning (DR) navigation inevitably experiences an error proportional to the mission range and the speed of the water currents. In response to this problem, a computationally feasible and low-power terrain-aided navigation (TAN) system is developed. A Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter robust to estimation divergence is designed to estimate the vehicle's position and the speed of water currents. To evaluate performance, field data from multiday AUV deployments in the Southern Ocean are used. These form a unique test case for assessing the TAN performance under extremely challenging conditions. Despite the use of a small number of low-power sensors and a Doppler velocity log to enable TAN, the algorithm limits the localisation error to within a few hundreds of metres, as opposed to a DR error of 40 km, given a 50 m resolution bathymetric map. To evaluate further the effectiveness of the system under a varying map quality, grids of 100, 200, and 400 m resolution are generated by subsampling the original 50 m resolution map. Despite the high complexity of the navigation problem, the filter exhibits robust and relatively accurate behaviour. Given the current aim of the oceanographic community to develop maps of similar resolution, the results of this study suggest that TAN can enable AUV operations of the order of months using global bathymetric models.

AB The environmental perception system is the foundation of unmanned driving systems and also the fundamental guarantee of the safety and intelligence of unmanned vehicles. The obstacle hazard identification technology is the core of the environment perception system, and it is also the basic condition for the autonomous driving of unmanned vehicles. In view of the complexity of obstacle danger identification, this research paper designs an improved Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) Algorithm for hazard recognition of obstacles in unmanned scenes through a systematic approach. First, it highlights the significance of morphological component analysis in identifying non-smooth regions within images where obstacles are likely to be present. Second, it introduces a novel approach for core point definition by identifying an optimal MinDensity value based on the curvature of the density distribution curve. Third, it addresses variations in density sequences through smoothing and normalization. Finally, it constructs an improved DBSCAN Algorithm for hazard recognition of obstacles in unmanned scenes. It addresses limitations in the traditional DBSCAN by refining the core point definition using an adaptive density threshold. It identifies the "elbow point" in density distribution, enhancing its ability to distinguish density states. Additionally, it incorporates density curve smoothing, normalization, and a merger step for handling stationary objects. The results show that it has high accuracy (95.6%), precision (96.3%), recall (94.5%), and F-Score (95.4%), as well as increased consistency (92.5%) and dependability (93.2%). It also has fast real-time data processing, lasting only 0.12 s, making it an excellent choice for obstacle detection and unmanned hazard avoidance.

AB The essence of connection in vehicle network is the social relationship between people, and thus Vehicular Social Networks (VSNs), characterized by social aspects and features, can be formed. The information collected by VSNs can be used for context prediction of autonomous vehicles. Multivariate relations are common in square connected relations caused by geographic characteristics in VSNs. They can effectively reflect the high-order structural features of the network dataset. It is necessary to exploit the multivariate relations of VSNs to improve the performance of context prediction. However, The representation of entity-relationes in the network often adopts a binary form, and the existing graph learning methods rely on the neighborhood information of nodes to achieve the aggregation or diffusion of information. Using this to represent multivariate relations will result in partial omissions or even complete loss of valuable information, which ultimately affects the learning effect of learning methods. In order to better understand the social behavior of the VSNs, this paper uses the network motif to implement the representation of the multivariate relations in the network, and proposes the graPh learnIng with moTif mAtrix (PITA) method. This method can be used as a preprocessing step for the measurement strategy of the relations in VSNs and the graph learning, which can mine the information in VSNs and improve the accuracy of the original graph learning method by the multivariate relation information. We performed experiments on 6 network datasets. The experimental results show that in the node classification task, the baseline method modified by the PITA method has a higher classification accuracy than the original method.

AB Since remote sensing images of post-fire vegetation are characterized by high resolution, multiple interferences, and high similarities between the background and the target area, it is difficult for existing methods to detect and segment the burned area in these images with sufficient speed and accuracy. In this article, we apply salient object detection (SOD) to burned area segmentation (BAS), the first time this has been done, and propose an efficient burned area segmentation network (BASNet) to improve the performance of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) high-resolution image segmentation. BASNet comprises positioning module and refinement module. The positioning module efficiently extracts high-level semantic features and general contextual information via global average pooling layer and convolutional block (CB) to determine the coarse location of the salient region. The refinement module adopts the CB attention module to effectively discriminate the spatial location of objects. In addition, to effectively combine edge information with spatial location information in the lower layer of the network and the high-level semantic information in the deeper layer, we design the residual fusion module to perform feature fusion by level to obtain the prediction results of the network. Extensive experiments on two UAV datasets collected from Chongli in China and Andong in South Korea, demonstrate that our proposed BASNet significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art SOD methods quantitatively and qualitatively. BASNet also achieves a promising prediction speed for processing high-resolution UAV images, thus providing wide-ranging applicability in post-disaster monitoring and management.

AB The rapid advancement of the Internet of Things is expected to play a critical role in future intelligent transportation systems. This technology utilizes advanced information and communication technologies to enhance the operational capabilities of the vehicles and is often referred to as IoAV. More importantly, the increasing usage of sensors and other technologies generates vast amounts of data and information to be exchanged between AVs. Since the wireless connectivity between AVs is constantly expanding, the transmission of data is expected to pose several challenges to the conventional wireless networks, including resource utilization, network optimization, quality of service, and so on. To overcome these challenges, software-defined networking (SDN) has emerged as a powerful technology. This article presents a composite architecture named SD- IoAV for the integration of SDN with IoAV. This integration is not straightforward because SD-IoAV is geographically dispersed by nature. An efficient technique to manage the underlying communications is to deploy multiple SDN controllers across the widely dispersed SDN domains. This is referred to as the controller placement problem (CPP). Thus, the primary focus of this work is to explore CPP in the context of SD-IoAV as a special case of energy minimization and load balancing under latency restrictions. In this context, for large networks, the number of variables increases exponentially, which in turn escalates the complexity of the problem manifold. Hence, to deduce a near optimal solution for large networks, a heuristic approach based on the incremental expansion of candidate space is proposed. The simulation results have been carried out in MATLAB, and the obtained results show that the proposed scheme attains higher energy savings and better load capacity management compared to an existing technique, that is, improved performance by 18.73 and 9.42 percent, respectively.

AB In the deep sea, biological data are often sparse; hence models capturing relationships between observed fauna and environmental variables (acquired via acoustic mapping techniques) are often used to produce full coverage species assemblage maps. Many statistical modelling techniques are being developed, but there remains a need to determine the most appropriate mapping techniques. Predictive habitat modelling approaches (redundancy analysis, maximum entropy and random forest) were applied to a heterogeneous section of seabed on Rockall Bank, NE Atlantic, for which landscape indices describing the spatial arrangement of habitat patches were calculated. The predictive maps were based on remotely operated vehicle (ROV) imagery transects high-resolution autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) side scan backscatter maps. Area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy indicated similar performances for the three models tested, but performance varied by species assemblage, with the transitional species assemblage showing the weakest predictive performances. Spatial predictions of habitat suitability differed between statistical approaches, but niche similarity metrics showed redundancy analysis and random forest predictions to be most similar. As one statistical technique could not be found to outperform the others when all assemblages were considered, ensemble mapping techniques, where the outputs of many models are combined, were applied. They showed higher accuracy than any single model. Different statistical approaches for predictive habitat modelling possess varied strengths and weaknesses and by examining the outputs of a range of modelling techniques and their differences, more robust predictions, with better described variation and areas of uncertainties, can be achieved. As improvements to prediction outputs can be achieved without additional costly data collection, ensemble mapping approaches have clear value for spatial management. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB This paper addresses the problem of estimating the 3D trajectory and associated uncertainty of an underwater autonomous vehicle from a set of images of the seabed taken by an onboard camera. The presented algorithms resort to the use of video mosaics and build upon previous work on image registration and visual pose estimation. The pose estimation is accomplished in two steps. Firstly, a video mosaic is created automatically, covering a region of interest of the seabed. Then, after associating a 3D referential for the mosaic, the estimation of the camera position from a new view of the scene becomes possible.
   The main contribution of this paper lies on the assessment of the performance of the 3D pose algorithms. In order to do this, an image sequence with available ground-truth is used for precise error measuring. A first-order error propagation analysis is presented, relating the uncertainty in the location of the match points with the uncertainty in the pose parameters. The importance of predicting the estimate uncertainty is emphasized by the fact that it can be used for comparing algorithms and for the on-line monitoring of the vehicle trajectory reconstruction quality.
   Several iterative and non-iterative pose estimation methods are discussed, differing both on the criteria being minimized and on the required information about the camera intrinsic parameters. This information ranges from the full knowledge of the parameters, to the case where they are estimated using self-calibration from an image sequence under pure rotation. The implemented pose algorithms are compared for the accuracy and estimate covariance. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Visible light communication (VLC) has emerged as a promising communication method in the special field of 6G, such as intersatellite communication (ISC) and underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC). Green light-emitting diode (LED)-based underwater visible light communication (VLC) is considered a potential candidate for UWOC of mobile autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and remotely operated underwater vehicle, particularly in coastal and harbor environments. However, due to bandwidth limitations and variable underwater channels, implementing high-speed underwater VLC remains a challenge. In this paper, a neural network-based auto equalization model (NNAEM) using end-to-end learning is proposed to achieve a high-speed underwater VLC link with a bandwidth-limited green LED. The entire NNAEM includes a neural network-based channel model, a pre-equalization neural network, and a post-equalization neural network. Based on the data-driven channel model, our auto equalization (AE) method can dynamically pre-equalize the discrete multitone (DMT) modulated signal in different bandwidth-limited cases and various nonlinearity cases. An underwater VLC link with a data rate of 3.451 Gbps and a transmission distance of 1.2 m is experimentally demonstrated by employing the proposed NNAEM under the hard decision-forward error correction (HD-FEC) threshold of 3.8 x 10(-3). The data rate improvement is up to 30.4% compared to other advanced digital signal processing (DSP) methods. The scenario adaptation and robustness of the NNAEM are also verified in the experiments, which demonstrate that the NNAEM can serve an important role in underwater high-speed VLC transmission.

AB A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided air-to-ground uplink non-orthogonal transmission framework is investigated for next generation multiple access. Occupying the same spectrum resource, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) users and ground users (GUs) are connected to terrestrial cellular networks via the uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) protocol. As the flight safety is important for employing UAVs in civil airspace, the collision avoidance mechanism has to be considered during the flight. Therefore, a joint optimization problem of the UAV trajectory design, RIS configuration, and uploading power control is formulated for maximizing the network sum rate, while ensuring the UAV's fight safety and satisfying the minimum data rate requirements of both the UAV and GU. The resultant problem is a sequential decision making one across multiple coherent time slots. Besides, the unknown locations of obstacles bring uncertainties into the decision making process. To tackle this challenging problem, a sample-efficient deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is proposed to optimize the UAV trajectory, RIS configuration, and power control simultaneously. Moreover, considering the ambiguous uncertainties in the environment, a distributionally robust DRL algorithm is further proposed to provide the worst-case performance guarantee. Numerical results demonstrate that the two proposed DRL algorithms outperform the conventional ones in terms of learning efficiency and robustness. It is also shown that the network sum rate is significantly improved by the proposed RIS-NOMA scheme compared to the conventional RIS-orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme and the case where no RIS is deployed.

AB We live in the era of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), which is an extension of Vehicular AdHoc Networks (VANETs). In VANETs, vehicles act as nodes connected with each other and sometimes with a public station. Vehicles continuously exchange and collect information to provide innovative transportation services; for example, traffic management, navigation, autonomous driving, and the generation of alerts. However, VANETs are extremely challenging for data collection, due to their high mobility and dynamic network topologies that cause frequent link disruptions and make path discovery difficult. In this survey, various state-of-the-art data collection protocols for VANETs are discussed, based on three broad categories, i.e., delay-tolerant, best-effort, and real-time protocols. A taxonomy is designed for data collection protocols for VANETs that is essential to add precision and ease of understandability. A detailed comparative analysis among various data collection protocols is provided to highlight their functionalities and features. Protocols are evaluated based on three parametric phases. First, protocols investigation based on six necessary parameters, including delivery and drop ratio, efficiency, and recovery strategy. Second, a 4-D functional framework is designed to fit most data collection protocols for quick classification and mobility model identification, thus eradicating the need to read extensive literature. In the last, in-depth categorical mapping is performed to deep dive for better and targeted interpretation. In addition, some open research challenges for ITS and VANETs are discussed to highlight research gaps. Our work can thus be employed as a quick guide for researchers to identify the technical relevance of data collection protocols of VANETs.

AB Autonomous vision-based taxi, takeoff, and landing systems are gaining popularity in fixed-wing commercial, military, and unmanned aerial vehicles presenting new technical and regulatory challenges. With ongoing advances in deep learning, machine learning, and big data management, the dangers of takeoff and landing operations have greatly decreased, and with less dependence on simultaneous and complex controllers. However, in a real-world scenario, airport runway detection for takeoff and landing operations is still deemed challenging, due to the vast amount of contextual information, complex backgrounds, and dangerous geographical scenarios. In this work, we propose an end-to-end airport runway detection network for automatic runway detection and localization centered on a two-stage region-based convolutional neural network that could significantly improve navigation efficiency and dependence on complex control systems. The first stage is an enhanced region proposal network with domain-specific constraints added, which automatically learns and extracts multiscale (high, mid, and low-level) features using a deep convolutional neural network and filters low-quality positive samples for robust runway detection. The second stage classifies the candidate regions and determines the precise localization of predictions using an enhanced anchor refinement and regression algorithm with a nonmaximum suppression function for bounding box optimization. Transfer learning and data augmentation techniques are used to propagate relevant domain-specific semantic and context information during the training phase to handle the problem of imbalances in the dataset classes. The results show the effectiveness of our algorithmic contributions as well as the benefits of the specific enhancements, in terms of, improved efficiency and accuracy of runway detection in remote sensing images.

AB Synthetic jets, often abbreviated as "SJs" or "Synjets," are a type of zero net mass flux (ZNMF) jets, which have gained popularity due to their ability to transfer momentum without transferring mass. This property distinguishes SJs from their counterpart traditional continuous jets. Over a stretch of time, SJs have been employed extensively in applications such as active flow control, impingement heat transfer, and miniature electronics cooling. However, researchers are now slowly extending the frontiers of SJ research and making efforts to utilize excellent properties of SJs in novel applications such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), marine systems, and bio-inspired propulsion systems. This paper strives to identify the gaps in the current research and the areas that have remained unexplored yet. The article begins with a brief discussion of the origin of SJs, i.e., "acoustic streaming." Resulting segments talk about the formation criteria and the recent works employing various configurations of orifices and cavities. The paper discusses the critical concepts such as jet impact factor, volumetric efficiency, and propulsive efficiency of synthetic jets. It is followed by introduction of novel flow control systems employing SJs such as gurney flaps, bumps, and electro-active synthetic jets. Finally, the most innovative applications of SJs such as AUVs, unmanned air vehicles, and jetting cavities are also brought out. Pulsatile jet flows found in jellyfish, cephalopod, squid, and salp have been discussed in great detail. The exhaustive discussion on future prospects strives to not only provide the reader with the comprehensive insights into SJs, but also to motivate future researchers to overcome the gaps identified in this paper.

AB The booming self-driving cars need to understand the behaviors of other road users for better performance. Recognizing pedestrians' crossing intentions is one of the most critical capabilities of self-driving cars to guarantee safe operations in the urban environment. Some researchers try to predict the future trajectories of pedestrians to avoid a potential collision. Others extract skeleton features from pedestrians to detect specific actions related to the crossing intention. All these methods either neglect the abundant appearance information of pedestrians, or work poorly under severe conditions, e.g., pedestrians standing far away, dim light, and occlusions. In this work, a pedestrian crossing intention recognition (PCIR) framework is proposed to recognize pedestrians' crossing intention. A module for searching targets of interest is introduced to find the pedestrians who are likely to cross the streets, and perform scene perception simultaneously. An action recognition module utilizes a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically extract spatiotemporal features that imply early actions before crossing, like limb movements. A distance encoding module makes full use of the contextual cues, e.g., distances between pedestrians and the oncoming vehicle, local traffic scenes around pedestrians, and vehicle speeds, to improve the recognition accuracy obtained from the action recognition module only. Finally, the PCIR framework fuses these factors to predict pedestrians' crossing intentions by minimizing a focal loss. Experimental evaluations verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in recognizing pedestrians' crossing intentions. Comparisons with the skeleton-based methods reveal the robustness of the PCIR framework in the urban environment.

AB Driverless buses are expected to play a vital role in the future, and better public acceptance will provide a social foundation for its development. In this study, two new variables, personal innovativeness (PI) and perceived risk (PR), were incorporated into the integrated technology acceptance model (UTAUT, unified theory of acceptance and use of technology) to construct an extended model, which was then applied to explore the influencing factors for the public acceptance of driverless buses. The quality of this extended model was verified through survey data collected in Chongqing, China. The structural equation modeling (SEM) method was adopted to quantitatively describe the impact of each factor on acceptance intention (AI) as well as the mutual influence relationships between the factors. The moderating effects of demographic attributes (gender, age, and education level) on each factor in the model were also analyzed. The results showed that PI and PR are the most critical factors that affect the public's acceptance intention; effort expectancy (EE), performance expectancy (PE), social influence (SI), and facilitating condition (FC) can also determine the acceptance intention to a certain extent; gender, age, and education level have exhibited significantly different moderating effects on the influencing factors. The explanatory power of the current research model for acceptance intention has reached 48%. This study has confirmed the applicability of the extended UTAUT model to the research of driverless bus acceptance and the research outcomes can serve as a reference basis for improving the service quality of driverless buses in China.

AB The simultaneous growth of textual data and the advancements within Text Analytics enables organisations to exploit this kind of unstructured data, and tap into previously hidden knowledge. However, the utilisation of this valuable resource is still insufficiently unveiled in terms of transport policy decision-making. This research aims to further examine the potential of textual big data analytics in transportation through a real-life case study. The case study, framed together with the Danish Road Directorate or Vejdirektoratet, was designed to assess public opinion towards the adoption of driverless cars in Denmark. Traditionally, the opinion of the public has often been captured by means of surveys for the problem owner. Our study provides demonstrations in which opinion towards the adoption of driverless cars is examined through the analysis of newspaper articles and tweets using topic modelling, document classification, and sentiment analysis. In this way, the research attends to the collective as well as individualised characteristics of public opinion. The analyses establish that Text Analytics may be used as a complement to surveys, in order to extract additional knowledge which may not be captured through the use of surveys. In this regard, the Danish Road Directorate could find the usefulness while understanding the barriers in the results generated from our study, for supplementing their future data collection strategies. However there are also some methodological limitations that need to be addressed before a broader adoption of textual big data analytics for transport policy decision-making may take place.

AB In this paper, we present a novel onboard robust visual algorithm for long-term arbitrary 2D and 3D object tracking using a reliable global-local object model for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications, e.g., autonomous tracking and chasing a moving target. The first main approach in this novel algorithm is the use of a global matching and local tracking approach. In other words, the algorithm initially finds feature correspondences in a way that an improved binary descriptor is developed for global feature matching and an iterative Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm is employed for local feature tracking. The second main module is the use of an efficient local geometric filter (LGF), which handles outlier feature correspondences based on a new forward-backward pairwise dissimilarity measure, thereby maintaining pairwise geometric consistency. In the proposed LGF module, a hierarchical agglomerative clustering, i.e., bottom-up aggregation, is applied using an effective single-link method. The third proposed module is a heuristic local outlier factor (to the best of our knowledge, it is utilized for the first time to deal with outlier features in a visual tracking application), which further maximizes the representation of the target object in which we formulate outlier feature detection as a binary classification problem with the output features of the LGF module. Extensive UAV flight experiments show that the proposed visual tracker achieves real-time frame rates of more than thirty-five frames per second on an i7 processor with 640 x 512 image resolution and outperforms the most popular state-of-the-art trackers favorably in terms of robustness, efficiency and accuracy.

AB As a crucial component of the autonomous driving task, the vehicle target detection algorithm directly impacts driving safety, particularly in inclement weather situations, where the detection precision and speed are significantly decreased. This paper investigated the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm and proposed an enhanced YOLOv4 for real-time target detection in inclement weather conditions. The algorithm uses the Anchor-free approach to tackle the problem of YOLO preset anchor frame and poor fit. It better adapts to the detected target size, making it suitable for multi-scale target identification. The improved FPN network transmits feature maps to unanchored frames to expand the model's sensory field and maximize the utilization of model feature data. Decoupled head detecting head to increase the precision of target category and location prediction. The experimental dataset BDD-IW was created by extracting specific labeled photos from the BDD100K dataset and fogging some of them to test the proposed method's practical implications in terms of detection precision and speed in Inclement weather conditions. The proposed method is compared to advanced target detection algorithms in this dataset. Experimental results indicated that the proposed method achieved a mean average precision of 60.3%, which is 5.8 percentage points higher than the original YOLOv4; the inference speed of the algorithm is enhanced by 4.5 fps compared to the original, reaching a real-time detection speed of 69.44 fps. The robustness test results indicated that the proposed model has considerably improved the capacity to recognize targets in inclement weather conditions and has achieved high precision in real-time detection.

AB The integrated navigation system, comprising a strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) and a laser doppler velocimeter (LDV), is a promising solution for autonomous terrestrial navigation due to its high autonomy. Pitch-independent LDV (PI-LDV) is widely used because of its high-velocity measurement accuracy, small size, and independence from the vehicle pitch. However, the current use of PI-LDV is limited to the use of its 1-D velocity, neglecting the use of its two subvelocities. This article proposes three calibration models based on the two subvelocities of PI-LDV, which can obtain accurate 2-D velocity information of PI-LDV. First, a loosely integrated calibration model is proposed based on the traditional calibration model for PI-LDV and the 2-D velocity derived from the two subvelocities of PI-LDV. This model performs analytical coarse calibration before the filtering calibration. Second, a tightly integrated calibration model is proposed that directly estimates the error of the included angle between the two PI-LDV beams, since there is a strict mathematical relationship between the 2-D velocity and the included angle. Third, an ultratightly integrated calibration model is proposed that uses the two original beam measurements of the PI-LDV and introduces a third virtual beam information. Two groups of vehicle tests were carried out and the results verified that the accuracy of the corresponding integrated navigation of the three models proposed in this article is much better than the traditional scheme, especially in height estimation. Moreover, the ultratightly integrated calibration model has the best calibration effect among the three proposed models.

AB In recent years, verification and validation processes of automated driving systems have been increasingly moved to virtual simulation, as this allows for rapid prototyping and the use of a multitude of testing scenarios compared to on-road testing. However, in order to support future approval procedures for automated driving functions with virtual simulations, the models used for this purpose must be sufficiently accurate to be able to test the driving functions implemented in the complete vehicle model. In recent years, the modelling of environment sensor technology has gained particular interest, since it can be used to validate the object detection and fusion algorithms in Model-in-the-Loop testing. In this paper, a practical process is developed to enable a systematic evaluation for perception-sensor models on a low-level data basis. The validation framework includes, first, the execution of test drive runs on a closed highway; secondly, the re-simulation of these test drives in a precise digital twin; and thirdly, the comparison of measured and simulated perception sensor output with statistical metrics. To demonstrate the practical feasibility, a commercial radar-sensor model (the ray-tracing based RSI radar model from IPG) was validated using a real radar sensor (ARS-308 radar sensor from Continental). The simulation was set up in the simulation environment IPG CarMaker(R) 8.1.1, and the evaluation was then performed using the software package Mathworks MATLAB(R). Real and virtual sensor output data on a low-level data basis were used, which thus enables the benchmark. We developed metrics for the evaluation, and these were quantified using statistical analysis.

AB A civil aircraft scaled demonstrator is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) obtained by reducing the geometry of a civil aircraft by an equal scale and simplifying the airframe and airborne subsystems. Due to the low development cost and flight risk of scaled demonstrators, flight tests with demonstrators are an attractive way to assess the reliability and effectiveness of new configurations and/or technologies available for civil aircraft. Nevertheless, engineers still hope to reduce the development cycles and costs of demonstrators to evaluate their multiple civil aircraft design solutions through flight tests in a short period of time. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is a formalized requirement and architecture modeling method which is a useful tool in aircraft design. However, no existing MBSE framework has been found suitable for the development of demonstrators due to their unique features. In this paper, an MBSE approach for civil aircraft scaled demonstrator is proposed based on the MagicGrid methodology and the existing technical process for the demonstrator. This approach formalizes the requirement analysis and architecting for demonstrators via system modeling language (SysML). Meanwhile, the stakeholders of civil aircraft scaled demonstrators are identified, and a requirement ontology and modeling standard are established according to existing demonstrator development practice. Then, a case study is performed through a hybrid power demonstrator which carries a hydrogen fuel cell as the main power supply, a set of solar cells, and two lithium cells. The requirement traceability and verifiability are examined, and a logic simulation is executed for architecture, which shows the feasibility of applying the MBSE approach for the development of civil aircraft scaled demonstrators.

AB Mobile network operators are interested in providing Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication services using their cellular infrastructure. Regional split of operators is one possible approach to support multi-operator infrastructure-based cellular V2V communication. In this approach, a geographical area is divided into non-overlapping regions, each one served by a unique operator. Its main drawback is the communication interruption motivated by the inter-operator handover in border areas, which prevents the fulfillment of the maximum end-to-end (E2E) latency requirements of fifth generation (5G) V2V services related to autonomous driving. In this work, we enable a fast inter-operator handover based on the pre-registration of the users on multiple operators, which substantially reduces the handover time to guarantee maximum E2E latency values of 100 ms in non-congested scenarios. To further reduce the latency of time-critical services to always less than 70 ms, even with the handover interruption time, while providing a latency around 20 ms in the majority of locations, we propose to complement the former technique with a mobile edge computing approach. Our proposal consists in the localization of application servers and broadcasting entities in all the base stations, to avoid the communication through the core network, together with the use of a new set of nodes in the base stations of cross-border areas called inter-operator relays, to minimize the communication latency between operators. Based on analytic and simulation results, it is demonstrated that the proposed techniques are effective to support low-latency infrastructure-based cellular V2V communications in multi-operator environments with regional split.

AB The scene rigidity is a strong assumption in typical visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) algorithms. Such strong assumption limits the usage of most vSLAM in dynamic real-world environments, which are the target of several relevant applications such as augmented reality, semantic mapping, unmanned autonomous vehicles, and service robotics. Many solutions are proposed that use different kinds of semantic segmentation methods (e.g., Mask R-CNN, SegNet) to detect dynamic objects and remove outliers. However, as far as we know, such kind of methods wait for the semantic results in the tracking thread in their architecture, and the processing time depends on the segmentation methods used. In this paper, we present RDS-SLAM, a real-time visual dynamic SLAM algorithm that is built on ORB-SLAM3 and adds a semantic thread and a semantic-based optimization thread for robust tracking and mapping in dynamic environments in real-time. These novel threads run in parallel with the others, and therefore the tracking thread does not need to wait for the semantic information anymore. Besides, we propose an algorithm to obtain as the latest semantic information as possible, thereby making it possible to use segmentation methods with different speeds in a uniform way. We update and propagate semantic information using the moving probability, which is saved in the map and used to remove outliers from tracking using a data association algorithm. Finally, we evaluate the tracking accuracy and real-time performance using the public TUM RGB-D datasets and Kinect camera in dynamic indoor scenarios.

AB Moving-objects detection is a critical ability for an autonomous vehicle. Facing the high detection requirements and the slow target-extraction problem of a common camera, this article proposes to utilize neuromorphic vision sensor (DVS) for detecting the moving objects and estimating their movement states. For a better detection work, the DVS image's noise points are filtered and the CTRV kinematics model is built in advance. In order to distinguish the overlapped or nearby bodies and get the accurate clustering number, this article proposes a 3-D improved K-means method. As the clustering centers can be influenced by the movement easily, the moving objects' clustering centers appear unstable, so the movement estimation also fluctuates. In order to obtain stable movement estimation, this article proposes a strong tracking center differential external Kalman filter (SCDEKF) to track the moving objects, and the method has higher accuracy and less computational load. In order to verify the advantages of proposed methods, a simulation environment was established in the Gazebo, and the common cameras were also added in simulation for comparison with the DVS sensor. The simulation results show that the 3-D improved K-means method with DVS can cluster the moving objects accurately, and the SCDEKF can provide more accurate movement estimation than the traditional EKF method. Finally, two experiments were conducted to prove the methods' superiority. The main contribution is to solve the exploitation problems faced by the short-term borne sensor and promote its application in transportation.

AB This paper investigates autonomous dynamic soaring maneuvers for a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (sUAV) having the capability to morph. Dynamic soaring for UAVs have mostly been confined in literature to fixed configurations. In order to analyze the extent to which dynamic soaring is influenced by different morphologies, an innovative concept of integrating dynamic soaring with morphing capabilities is introduced. Moreover, optimal soaring trajectories are generated for two basic wing morphologies: variable sweep and variable span. Three-dimensional point-mass UAV equations of motion and nonlinear wind gradient profile are used to model the flight dynamics. Parametric characterization of the key performance parameters is performed to determine the optimal platform configuration during various phases of the maneuver. Results presented in this paper indicate 15% lesser required wind shear by the proposed span morphology and 14% lesser required wind shear by the proposed sweep morphology, in comparison to their respective fixed wing counterparts. This shows that the morphing UAV can perform dynamic soaring in an environment, where fixed configuration UAVs might not, because of lesser available wind shears. Apart from this, span morphology reduced drag by 15%, lift requirement by 11% and angle of attack requirement by 20%, whereas increased the maximum velocity by 6.2%, normalized energies by 9% and improved loitering parameters (approximately 10%), in comparison to fixed span configurations. Similarly, sweep morphology guaranteed 20% drag reduction, 16% lesser angle of attack requirement and improved loitering performance over the fixed sweep configurations. The results achieved from this study strongly support the idea of integrating dynamic soaring with morphing capabilities and its potential benefits. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Multibeam (1 m resolution) and side scan data collected from an autonomous underwater vehicle, and lava samples, radiocarbon-dated sediment cores, and observations of flow contacts collected by remotely operated vehicle were combined to reconstruct the geologic history and flow emplacement processes on Axial Seamount's summit and upper rift zones. The maps show 52 post-410 CE lava flows and 20 precaldera lava flows as old as 31.2 kyr, the inferred age of the caldera. Clastic deposits 1-2 m thick accumulated on the rims postcaldera. Between 31 ka and 410 CE, there are no known lava flows near the summit. The oldest postcaldera lava (410 CE) is a pillow cone SE of the caldera. Two flows erupted on the W rim between similar to 800 and 1000 CE. From 1220 to 1300 CE, generally small eruptions of plagioclase phyric, depleted, mafic lava occurred in the central caldera and on the east rim. Larger post-1400 CE eruptions produced inflated lobate flows of aphyric, less-depleted, and less mafic lava on the upper rift zones and in the N and S caldera. All caldera floor lava flows, and most uppermost rift zone flows, postdate 1220 CE. Activity shifted from the central caldera to the upper S rift outside the caldera, to the N rift and caldera floor, and then to the S caldera and uppermost S rift, where two historical eruptions occurred in 1998 and 2011. The average recurrence interval deduced from the flows erupted over the last 800 years is statistically identical to the 13 year interval between historical eruptions.

AB In this article, we propose a framework for energy efficient trajectory design of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based portable access point (PAP) deployed to serve a set of ground nodes (GNs). In addition to the PAP and GNs, the system consists of a set of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) mounted on man-made structures to increase the number of bits transmitted per Joule of energy consumed measured as the global energy efficiency (GEE). The GEE trajectory for the PAP is designed by considering the UAV propulsion energy consumption and the Peukert effect of the PAP battery, which represents an accurate battery discharge profile as a non-linear function of the UAV power consumption profile. The GEE trajectory design problem is solved in two phases: in the first, a path for the PAP and feasible positions for the IRS modules are found using a multi-tier circle packing method, and the required IRS phase shift values are calculated using an alternate optimization method that considers the interdependence between the amplitude and phase responses of an IRS element; in the second phase, the PAP flying velocity and user scheduling are calculated using a novel multi-lap trajectory design algorithm. Numerical evaluations show that: neglecting the Peukert effect overestimates the available flight time of the PAP; after a certain threshold, increasing the battery size reduces the available flight time of the PAP; the presence of IRS modules improves the GEE of the system compared to other baseline scenarios; the multi-lap trajectory saves more energy compared to a single-lap trajectory developed using a combination of sequential convex programming and Dinkelbach algorithm.

AB Additive Manufacturing (AM) methods in the construction industry typically employ ground-based deposition methods. An alternative to transform the role of AM in construction is to introduce an aerial capability. A recent project titled Aerial Additive Manufacturing (AAM), the first AM system to use untethered, unmanned aerial vehicles (or 'drones'), has demonstrated the 3D-printing of cementitious materials during flight. An autonomous aerial system would minimise requirements for working at height, thus reducing safety risks and release AM from ground-based constraints. This study investigates viscous cementitious mortars for AAM. To assess workability and buildability, a robotic arm representing UAV movement in three-dimensional space moved a lightweight deposition device to extrude multiple layers. Constituents such as Pulverised Fuel-Ash, Silica fume, polyol resin, limeX70 and Polypropylene fibres were added to cement-based material mixes. Sand:binder ratios were a maximum of 1.00 and Water:binder ratios ranged from 0.33-0.47. Workability and buildability of mixes were evaluated using performance parameters such as power required for extrusion, number of layers successfully extruded, the extent of deformation of extruded layers and evaluation of mechanical and rheological properties. Rheology tests revealed mortars with a suitable workability-buildability balance possessed a Complex modulus of 3-6 MPa. Mechanical tests showed that resistance to deformation and buildability positively correlate and indicate compressive strengths in excess of 25 MPa. This study has demonstrated that structural cementitious material can be processed by a device light enough to be carried by a UAV to produce an unsupported, coherent multiple-layered object and further demonstrated the feasibility of untethered AAM as an alternative to ground-based AM applications in construction.

AB Energy-saving techniques are vital for the battery-powered sensor devices (SDs), which affect their lifetime. In this paper, we propose an air-and-ground cooperative wireless sensor network (AGWSN), wherein several UAVs are deployed as aerial access points (AAPs) to assist the terrestrial access point (TAP) for data collecting. The positions of the AAPs can be modified to approach the cell-edge SDs, therefore reducing the energy of the SDs expended in uploading data. To fully exploit the potential of the AGWSN, we formulate a joint AAP position optimization, channel allocation, and power control problem to minimize the total power consumption of all SDs subject to their decoding threshold. To solve the formulated problem, we first analyze the optimal user pairing rule in each cell and based on the rule propose a maximum-weighted-independent-set inspired algorithm for the AAP position optimization. Then, we remodel the channel allocation problem as an interference minimization problem and devise a K-CUT based algorithm to solve it. We further propose a low-complex iterative algorithm to obtain the optimal transmission power for each SD. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated via theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. Simulation results indicate that if the intracell and intercell interference are not well coordinated, the superiorities of the AGWSN cannot be developed, and its performance is even worse than the traditional terrestrial network (TTN). Cooperated with our algorithms, the AGWSN significantly outperforms the TTN in terms of total power consumption and probability of successful decoding.

AB Objective The objective of this semi-controlled study was to investigate drivers' performance when resuming control from an Automated Driving System (ADS), simulated through the Wizard of Oz method, in real traffic. Background Research on take-overs has primarily focused on urgent scenarios. This article aims to shift the focus to non-critical take-overs from a system operating in congested traffic situations. Method Twenty drivers drove a selected route in rush-hour traffic in the San Francisco Bay Area, CA, USA. During the drive, the ADS became available when predetermined availability conditions were fulfilled. When the system was active, the drivers were free to engage in non-driving related activities. Results The results show that drivers' transition time goes down with exposure, making it reasonable to assume that some experience is required to regain control with comfort and ease. The novel analysis of after-effects of automated driving on manual driving performance implies that the after-effects were close to negligible. Observational data indicate that, with exposure, a majority of the participants started to engage in non-driving related activities to some extent, but it is unclear how the activities influenced the take-over performance. Conclusion The results indicate that drivers need repeated exposure to take-overs to be able to fully resume manual control with ease. Application Take-over signals (e.g., visuals, sounds, and haptics) should be carefully designed to avoid startle effects and the human-machine interface should provide clear guidance on the required take-over actions.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are in use for surveillance services in the geographic areas, that are very hard and sometimes not reachable by humans. Nowadays, UAVs are being used as substitutions to manned operations in various applications. The intensive utilization of autonomous UAVs has given rise to many new challenges. One of the vital problems that arise while deploying UAVs in surveillance applications is the Coverage Path Planning(CPP) problem. Given a geographic area, the problem is to find an optimal path/tour for the UAV such that it covers the entire area of interest with minimal tour length. A graph can be constructed from the map of the area under surveillance, using computational geometric techniques. In this work, the Coverage Path Planning problem is posed as a Travelling Salesperson Problem(TSP) on these graphs. The graphs obtained are large in number of vertices and edges and the real-time applications require good computation speed. Hence a model is built using Graph Convolution Network (GCN). The model is effectively trained with different problem instances such as TSP20, TSP50, and TSP100. Results obtained from the Concorde Bench-mark Dataset were used to analyze the optimality of the predicted tour length by the GCN. The model is also evaluated against the performance of evolutionary algorithms on several self-constructed graphs. Particle Swarm Optimization, Ant Colony Optimization, and Firefly Algorithm are used to find optimal tours and are compared with GCN. It is found that the proposed GCN framework outperforms these evolutionary algorithms in optimal tour length and also the computation time.

AB This work investigates which conditions lead to co-driver discomfort aside from classical motion sickness, what characterizes uncomfortable situations, and why these conditions have a negative effect. The automobile is called a "passenger vehicle" as its main purpose is the transportation of people. However, passengers in the car are rarely considered in research concerning driving discomfort. The few studies in this area focus on driver discomfort, automated vehicles, or driver assistant systems. An earlier public survey indicated that discomfort is also a relevant problem for co-drivers. In this paper, these results are confirmed and extended through an online questionnaire with N = 119 participants and a detailed follow-up interview study with N = 24 participants was conducted. The results of the online questionnaire show that co-driver discomfort is a widespread problem (88%). The interviews indicate that the driving style is one factor contributing to co-driver discomfort, in particular close following or fast driving. In those situations, participants experienced a feeling of being exposed, which additionally contributed to their discomfort. Uncomfortable situations were also perceived as safety critical. A model for possible cognitive origins of discomfort in co-drivers, extending theories from the areas of stress and self-regulation, is developed based on the results. Co-driver discomfort is a common problem, highlighting the relevance of further research on supporting co-drivers. The reported correlations and the proposed model can help to explain the origin of this discomfort. The results provide a foundation for the future design of interventions like human machine interfaces aiming at reducing co-driver discomfort.

AB In an era of automated driving, steer-by-wire system seems to be an indispensable component for an autonomous vehicle. Among the many problems concerned, steering control of the system may be arguably the most indispensable part that lay the foundation for the system and is essentially a position servo control problem. Traditionally, the most commonly used control loop structures of the position servo system can be classified into two categories, both considering the current control loop as an essential part. However, this is not necessarily true in practical applications. In view of this, control systems with two different types of control loops based on proportional-integral-derivative controllers have been designed and compared in this paper for trajectory tracking of the steer-by-wire system with Coulomb friction. The aim is to explore the essential differences between the two types of control loops and study the effect of current loop on performance of the system. When properly designed, it can be seen that the asymptotic stability of the control system can be guaranteed. However, the system with type I control loop has a faster response speed, whereas the system with type II control loop has a smoother response. Theoretical as well as simulation and experimental results have been provided in detail, which can contribute to the understanding of the two types of control loops and can be used as guidance not only for researchers but also for engineering practice.

AB This article introduces an interpretative approach to the analysis of situations in computational settings called situational analytics. I outline the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of this approach, which is still under development, and show how it can be used to surface situations from large data sets derived from online platforms such as YouTube. Situational analytics extends to computationally-mediated settings a qualitative methodology developed by Adele Clarke, Situational Analysis (2005), which uses data mapping to detect heterogeneous entities in fieldwork data to determine 'what makes a difference' in a situation. Situational analytics scales up this methodology to analyse situations latent in computational data sets with semi-automated methods of textual and visual analysis. I discuss how this approach deviates from recent analyses of situations in computational social science, and argue that Clarke's framework renders tractable a fundamental methodological problem that arises in this area of research: while social researchers turn to computational settings in order to analyse social life, the social processes unfolding in these envirnoments are fundamentally affected by the computational architectures in which they occur. Situational analytics offers a way to address this problematic by making a heterogeneously composed situation - involving social, technical and media elements - the unit of computational analysis. To conclude, I show how situational analytics can be applied in a case study of YouTube videos featuring intelligent vehicles and discuss how situational analysis itself needs to be elaborated if we are to come to terms with computational transformations of the situational fabric of social life.

AB The introduction of cloud condensation nuclei and radiative heating by sunlight-absorbing aerosols can modify the thickness and coverage of low clouds, yielding significant radiative forcing of climate. The magnitude and sign of changes in cloud coverage and depth in response to changing aerosols are impacted by turbulent dynamics of the cloudy atmosphere, but integrated measurements of aerosol solar absorption and turbulent fluxes have not been reported thus far. Here we report such integrated measurements made from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) during the CARDEX (Cloud Aerosol Radiative Forcing and Dynamics Experiment) investigation conducted over the northern Indian Ocean. The UAV and surface data reveal a reduction in turbulent kinetic energy in the surface mixed layer at the base of the atmosphere concurrent with an increase in absorbing black carbon aerosols. Polluted conditions coincide with a warmer and shallower surface mixed layer because of aerosol radiative heating and reduced turbulence. The polluted surface mixed layer was also observed to be more humid with higher relative humidity. Greater humidity enhances cloud development, as evidenced by polluted clouds that penetrate higher above the top of the surface mixed layer. Reduced entrainment of dry air into the surface layer from above the inversion capping the surface mixed layer, due to weaker turbulence, may contribute to higher relative humidity in the surface layer during polluted conditions. Measurements of turbulence are important for studies of aerosol effects on clouds. Moreover, reduced turbulence can exacerbate both the human health impacts of high concentrations of fine particles and conditions favorable for low-visibility fog events.

TI The ExoMars rover locomotion subsystem
SO JOURNAL OF TERRAMECHANICS
LA English
DT Article
AB ExoMars is the European Space Agency (ESA) mission to Mars planned for launch in 2018, focusing on exobiology with the primary objective of searching for any traces of extant or extinct carbon-based micro-organisms. The on-surface mission is performed by a near-autonomous mobile robotic vehicle (also referred to as the rover) with a mission design life of 180 sols. The rover has a 6 x 6 x 6 with 6 wheel-walking drive configuration (all 6 wheels are driven, steered and have a 'walking' capability) and has flexible wheels providing enhanced traction compared to rigid wheels of the same diameter. The suspension is a passive '3-bogie' system which offers the same 6 wheel contact on uneven ground and mobility performance as the NASA-JPL 'rocker-bogie' suspension used on previous Mars rovers, but permits elimination of the differential linkage present in that design. Mars presents several challenges to the rover locomotion subsystem with its rock-strewn surface, sand dunes, rocky outcrops, craters and slopes. The unknown nature of the terrain to be traversed imposes several constraints on the locomotion subsystem design that need to be evaluated and incorporated within the flight model for its successful operation on Mars. In addition, accommodation within the confines of the lander and successful egress from it over deflated airbags places stringent constraints on locomotion subsystem mass, stowage envelope, deployment and wheel design. This paper documents the evolution of the ExoMars rover vehicle locomotion configuration from an early design concept to the current mission baseline design. The discussion involves various tradeoffs supported by mechanical and terramechanical analyses, simulations and testing performed on full-scale locomotion breadboard models at single wheel level and system level.

AB The promise of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) combined with the mobile edge computing (MEC), named MEC-aided-UAV extends the MEC application to offer new flexible, low-latency computing services and considerable utilities for pervasive sensing of the world. In MEC, the UAV with limited on-board energy and computation resources needs to offload its tasks to resource-rich ground base stations (GBSs) servers. Because of the broadcast nature of line-of-sight (LoS) channels, one of the key challenges in task offloading is to guarantee that confidential data is offloaded safely to the GBSs without being intercepted by eavesdroppers (Eves). In this MEC-aided-UAV system, the GBSs help the UAV compute the offloaded tasks and transmit the artificial noise (AN) to suppress the vicious Eves. We make the first attempt to study the maximum-minimum average secrecy capacity problem, including joint optimization of the trajectory and transmit power of the UAV, the transmit power of AN, the local computation ratio, and the selection of GBSs with consideration of the practical constraints of completion delay of the tasks, maximum velocity, and the power consumption. The optimization issue is confirmed as a mixed-integer non-convex problem. Thereafter, a low-complexity iterative algorithm with the block coordinate descent method and successive convex approximation technique is put forward to get its suboptimal solution. In addition, the convergent solution can be achieved by solving the subproblems in turn. Evaluation results validate that the proposed secure offloading scheme significantly effectiveness the baselines by 17.4%-71.2% on the maximum-minimum average secrecy capacity.

AB Traffic self-organizing is controlled autonomously by rules that rely on adaptation to local variations in traffic state and enable effective coordination of the vehicular traffic at a network level. Combined self-organizing network with intelligent transportation, we proposed a distributed self-organizing method for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), which aimed to improve the efficiency and safety between Multiple Adjacent-Ramps (multi-ARs). To make the mainline formation more stable, the speed of ramp vehicles was adjusted to ensure suitable speed and headway of the mainline formation. In the test, the multi-ARs in the East Ring Interchange on the Inner Ring Express in Chongqing was selected to collect the initial data sample by the drones and fixed-point cameras. Under the respective scenarios of conventional driving and intelligent networks, the Python, SUMO, and TraCI were adopted to run simulations and validate the proposed model. Results showed that our model could keep Time to Conflict (TTC) above 1.4s, reduce the average delay by 34.22%, reduce the lane-changing times by 28.07%, reduce single lane occupancy to 8% and improve average speed by 3.68% of multi-ARs. To verify the applicability of the proposed model, experiments were carried out under different traffic volumes, demonstrating the relevance of the proposed method for medium-to-high-density traffic flows. It can provide a basis for traffic engineers and policymakers to maintain the stable development of the urban expressways and ensure the overall operation quality of the multi-ARs.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm consists of a number of autonomous and collaborative UAV nodes. The purpose of the research is to address the hypotheses: an efficient centralized resources management scheme should be adopted to meet the mission-oriented feature of UAV swarms, while a distributed fault-tolerant mechanism should be adopted to meet the characteristics of complex environment and address the issue of high failure rate of UAV nodes. By using an experimental modeling method, this paper proposes a management model and related mechanisms fitting for UAV swarms with the feature of "centralized decision making and distributed task execution." The model allows UAV nodes to manage their own resources autonomously and execute centralized decisions accordingly. The advantage of the model is that the master node of a UAV swarm is able to perceive all the resources of the system and the status of all (or some) of the UAVs efficiently; therefore, it provides a supportive environment for the UAV swarm application to make centralized decisions and optimize those decisions. Additionally, this paper proposes a distributed fault-tolerant model and related mechanisms to address the issue of high failure rate of UAV nodes, as well as the system vulnerability caused by harsh environment. Finally, this study developed a prototype system designed and implemented by OMNeT++ to confirm the truth of the hypotheses. The analysis of the experimental data and simulation results of the prototype validated the feasibility and usability of the distributed fault-tolerant mechanism and demonstrated its value for the mission-oriented UAV swarms.

   Introductory Article of the MDPI Special Issue "Transmission Techniques for 5G and Beyond".
   This article provides an overview of the fifth generation of cellular communications (5G) and beyond. It presents the transmission techniques of current 5G communications and those expected of future developments, namely a brief study of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) using the single carrier with frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE) block transmission technique, evidencing its added value in terms of spectral efficiency. An introduction to the sixth generation of cellular communications (6G) is also provided. The insertion of 5G and 6G within the Fourth Industrial Revolution framework (also known as Industry 4.0) is also dealt with. Consisting of a change in paradigm, when compared to previous generations, 5G supports a myriad of new services based on the Internet of things (IoT) and on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, supporting technologies such as autonomous driving, smart cities, and remote surgery. The new services provided by 5G are supported by new techniques, such as millimeter waves (mm-wave), in addition to traditional microwave communication, and by massive multiple-input multiple-output (m-MIMO) technology. These techniques were not employed in the fourth generation of cellular communications (4G). While 5G plays an important role in the initial implementation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, 6G will address a number of new services such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), holographic services, the advanced Internet of things (IoT), AI-infused applications, wireless brain-computer interaction (BCI), and mobility at higher speeds. The current research on systems beyond 5G indicates that these applications shall be supported by new MIMO techniques and make use of terahertz (THz) bands.

ID ATTITUDE ESTIMATION; DESIGN
AB We address the complete state estimation problem of unmanned aerial vehicles, even under high-dynamic 3-D aerobatic maneuvers, while using low-cost sensors with bias variations and higher levels of noise. In such conditions, the control demand, for a robust real-time data fusion filter with minimal lag and noise, is addressed with the efficiency of a complementary filter scheme. First, the attitude is directly estimated in Special Orthogonal Group (SO(3)) by complementing the noisy accelerometer/magnetometer vector basis with a gyro propagated vector basis. Data fusion follows a least square minimization in SO(3) (Wahba's problem) solved in an analytic nonrecursive manner. Stability of the proposed filter is shown and performance metrics are extracted, whereas the computational complexity has been minimized with an appropriate reference frame and a custom singular value decomposition algorithm. An adaptation scheme is proposed to allow unhindered operation of the filter to erroneous inputs introduced by the high dynamics of a 3-D flight. Finally, the velocity/position estimation is mainly constructed by complementary filters combining multiple sensors. In addition to the low complexity and the filtering of the noise, the proposed observer is aided through a developed vision algorithm, enabling the use of the filter in Global-Positioning-System-denied environments. Extensive experimental results and comparative studies with state-of-the-art filters, either in the laboratory or in the field using high-performance autonomous helicopters, demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme in demanding conditions.

ID 3-D PLACEMENT
AB We propose the intermittently tethered unmanned aerial vehicle (iTUAV) as a trade-off between the power availability of a tethered UAV (TUAV) and flexibility of an untethered UAV. An iTUAV can provide cellular connectivity to an area while being temporarily tethered to the most adequate ground anchor. Also, it can flexibly detach from one anchor, travel, and then attach to another one to maintain and improve the coverage quality for mobile terrestrial users. Hence, we discuss in this article the existing UAV-based cellular networking technologies, followed by a detailed description of the iTUAV system, its components, and mode of operation. Subsequently, we present a comparative study of the existing and proposed systems highlighting the differences of key features, such as mobility and energy availability. To emphasize the potential of iTUAV systems, we conduct a case study, evaluate the iTUAV performance, and compare it to benchmark systems. Obtained results show that with only 10 anchors in the area, the iTUAV system can serve up to 90 percent of the users covered by the untethered UAV swapping system. Moreover, results for a small case study illustrate that the iTUAV system allows to balance performance and cost, as well as be implemented realistically. For instance, when user locations are clustered, the iTUAV system with only two active iTUAVs and four possible anchor locations, outper-forms a system with three TUAVs, while when considering a single UAV on a 100 minutes mission, a system with only six anchors already outperforms a freely flying UAV as it combines location flexibility with increased mission time.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking is of great significance for a wide range of applications, such as delivery and agriculture. Previous benchmarks in this area mainly focused on small-scale tracking problems while ignoring the amounts of data, types of data modalities, diversities of target categories and scenarios, and evaluation protocols involved, greatly hiding the massive power of deep UAV tracking. In this article, we propose WebUAV-3M, the largest public UAV tracking benchmark to date, to facilitate both the development and evaluation of deep UAV trackers. WebUAV-3M contains over 3.3 million frames across 4,500 videos and offers 223 highly diverse target categories. Each video is densely annotated with bounding boxes by an efficient and scalable semi-automatic target annotation (SATA) pipeline. Importantly, to take advantage of the complementary superiority of language and audio, we enrich WebUAV-3M by innovatively providing both natural language specifications and audio descriptions. We believe that such additions will greatly boost future research in terms of exploring language features and audio cues for multi-modal UAV tracking. In addition, a fine-grained UAV tracking-under-scenario constraint (UTUSC) evaluation protocol and seven challenging scenario subtest sets are constructed to enable the community to develop, adapt and evaluate various types of advanced trackers. We provide extensive evaluations and detailed analyses of 43 representative trackers and envision future research directions in the field of deep UAV tracking and beyond. The dataset, toolkits, and baseline results are available at https://github.com/983632847/WebUAV-3M.

AB To guarantee the best driving experience and status of the driver, further improve the driv -ing safety of human-machine co-driving vehicles, reduce the conflict between the driver and controller, and weaken the impact of the driver's uncertain behaviours, a human- machine co-driving system with a dynamic weight allocation model is designed. First, a human-machine co-driving system is built with a fixed allocation coefficient. Evaluation indexes based on the degree of participation of the driver and driving safety are proposed. Subsequently, several important influencing factors affecting weight allocation are anal-ysed, including driving characteristics, driving states, and changes in the controller param-eters. The results show that the impact of these factors can be weakened by the designed system. However, a good driving experience of the driver cannot be guaranteed. In addi-tion, a conflict between the driver and controller still exists. Next, a model of dynamic weight allocation considering the volatility of the driving characteristics and states of the driver is proposed. Further, the human-machine co-driving system is modified by consid-ering the influence of changes in controller parameters and external interference. Finally, the validity of the designed model of dynamic weight allocation and the modified system were verified by simulation. The results show that the modified system could improve the driving experience and safety better than a system with a fixed allocation coefficient. In addition, the modified system has a better anti-interference ability and lower sensitivity to interference. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The high reliability of modern engineering systems is achieved by performing predictive maintenance. Mathematical models based on stochastic timed colored Petri nets are an effective tool for developing complex production processes for Industry 4.0. This article discusses the maintainability evaluation used in hierarchical Petri net models. The hierarchical simulation model was built using timed colored Petri nets, and was constructed with four levels of repair and maintenance modules. New module structures are proposed for simulating the schedule of production tasks and interaction with technological units. The emphasis is on the processes of predicting maintenance and repair, moving units to service, replacing units, and forming a reserve. The design of the simulation modules allows the setting of probabilistic parameters for the distributions of equipment failures, requests for unit maintenance, repair time, and recovery time after repair. The article proposes to use the hierarchical Petri model in conjunction with solving the problem of minimizing the cost of service. The iterative procedure consists of obtaining an approximate unit distribution by tasks, subsequent simulation of the technological process, and adjusting the optimization problem constraints. For example, the hierarchical Petri net is considered to assess the maintainability of autonomous agricultural vehicles. The results of the simulation experiments are presented. A simulation of the agrotechnical production process was performed, during which vehicles were maneuvered, taken out for repair or maintenance, and returned to the reserve fund. The interdependencies of preventive maintenance periods, service operations, failure rates, and predictive maintenance requests were obtained in order to comply with the task scheduling. The proposed model is a generalization, but it is especially effective in studying mobile equipment servicing.

AB In this study, the hydrodynamic response of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) subjected to oblique water entry impact is investigated by employing an explicit FEM technique with arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation. The predictive ability of the employed numerical model is validated by correlating the cavity evolution of AUV and peak impact accelerations with the experimental outcomes of the previous research work. The influence of advection algorithms on the water entry phenomenon is studied. It is found that the first order donor cell advection scheme is more suitable for low speed impact problems as it is computationally more efficient. However, for high speed water entry simulations, the van Leer advection scheme gives more accurate results. Moreover, using different water entry angles, the effect of the angle of attack (AOA) and length of AUV and its head shape on the impact performances are investigated and discussed. The results show that the radial impact load is more likely to be influenced by AOA and the effect of AOA on the radial impact load is more significant for a small water entry angle, i.e., 30 degrees, as compared to a large entry angle, i.e., 60 degrees. It is also observed that AUV of a smaller length shows the ricochet behavior at a water entry angle of 30 degrees. It is seen that the head shape has a substantial effect on the axial and radial impact loads and velocity attenuation of a vehicle under water. The conclusions drawn in this research work will be beneficial for the selection of appropriate initial launch conditions and for the designing of an AUV structure.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are emerging technologies expected to bring important environmental, social, and economic improvements in transportation systems. Given their implications in terms of air quality and sustainable and safer movement of goods, heavy-duty trucks (HDTs), carrying the majority of U.S. freight, are considered an ideal domain for the application of CAV technology. An input-output (IO) model is developed based on the Eora database-a detailed IO database that consists of national IO tables, covering almost the entire global economy. Using the Eora-based IO model, this study quantifies and assesses the environmental, economic, and social impacts of automated diesel and battery electric HDTs based on 20 macro-level indicators. The life cycle sustainability performances of these HDTs are then compared to that of a conventional diesel HDT. The study finds an automated diesel HDT to cause 18% more fatalities than an automated electric HDT. The global warming potential (GWP) of automated diesel HDTs is estimated to be 4.7 thousand metric tons CO2-eq. higher than that of automated electric HDTs. The health impact costs resulting from an automated diesel HDT are two times higher than that of an automated electric HDT. Overall, the results also show that automation brings important improvements to the selected sustainability indicators of HDTs such as global warming potential, life cycle cost, GDP, decrease in import, and increase in income. The findings also show that there are significant trade-offs particularly between mineral and fossil resource losses and environmental gains, which are likely to complicate decision-making processes regarding the further development and commercialization of the technology.

AB The aerobiology of fungi in the genus Fusarium is poorly understood. Recent work has highlighted the role of Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) in the movement of fusaria in the lower atmosphere. Here, we extend this work by examining the relationship between the length of atmospheric sampling intervals with autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and the recovery of fusaria. UAVs were equipped with an array of eight microbe-sampling devices with four "inner" sampling arms and four "outer" sampling arms. Each set of arms was used to collect consecutive aerobiological samples during 10 min sampling periods at 100 m above ground level at the Kentland Farm in Blacksburg, Virginia. Fifty-one flights (102 consecutive sampling intervals) were conducted in 2010 and 2011. A correlation analysis showed that the counts of fusaria did not vary between the inner and outer sampling arms from consecutive sampling period of 10 min (r = 0.93, P < 0.001), and the frequency of colony counts had similar distributions for samples from the inner and outer sampling arms. An analysis of the temporal variation in the collections of Fusarium showed that the similarity between collections decreased over time. This work supports the idea that atmospheric populations of fusaria are well mixed, and large changes in the recovery of fusaria in the lower atmosphere may be attributed to large-scale phenomena (e.g., LCSs) operating across varying temporal and spatial scales. This work may contribute to effective control measures for diseases causes by fusaria in the future.

   learning (FL); nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA); unmanned aerial

AB The nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique for addressing fifth-generation (5G) new radio services is emerging as a promising technology. In contrast to the traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) techniques, NOMA can transmit a signal to various devices from the same resource block by exploiting the power domain and decoding the desired signal using the successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique. However, in large-scale 5G macro-cell scenarios, NOMA can need help to efficiently serve far-end devices due to long-distance transmission links, multipath fading, and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) problems. We explore flying small base stations (BSs), which can act as relays to mitigate link quality-related issues. Using the NOMA technique, multiple small-scale flying BSs can fly over the affected devices simultaneously and serve them without utilizing fewer resources compared to the conventional OMA method. We develop a novel intelligent unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based navigation solution using federated deep reinforcement learning (DRL) whereby cost-efficient multiple UAV-BSs fly over certain areas autonomously and serve ground devices (GDs) using 5G NOMA systems without any interruption. We consider a greedy policy (GP) as a benchmark, where the UAV-BSs fly over high-priority devices to serve them. In addition, we consider the traveling salesman problem (TSP)-based navigation solution as a benchmark. We perform extensive simulation analysis for different system parameters, i.e., coverage time, coverage score (CS), and channel-to-noise ratio (CNR), and conclude that the proposed scheme outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

AB In this paper, we present a novel variant of the Covering Tour Problem (CTP), called the Covering Tour Problem with Varying Coverage (CTP-VC). We consider a simple graph ������ = (������, ������), with a measure of importance assigned to each node in ������. A vehicle with limited battery capacity visits the nodes of the graph and has the ability to stay in each node for a certain period of time, which determines the coverage radius at the node. We refer to this feature as stay-dependent varying coverage or, in short, varying coverage. The objective is to maximize a scalarization of the weighted coverage of the nodes and the negation of the cost of moving and staying at the nodes. This problem arises in the monitoring of marine environments, where pollutants can be measured at locations far from the source due to ocean currents. To solve the CTP-VC, we propose a mathematical formulation and a heuristic approach, given that the problem is NP-hard. Depending on the availability of solutions yielded by an exact solver, we evaluate our heuristic approach against the exact solver or a constructive heuristic on various instance sets and show how varying coverage improves performance. Additionally, we use an offshore CO2 storage site in the Gulf of Mexico as a case study to demonstrate the problem's applicability. Our results demonstrate that the proposed heuristic approach is an efficient and practical solution to the problem of stay-dependent varying coverage. We conduct numerous experiments and provide managerial insights.

AB Underwater robotics is rapidly evolving due to the increasing demand for marine resource exploitation. Compared with rigid robots propelled by propellers, bionic robots are stealthier and more maneuverable, such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), making them widely used underwater. In order to study the motion state of the umbrella jellyfish bionic robot, the displacement of the jellyfish robot along the same direction and the surrounding fluid pressure distribution caused by the jellyfish motion under different experimental conditions are discussed in this paper. The effect of different environmental factors on driving the jellyfish robot is determined by comparing the displacements at different observation points. The results of the study show that the lower the frequency and the longer the motion period, the greater the displacement produced by the robot within the same motion period. Frequency has a significant effect on the motion state of the jellyfish robot. While the change of amplitude also affects the motion state of the jellyfish robot, the displacement of the relaxation phase of the jellyfish robot is much smaller than that of the contraction phase with a small amplitude. It can be concluded that the effect of frequency on robot displacement is greater than the effect of amplitude on robot displacement. This study qualitatively discusses the changes of the motion state of the bionic jellyfish robot in still water under the excitation of different frequencies and amplitudes, and the results can provide corresponding reference for the future application of the bionic jellyfish robot, such as resource exploration, underwater exploration, and complex environment exploration.

AB The growing demand for urban mobility highlights the need for relevant and sustainable solutions in cities worldwide. Thus, we develop and implement a framework to analyze the systemic impacts of future urban mobility trends and policies. We build on prior work in classifying the world's cities into 12 urban typologies that represent distinct land-use and behavioral characteristics by introducing a generalized approach for creating a detailed, simulatable prototype city that is representative of a given typology. We then generate and simulate two auto-dependent (largely US-specific) prototype cities via a state-of-the-art agent-based platform, SimMobility, for integrated demand microsimulation and supply mesoscopic simulation. We demonstrate the framework by analyzing the impacts of automated mobility on-demand (AMoD) implementation strategies in the cities based on demand, congestion, energy consumption and emissions outcomes. Our results show that the introduction of AMoD cannibalizes mass transit while increasing vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) and congestion. In sprawling auto-dependent cities with low transit penetration, the congestion and energy consumption effects under best-case assumptions are similar regardless of whether AMoD competes with or complements mass transit. In dense auto-dependent cities with moderate transit modeshare, the integration of AMoD with transit yields better outcomes in terms of VKT and congestion. Such cities cannot afford to disinvest in mass transit, as this would result in unsustainable outcomes. Overall, this framework can provide insights into how AMoD can be sustainably harnessed not only in low-density and high-density auto-dependent cities, but also in other typologies.

AB In precision agriculture, autonomous ground and aerial vehicles can lead to favourable improvements in field operations, extending crop scouting to large fields and performing field tasks in a timely and effective way. However, automated navigation and operations within a complex scenarios require specific and robust path planning and navigation control. Thus, in addition to proper knowledge of their instantaneous position, robotic vehicles and machines require an accurate spatial description of their environment. An innovative modelling framework is presented to semantically interpret 3D point clouds of vineyards and to generate low complexity 3D mesh models of vine rows. The proposed methodology, based on a combination of convex hull filtration and minimum area c-gon design, reduces the amount of instances required to describe the spatial layout and shape of vine canopies allowing the amount of data to be reduced without losing relevant crop shape information. The algorithm is not hindered by complex scenarios, such as nonlinear vine rows, as it is able to automatically process non uniform vineyards. Results demonstrated a data reduction of about 98%; from the 500 Mb ha(-1) required to store the original dataset to 7.6 Mb ha(-1) for the low complexity 3D mesh. Reducing the amount of data is crucial to reducing computational times for large original datasets, thus enabling the exploitation of 3D point cloud information in real-time during field operations. When considering scenarios involving cooperating machines and robots, data reduction will allow rapid communication and data exchange between in field actors. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB Conservation management requires reliable and up-to-date data on land use, wildlife population sizes and resource distribution across highly variable ecosystems. Simultaneously, limited funding in conservation often restrict the assessment and interpretation of these datasets. Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) appear as promising and cost-efficient tools to deliver high-quality data, especially when combined with advanced sensor technologies, e.g. based on specific light features such as spectral signature, short-wave infrared (SWIR) reflection and/or polarization. However, their application rates for conservation purposes remain low, partly because of current technology's inaptitude to extrapolate findings onto large spatial scales due to limited flight ranges of the vehicles and difficulties in animal detection and identification. Particularly, using SWIR cameras and polarization filters combined with thermal cameras may improve animal detection, but only few tests have so far investigated the reliability of these technologies. The analysis of large datasets e.g. from hyperspectral cameras requires skills and time, whereas most interest lies in the results of these surveys. Additionally, legal constraints and high initial investment costs confront their application. Overcoming these challenges requires advancing technological robustness of the tool as well as defining the applicability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) within conservation management. Moreover, its application needs validation in contrast to ground and/or aerial surveys to recommend protocols in different ecological settings and for different management questions. We conclude that UAVs may not serve as panaceas for monitoring land use changes and wildlife trends, but as additional, intermediary data collection tools to support management decisions.

AB River corridors play a crucial environmental, economic, and societal role yet also represent one of the world's most dangerous natural hazards, making monitoring imperative to improve our understanding and to protect people. Remote sensing offers a rapidly growing suite of methods by which river corridor monitoring can be performed efficiently, at a range of scales and in difficult environmental conditions. This paper aims to evaluate the current state and assess the potential future of river corridor monitoring, whilst highlighting areas that require further investigation. We initially review established methods that are used to undertake river corridor monitoring, framed by the context and scales upon which they are applied. Subsequently, we review cutting edge technologies that are being developed and focussed around unmanned aerial vehicle and multisensor system advances. We also "horizon scan" for future methods that may become increasingly prominent in research and management, citing examples from within and outside of the fluvial domain. Through review of the literature, it has become apparent that the main gap in fluvial remote sensing lies in the trade-off between resolution and scales. However, prioritising process measurements and simultaneous multisensor data collection is likely to offer a bigger advance in understanding than purely from better surveying methods alone. Challenges regarding the legal deployment of more complex systems, as well as effectively disseminating data into the science community, are amongst those that we propose need addressing. However, the plethora of methods currently available means that researchers and monitoring agencies will be able to identify suitable techniques for their needs.

AB This research paper presents a validated emotion enabled cognitive driver assistance model (EECDAM) as an accident prevention scheme while keeping in mind different types of driver distractions. It is observed that distracted drivers know that distraction can lead them to a crash but they are not aware of distractions when they take over and they continue to drive. With advancements in autonomous vehicles technologies, it is possible to have an onboard driver assistance systems. However, research is yet to be reported on this issue whether onboard driver assistance program will be effective or not. The Emotion Enabled Cognitive Driver Assistance Model is a system based on an encapsulated Emotion Enabled Cognitive Driver Assistant (EECDA), which computes the effects of external factors at the distraction level of the subject and generates algorithmically generated fear emotion. During experiments, the EECDA intervenes when the fear intensity of the driver crosses a threshold by sending two sound alerts to the driver to take appropriate action. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach as a road safety system, a Cognitive Agent-Based Computing (CABC) framework has been utilized to validate the results of the EECDAM. Algorithms are utilized using fuzzy sets to compute distraction of the drivers. We also present an Agent-Based Model (ABM) to validate the implementation of the proposed scheme. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proficiency of the proposed model for robust collision avoidance. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The proximal tubule contains an autonomous renin-angiotensin system that regulates transport independently of circulating angiotensin II. Androgens are known to increase expression of angiotensinogen, but the effect of androgens on proximal tubule transport is unknown. In this in vivo microperfusion study, we examined the effect of androgens on proximal tubule transport. The volume reabsorptive rate in Sprague-Dawley rats given dihydrotestosterone (DHT) injections was significantly higher than in control rats given vehicle injections (4.57 +/- 0.31 vs. 3.31 +/- 0.23 nl . min(-1) . mm(-1), P < 0.01). Luminally perfusing with either enalaprilat ( 10(-4) M) to inhibit production of angiotensin II or losartan ( 10(-8) M) to block the angiotensin receptor decreased the proximal tubule volume reabsorptive rate in DHT-treated rats to a significantly greater degree than in control vehicle-injected rats. The renal expression of angiotensinogen was shown to be higher in the DHT-treated animals, using Northern blot analysis. The expression of angiotensin receptors, determined by specific binding of angiotensin II, was not different in the two groups of animals. Brush-border membrane protein abundance of the Na/H exchanger, a membrane transport protein under angiotensin II regulation, was also higher in DHT-treated rats vs. control rats. Rats that received DHT had higher blood pressures than the control rats but had no change in their glomerular filtration rate. In addition, serum angiotensin II levels were lower in DHT-treated vs. control rats. These results suggest that androgens may directly upregulate the proximal tubule renin-angiotensin system, increase the volume reabsorptive rate, and thereby increase extracellular volume and blood pressure and secondarily decrease serum angiotensin II levels.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are an emerging technology in the 5G-and-beyond systems with the promise of assisting cellular communications and supporting IoT deployment in remote and density areas. Safe and secure navigation is essential for UAV remote and autonomous deployment. Indeed, the opensource simulator can use commercial software-defined radio tools to generate fake global positioning system (GPS) signals and spoof the UAV GPS receiver to calculate wrong locations, deviating from the planned trajectory. Fortunately, the existing mobile positioning system can provide additional navigation for cellular-connected UAVs and verify the UAV GPS locations for spoofing detection, but it needs at least three base stations (BSs) at the same time. In this article, we propose a novel deep-ensemble-learning-based, mobile-network-assisted UAV monitoring and tracking system for cellular-connected UAV spoofing detection. The proposed method uses path losses between BSs and UAVs communication to indicate the UAV trajectory deviation caused by GPS spoofing. To increase the detection accuracy, three statistics methods are adopted to remove environmental impacts on path losses. In addition, deep ensemble learning methods are deployed on the edge cloud servers and use the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks to analyze path losses statistical features for making a final decision, which has no additional requirements and energy consumption on UAVs. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our method in detecting GPS spoofing, achieving above 97% accuracy rate under two BSs, while it can still achieve at least 83% accuracy under only one BS.

AB The identification of fractures and discontinuities has great importance on the fluid flow estimation in hydrocarbon reservoirs since they influence the properties of porosity and permeability. Due to the inaccessibility and sparsity of reservoir data, the fracture characterization is generally assessed through the study of outcrop analogues using remote sensing or in situ observations by a specialist. Considering the remote sensing methods, the unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) acquisition combined with Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry is a low-cost way to generate products like orthorectified images, allowing manual and automated methods of fracture trace detection. Automatic approaches, commonly used to address this problem, present some known limitations and disadvantages due to the nature of the outcrops and weather conditions during UAV acquisitions. In this work, we focus on fracture detection over karstic regions that are highly fractured. For this, we evaluated a series of adaptive segmentation methods based on thresholding. The Sauvola local adaptive segmentation presented the best result when compared to a manually annotated ground truth. The segmentation results were further improved by the use of the binary denoising method Non-Local means. We also carried an evaluation of the influence of the sun position in the fracture detection, and to reduce this inherent bias we combined three UAV acquisitions done over the karstic carbonate outcrop, namely Rosario pavement in the Jandaira formation northeast Brazil. With the proposed methodology we acquired more accurate fracture data over the study area, which follows the directional statistics of previous works carried out in the region.

AB During automatic driving, the complex background and mutual occlusion between multiple targets hinder the correct judgment of the detector and miss detection. When a close-range target is captured again, the vehicle may not be able to respond in time and cause a fatal accident. Therefore, in the application of auxiliary systems, a model that can accurately identify partially occluded targets in complex backgrounds and perform short-term tracking and early warning of completely occluded objects is required. This paper proposes a method to improve detection accuracy while supporting real-time operations based on YOLOv3 and realize real-time warnings for those objects that are completely blocked. First, we obtain a more suitable prior frames setting through class-wise K-means clustering. To solve the problem that the maxpool operation of original CBAM easily introduces background noise, we proposed AS-CBAM(Adaptive Selection Convolutional Block Attention Module) and innovatively combined the HDC(Hybrid Dilated Convolution) to maximize the receptive field and fine-tune the characteristics. The 1x1 convolution operation is used to suppress the increase of the parameter amount. In this study, DIOU-NMS was used to replace traditional NMS. Besides, a tracking algorithm based on Kalman filtering and Hungarian matching is introduced to improve the system's ability to recognize occluded objects. Compared with the traditional YOLOv3, the proposed method can increase the mAP by 1.32% and 1.47% on KITTI and UA-DETRAC, respectively. Nevertheless, it shows a processing speed of 35.07FPS and a more significant improvement in accuracy (90.36% vs. 85.71%) on the Object-Mask, a dataset that focuses on occlusion conditions. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is more suitable for autonomous driving applications.

AB We present a multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) control and estimation system for supporting replicable research through realistic simulations and real-world experiments. We propose a unique multi-frame localization paradigm for estimating the states of a UAV in various frames of reference using multiple sensors simultaneously. The system enables complex missions in GNSS and GNSS-denied environments, including outdoor-indoor transitions and the execution of redundant estimators for backing up unreliable localization sources. Two feedback control designs are presented: one for precise and aggressive maneuvers, and the other for stable and smooth flight with a noisy state estimate. The proposed control and estimation pipeline are constructed without using the Euler/Tait-Bryan angle representation of orientation in 3D. Instead, we rely on rotation matrices and a novel heading-based convention to represent the one free rotational degree-of-freedom in 3D of a standard multirotor helicopter. We provide an actively maintained and well-documented open-source implementation, including realistic simulation of UAV, sensors, and localization systems. The proposed system is the product of years of applied research on multi-robot systems, aerial swarms, aerial manipulation, motion planning, and remote sensing. All our results have been supported by real-world system deployment that subsequently shaped the system into the form presented here. In addition, the system was utilized during the participation of our team from the Czech Technical University in Prague in the prestigious MBZIRC 2017 and 2020 robotics competitions, and also in the DARPA Subterranean challenge. Each time, our team was able to secure top places among the best competitors from all over the world.

AB Many intra-logistics systems, such as automated container terminals, distribution warehouses, and cross-docks, observe parallel process flows, which involve simultaneous (parallel) operations of independent resources while processing a job. When independent resources work simultaneously to process a common job, the effective service requirement of the job is difficult to estimate. For modeling simplicity, researchers tend to assume sequential operations of the resources. In this paper, we propose an efficient modeling approach for parallel process flows using two-phase servers. We develop a closed queuing network model to estimate system performance measures. Existing solution methods can evaluate the performance of closed queuing networks that consist of two-phase servers with exponential service times only. To solve closed queuing networks with general two-phase servers, we propose new solution methods: an approximate mean value analysis and a network aggregation dis-aggregation approach. We derive insights on the accuracy of the solution methods from numerical experiments. Although both solution methods are quite accurate in estimating performance measures, the network aggregation disaggregation approach consistently performs best. We illustrate the proposed modeling approach for two intra-logistic systems: a container terminal with automated guided vehicles and a shuttle-based compact storage system. Results show that approximating the simultaneous operations as sequential operations underestimates the container terminal throughput on average by 28% and at maximum up to 47%. Similarly, considering sequential operations of the resources in the compact storage system results in an underestimation of the throughput capacity up to 9%. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Compact automated parking (CAP) systems are fully automated parking systems, which store cars densely. Such systems are mainly used in congested cities all over the world, providing rapid parking access and safe vehicle storage. We study a prominent new technology, with relatively low Cost and rapid response. The system has a rotating ring equipped with shuttles in each tier for horizontal transport, and uses two lifts in the middle of the CAP system for vertical transport. We present a dedicated lift operating policy under which it uses one lift for storage and another for retrieval, and a general operating policy under which it uses both lifts for storage and retrieval. We propose queuing networks for single-tier and multitier systems based on two different policies for operating the lifts (a dedicated and general operating policy). We validate the analytical models using simulation based on a real application. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis in which we vary speeds of lifts and car rotation. Then we use the analytical models to optimize the system layout by minimizing the retrieval time. Furthermore, combining time efficiency and system cost, we find an appropriate system layout for designers. Third, we compare two lifts under dedicated and general operating policies. Forth, we find the optimal number of the lifts through a general compact automated parking system. Finally, we calculate the investment cost of a CAP system under different system configurations and compare it with an alternative design: a cubic parking system. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI An Acoustic Network Navigation System
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

ID AUV NAVIGATION; LOCALIZATION
AB This work describes a system for acoustic-based navigation that relies on the addition of localization services to underwater networks. The localization capability has been added on top of an existing network, without imposing constraints on its structure/operation. The approach is based on the inclusion of timing information within acoustic messages through which it is possible to know the time of an acoustic transmission in relation to its reception. Exploiting such information at the network application level makes it possible to create an interrogation scheme similar to that of a long baseline. The advantage is that the nodes/autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) themselves become the transponders of a network baseline, and hence there is no need for dedicated instrumentation. The paper reports at sea results obtained from the COLLAB-NGAS14 experimental campaign. During the sea trial, the approach was implemented within an operational network in different configurations to support the navigation of the two Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation Ocean Explorer (CMRE OEX) vehicles. The obtained results demonstrate that it is possible to support AUV navigation without constraining the network design and with a minimum communication overhead. Alternative solutions (e.g., synchronized clocks or two-way-travel-time interrogations) might provide higher precision or accuracy, but they come at the cost of impacting on the network design and/or on the interrogation strategies. Results are discussed, and the performance achieved at sea demonstrates the viability to use the system in real, large-scale operations involving multiple AUVs. These results represent a step toward location-aware underwater networks that are able to provide node localization as a service. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In Shannon theory, semantic aspects of communication were identified but considered irrelevant to the technical communication problems. Semantic communication (SC) techniques have recently attracted renewed research interests in 6(th) generation (6G) wireless, because they have the capability to support an efficient interpretation of the significance and meaning intended by a sender (or accomplishment of the goal) when dealing with multi-modal data such as videos, images, audio, text messages, and so on, which would be the case for various applications such as intelligent transportation systems where each autonomous vehicle needs to deal with real-time videos and data from a number of sensors including radars. To this end, most of the emerging SC works focus on specific data types and employ sophisticated machine learning models including deep learning and neural networks. However, they could be impractical for multi-modal data possibly within a real-time constraint, relative to the purpose of the communication. A notable difficulty of existing SC frameworks lies in handling the discrete constraints imposed on the pursued semantic coding and its interaction with the independent knowledge-base, which makes reliable semantic extraction extremely challenging. Therefore, we develop a new hashing-based semantic extraction approach to SC framework, where our learning objective is to generate one time signatures (hash codes) using supervised learning for low latency, secure and efficient management of the SC dynamics. We first evaluate the proposed semantic extraction framework over large image data sets, extend it with domain adaptive hashing and then demonstrate the effectiveness of "semantics signature" in bulk transmission and multi-modal data.

AB Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attained considerable attention for providing reliable and cost-effective communication due to the flexibility of deployment and line of sight (LoS) propagation. Efficient UAV path planning is one of the key aspects that need to be addressed to minimize energy consumption and satisfy the rate requirements of the user. Thus, in this work, we propose a novel framework that utilizes the modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm for UAV path planning to support the rate requirements of the user. In the proposed framework, the problem of joint path planning and energy consumption is formulated to improve the instantaneous sum rate of the user. In order to solve the formulation, the proposed framework involves two steps. Initially, the line of sight probability is used to obtain an optimal destination location at which the UAV is in LoS with the user and offers the required downlink rate. Following that, the modified PSO is used to find the most energy-efficient path from the source to the destination. Through experiments, we show that the proposed framework provides a three-dimensional (3D) path in a complex environment, and has the ability to avoid obstacles in the path. In addition, it minimizes energy consumption and travel time and improves the user rate as compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, the performance of the proposed framework is tested in three different scenarios and shows that the proposed method performs better than the state-of-the-art methods in all scenarios.

AB In-flight system failure is one of the major safety concerns in the operation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in urban environments. To address this concern, a safety framework consisting of following three main tasks can be utilized: (1) Monitoring health of the UAV and detecting failures, (2) Finding potential safe landing spots in case a critical failure is detected in step 1, and (3) Steering the UAV to a safe landing spot found in step 2. In this paper, we specifically look at the second task, where we investigate the feasibility of utilizing object detection methods to spot safe landing spots in case the UAV suffers an in-flight failure. Particularly, we investigate different versions of the YOLO objection detection method and compare their performances for the specific application of detecting a safe landing location for a UAV that has suffered an in-flight failure. We compare the performance of YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and YOLOv5l while training them by a large aerial image dataset called DOTA in a Personal Computer (PC) and also a Companion Computer (CC). We plan to use the chosen algorithm on a CC that can be attached to a UAV, and the PC is used to verify the trends that we see between the algorithms on the CC. We confirm the feasibility of utilizing these algorithms for effective emergency landing spot detection and report their accuracy and speed for that specific application. Our investigation also shows that the YOLOv5l algorithm outperforms YOLOv4 and YOLOv3 in terms of accuracy of detection while maintaining a slightly slower inference speed.

Using an ordered logistic regression structure, different statistical models were developed and tested, including fixed-effects and random parameter models, as well as the inclusion of interaction effects and attitudinal factors. Initial results from the fixed-effects model showed that the younger cohorts, including Millennials and Generation Z, showed a significantly positive preference for more frequent ride-hail use, whereas the older cohorts' preferences (Generation X, Baby Boomers, and older) did not show any significant effects on ride-hail frequency. In the next step, the presence of heterogeneity among Millennials was tested using random parameters. The results confirmed that Millennials' usage of ride-hail was heterogeneous, and this was statistically significant at the 90% confidence interval (sigma(2) = 0.61, rho = 0.097). To identify sources of heterogeneity, interaction effects were added to the model. Accordingly, use of ride-hail was more popular among middle-aged Millennials (30 to 34 years old) and Millennials with higher incomes. Likewise, attitudes such as cost sensitivity (toward private vehicle ownership), and being a rational user resulted in higher frequency ride-hail use across Millennials. On the contrary, unemployed Millennials were less likely to utilize ride-hail. The results from this study provide a more transparent picture of current ride-hail market segmentation, which could help predict the future market comprising autonomous vehicles and other emerging mobility options.

AB With the development of robotics, the underwater robot platform has been widely used in the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT). An underwater robot platform equipped with multiple sensors is used as a mobile collector to build a reliable information collection system for IoUT. This article presents the mechatronic design, fabrication, modeling, control, simulation, and experiments of a robot IoUT platform to enable the smart ocean. Inspired by the design of both fin-actuated swimming of fish and buoyancy-driven gliding of underwater glider, a novel multilink gliding fish robot is proposed. The multilink gliding fish robot, which is called FishBot in this article, can swim flexibly and glide energy efficiently in three dimensions. In the FishBot, the body and/or caudal fin (BCF) with three degrees of freedom and buoyancy-driven system was equipped as the main propulsion device. Besides, a pair of pectoral fins was equipped to assist in regulating the gliding attitude and enhance the FishBot maneuverability in the vertical plane. The dynamic model that consists of cruise swimming motion, pure-pitching swimming motion, and 3-D swimming motion for control is established. Moreover, a behavioral control framework is developed to achieve a variety of fish-like swimming behaviors and gliding motion. Meanwhile, we proved the stability of the linear quadratic regulation controller and the locomotion controller is provided with exponential stability. The validity of the proposed model and the designed controller is demonstrated by numerical simulations. Finally, a series of experiments involving different fish-like behaviors and gliding motion elucidates the powerful locomotion ability of the FishBot.

AB As an emerging field of aerial robotics, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant research interest within the wireless networking research community. As soon as national legislations allow UAVs to fly autonomously, we will see swarms of UAV populating the sky of our smart cities to accomplish different missions: parcel delivery, infrastructure monitoring, event filming, surveillance, tracking, etc. The UAV ecosystem can benefit from 5G/B5G cellular networks, which can be exploited in different ways to enhance UAV communications. Because of the inherent characteristics of UAV pertaining to flexible mobility in 3D space, autonomous operation and intelligent placement, these smart devices cater to wide range of wireless applications and use cases. This work aims at presenting an in-depth exploration of integration synergies between 5G/B5G cellular systems and UAV technology, where the UAV is integrated as a new aerial User Equipment (UE) to already deployed cellular networks. In this integration, the UAVs perform the role of flying users within cellular coverage, thus they are termed as cellular-connected UAVs. The main focus of this work is to present an extensive study of integration challenges along with key 5G/B5G technological innovations and ongoing efforts in design prototyping and field trials corroborating cellular-connected UAVs. This study highlights recent progress updates with respect to 3GPP standardization and emphasizes socio-economic concerns that must be accounted before successful adoption of this promising technology. Various open problems paving the path to future research opportunities are also discussed.

AB Accident Analysis & Prevention (AA&P) is a leading academic journal established in 1969 that serves as an important scientific communication platform for road safety studies. To celebrate its 50th anniversary of publishing outstanding and insightful studies, a multi-dimensional statistical and visualized analysis of the AA&P publications between 1969 and 2018 was performed using the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection database, bibliometrics and mapping-knowledge-domain (MKD) analytical methods, and scientometric tools. It was shown that the annual number of AA&P's publications has grown exponentially and that over the course of its development, AA&P has been a leader in the field of road safety, both in terms of innovation and dissemination. By determining its key source countries and organizations, core authors, highly co-cited published documents, and high burst-strength publications, we showed that AA&P's areas of focus include the "effects of hazard and risk perception on driving behavior", "crash frequency modeling analysis", "intentional driving violations and aberrant driving behavior", "epidemiology, assessment and prevention of road traffic injuries", and "crash-injury severity modeling analysis". Furthermore, the key burst papers that have played an important role in advancing research and guiding AA&P in new directions - particularly those in the fields of crash frequency and crash injury severity modeling analyses were identified. Finally, a modified Haddon matrix in the era of intelligent, connected and autonomous transportation systems is proposed to provide new insights into the emerging generation of road safety studies.

AB Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to describe simulation research carried out for the needs of multi-sensor anti-collision system for light aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper presents an analysis related to the practical possibilities of detecting intruders in the air space with the use of optoelectronic sensors. The theoretical part determines the influence of the angle of view, distance from the intruder and the resolution of the camera on the ability to detect objects with different linear dimensions. It has been assumed that the detection will be effective for objects represented by at least four pixels (arranged in a line) on the sensor matrix. In the main part devoted to simulation studies, the theoretical data was compared to the obtained intruders' images. The verified simulation environment was then applied to the image processing algorithms developed for the anti-collision system.
   Findings
   A simulation environment was obtained enabling reliable tests of the anti-collision system using optoelectronic sensors.
   Practical implications - The integration of unmanned aircraft operations in civil airspace is a serious problem on a global scale. Equipping aircraft with autonomous anti-collision systems can help solve key problems. The use of simulation techniques in the process of testing anti-collision systems allows the implementation of test scenarios that may be burdened with too much risk in real flights.
   Social implications
   This paper aims for possible improvement of safety in light-sport aviation.
   Originality/value
   This paper conducts verification of classic flight simulator software suitability for carrying out anti-collision systems tests and development of a flight simulator platform dedicated to such tests.

AB It is well-known that information and communication technologies enable many tasks in the context of precision agriculture. In fact, more and more farmers and food and agriculture companies are using precision agriculture-based systems to enhance not only their products themselves, but also their means of production. Consequently, problems arising from large amounts of data management and processing are arising. It would be very useful to have an infrastructure that allows information and agricultural tasks to be efficiently shared and handled. The cloud computing paradigm offers a solution. In this study, a cloud-based software architecture is proposed with the aim of enabling a complete crop management system to be deployed and validated. Such architecture includes modules developed by using Google App Engine, which allows the information to be easily retrieved and processed and agricultural tasks to be properly defined and planned. Additionally, Google's Datastore (which ensures a high scalability degree), hosts both information that describes such agricultural tasks and agronomic data. The architecture has been validated in a system that comprises a wireless sensor network with fixed nodes and a mobile node on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), deployed in an agricultural farm in the Region of Murcia (Spain). Such a network allows soil water and plant status to be monitored. The UAV (capable of executing missions defined by an administrator) is useful for acquiring visual information in an autonomous manner (under operator supervision, if needed). The system performance has been analysed and results that demonstrate the benefits of using the proposed architecture are detailed.

AB Over the last decade, ocean sunfish movements have been monitored worldwide using various satellite tracking methods. This study reports the near-real time monitoring of finescale (< 10 m) behaviour of sunfish. The study was conducted in southern Portugal in May 2014 and involved satellite tags and underwater and surface robotic vehicles to measure both the movements and the contextual environment of the fish. A total of four individuals were tracked using custom-made GPS satellite tags providing geolocation estimates of fine-scale resolution. These accurate positions further informed sunfish areas of restricted search (ARS), which were directly correlated to steep thermal frontal zones. Simultaneously, and for two different occasions, an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) videorecorded the path of the tracked fish and detected buoyant particles in the water column. Importantly, the densities of these particles were also directly correlated to steep thermal gradients. Thus, both sunfish foraging behaviour (ARS) and possibly prey densities, were found to be influenced by analogous environmental conditions. In addition, the dynamic structure of the water transited by the tracked individuals was described by a Lagrangian modelling approach. The model informed the distribution of zooplankton in the region, both horizontally and in the water column, and the resultant simulated densities positively correlated with sunfish ARS behaviour estimator (r(s) = 0.184, p < 0.001). The model also revealed that tracked fish opportunistically displace with respect to subsurface current flow. Thus, we show how physical forcing and current structure provide a rationale for a predator's finescale behaviour observed over a two weeks in May 2014.

DE emergent behaviors group formations; kinbots; multi-robot coordination;
   collective robotics
AB In this paper we address the problem of synthesizing simple rules and local interactions at the individual level so that prespecified complex behavior emerges at the group level of a collection of autonomous mobile agents. Usually, the emergent Collective behavior is used to perform certain spatial group-tasks. Specifically, we consider self-assembling of a group of mobile robots into grid, line, and wedge patterns. We introduce the notion of local-templates in which each mobile agent - capable of simple forward/backward movements and a clock-wise/counter clock-wise spin - actively encodes distinctive information into multiple non-overlapping sectorial regions of the surrounding environment in order to form pose-specific virtual links with similar minimalist agents in a local neighborhood. The resulting local patterns around each agent lead to the desired global formation. In order to take mobile robots closer to their biological counterparts, there is a need to further simplify the manner in which they currently perceive their surroundings, communicate with their neighbors, and compute their actions. We have built a robotic platform consisting of four wheeled-mobile robots that are christened as Kinbots. They are similar in principle to Braitenberg Vehicles and use simple perception/interaction/actuation techniques to achieve individual vehicle complexity and produce effective group behavior through cooperation. To validate the proposed approach, we demonstrate a column-formation task in Computer simulations and physical experiments. We illustrate an experiment which is representative of various prominent stages in a group-formation task such as formation-achievement, maintenance, and response of formation movement to the presence of obstacles.

AB Technological developments in the areas of robotics, autonomous flight controls, sensory equipment, and energy storage have enabled the rise of the commercial drone industry. Drones, also referred to as remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) are a versatile tool used in applications ranging from geological surveying to package delivery and vary in size from a few grams to several tons. With their increasing utilization by individuals, corporations, and the government, more must be done to understand how the public perceives their use. Studies have been performed all over the world and show an increasing level of support for drones, largely due to greater awareness of their existence and how they work. The last major survey performed in Canada was done in 2014 and found the public was rather opposed to the use of drones and preferred traditionally piloted aircraft in all 38 applications polled. Much has changed over the past eight years as the findings presented herein show the public is supportive of the technology in most applications. Factors leading to a higher level of support included age, gender, prior drone knowledge, and being a user of the technology. Applications of drones that were perceived to further the public interest such as search and rescue, firefighting, and climate research were also viewed more positively. Most drone user groups were viewed favorably except for journalists and corporations. Together, these results show the changing sentiment and opinions of Canadians and can be of use to industry stakeholders and governments for effectively using drones and developing policies to regulate them.

AB The need of underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) having mobile sensor nodes has been there for a long time in form of underwater warfare or explorations by autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) or remote unmanned vehicles (ROVs). There are very few protocols for ad hoc mobile UWSNs (AMUWSNs). Designing a protocol for AMUWSN is quite challenging because of continuous random movement of the sensor nodes. In addition to random movement, the challenges to design a routing protocol for AMUWSN are more demanding than terrestrial ad hoc networks due to acoustic communications, which has large propagation delay in water. In this article, we present a self-organized ad hoc mobile (SOAM) routing protocol for AMUWSN. The sensor nodes may need to communicate with each other to the gateway (GW). The protocol, which we also refer to as SOAM, is a reactive, self-configuring, and self-organizing cluster-based routing protocol that uses received signal strength (RSS) for distance estimation. A beacon (BCN) packet will be sent by the GW, which will traverse through all the cluster heads (CHs) to form forwarding paths between the GW and the CHs. The ordinary sensor nodes (OSNs) will select the CHs every time they intend to forward a packet based on the BCN and they will receive from CHs. The formation of the forwarding path between the GW and the CHs and the selection CHs by OSN is explained in Section IV.

AB Millimeter-wave (mmW) automotive radar imaging technology has shown significant potential in autopilot assistance systems. The automotive radar with limited aperture can achieve high-resolution images by synthetic aperture technology. However, conventional imaging methods result in strong background clutter and high sidelobe interferences. To solve these problems, we propose a target-oriented Bayesian compressive sensing imaging method with region-adaptive extractor (TO-BCS-RAE) for mmW automotive radar imaging. First, to extract the potential target regions (PTRs) as well as subtract the background clutters outside the PTR in a high-resolution initial image (by synthetic aperture), a region-adaptive extractor (RAE) is developed by utilizing 2-D constant false alarm (CFAR), isolated-point removing, and imaging clustering. Meanwhile, a more accurate prior distribution of target scattering points can be obtained in the PTR. Then, to suppress the background clutters while enhancing the smooth structure of targets in the PTR, a target-oriented Bayesian compressive sensing (TO-BCS) imaging method is proposed by combining the prior probability distributions and inherent continuity of the target scattering points. It can also effectively reduce the high sidelobes. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of TO-BCS-RAE, we conduct experiments on real data collected from an automotive radar with a vehicle platform in three typical driving scenarios. Both simulated and experimental results show the imaging quality of the proposed imaging method over conventional backprojection (BP), orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), and iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (ISTA) methods.

AB This work aims to explore the effect of Resource Allocation and Control (RAC) of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) communication equipment. The communication congestion problem is caused by insufficient computing resources of macro base stations when many user terminals access the IoT system. To this end, this work innovatively constructs the IoT system combined with UAVs to satisfy the user's communication experience and allocate channel resources simultaneously. Finally, a UAV-assisted IoT resource allocation and control model is constructed and tested through experiments on the simulation software to analyze its performance. The results indicate that the transmission delay of the model reported here is significantly lower than that of other algorithms with the increased number of end users and the proportion of tasks. When the number of users is 500, the transmission delay of data resources is 47.5s. Besides, it requires lower energy consumption and shorter task completion time while maintaining lower throughput. At the same time, the uplink transmission rate of the model is generally stable at 3.10bps; the uplink transmission rate of the entire wireless communication system shows an increasing trend with the increase of the transmit power. Therefore, it is found that the model constructed here has strong robustness and achieves an excellent data resource allocation effect while ensuring lower data delay. This model provides an experimental reference and contribution to the improvement of the performance of IoT systems and the accurate allocation of network resources.

AB As the friction between a vehicle's tires and the road surface correlates with the road-covering water film height, knowledge about the present wetness level is of relevance for drivers and autonomous systems. A promising approach for wetness quantification is based on a capacitive transducer array (TA) that is integrated at a front wheel arch liner and capable of detecting spray water ejected by the tires. While this approach has already shown that wetness classification using capacitive measurement data is feasible, potentially affecting factors such as the water's electrical conductivity were assumed to be constant in the past. This article presents a study on the effect of the spray water's conductivity on wetness classification for that approach and also demonstrates the feasibility of classifying conductivity using the same capacitive measurement data. For these purposes, we propose a test bench capable of simulating reproducible spray water scenarios. We show the effect of varying conductivity on the measured capacitance curves complicating the distinction of wetness classes. In partial investigations, we demonstrate the extent of the conductivity's effect on classifier performance. While wetness classification with conductivities differing from training results in poor classifier performance, the mean accuracy (ACC) can be increased to approximately 0.98 considering all occurring conductivities. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage classification approach that initially determines the conductivity and subsequently considers it as an additional feature in wetness classification. The approach increases classifier performance to more than 0.99 indicating that knowledge of the spray's present conductivity can optimize road surface wetness classification.

AB Future spacecraft will be provided with special features to enable On-Orbit-Servicing missions. Such features include capture interfaces, proximity sensors, and algorithms for autonomous RVD (Rendezvous and Docking). The reliability standards of the space industry require all these technologies to be tested in relevant environment; to this purpose, several ground testing facilities have been built during the last years. They reproduce many aspects of the free-falling motion of a spacecraft often exploiting two technologies: robotic systems and low friction tables. The first use a virtual environment to compute the effects of the external forces and reproduce the motion of a spacecraft with a robotic arm; the second unbind vehicle mock-ups from friction effects, allowing them to experience a free motion at least in three degrees of freedom. Merging together these two types of facilities gives the possibility to further extend their capabilities. This work presents a series of tests conducted on a custom robotic arm, intended to be integrated with a low friction table. The tests focus on two main aspects: (i) the accuracy of the positioning capability and (ii) the dynamic behaviour of the robotic arm. Both aspects are directly connected with the final purpose of operating in conjunction with a vehicle floating on a low friction table. The paper also presents some improvements of the robotic arm suggested by the results of the tests to fit the requirements on the positioning accuracy. These are represented by three main achievements: (i) the accuracy is comparable with the principal navigation sensor; (ii) the vibrations are below the error of the navigation sensor, and (iii) the ability of the robotic arm in performing a capture task.

AB Toward 5G cellular network, to achieve an extremely high data rate and Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication by using a limited radio frequency spectrum bands becomes a big challenge. 3GPP LTE-A/LTE-A Pro thus specifies the technologies of Carrier Aggregation (CA) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) to increase the frequency spectrum efficiency and to dynamically allocate the virtualized network component for different classes of requests, respectively. CA can aggregate multiple contiguous or non-contiguous Component Carriers (CCs) and to improve frequency spectrum utilization and signal quality. NFV can dynamically allocate network (virtualized) resource for different classes of services, e.g., human-driven Cloud Computing, machine-driven Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) (e.g., Autonomous Self Driving Vehicle) and sensing-based Internet of Things (IoTs), etc. However, different SINRs of different frequency spectrum bands suffer from the exiting radio nature of CCs. The CA effect and system capacity are thus limited obviously. Additionally, in CC accesses via IoV/IoT, human-driven and machine-driven types communications exhibit different arrival requests and traffic characteristics. Various QoS requirements and traffic distributions of Human and Machine transmissions are certainly different. This paper thus proposes the Cross-Layer scheduling with CC Aggregation (CLCA) toward 5G. CLCA consists of three mechanisms: (1) Markov Decision Process-based cost reward Packet Selection (MDP-PS), (2) Adaptive Packet Scheduling (APS) and (3) Adaptive Component Carrier scheduling (ACC). Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed CLCA approach outperform the compared approaches in system capacity, network reward and packet failure rate.

AB Single object tracking (SOT) is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with a wide range of applications, including autonomous driving, augmented reality, and robot navigation. The robustness of SOT faces two main challenges: tiny target and fast motion. These challenges are especially manifested in videos captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), where the target is usually far away from the camera and often with significant motion relative to the camera. To evaluate the robustness of SOT methods, we propose BioDrone-the first bionic drone-based visual benchmark for SOT. Unlike existing UAV datasets, BioDrone features videos captured from a flapping-wing UAV system with a major camera shake due to its aerodynamics. BioDrone hence highlights the tracking of tiny targets with drastic changes between consecutive frames, providing a new robust vision benchmark for SOT. To date, BioDrone offers the largest UAV-based SOT benchmark with high-quality fine-grained manual annotations and automatically generates frame-level labels, designed for robust vision analyses. Leveraging our proposed BioDrone, we conduct a systematic evaluation of existing SOT methods, comparing the performance of 20 representative models and studying novel means of optimizing a SOTA method (KeepTrack Mayer et al. in: Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF international conference on computer vision, pp. 13444-13454, 2021) for robust SOT. Our evaluation leads to new baselines and insights for robust SOT. Moving forward, we hope that BioDrone will not only serve as a high-quality benchmark for robust SOT, but also invite future research into robust computer vision. The database, toolkits, evaluation server, and baseline results are available at http://biodrone.aitestunion.com.

AB Introduction Shared on-demand mobility services emerge at a fast pace, changing the landscape of public transport. However, shared mobility services are largely designed without considering the access needs of people with disabilities, putting these passengers at risk of exclusion. Recognising that accessibility is best addressed at the design stage and through direct participation of persons with disabilities, the objective of this study was to explore disabled users' views on the following emerging shared mobility services: (a) ride pooling, (b) microtransit, (c) motorbike taxis, (d) robotaxis, (f) e-scooter sharing, and (g) bike sharing. Methodolgy Using an online mobility survey, we sampled disabled users' (1) views on accessibility, (2) use intention, and (3) suggestions for improving accessibility. The results reflect the responses of 553 individuals with different types of disabilities from 21 European countries. Results Projected accessibility and use intention were greatest for microtransit, robotaxis, and ride pooling across different disabilities. In contrast, motorbike taxis, e-scooter sharing, and bike sharing were viewed as least accessible and least attractive to use, especially by persons with physical, visual, and multiple disabilities. Despite differences in projected accessibility, none of the shared mobility services would fulfil the access needs of disabled persons in their current form. Suggestions for increasing the accessibility of these services included (a) an ondemand door-to-door service, (b) an accessible booking app, (c) real-time travel information, and (d) the necessity of accommodating wheelchairs. Conclusions Our findings highlight the need for improving both vehicles and service designs to cater for the access needs of persons with disabilities and provide policymakers with recommendations for the design of accessible mobility solutions.

AB Transportation is sensitive to risk. Given the fast development of digitalisation and automation of transport systems in the past decade, new types of security risks (e.g. cyberattacks) emerge within the context of transport safety research. To enable the integrated analysis of emerging security and classical safety-related risks in a holistic manner, safety and security co-analysis (SSCA) is highly demanded for accident prevention. SSCA in transport systems will benefit the risk analysis of complex cyber physical transport systems facing challenges from both hazards and threats. However, the nature of hazard and threat-based risks is fundamentally different, which leads to the various difficulties of analysing them on the same plane. They include the use of different risk parameters, the uncertainty levels of the risk input and the methodologies of risk inference. To address such concerns, this study firstly reviews the literature on SSCA and compares the employed methodologies and their applications within the context of transport systems. Taking into account the advantages of both security-driven and safety-oriented methods, a conceptual framework is proposed to imply the insights on SSCA for transportation through both top-down and bottom-up perspectives, followed by a quantitative illustrative case study. Then, the regu-latory development and evolution of SSCA in transport in practice is analysed across different transport modes, which configures initiatives' interrelations for a cross-fertilisation purpose. As a result, the findings reveal new research directions for the safety of digitalised and/or autonomous transport vehicles and aid in the formation of future transport safety study agendas.

AB Novel tools and methods for monitoring marine environments can improve efficiency but must not compromise long-term data records. Quantitative comparisons between new and existing methods are therefore required to assess their compatibility for monitoring. Monitoring of shallow water coral reefs is typically conducted using diver-based collection of benthic images along transects. Diverless systems for obtaining underwater images (e.g. towed-cameras, remotely operated vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles) are increasingly used for mapping coral reefs. Of these imaging platforms, towed-cameras offer a practical, low cost and efficient method for surveys but their utility for repeated measures in monitoring studies has not been tested. We quantitatively compare a towed-camera approach to repeated surveys of shallow water coral reef benthic assemblages on fixed transects, relative to benchmark data from diver photo-transects. Differences in the percent cover detected by the two methods was partly explained by differences in the morphology of benthic groups. The reef habitat and physical descriptors of the site-slope, depth and structural complexity-also influenced the comparability of data, with differences between the tow-camera and the diver data increasing with structural complexity and slope. Differences between the methods decreased when a greater number of images were collected per tow-camera transect. We attribute lower image quality (variable perspective, exposure and focal distance) and lower spatial accuracy and precision of the towed-camera transects as the key reasons for differences in the data from the two methods and suggest changes to the sampling design to improve the application of tow-cameras to monitoring.

AB Detection and classification of vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians and cyclists is a key requirement for the realization of fully autonomous vehicles. Radar-based classification of VRUs can be achieved by exploiting differences in the micro-Doppler signatures associated with VRUs. Specifically, machine learning (ML) algorithms can be trained to classify VRUs using the spectral content of radar signals. The performance of these models depends on the quality and quantity of the data used during the training process. Currently, data collection is typically done through measurements or low fidelity physics, primitive-based simulations. The feasibility of carrying out measurements to collect training data is typically limited by the vast amounts of data required and practicality issues when using VRUs like animals. In this paper, we present a computationally efficient, high fidelity physics-based simulation workflow that can be used to obtain a large quantity of spectrograms from the micro-Doppler signatures of VRUs. The simulations are conducted on full-scale VRU models with a 77 GHz, frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar sensor model. Here, we collect the spectrograms of 4 targets; car, pedestrian, cyclist and dog at different speeds and angles-of-arrival. This data is then used to train a 5-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) that achieves nearly 100% classification accuracy after 5 epochs. Studies are conducted to investigate the impact of training data size, velocity and observation time window size on the accuracy of the CNN. Results from this study demonstrate how an accuracy of 95% can be realized using spectrograms obtained over a 0.2 s time window.

AB Driver model is the most basic and important model for moving direction control of autonomous vehicles and it has been extensively studied from the perspective of precision and robustness of control, driving safety, and riding comfort. However, human-like driver model is a rarely mentioned research issue. In this paper, we first establish three preview-based driver models in PreScan + Simulink and collect human drivers' steering data on four two-way and two-lane free curved roads with 20 experienced drivers and one experimental vehicle under four specified speeds. Then, the similarities between steering wheel angles of preview-based models and those of human drivers are compared through dynamic time warping (DTW). From the calculation results of DTW and analysis of human drivers' gaze positions, it shows that the preview-based models are hard to reflect the characteristics of human drivers' maneuver. To this end, we propose a human-like driver model based on the continuity of human drivers' steering wheel angles. The experienced drivers' steering wheel angels are modeled with three different kinds of multivariate multi-step recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and the inputs of models are historical speeds, historical road curvatures, future road curvatures, and historical steering wheel angles, as well as the outputs are future steering wheel angles. By comparing the three RNN-based driver models with different configuration structures and historical steps, it is found that the long short-term memory (LSTM) model has the best prediction performance in validation and testing period. In this way, a data-driven human-like driver model is developed to generate human-like steering wheel angles on curved roads.

ID MAP-MATCHING ALGORITHMS; VEHICLE; INFORMATION; TRACKING
AB Lane-level road network updating is crucial for urban traffic applications that use geographic information systems contributing to, for example, intelligent driving, route planning and traffic control. Researchers have developed various algorithms to update road networks using sensor data, such as high-definition images or GPS data; however, approaches that involve change detection for road networks at lane level using GPS data are less common. This paper presents a novel method for automatic change detection of lane-level road networks based on GPS trajectories of vehicles. The proposed method includes two steps: map matching at lane level and lane-level change recognition. To integrate the most up-to-date GPS data with a lane-level road network, this research uses a fuzzy logic road network matching method. The proposed map-matching method starts with a confirmation of candidate lane-level road segments that use error ellipses derived from the GPS data, and then computes the membership degree between GPS data and candidate lane-level segments. The GPS trajectory data is classified into successful or unsuccessful matches using a set of defuzzification rules. Any topological and geometrical changes to road networks are detected by analysing the two kinds of matching results and comparing their relationships with the original road network. Change detection results for road networks in Wuhan, China using collected GPS trajectories show that these methods can be successfully applied to detect lane-level road changes including added lanes, closed lanes and lane-changing and turning rules, while achieving a robust detection precision of above 80%.

ID UNDERWATER; DESIGN
AB The paper treats the question of suboptimal dive plane control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) using the state-dependent Riccati equation (SDRE) technique. The SDRE method provides an effective mean of designing nonlinear control systems for minimum as well as nonminimum phase AUV models. It is assumed that the hydrodynamic parameters of the nonlinear vehicle model are imprecisely known, and in order to obtain a practical design, a hard constraint on control fin deflection is imposed. The problem of depth control is treated as a robust nonlinear output (depth) regulation problem with constant disturbance and reference exogenous signals. As such an internal model of first-order fed by the tracking error is constructed. A quadratic performance index is chosen for optimization and the algebraic Riccati equation is solved to obtain a suboptimal control law for the model with unconstrained input. For the design of model with fin angle constraints, a slack variable is introduced to transform the constrained control input problem into an unconstrained problem, and a suboptimal control law is designed for the augmented system using a modified performance index. Using the center manifold theorem, it is shown that in the closed-loop system, the system trajectories are regulated to a manifold (called output zeroing manifold) on which the depth tracking error is zero and the equilibrium state is asymptotically stable. Simulation results are presented which show that effective depth control is accomplished in spite of the uncertainties in the system parameters and control fin deflection constraints.

AB This paper describes an approach to the construction of three-dimensional stochastic models for intelligent systems exploring an underwater environment. Important characteristics shared by such applications are: (1) real-time constraints; (2) unstructured, three-dimensional terrain; (3) high-bandwidth sensors providing redundant, overlapping coverage; (4) lack of prior knowledge about the environment; and (5) inherent inaccuracy or ambiguity in sensing and interpretation. The paper develops an underlying theory of stochastic backprojection and demonstrates how such an approach satisfies these five needs for undersea robotics.
   Models are cast as three-dimensional spatial decompositions of stochastic feature vectors. A numerical approach to incorporating new sensor information is derived from an incremental adaptation of the summation method for image reconstruction. Error and ambiguity are accounted for by blurring a spatial projection of remote-sensor data before combining them stochastically with the model. By exploiting the redundancy in high-bandwidth sensing, model certainty and resolution are enhanced as more data accumulate. In the case of a three-dimensional profiling sonar, the model converges to a ''fuzzy'' surface distribution from which a deterministic surface map is extracted.
   To verify the fundamental properties of stochastic backprojection and the resulting models, computer simulations are used to demonstrate: impulse and ramp responses; mitigation of artifacts caused by deterministic processing; incremental increase in accuracy and reduction of uncertainty; and convergence. Two examples illustrate how this approach has been successfully applied in the field for three-dimensional modeling of a sunken shipwreck by a remote undersea vehicle and for backscatter modeling of undersea terrain.

AB The growing interest in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) from both the scientific and industrial sectors has attracted a wave of new researchers and substantial investments in this expansive field. However, due to the wide range of topics and subdomains within UAV research, newcomers may find themselves overwhelmed by the numerous options available. It is therefore crucial for those involved in UAV research to recognize its interdisciplinary nature and its connections with other disciplines. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the UAV field, highlighting recent trends and advancements. Drawing on recent literature reviews and surveys, the review begins by classifying UAVs based on their flight characteristics. It then provides an overview of current research trends in UAVs, utilizing data from the Scopus database to quantify the number of scientific documents associated with each research direction and their interconnections. This paper also explores potential areas for further development in UAVs, including communication, artificial intelligence, remote sensing, miniaturization, swarming and cooperative control, and transformability. Additionally, it discusses the development of aircraft control, commonly used control techniques, and appropriate control algorithms in UAV research. Furthermore, this paper addresses the general hardware and software architecture of UAVs, their applications, and the key issues associated with them. It also provides an overview of current open source software and hardware projects in the UAV field. By presenting a comprehensive view of the UAV field, this paper aims to enhance our understanding of this rapidly evolving and highly interdisciplinary area of research.

AB In this study, we present, analyze, and validate a linear state-space model for a simplified rocket with four fins. The model is validated experimentally using a wind tunnel. The proposed model consists of two main elements: a rocket body and fins. The body is represented as a cylinder integrated from infinitesimal sections along the longitudinal direction (x-axis), and each fin is interpreted as an individual rigid body. Applying a linear state space facilitates the use of linear analysis tools, leading to expedient system stability assessment and controller design. Stability analysis of the specific model is performed for validation. The results of the analysis showed that the phase margins of pitching and yawing were 16.9(degrees), and that of rolling was 2.21(degrees). However, the linearized state space carries the risk of discrepancies with the actual dynamics. The model is experimentally validated in a wind tunnel to reduce risk. The rocket model is affixed to a stationary jig in a wind tunnel and has four degrees of freedom. This arrangement allows for the verification of a coupled three-axis rotational model. The results show convergence within an average similarity of 77% in the linear range, confirming the reliability of the model. The validated model can be used for comprehensive analyses including control system design, performance optimization, and robustness analysis of a rocket with four fins in the future.

AB The 3GPP has standardized the 5G New Radio (NR) sidelink (SL) technology that enables direct device-to-device communications. SL will be key in realizing several high-speed, low-latency vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications, such as automated driving. To meet these applications' high data rate requirements, operating SL at mmWave and sub-THz frequencies will be essential. However, the current SL design primarily caters to sub-6 GHz frequencies and does not consider the directionality of transmissions at high frequencies. For Mode 2 of SL, where SL UEs perform sensing-based autonomous resource selection, this results in hidden node interference due to the transmit (Tx) UE's inability to sense transmissions not aligned with the primary direction of communication. We propose paired transmission and sensing of sidelink control information (SCI), whereby SL Tx UEs transmit and receive SCI in an additional paired direction directly opposite to the primary direction. This helps eliminate hidden node interference while reducing the number of exposed nodes. Simulations in NR V2X highway deployments show that the paired scheme improves the average packet reception ratio (PRR) by 27% over the state-of-the-art at the highest traffic loads. We also propose enhanced transmit power control strategies to minimize interference between concurrent SL transmissions. This enables better resource reuse and further improves performance, with our combined solution achieving at least 95% average PRR in all scenarios. Finally, we present a stochastic geometry-based analytical model for a single-lane highway V2X network and validate it against simulation results. Our model provides insights into the reliability and capacity of high-frequency SL networks.

AB Accuracy is the most critical factor that affects the effect of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) airdrop. The method to improve the accuracy of UAV airdrop based on traditional modeling has some limitations such as complex modeling, multiple model parameters and difficulty in considering all kinds of factors comprehensively when facing complex realistic environment. In order to solve the problem of UAV precision airdrop more conveniently, this paper introduces the deep reinforcement learning method and proposes an Adaptive Priority Experience Replay Deep Double Q-Network (APER-DDQN) algorithm based on Deep Double Q-Network (DDQN). This method introduces the priority experience replay mechanism based on DDQN, and adopts adaptive discount rate and learning rate to improve the decision-making performance and stability of the algorithm. Furthermore, this paper designs and builds a simulation experimental platform for algorithm training and testing. The experimental results show that our APER-DDQN has good performance and can more effectively solve the problem of UAV accurate airdrop while avoiding the complex modeling process. Firstly, in the training stage, compared with DDQN and Deep Q Network (DQN), APER-DDQN has faster convergence speed, higher reward and more stable performance. Then, in the test phase, compared with relying on human experience, our method shows higher average reward (average 3.01) and success rate (average 41%), and our method also has more advantages in performance compared with DDQN and DQN. Finally, extended experiments verify the generalization ability of APER-DDQN to different environments.

AB As a typical underactuated mechanical system, offshore ship-mounted cranes are widely used to carry out the tasks of transferring cargos from one ship to another in the marine environment. Different from land-fixed cranes as well as traditional harbor cranes, offshore ship-to-ship crane systems work in two noninertial (ship) frames, while the target locations of the cargos are also inevitably influenced by the movements of the target ship. Besides, various external disturbances, which are caused by persistent sea waves, sea winds, or currents, etc., bring much more challenges to the control task of offshore ship-to-ship crane systems. To properly address these practical problems, in this article, we propose an increased adaptive neural network (NN)-based anti-swing tracking control strategy for such coordinated offshore crane systems, with a ship-motion prediction algorithm suggested to generate the target trajectories for cargos, and an adaptive NN proposed to deal with complicated unknown wave-induced disturbances. Bounded tracking performance is also guaranteed through a complete Lyapunov-based stability analysis. To the best of our knowledge, without any simplification of the original nonlinear dynamics, this article provides a high-performance adaptive control approach to deal with the anti-interference tracking control problem for offshore ship-to-ship crane systems, which are subjected to trajectories uncertainties as well as unknown wave motions disturbances. Furthermore, comparative hardware experimental results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed control method.

AB Truck platooning is a promising strategy to not only reduce the workload of truck drivers but also to increase the efficiency of freight transportation. In addition, truck platooning is expected to contribute to the increase in highway capacity, which causes changes in travel demand and travel time patterns. The reliable identification of the impacts of truck platooning based on a scientific and systematic approach is a fundamental task for implementing truck platooning in practice and maximizing its effectiveness. The purpose of this study is to quantify the benefits of travel time savings that would be achieved as a result of truck platooning. A nice feature of the proposed methodology is the integration of microscopic and macroscopic phenomena in its evaluation framework. First, micro-level analysis was conducted to identify the change in highway capacity in a mixed traffic stream consisting of truck platoons and general vehicles. A widely used microscopic traffic simulator, VISSIM, was adopted to quantify the rate of change of the capacity. For the macro-level analysis, the transportation planning software TransCAD was used to estimate the extent of the reduction in travel times based on the increase in the capacity obtained from the micro-level analysis. Simulations based on the proposed methodology were performed on Korean freeways of 3 or more lanes. It was observed that truck platooning would result in annual benefits of travel time savings corresponding to approximately 187.6 billion Korean won (167.7 million US $) in 2020. The results are expected to support various policy-making activities to facilitate the implementation of truck platooning on freeways.

AB Deep-sea mineral deposits potentially represent vast metal resources that could make a major contribution to future global raw material supply. Increasing demand for these metals, many of which are required to enable a low-carbon and high-technology society and to relieve pressure on land-based resources, may result in deep sea mining within the next decade. Seafloor massive sulphide (SMS) deposits, containing abundant copper, zinc, gold and silver, have been the subject of recent and ongoing commercial interest. Although many seafloor hydrothermally systems have been studied, inactive SMS deposits are likely more accessible to future mining and far more abundant, but are often obscured by pelagic sediment and hence difficult tolocate. Furthermore, SMS deposits are three dimensional. Yet, to date, very few have been explored or sampled below the seafloor. Here, we describe the most comprehensive study to date of hydrothermally extinct seafloor massive sulphide (eSMS) deposits formed at a slow spreading ridge. Our approach involved two research cruises in the summer of 2016 to the Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse (TAG) hydrothermal field at 26 N on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. These expeditions mapped a number of hydrothermally extinct SMS deposits using an autonomous underwater vehicle and remotely operated vehicle, acquired a combination of geophysical data including sub-seafloor seismic reflection and refraction data from 25 ocean bottom instruments, and recovered core using a robotic lander-type seafloor drilling rig. Together, these results that have allowed us to construct a new generic model for extinct seafloor massive sulphide deposits indicate the presence of up to five times more massive sulphide at and below the seafloor than was previously thought.

AB The horizontal alignment of existing highways may be identified by using several terrestrial or aerial geomatics technologies. Such technologies involve different levels of precision and accuracy; hence, different results can be expected. At present, there are no comparisons available between the solutions resulting from the use of different technologies and data sources for the same road alignment.
   In this investigation, a number of terrestrial mobile mapping techniques and data collection strategies were evaluated. The centerline of a 3.6 km section of a highway was used to estimate radii, centers of curvature and orientation of tangents. Two statistical fitting methods were used to back-calculate these parameters, and the results were then compared with as-built alignment data.
   Terrestrial images from a mobile mapping vehicle were used to determine the centerline, which was also estimated as the average line of the carriageway and pavement edges, and as the average line of the two driving trajectories. Positions were surveyed using low-cost sensors (an integrated GPS-IMU platform, HD webcam). For comparison purposes, aerial orthophotos and a GNSS (high-cost) receiver were used simultaneously. Although the GPS-IMU data and estimated trajectories provided results comparable to those of the GNSS receiver, the use of georeferenced images proved less accurate. The results and comments in the paper should be of use to survey practitioners when they need to select an acquisition methodology appropriate to the desired level of accuracy and in line with budget constraints.

AB Recent and continuing advances in active safety vehicle technology have created new possibilities for improving road safety. Crash-avoidance systems with the capability to warn and assist drivers are now available in most automotive market in developed countries. Despite this availability, investment in high-technology transit buses to prevent fatalities and injuries has been very slow. In this paper, we examine the safety benefits of using forward- and side-collision warning systems and active collision avoidance systems in transit buses in New York City and Bogota, Colombia. Using historical data, we develop a transportation risk profile for each city by type of user (driver, passenger, pedestrian, and bicyclist) and crash severity. Because there is no historical data on the effectiveness of crash avoidance systems on buses in the U.S., we surveyed 12 leading experts on autonomous and connected vehicles to assess the potential reduction in injuries and fatalities in road crashes that involve buses. We report on the agreements and disagreements of expert's judgments and contrast their judgment with the break-even combination of risk reduction needed to overcome the cost of providing crash avoidance technology in the bus fleet. Additionally, we perform a benefit-cost analysis under uncertainty using Monte Carlo simulation to compute distributions of benefit-cost-ratio. The benefit-cost analysis reveals that implementing any of the technologies in NYC is economically justifiable. In Bogota, even though fatality and injury risks are higher, statistical valuation of lives and injuries are much lower. As a consequence, policy makers are likely to reject the investment in the technologies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB One long-standing challenge in robotics is the realization of mobile autonomous robots able to operate safely in human workplaces, and be accepted by the human occupants. We describe the development of a multiton robotic forklift intended to operate alongside people and vehicles, handling palletized materials within existing, active outdoor storage facilities. The system has four novel characteristics. The first is a multimodal interface that allows users to efficiently convey task-level commands to the robot using a combination of pen-based gestures and natural language speech. These tasks include the manipulation, transport, and placement of palletized cargo within dynamic, human-occupied warehouses. The second is the robot's ability to learn the visual identity of an object from a single user-provided example and use the learned model to reliably and persistently detect objects despite significant spatial and temporal excursions. The third is a reliance on local sensing that allows the robot to handle variable palletized cargo and navigate within dynamic, minimally prepared environments without a global positioning system. The fourth concerns the robot's operation in close proximity to people, including its human supervisor, pedestrians who may cross or block its path, moving vehicles, and forklift operators who may climb inside the robot and operate it manually. This is made possible by interaction mechanisms that facilitate safe, effective operation around people. This paper provides a comprehensive description of the system's architecture and implementation, indicating how real-world operational requirements motivated key design choices. We offer qualitative and quantitative analyses of the robot operating in real settings and discuss the lessons learned from our effort.

TI A Small-Scale Comparison of Iceland Scallop Size Distributions Obtained

AB An approach is developed to estimate size of Iceland scallop shells from AUV photos. A small-scale camera based AUV survey of Iceland scallops was conducted at a defined site off West Iceland. Prior to height estimation of the identified shells, the distortions introduced by the vehicle orientation and the camera lens were corrected. The average AUV pitch and roll was 1.3 and 2.3 deg that resulted in <2% error in ground distance rendering these effects negligible. A quadratic polynomial model was identified for lens distortion correction. This model successfully predicted a theoretical grid from a frame photographed underwater, representing the inherent lens distortion. The predicted shell heights were scaled for the distance from the bottom at which the photos were taken. This approach was validated by height estimation of scallops of known sizes. An underestimation of approximately 0.5 cm was seen, which could be attributed to pixel error, where each pixel represented 0.24 x 0.27 cm. After correcting for this difference the estimated heights ranged from 3.8-9.3 cm. A comparison of the height-distribution from a small-scale dredge survey carried out in the vicinity showed non-overlapping peaks in size distribution, with scallops of a broader size range visible in the AUV survey. Further investigations are necessary to evaluate any underlying bias and to validate how representative these surveys are of the true population. The low resolution images made identification of smaller scallops difficult. Overall, the observations of very few small scallops in both surveys could be attributed to low recruitment levels in the recent years due to the known scallop parasite outbreak in the region.

AB One-stage 3D object detection using mobile light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has developed rapidly in recent years. Specifically, one-stage methods have attracted attention because of their high efficiency and light weight compared with two-stage methods. Inspired by this, we present the semantic segmentation assisted one-stage three-dimensional vehicle object detection (SSA3D), a network for the rapid detection of objects that keeps the advantages of the semantic segmentation module in the two-stage methods without increasing redundant computational load. First, we modified the sampling of the farthest point to improve the quality of the sampling points. This helps to reduce sampling outlier points and bad points that are difficult to perceive in the spatial structure information surrounding the point. Second, a neighbor attention group module is devoted to selectively add extra weight to neighbor points because of the different importance of neighbor points for the corresponding sampling point. Correctly increasing the weight is helpful to obtain richer spatial structure information. Finally, a delicate box generation module is included as a voted center point layer based on the generalized Hoff vote method and an anchor-free regression. We used the feature aggregation module as the backbone and the feature propagation module as the auxiliary network to achieve efficiency. At the same time, the auxiliary network retains the ability to extract point-wise features from the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation network. In experiments, we evaluated and tested the SSA3D on a common KITTI dataset and achieved improved performance in the class of car accuracy.

AB The autonomous real-time optical navigation of planetary unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is of the key technologies to ensure the success of the exploration. In such a GPS-denied environment, vision-based localization is an optimal approach. In this article, we proposed a terrain aided simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, which simultaneously reconstructs the 3-D map point of environment and estimates the location of a planet UAV based on preexisting digital elevation model (DEM). To directly georeference the onboard UAV images to the digital terrain model, a theoretical model is proposed to prove that topographic features of UAV image and DEM can be correlated in the frequency domain via cross power spectrum. To provide the six-DOF of the UAV, we developed an optimization approach, which fuses the geo-referencing result into an SLAM system via local bundle adjustment (LBA) to achieve robust and accurate vision-based navigation even in featureless planetary areas. To test the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed localization algorithm, a new dataset for planetary drone navigation is proposed based on simulation engine. The proposed dataset includes 40 200 synthetic drone images taken from nine planetary scenes with related DEM query images. Comparison experiments are carried out to demonstrate that over the flight distance of 33.8 km, the proposed method achieved an average localization error of 0.45 m, compared to 1.32 m by ORB-SLAM2 and 0.75 m by ORB-SLAM3, with the processing speed of 12 Hz, which will ensure real-time performance. We will make our datasets available to encourage further work on this topic.

AB The vehicular network is taking great attention from both academia and industry to enable the intelligent transportation system (ITS), autonomous driving, and smart cities. The system provides extremely dynamic features due to the fast mobile characteristics. While the number of different applications in the vehicular network is growing fast, the quality of service (QoS) in the 5G vehicular network becomes diverse. One of the most stringent requirements in the vehicular network is a safety-critical real-time system. To guarantee low-latency and other diverse QoS requirements, wireless network resources should be effectively utilized and allocated among vehicles, such as computation power in cloud, fog, and edge servers; spectrum at roadside units (RSUs); and base stations (BSs). Historically, optimization problems have mostly been investigated to formulate resource allocation and are solved by mathematical computation methods. However, the optimization problems are usually nonconvex and hard to be solved. Recently, machine learning (ML) is a powerful technique to cope with the complexity in computation and has capability to cope with big data and data analysis in the heterogeneous vehicular network. In this paper, an overview of resource allocation in the 5G vehicular network is represented with the support of traditional optimization and advanced ML approaches, especially a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method. In addition, a federated deep reinforcement learning- (FDRL-) based vehicular communication is proposed. The challenges, open issues, and future research directions for 5G and toward 6G vehicular networks, are discussed. A multiaccess edge computing assisted by network slicing and a distributed federated learning (FL) technique is analyzed. A FDRL-based UAV-assisted vehicular communication is discussed to point out the future research directions for the networks.

AB Digital terrain model (DTM) generation is essential to recreating terrain morphology once the external elements are removed. Traditional survey methods are still used to collect accurate geographic data on the land surface. Given the emergence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with low-cost digital cameras and better photogrammetric methods for digital mapping, efficient approaches are necessary to allow rapid land surveys with high accuracy. This paper provides a review, complemented with the authors' experience, regarding the UAV photogrammetric process and field survey parameters for DTM generation using popular commercial photogrammetric software to process images obtained with fixed-wing or multicopter UAVs. We analyzed the quality and accuracy of the DTMs based on four categories: (i) the UAV system (UAV platforms and camera); (ii) flight planning and image acquisition (flight altitude, image overlap, UAV speed, orientation of the flight line, camera configuration, and georeferencing); (iii) photogrammetric DTM generation (software, image alignment, dense point cloud generation, and ground filtering); (iv) geomorphology and land use/cover. For flat terrain, UAV photogrammetry provided a horizontal root mean square error (RMSE) between 1 to 3 x the ground sample distance (GSD) and a vertical RMSE between 1 to 4.5 x GSD, and, for complex topography, a horizontal RMSE between 1 to 7 x GSD and a vertical RMSE between 1.5 to 5 x GSD. Finally, we stress that UAV photogrammetry can provide DTMs with high accuracy when the photogrammetric process variables are optimized.

AB Real-time driving risk status prediction is critical for developing proactive traffic intervention strategies and enhance driving safety. However, the optimal observation time window length and prediction time window length, which should be the prerequisite for the timeliness and accuracy of real-time driving risk status prediction model, have been rarely explored in previous studies. In this study, a methodology which integrates driving risk status identification, rolling time window-based feature extraction, real-time driving risk status prediction and driving risk influencing factors analysis was proposed to accurately evaluate and predict real-time driving risk status. The methodology was tested based on 1,440 car-following events from Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study. Results show that four driving risk statuses (safe, low-risk, median-risk and high-risk) are most appropriate to establish risk labelling criteria. In addition, results from driving risk status prediction show that when the observation time window length is 0.5 s, the accuracy rate of predicting medium-risk or high-risk status occurring in the next 0.7 s is higher than 85 % using multi-layer perceptron model. Meanwhile, the results from the analysis of influencing factors show that the input variables related to the risk status score higher in the ranking of feature importance. A part from that, speed difference, headway distance, speed and acceleration are still important in predicting driving risk status. The proposed methods in this paper can be applied in connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) to reduce driver cognitive workload and hence improve driving safety fed with naturalistic driving data collected using in-vehicle systems.

AB The early recognition and understanding of the actions performed by pedestrians in traffic scenes leads to an anticipation of pedestrian intentions in advance and helps in the process of collision warning and avoidance in the context of autonomous vehicles. An environment with low visibility conditions such as night-time, fog, heavy rain or smoke increases the number of difficult situations in traffic. A complete and original model for assessing if a pedestrian is engaged in a street cross action using only infrared monocular scene perception is proposed in this paper. The assessment of a street cross action is done by the time series analysis of features like: pedestrian motion, position of pedestrians with respect to the drivable area and their distance with respect to the ego-vehicle. The extraction of these features emerges from the combination of a deep learning based pedestrian detector with an original tracking algorithm, a semantic segmentation of the road surface and a time series long-short term memory network based action recognition. In order to validate the proposed method we introduce a new dataset named CROSSIR. It is formed of pedestrian annotations, action annotations and semantic labels for the road. The CROSSIR dataset is suitable for several common computer vision algorithms: (1) pedestrian detection and tracking algorithms because each pedestrian has a unique identifier over the frames in which it appears; (2) pedestrian action recognition; (3) semantic segmentation of the road pixels in the infrared image.

AB A Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANETs) is an autonomous technology that creates a self-organized wireless network via Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAVs). In this network, all UAVs can communicate within a restricted range of wireless communication in the absence of fixed infrastructure. As a result of high mobility, the limited energy, and the communication range of UAVs, network forming and deformation between them are very frequent that causes packet delivery failure. Therefore, a stable route is always needed to ensure effective data dissemination between source and destination in FANETs. Since it has drastically changing network topology, therefore, to maintain the stable route during packet transmission, there is a need for a suitable routing protocol. This paper proposes an Optimized Location-Aided Routing (O-LAR) protocol which is the modified version of Location-Aided Routing (LAR) protocol. Our protocol's novelty comes from the fact that it established an optimal route between UAVs for information dissemination towards their respective destination UAV by considering weight function. A weighted function is used to decide the best next-hop node selection based on the parameters like residual energy, distance, and UAV movement direction. The performance of the O-LAR is evaluated mathematically and simulated through the NS-2 simulator. The empirical results attest that O-LAR improves the link duration, network lifetime, packet delivery ratio, and average throughput compared with the state-of-the-art protocols: LEPR, D-LAR, and LAR. Further, the proposed scheme reduces the number of next-hops, routing overhead and end-to-end delay compared to the state-of-the-art protocols.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of task-induced fatigue in prolonged conditional automated driving on takeover performance. Background: In conditional automated driving, the driver can engage in non-driving related tasks (NDRTs) and does not have to monitor the system and the driving environment. In the event that the system hits its limits, the human driver must regain control of the car. To ensure safety, adequate driver fallback performance is necessary. Effects of the drivers' state and the engagement in NDRTs need to be investigated. Method: Seventy-three participants experienced prolonged conditional automated rides and simultaneously had to engage in either an activating quiz or a fatiguing monitoring task (between subjects). After 50 minutes, a takeover situation occurred, and participants had to regain control of the car. Results: Prolonged conditional automated driving and simultaneously engaging in NDRTs affected the driver's state and the takeover performance of the participants. Takeover performance was impaired when participants had to deal with monotonous NDRTs. Conclusion: An engagement in monotonous monitoring tasks in conditional automated driving affects the driver's state and takeover performance when it comes to takeover situations. Especially in prolonged automated driving, an adequate driver state seems to be necessary for safety reasons. Application: The results of this study demonstrate that engagement in monotonous NDRTs while driving conditionally automated may negatively affect takeover performance. A monitoring of the driver state and adapted assistance in a takeover situation seems to be a good opportunity to ensure safety.

AB This paper discusses a path planning and control method developed for robotic application in roadway crack sealing. Filling and scaling of roadway cracks is a tedious operation subject to poor working conditions. Application of autonomous robotics to this operation requires a path planning system that can take data representing roadway cracks from an external sensor, extract connected crack paths, and link paths together to form the Cartesian motion for the robotic system used to seal the crack. Since the operation is performed in an on-line fashion, the path planning system has to perform kinematic computations based on dead-reckoning data to update the crack profile as the crack sealing vehicle is moving. Stringent requirements are placed on the controller by the errors inherent in the global path generation, along with the fact that to avoid kinematic singularities, the manipulator used is kinematically redundant. The system developed uses a robust controller known as the simplified Cartesian computed torque (SCCT) to guide the end-effector along with a compliance loop to move the desired trajectory over the crack, while also addressing kinematic redundancy through application of the weighted generalized inverse Jacobian, The contributions of this paper are on developing practical applications of image processing techniques to extract path locations and determine the appropriate Cartesian end-effector paths, as well as the development of a simple but robust compliant redundant robot controller, all for use in the unstructured environment encountered in highway maintenance operations, The system described has been implemented as part of a prototype automated crack sealing machine. Sample results for actual highway data are included.

AB Underwater wireless communication is a rapidly growing field, especially with the recent emergence of technologies such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). To support the high-bandwidth applications using these technologies, underwater optics has attracted significant attention, alongside its complementary technology - underwater acoustics. In this paper, we propose a hybrid opto-acoustic underwater wireless communication model that reduces network power consumption and supports high-data rate underwater applications by selecting appropriate communication links in response to varying traffic loads and dynamic weather conditions. Underwater optics offers high data rates and consumes less power. However, due to the severe absorption of light in the medium, the communication range is short in underwater optics. Conversely, acoustics suffers from low data rate and high power consumption, but provides longer communication ranges. Since most underwater equipment relies on battery power, energy-efficient communication is critical for reliable underwater communications. In this work, we derive analytical models for both underwater acoustics and optics, and calculate the required transmit power for reliable communications in various underwater communication environments. We then formulate an optimization problem that minimizes the network power consumption for carrying data from underwater nodes to surface sinks under varying traffic loads and weather conditions. The proposed optimization model can be solved offline periodically, hence the additional computational complexity to find the optimum solution for larger networks is not a limiting factor for practical applications. Our results indicate that the proposed technique yields up to 35% power savings compared to existing opto-acoustic solutions.

AB This article presents a remote management architecture of an unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) fleet to aid in the management of solar power plants and object tracking. The proposed system is a competitive advantage for sola r energy production plants, due to the reduction in costs for maintenance, surveillance, and security tasks, especially in large solar farms. This new approach consists of creating a hardware and software architecture that allows for performing different tasks automatically, as well as remotely using fleets of UAVs. The entire system, composed of the aircraft, the servers, communication networks, and the processing center, as well as the interfaces for accessing the services via the web, has been designed for this specific purpose. Image processing and automated remote control of the UAV allow generating autonomous missions for the inspection of defects in solar panels, saving costs compared to traditional manual inspection. Another application of this architecture related to security is the detection and tracking of pedestrians and vehicles, both for road safety and for surveillance and security issues of solar plants. The novelty of this system with respect to current systems is summarized in that all the software and hardware elements that allow the inspection of solar panels, surveillance, and people counting, as well as traffic management tasks, have been defined and detailed. The modular system presented allows the exchange of different specific vision modules for each task to be carried out. Finally, unlike other systems, calibrated fixed cameras are used in addition to the cameras embedded in the drones of the fleet, which complement the system with vision algorithms based on deep learning for identification, surveillance, and inspection.

AB This work considers the future of driving in terms of both its short- and long-term horizons. It conjectures that human-controlled driving will follow in the footsteps of a wide swath of other, now either residual or abandoned human occupations. Pursuits that have preceded it into oblivion. In this way, driving will dwindle down into only a few niche locales wherein enthusiasts will still persist, much in the way that steam train hobbyists now continue their own aspirational inclinations. Of course, the value of any such prognostication is in direct proportion to the degree that information is conveyed, and prospective uncertainty reduced. In more colloquial terms: the devil is in the details of these coming transitions. It is anticipated that we will see a progressive transformation of the composition of on-road traffic that will be registered most immediately in the realm of professional transportation in which the imperative for optimization exceeds that in virtually all other user segments. The transition from manual control to full automation will be more punctate than gradualist in its evolutionary development. As performance optimization slowly exhausts the commercial sector, it will progressively transition more into the discretionary realm by dint of simple technology transfer alone. The hedonic dimension of everyday driving will be dispersed and pursued by progressively fewer individuals. The traveling window of generational expectation will soon mean that human driving will be largely "forgotten," as each sequential generation matures without this, still presently common experience. Indications of this stage of progress are beginning to be witnessed in the demographic profile of vehicle usage and ownership rates. The purpose of the exposition which follows is to consider and support each of these stated propositions.

However, existing pedestrian simulators that make use of this technology have a set of limitations that make them unsuitable for the simulation of a large virtual scenario. Specifically, the boundaries of the virtual scene set by these simulators encompass a relatively small area (e.g., a single crosswalk). In light of these issues, this paper aims to develop an augmented reality (AR) enabled pedestrian-in-the-loop simulation (AR-PED) framework that enables the simulation of pedestrians in a large virtual scenario (e.g., a city) with an actual scale. The proposed AR-PED simulation framework is empowered by the latest advances in cloud computing and AR to allow multiple users to access the simulation at the same time. A client-server architecture allows users to act as pedestrians, drive a car or simply visualize the scene simultaneously. Additionally, other vehicles can be artificially generated by a microscopic traffic simulation (MTS) package that acts as the server. A prototype of the proposed framework is implemented and demonstrated by simulating a model of a city. The promising capabilities and performance of the AR-PED framework are attested with the deployable experiments and potential improvements over the present study to further excel the current framework are also discussed.

AB Localization of size-limited gamma-ray anomalies plays a fundamental role in uranium prospecting and environmental studies. Possibilities of a newly developed mini-airborne gamma-ray spectrometric equipment were tested on a uranium anomaly near the village of Tfebsko, Czech Republic. The measurement equipment was based on a scintillation gamma-ray spectrometer specially developed for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) mounted on powerful hexacopter. The gamma-ray spectrometer has two 103 cm(3) BGO scintillation detectors of relatively high sensitivity. The tested anomaly, which is 80 m by 40 m in size, was investigated by ground gamma-ray spectrometric measurement in a detail rectangular measurement grid. Average uranium concentration is 25 mg/kg eU attaining 700 mg/kg eU locally. The mini-airborne measurement across the anomaly was carried out on three 100 m long parallel profiles at eight flight altitudes from 5 to 40 m above the ground. The resulting 1 s 1024 channel gamma-ray spectra, recorded in counts per second (cps), were processed to concentration units of K, U and Th, while total count (TC) was reported in cps. Increased gamma ray intensity of the anomaly was indicated by mini-airborne measurement at all profiles and altitudes, including the highest altitude of 40 m, at which the recorded intensity is close to the natural radiation background. The reported instrument is able to record data with comparable quality as standard airborne survey, due to relative sensitive detector, lower flight altitude and relatively low flight speed of 1 m/s. The presented experiment brings new experience with using unmanned semi-autonomous aerial vehicles and the latest mini-airborne radiometric instrument. The experiment has demonstrated the instrument's ability to localize size-limited uranium anomalies.

AB This paper describes a novel concept for detecting and tracking underwater cables that differs from common detection methods, including visual, acoustic and magnetic detection, which are based on a survey platform, such as remotely operated vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles, and have high costs and require long-time monitoring. The proposed detection method can be performed in locations that are difficult to observe using cameras without the use of magnetic fields. The concept relies on low-cost flex sensors that provide underwater, real-time, whole cable detection. Building off of this concept, a detection system and an error analysis system were incorporated, which includes the characteristics of the flex sensors, the mounting structure for the flex sensors, and the underwater cable as well as the 2-D cable bend model and a water tank test. The detected data set, which was rendered on an observation monitor, provided visual feedback regarding any bending or warping problems. To evaluate the detection accuracy, mean absolute error and similarity analyses were performed using the observational data and sensor data obtained from the water tank test. The results of these analyses showed strong agreement between the fitted curve to the detected data and the observational curve, indicating acceptable error. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system for effective underwater cable detection. Thus, the results of this investigation clearly reveal the potential of the novel sensing technique for practical underwater cable detection and monitoring applications. However, the 2-D cable bending detection model is not suitable for 3-D bending or torsion, which will be considered in future research

TI A Diagnostic Tree Approach for Fault Cause Identification in the
   Attitude Control Subsystem of Satellites
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Space and Earth observation programs demand stringent guarantees ensuring smooth and reliable operations of space vehicles and satellites. Due to unforeseen circumstances and naturally occurring faults, it is desired that a fault-diagnosis system be capable of detecting, isolating, identifying, or classifying faults in the system. Unfortunately, none of the existing fault-diagnosis methodologies alone can meet all the requirements of an ideal fault-diagnosis system due to the variety of fault types, their severity, and handling mechanisms. However, it is possible to overcome these shortcomings through the integration of different existing fault-diagnosis methodologies.
   In this paper, a novel learning-based, diagnostic-tree approach is proposed which complements and strengthens existing efficient fault detection mechanisms with an additional ability to classify different types of faults to effectively determine potential fault causes in a subsystem of a satellite. This extra capability serves as a semiautomatic diagnostic decision support aid to expert human operators at ground stations and enables them to determine fault causes and to take quick and efficient recovery/reconfiguration actions. The developed diagnosis/analysis procedure exploits a qualitative technique denoted as diagnostic tree (DX-tree) analysis as a diagnostic tool for fault cause analysis in the attitude control subsystem (ACS) of a satellite. DX-trees constructed by our proposed machine-learning-based automatic tree synthesis algorithm are demonstrated to be able to determine both known and unforeseen combinations of events leading to different fault scenarios generated through synthetic attitude control subsystem data of a satellite. Though the immediate application of our proposed approach would be at ground stations, the proposed technique has potential for being integrated with causal model-based diagnosis and recovery techniques for future autonomous space vehicle missions.

AB The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is strongly advocated for sixth-generation (6G) networks, as the 6G standard will not be limited to improving broadband services, but will also target the extension of the geographical cellular coverage. In this context, the deployment of UAVs is considered a key solution for seamless connectivity and reliable coverage. That being said, it is important to underline that although UAVs are characterized by their high mobility and their ability to establish line-of-sight (LOS) links, their use is still impeded by several factors such as weather conditions, their limited computing power, and, most importantly, their limited energy. In this work, we are aiming for the novel technology that enables indefinite wireless power transfer for UAVs using laser beams. We propose a novel UAV deployment strategy, based on which we analyze the overall performance of the system in terms of wireless coverage. To this end, we use tractable tools from stochastic geometry to model the complex communication system. We analyze the user's connectivity profile under different laser charging capabilities and in different type of environments. We show a decrease in the coverage probability by more than 12% in moderate-to-strong turbulence conditions compared to low turbulence conditions. We also show how the connection rate to the aerial network significantly decreases in favor of the terrestrial network for short laser charging ranges. We conclude that laser-powered drones are considered interesting alternatives when placed in LOS with users, in low-to-moderate optical turbulence, and at reasonable ranges from the charging stations.

AB The emerging combination of Internet of Things (IoT) and aerospace integration aided by satellite and 6G communication techniques has stimulated the Internet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), i.e., Internet of Drones (IoD). To accommodate and share the enormous real-time UAV data, cloud-based IoD is an inevitable choice to lower the heavy burden of mobile UAVs. Nevertheless, how to protect highly sensitive UAV data in such a honest-but-curious, open and distributed environment with resource-limited UAVs is a significant challenge. Although our previous work (PATLDAC) in SPNCE'21 devises a cloud-based UAV data access control scheme with policy privacy protection, limited access time and user traceability, it incurs inflexible and centralized cloud data storage and access as well as untrustworthy metadata in untrusted cloud environment for data access and user tracing. To this end, we further propose a blockchain-based privacy-aware data access control (BPADAC) scheme for distributed and secure UAV data sharing in cloud-based IoD. Based on fine-grained, traceable and privacy-preserving UAV data access characteristic of our previous work, we extend it by leveraging blockchain and Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for distributed and trustful UAV data access and storage, together with reliable and limited access mechanism to guarantee cloud UAV data sharing service provision. We also design public and undeniable user tracing mechanism to prevent user key abuse with traitor denial. Finally, we present formal security analysis and prototype the system leveraging the smart contracts of Ethereum blockchain for performance evaluation to show the feasibility of BPADAC.

AB This paper proposes a novel lightweight security-enabled distributed software-defined drone network (SDDN) for traffic monitoring. Security of drone/Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) communication and data exchange is ensured through lightweight key generation and encryption/decryption algorithm. A hybrid (static and dynamic) OpenMP/MPI-based distributed processing is used to compute the security primitives for drone-to-drone communication. The proposed approach is more reliable, scalable and interoperable compared to other centralized logical control and incorporating network programming methods. Additionally, the use of cryptographic primitives and protocols make it more secure against attacks. A comparative analysis of proposed lightweight key generation and encryption/decryption algorithms with stateof-the-art algorithms shows that both proposed algorithms require fewer Gate Equivalents (GEs), and it varies from 18.4k to 29.6k. In terms of performance, both algorithms' computational delay varies from 1.5 to 2 s. Jitter lies between 0.7 msec and 2 msec. The proposed algorithms are found to have communicational costs varying with 0.4 and 0.7 times of input in bytes with a base value of 1.4 and 1.25. Further, energy consumption is varying with 0.4 and 0.7 times of input in bytes with a base value of 0.3 and 0.25. Security interruption probability variation analysis show that the proposed security algorithms are better compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Further, security analysis of both algorithms (using a statistical and formal model) shows that the proposed system is protected against various attacks.

AB Over 600 000 bridges in the U.S. must be inspected every two years to identify flaws, defects, or potential problems that may need follow-up maintenance. Bridge inspection has adopted unmanned aerial vehicles (or drones) for improving safety, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Although drones can operate in an autonomous mode, keeping inspectors in the loop is critical for complex tasks in bridge inspection. Therefore, inspectors need to develop the skill and confidence to operate drones in their jobs. This article presents the design and development of a virtual-reality-based training and assessment system for inspectors assisted by a drone in bridge inspection. The system is composed of four integrated modules: a simulated bridge inspection developed in Unity, an interface that allows a trainee to operate the drone in simulation using a remote controller, data monitoring and analysis to provide real-time in-task feedback to trainees to assist their learning, and a post-study assessment supporting personalized training. This article also conducts a proof-of-concept pilot study to illustrate the functionality of this system. The study demonstrated that the training and assessment system for bridge inspection with an assistant drone, as a tool for the early-stage training, can objectively identify the training needs of individuals in detail and, further, help them develop the skill and confidence in collaborating with a drone in bridge inspection. The system has built a modeling and analysis platform for exploring advanced solutions to the human-drone cooperative inspection of civil infrastructure.

AB Video analytics using networked smart cameras has become a core function for many applications including surveillance, object detection, AR/VR, and so on. In recent years, a number of architectures have been proposed to organize the computing and networking resources of cloud and edge cameras to collectively complete an analytics task (e.g., 3D reconstruction, multi-view re-identification). Unfortunately, in many applications, image sharing can lead to privacy con-cerns. One example is the high definition map (HD map) for autonomous driving. An HD map has a highly dynamic layer of real-time objects. Vehicles can collectively contribute videos from their onboard cameras to construct such a layer, but the video images can contain private information (e.g., the license plate numbers of front cars). In this article, we propose FEVA, a new federat-ed video analytics architecture. Intrinsically, FEVA keeps the video image data local to the edge for analytics and transmits the analytics results to the cloud for aggregation. FEVA partitions the video analytics computing tasks in a way that is priva-cy-preserving and maximizes the overall analytics accuracy under the computing and communication resource constraints of the edge devices. We show how FEVA can be used in practice by a case study using FEVA to support a video analyt-ics application on multi-view vehicles 3D reconstruction. We implement FEVA by extending the open source platform TensorFlow Federated from Google. We deploy our case in an environment with four Amazon OeepLens cameras. Our eval-uation shows that FEVA can protect privacy while effectively increasing the accuracy of the video analytics application.

AB This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on applications of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in communications and networking. Modern networks, e.g., Internet of Things (IoT) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, become more decentralized and autonomous. In such networks, network entities need to make decisions locally to maximize the network performance under uncertainty of network environment. Reinforcement learning has been efficiently used to enable the network entities to obtain the optimal policy including, e.g., decisions or actions, given their states when the state and action spaces are small. However, in complex and large-scale networks, the state and action spaces are usually large, and the reinforcement learning may not be able to find the optimal policy in reasonable time. Therefore, DRL, a combination of reinforcement learning with deep learning, has been developed to overcome the shortcomings. In this survey, we first give a tutorial of DRL from fundamental concepts to advanced models. Then, we review DRL approaches proposed to address emerging issues in communications and networking. The issues include dynamic network access, data rate control, wireless caching, data offloading, network security, and connectivity preservation which are all important to next generation networks, such as 5G and beyond. Furthermore, we present applications of DRL for traffic routing, resource sharing, and data collection. Finally, we highlight important challenges, open issues, and future research directions of applying DRL.

AB A networked system consisting of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), automated logistic service stations (LSSs), customer interface software, system orchestration algorithms and UAV control software can be exploited to provide persistent service to its customers. With efficient algorithms for UAV task planning, the UAVs can autonomously serve the customers in real time. Nearly uninterrupted customer service may be accomplished via the cooperative hand-off of customer tasks from weary UAVs to ones that have recently been replenished at an LSS. With the goal of enabling the autonomy of the task planning tasks, we develop a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for the problem of providing simultaneous. UAV escort service to multiple customers across a field of operations with multiple sharable LSSs. This MILP model provides a formal representation of our problem and enables use in a rolling horizon planner via allowance of arbitrary UAV initial locations and consumable reservoir status (e.g., battery level). As such, it enables automation of the orchestration of system activities. To address computational complexity, we develop efficient heuristics to rapidly derive near optimal solutions. A receding horizon task assignment (RHTA) heuristic and sequential task assignment heuristic (STAH) are developed. STAH exploits properties observed in optimal solutions obtained for small problems via CPLEX. Numerical studies suggest that RHTA and STAH are 45 and 2100 times faster than solving the MILP via CPLEX, respectively. Both heuristics perform well relative to the optimal solution obtained via CPLEX. An example demonstrating the use of the approach for rolling horizon planning is provided.

AB As vehicles integrate more and more autonomous driving functionalities, it becomes more and more important to use vehicular networks to fully guarantee the safety and real-time performance of on-board computing tasks. Current studies on vehicular networks pay much attention to the performance improvement of network communication and resource allocation, while ignoring the fact that automotive on-board computing tasks play a significant role in vehicle safety and need to be elegantly handled in vehicular networks. In this article, we propose a hybrid scheduling framework for meeting all hard real-time task deadlines while minimizing soft real-time task deadline misses. In particular, the proposed scheduler is composed of some local schedulers and a global scheduler, where the former guarantees the schedulability of all hard real-time tasks, and the latter decides the assignment of soft real-time jobs dynamically online. Depending on the remaining processing capability of a vehicular network, arrival jobs are either assigned for further processing or discarded. An approach combining the utilization-based schedulability test and demand-supply analysis is proposed to effectively assign tasks to processors offline. To meet as many soft real-time task deadlines as possible, tasks' demand and supply bounds are computed at runtime, such that online execution information can be used to compensate for the scheduling loss with the worst-case assumption made by the offline test. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to a genetic algorithm, our proposed approach needs far less computation to assign more tasks offline. The online scheduling also saves many soft real-time jobs that were to be dropped by the offline algorithm.

AB In recent years, rapid advancements in the Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) industry have greatly motivated the research and development in pedestrian trajectory prediction and risk assessment. One of the critical requirements for AVs is to predict the future trajectories of pedestrians and provide collision warnings in an accurate and prompt manner. Nevertheless, accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories remains a technical challenge, mainly caused by the heterogeneity of pedestrian crossing behavior and uncertainties in vehicle-pedestrian interactions. This paper proposes a deep learning-based method for pedestrian trajectory prediction and risk assessment, using trajectory data extracted from roadside LiDAR data and corresponding signal phasing information at MLK and Georgia Avenue in Chattanooga, TN. Meanwhile, a set of criteria referred to as the risk factor is established to quantitatively evaluate the risk of the pedestrian crossing behavior, which also serves as a learnable feature. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is proposed, which takes the following data as the input: the pedestrian trajectory data, signal phasing data, and risk factors from the past 10 steps. Meanwhile, the network predicts the pedestrian trajectory and risk factor at the future time step. In the experimental study, the root-mean-square errors between the predicted and ground truth x and y coordinates are 0.225 meters and 0.377 meters, respectively, and the F1 score value for the risk factor is 99.6%, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed LSTM-based methodology on pedestrian trajectory prediction and risk assessment.

AB Green Hydrogen Microgrid System has been selected as a source of clean and renewable alternative energy because it is undergoing a global revolution and has been identified as a source of clean energy that may aid the country in achieving net-zero emissions in the coming years. The study proposes an innovative Microgrid Renewable hybrid system to achieve these targets. The proposed hybrid renewable energy system combines a photovoltaic generator (PVG), a fuel cell (FC), a supercapacitor (SC) and a home vehicle power supply (V2H) to provide energy for a predefined demand. The proposed architecture is con-nected to the grid and is highly dependent on solar energy during peak periods. During the night or shad-ing period, it uses FC as a backup power source. The SC assists the FC with high charge power. SC performs this way during load transients or quick load changes. A multi-agent system (MAS) was used to build a real energy management system (RT-HEMS) for intelligent coordination between components (MAS). The scheduling algorithm reduces energy consumption by managing the required automation devices with-out the need for additional network power. It will meet household energy requirements regardless of weather conditions, including bright, cloudy or rainy conditions. Implementation and discussion of the RT-HEMS ensures that the GHS is functioning properly and that the charge request is satisfied.(c) 2022 THE AUTHOR.

AB In this study, a fault-tolerant position tracking control of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is addressed by proposing a model reference interval type-2 (IT-2) fuzzy-model-based sliding mode tracking control methodology. Considering the underactuated characteristic of the quadrotor UAV, first, the authors separate the overall dynamics of the quadrotor into the attitude, altitude, and position subsystems. Moreover, each of them is represented via IT-2 fuzzy model to deal with uncertainties of its membership functions. After then, a linear reference model supposed to be tracked by each subsystem is designed, on which each tracking error dynamics is derived. Given the tracking error dynamics and additive actuator faults, an IT-2 integral fuzzy sliding surface is proposed to enhance the robust tracking performance of the entire system. As a result, a linear matrix inequality-based sufficient condition is derived to guarantee the asymptotic stabilisation as well as satisfying an H-infinity tracking performance. Furthermore, a reachability condition of the designed sliding surface is also proposed. Finally, the authors provide design examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed position tracking control methodology.

AB Different approaches have been developed to perform diagnosis and supervision on continuous systems. On the one hand, Consistency-Based Diagnosis (CBD) as a qualitative approach has proved its convenience to diagnose multiple faults. However, it faces some problems regarding robustness in decision step and difficulties to obtain an accurate qualitative model. On the other hand, the quantitative approaches based Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) enable to generate a set of fault indicators called residuals in order to carry out on-line diagnosis. The performances of such methods depend mainly on the behavioural model accuracy and their implementation is sometimes difficult to realise, especially when the possibility of multiple faults is taken into account. To overcome the drawbacks of such methods and to fully exploit their strengths, we give a formal description of a graphical model called Signed Bond Graph (SBG). This formalism exploits its qualitative and quantitative structural properties enabling the generation of multiple behaviour predictions (i.e. possible conflicts). Furthermore, since the SBG is constructed from the Bond Graph (BG) model, the use of this latter as a quantitative method for residuals generation allows to compare the results emanating from the qualitative reasoning based SBG in order to eliminate the possible conflicts which are inconsistent or not physically possible even though they sound logical from a qualitative point of view. The proposed approach is illustrated by a real application to a traction system of an intelligent and autonomous vehicle performed within the European project InTraDE. The result shows its good applicability and efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Control systems; Attitude estimation; GPS; Fuzzy Logic Control; UAV
ID DESIGN
AB Attitude estimation is an important issue in the autonomous flight of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system. However, for a micro-sized UAV with a wingspan of less than 2 m, a high performance Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) is usually too heavy and large, whereas a low-cost AHRS of suitable size and weight may easily give erroneous attitude data. In this study, a single-antenna global positioning system (GPS)-based attitude estimation method, called pseudoattitude, in combination with the angular rate data given by the onboard gyroscopes, is applied to solve the problem. That is, the pseudoattitude estimated by the GPS velocity data provides a reference attitude with some time lag, whereas the gyroscope's angular rate is integrated with the aid of a proposed complementary filter to eliminate the time lag problem. An experimental method is then developed to determine the filter parameters by a static ground test of the GPS and flight test data with postprocessing and analysis. A fuzzy logic attitude controller is designed for the experimental verification of the attitude estimation. Results indicate that the attitude estimation is successfully obtained and used as the primary attitude source to stably control the UAV in this study. During the flight tests, two sets of desired attitude conditions (desired roll: 0 degrees, desired pitch: 0 degrees and desired roll: -25 degrees, desired pitch: 3 degrees) are set for the aircraft, and it is capable of maintaining the desired attitude conditions with sufficient performance for low-cost UAV applications.

DT Article
ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) that can drive autonomously in cross-country environment have received a good deal of attention in recent years. They must have the ability to determine whether the current terrain is traversable or not by using onboard sensors. This paper explores new methods related to environment perception based on computer image processing, pattern recognition, multisensors data fusion, and multidisciplinary theory. Kalman filter is used for low-level fusion of physical level, thus using the D-S evidence theory for high-level data fusion. Probability Test and Gaussian Mixture Model are proposed to obtain the traversable region in the forward-facing camera view for UGV. One feature set including color and texture information is extracted from areas of interest and combined with a classifier approach to resolve two types of terrain (traversable or not). Also, three-dimension data are employed; the feature set contains components such as distance contrast of three-dimension data, edge chain-code curvature of camera image, and covariance matrix based on the principal component method. This paper puts forward one new method that is suitable for distributing basic probability assignment (BPA), based on which D-S theory of evidence is employed to integrate sensors information and recognize the obstacle. The subordination obtained by using the fuzzy interpolation is applied to calculate the basic probability assignment. It is supposed that the subordination is equal to correlation coefficient in the formula. More accurate results of object identification are achieved by using the D-S theory of evidence. Control on motion behavior or autonomous navigation for UGV is based on the method, which is necessary for UGV high speed driving in cross-country environment. The experiment results have demonstrated the viability of the new method.

TI Terrain surface classification with a control mode update rule using a

SO ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Terrain classification; Terrain-dependent control; Computer vision
AB It is necessary for autonomous ground vehicles operating on outdoor terrains to identify and adapt to different terrains in order to improve their mobility and safety. This work presents a classification scheme to identify outdoor terrains and an update rule to reduce the possibility of implementing control modes based on classification inaccuracies. A laser stripe-based structured light sensor, which has a laser and infrared camera component, is used to sense terrains directly in front of the vehicle (<1m). Use of this infrared vision system allows sensing at night, without external lighting, unlike many previous vision-based approaches that rely on stand-alone cameras. Also, unlike many previous results, the classification algorithm presented here does not rely on measures of color, which are subject to illumination and weather conditions. Instead, the method presented here relies on spatial relationships which are captured in two quantities: spatial frequency from range data and texture from camera data. The presented terrain classification scheme uses a probabilistic neural network classifier to exploit the spatial differences in four terrains: asphalt, grass, gravel and sand. This approach yields empirical results that report a greater than 97% classification accuracy when both spatial frequency and texture features are used. Color robustness and lighting robustness is then shown through additional experiments. Furthermore, instead of implementing control modes directly from the identified terrains, it is shown that the use of current and past terrain detections allows for the rejection of misclassifications with minimal effect on the rate at which a new control mode can be implemented.

AB OSCAR II is a twin-engine aerial demonstrator equipped with a monocular visual system, which manages to keep its gaze and its heading steadily fixed on a target (i.e., a dark edge or a bar) in spite of the severe random perturbations applied to its body via a ducted fan. The tethered robot stabilizes its gaze on the basis of two oculomotor reflexes (ORs) inspired by studies on animals: 1) a visual-fixation reflex (VFR) and 2) a vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). One of the key features of this robot is that the eye is decoupled mechanically from the body about the vertical (i.e., yaw) axis. To meet the conflicting requirements of high accuracy and fast ocular responses, a miniature (2.4 g) voice-coil motor (VCM) was used, which enables the eye to make a change of orientation with an unusually short rise time (19 ms). The robot, which was equipped with a high-bandwidth (7 Hz) "VOR," which is based on an inertial microrate gyro, is capable of accurate visual fixation as long as there is light. The robot is also able to pursue a moving target in the presence of erratic gusts of wind. Here, we present the two interdependent control schemes driving the eye in the robot and the robot in space with no knowledge of the robot's angular position. This "steering-by-gazing" control strategy, which is implemented on this lightweight (100 g) miniature aerial robot, demonstrates the effectiveness of this biomimetic visual/inertial heading control strategy.

AB Multi-object detection is one of essential prerequisites for autonomous driving under complicated traffic environments. Specially, for the cases of nighttime driving, the accuracy of object detector for those images captured by infrared cameras is inevitably affected by several unanticipated issues (such as dim and unexpected light sources), which may significantly degrade the performance of detecting multiple objects (e.g., pedestrians and vehicles). To address such problem, we propose a Light-Weighted Multi-Object Detection Scheme for Infrared Images (LW-MODS-IRI). First, we select an effective super-resolution (SR) method to enhance and repair those infrared images, which can facilitate restoring the details of images for better detection accuracy. Next, those enhanced images are trained by our LW-MODS-IRI scheme. In contrast with previous methods, we develop an adaptive computing policy for anchor clustering that aims at locating the bound of targets in a reasonable manner for higher detection precision. Moreover, a modified attention mechanism is exploited to enlarge the receptive fields for promoting the detection performance of those large objects. Furthermore, we propose an improved channel-level pruning technique to generate both compact and accurate model after the training with sparsity. Finally, the extensive experiment results on Teledyne FLIR ADAS dataset (FLIR) demonstrate that the LW-MODS-IRI scheme can have both higher inference accuracy (e.g., 10.7% more) and higher detection efficiency (e.g., 4.13 times faster) compared to the existing object detectors, which typically reveals its practical viability when it is applied to in-vehicle systems.

TI Long-Term Target Tracking of UAVs Based on Kernelized Correlation Filter
SO MATHEMATICS

DT Article
DE unmanned aerial vehicle; object tracking; kernelized correlation filter
AB During the target tracking process of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the target may disappear from view or be fully occluded by other objects, resulting in tracking failure. Therefore, determining how to identify tracking failure and re-detect the target is the key to the long-term target tracking of UAVs. Kernelized correlation filter (KCF) has been very popular for its satisfactory speed and accuracy since it was proposed. It is very suitable for UAV target tracking systems with high real-time requirements. However, it cannot detect tracking failure, so it is not suitable for long-term target tracking. Based on the above research, we propose an improved KCF to match long-term target tracking requirements. Firstly, we introduce a confidence mechanism to evaluate the target tracking results to determine the status of target tracking. Secondly, the tracking model update strategy is designed to make the model suffer from less background information interference, thereby improving the robustness of the algorithm. Finally, the Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC) template matching is used to make a regional proposal first, and then the tracking model is used for target re-detection. Then, we successfully apply the algorithm to the UAV system. The system uses binocular cameras to estimate the target position accurately, and we design a control method to keep the target in the UAV's field of view. Our algorithm has achieved the best results in both short-term and long-term evaluations of experiments on tracking benchmarks, which proves that the algorithm is superior to the baseline algorithm and has quite good performance. Outdoor experiments show that the developed UAV system can achieve long-term, autonomous target tracking.

SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

ID INDOOR; NAVIGATION; DESIGN
AB The use of mobile robots in search-and-rescue and disaster-response missions has increased significantly in recent years. However, they are still remotely controlled by expert professionals on an actuator set-point level, and they would benefit, therefore, from any bit of autonomy added. This would allow them to execute high-level commands, such as "execute this trajectory" or "map this area." In this paper, we describe a vision-based quadrotor micro aerial vehicle that can autonomously execute a given trajectory and provide a live, dense three-dimensional (3D) map of an area. This map is presented to the operator while the quadrotor is mapping, so that there are no unnecessary delays in the mission. Our system does not rely on any external positioning system (e.g., GPS or motion capture systems) as sensing, computation, and control are performed fully onboard a smartphone processor. Since we use standard, off-the-shelf components from the hobbyist and smartphone markets, the total cost of our system is very low. Due to its low weight (below 450 g), it is also passively safe and can be deployed close to humans. We describe both the hardware and the software architecture of our system. We detail our visual odometry pipeline, the state estimation and control, and our live dense 3D mapping, with an overview of how all the modules work and how they have been integrated into the final system. We report the results of our experiments both indoors and outdoors. Our quadrotor was demonstrated over 100 times at multiple trade fairs, at public events, and to rescue professionals. We discuss the practical challenges and lessons learned. Code, datasets, and videos are publicly available to the robotics community. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB It is essential to quantitatively evaluate road safety compliance through the modeling of three-dimensional geometric information of in-service roads to automatically guide the determination of driving speeds in intelligent transportation. A novel methodology is presented for reliably estimating 3D geometric elements and assessing geometry-related safety. A point-octree-normal-vector (PONV) network is developed to cope with the heterogeneous density of point clouds from mobile and terrestrial laser scanning and reduce possible failures caused by the disordered rotation of points. The points on road surfaces are adaptively segmented into stripes without data loss. Road horizontal elements, cross-sectional slopes and longitudinal slopes are estimated independent of alignment variations based on a concave hull algorithm, a cubic B-spline algorithm and a total least-squares method. A road safety compliance assessment related to the radius of curvature, average gradient, rate of curvature changes and side friction factors is conducted. Warning and suggested driving speeds are thus provided. Experiments show that the PONV network achieved superior performance in extracting road surfaces, with accuracy, precision, recall, and mean intersection-over-union scores of 98.1%, 89.7%, 89.3% and 82.5%, respectively. The geometric elements with neighboring distances in meters were basically consistent with those in traditional surveys and raw point clouds. Through comparison with safety guidelines, suitable vehicle operation speeds were suggested in road sections with unreasonable rates of curvature changes and side friction factors. This work can be applied for constructing road information models and automatically guiding driving speeds with high-definition maps on autonomous vehicles.

AB Riparian zones act as ecological engineers through stream bank stabilization, pollutant buffering, energy provision to food webs, and groundwater recharge. In the ongoing situation of declining river water quality and global environmental changes, an integrated strategy involving aspects of riparian zone monitoring and management is essential for policy-making and socio-economic services. To address this, a review of papers and policies from 1980 to 2023 is conducted to identify existing technologies and their gaps. 298 articles were reviewed to understand riparian habitats and their ecological function. Analysis shows that field-based monitoring approaches have considerable limitations, including increased labor costs, and methodologies that result in ineffective riparian zone management. These issues can be overcome using geospatial technologies due to their high-quality and long-term inventories and ease of map updates. Unmanned aerial vehicles are widely used for low-cost monitoring in recent times. The result shows that there is no policy framework specifically addressing riparian zone management across the South Asian region which is home to the world's largest population. Riparian buffer width requires attention across all stakeholders which are missing in the South Asian region and a few other countries across the globe. The authors suggest the use of buffer width consisting of Vetiver grasses of at least 5 m used in conjunction with woody vegetation of a 25-m filter strip. Strategies from the USA and Australia can also show the path towards the riparian zone sustainability.

AB Intelligent vehicle infrastructure cooperative systems can essentially address the bottleneck of the limited perception range of autonomous vehicles. This is achieved by the real-time perception of road traffic using roadside mounted sensors, which is receiving increasing attention. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has progressively been deployed on the roadside due to its advantage of remaining unaffected by lights and the capability to obtain 3-D information about traffic participants. However, a practical evaluation criterion is currently lacking for assessing the merits of roadside LiDAR placement. In this study, we propose an information-theoretic LiDAR mounting placement evaluation method, which simplifies the complex problem of LiDAR mounting placement to a simple parameter calculation problem. We characterize the amount of information detected by LiDAR in the region of interest (ROI) by introducing the per voxel point clouds' metric. The resulting metric, named the maximum density gain, quantifies the effect of LiDAR mounting placements on perception performance. A bidirectional eight-lane traffic scenario is constructed in Unity3D, and datasets of simulated LiDARs are collected under two traffic conditions: with and without obstruction. The Pointpillars is used to test the collected dataset, which is a point cloud-based 3-D object detection algorithm. The results of Pointpillars and our proposed method are compared to test the validity of the proposed method. The experimental results show that our proposed method is compatible with the outcomes of Pointpillars while being simpler and computationally efficient. The proposed LiDAR mounting placement evaluation method can offer a reliable calculation reference for the mounting placement of roadside LiDARs.

AB Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm is a prerequisite for unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) localization, path planning, and navigation, which includes two essential components: frontend odometry and backend optimization. Frontend odometry tends to amplify the cumulative error continuously, leading to ghosting and drifting on the mapping results. However, loop closure detection (LCD) can be used to address this technical issue by significantly eliminating the cumulative error. The existing LCD methods decide whether a loop exists by constructing local or global descriptors and calculating the similarity between descriptors, which attaches great importance to the design of discriminative descriptors and effective similarity measurement mechanisms. In this paper, we first propose novel multi-channel descriptors (CMCD) to alleviate the lack of point cloud single information in the discriminative power of scene description. The distance, height, and intensity information of the point cloud is encoded into three independent channels of the shadow-casting region (bin) and then compressed it into a two-dimensional global descriptor. Next, an ORB-based dynamic threshold feature extraction algorithm (DTORB) is designed using objective 2D descriptors to describe the distributions of global and local point clouds. Then, a DTORB-based similarity measurement method is designed using the rotation-invariance and visualization characteristic of descriptor features to overcome the subjective tendency of the constant threshold ORB algorithm in descriptor feature extraction. Finally, verification is performed over KITTI odometry sequences and the campus datasets of Jilin University collected by us. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method to the state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Lane changes made during traffic oscillations on freeways largely affect traffic safety and could increase collision potentials. Predicting the impacts of lane change can help to develop optimal lane change strategies of autonomous vehicles for safety improvement. The study aims at proposing a machine learning method for the short-term prediction of lane-changing impacts (LCI) during the propagation of traffic oscillations. The empirical lane changing trajectory records were obtained from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) platform. A support vector regression (SVR) model was trained in this study to predict the LCI on the crash risks and flow change using microscopic traffic variables such as individual speed, gap and acceleration on both original lanes and target lanes. Sensitivity analyses were conducted in the SVR to quantify the contributions of correlative lane changing factors. The results showed that the trained SVR model achieved an accuracy of 72.81 % for the risk of crashes and 95.34 % in predicting the flow change. The sensitivity analysis explored the optimal speed and acceleration for the lane changer to achieve the lowest time integrated time-to-collision (TIT) value for safety maximization. Finally, we compared the LCI for motorcycles, automobiles and trucks as well as the LCI for both lane-changing directions (from left to right and from right to left). It was found that motorcycles conducted lane changes with smaller gaps and larger speed differences, which brings the highest crash risks. Passenger cars were found to be the safest when they conduct lane changes. Lane changes to the right had more negative impacts on traffic flow and crash risks.

AB Objective: This paper aims to describe and test novel computational driver models, predicting drivers' brake reaction times (BRTs) to different levels of lead vehicle braking, during driving with cruise control (CC) and during silent failures of adaptive cruise control (ACC). Background: Validated computational models predicting BRTs to silent failures of automation are lacking but are important for assessing the safety benefits of automated driving. Method: Two alternative models of driver response to silent ACC failures are proposed: a looming prediction model, assuming that drivers embody a generative model of ACC, and a lower gain model, assuming that drivers' arousal decreases due to monitoring of the automated system. Predictions of BRTs issued by the models were tested using a driving simulator study. Results: The driving simulator study confirmed the predictions of the models: (a) BRTs were significantly shorter with an increase in kinematic criticality, both during driving with CC and during driving with ACC; (b) BRTs were significantly delayed when driving with ACC compared with driving with CC. However, the predicted BRTs were longer than the ones observed, entailing a fitting of the models to the data from the study. Conclusion: Both the looming prediction model and the lower gain model predict well the BRTs for the ACC driving condition. However, the looming prediction model has the advantage of being able to predict average BRTs using the exact same parameters as the model fitted to the CC driving data. Application: Knowledge resulting from this research can be helpful for assessing the safety benefits of automated driving.

AB Scleractinian cold-water coral (CWC) reefs are key habitats for benthic fauna as they enhance spatial heterogeneity and biodiversity. Understanding their environmental and ecological dynamics has therefore important implications for biodiversity conservation. This is especially true for the Mediterranean Sea, where living cold-water coral reefs are rare. In this study, we present a quantitative analysis of the CWC assemblages from Cabliers Coral Mound Province, located in the Alboran Sea (westernmost Mediterranean). The province extends for 25 km, with some mounds rising up to 140 m from the surrounding seafloor and being partly topped by living CWC reefs. The observed megabenthic species were quantified through video analysis of three Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) dives (280-485 m water depth) and their distribution was related to mound geomorphic characteristics and seafloor terrain parameters, extracted from a high-resolution Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) multi-beam bathymetry. The pronounced abundance and size of scleractinian CWCs among the observed assemblages, makes Cabliers the only known coral mound province in the Mediterranean Sea with currently growing reefs. Within these reefs, several recruits and juveniles of the sebastid Helicolenus dactylopterus were observed, confirming the use of such habitats as nursery grounds by some commercially valuable fish species. The qualitative comparison between the fauna of Cabliers and Atlantic coral mounds suggest that the number of species associated with CWC mounds worldwide is even higher than previously thought. This finding has important implications for the conservation and management of CWC habitats in different geographic regions.

AB Variations in seabed gradient are widely acknowledged to influence deep-water deposition, but are often difficult to measure in sufficient detail from both modem and ancient examples. On the continental slope offshore Los Angeles, California, autonomous underwater vehicle, remotely operated vehicle, and shipboard methods were used to collect a dense grid of high-resolution multibeam bathymetry, chirp sub-bottom profiles, and targeted sediment core samples that demonstrate the influence of seafloor gradient on sediment accumulation, depositional environment, grain size of deposits, and seafloor morphology. In this setting, restraining and releasing bends along the active right-lateral Palos Verdes Fault create and maintain variations in seafloor gradient. Holocene down-slope flows appear to have been generated by slope failure, primarily on the uppermost slope (similar to 100-200 m water depth). Turbidity currents created a low relief (<10 m) channel, up-slope migrating sediment waves (lambda = similar to 100 m, h <= 2 m), and a series of depocenters that have accumulated up to 4 m of Holocene sediment. Sediment waves increase in wavelength and decrease in wave height with decreasing gradient. Integrated analysis of high-resolution datasets provides quantification of morphodynamic sensitivity to seafloor gradients acting throughout deep-water depositional systems. These results help to bridge gaps in scale between existing deep-sea and experimental datasets and may provide constraints for future numerical modeling studies. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper examines an integrated path planning and power management problem for a solar-powered unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). The proposed method seeks to minimize the travel time of the UGV through an area of known energy density by designing a smooth, heuristically optimized path and allocating the vehicle's power among its electrical components, while the UGV harvests ambient energy along the designed path to satisfy with the mission's strict energy constraints. A scalar field is first established to evaluate the solar radiation density at discrete locations. A modified particle swarm optimization method is applied to search for a minimal time path wherein the energy gathered is equal to or greater than the energy expended. The proposed modeling and optimization strategy is verified through computer simulation and experimental demonstration.
   Note to Practitioners-With the advancement of autonomous technology, robotic systems have alleviated human operators from numerous tedious tasks where system endurance plays a crucial role. Current technology employed in solar-powered robotic systems is subject to design and power limitations and varying environments. Intelligently harvesting energy from environments and scheduling power consumption to optimize desired system performance will significantly improve the solar robot's endurance. Therefore, the goal of realizing energy autonomy of solar-powered robotic systems motivates this work. Any robotic system which can access solar energy will potentially benefit from the results of this work. With solar panels integrated into robotic systems applied to missions such as environmental monitoring, search and rescue, surveillance, and farming, the proposed path planning and power management strategy has the potential to dramatically extend the operation time of a system.

AB We conducted deep-sea magnetic measurements using autonomous underwater vehicles in the Bayonnaise knoll caldera, the Izu-Ogasawara island arc, which hosts the large Hakurei hydrothermal field. We improved the conventional correction method applied for removing the effect of vehicle magnetization, thus greatly enhancing the precision of the resulting vector anomalies. The magnetization distribution obtained from the vector anomaly data shows a approximate to 2 km wide belt of high magnetization, trending NNW-SSE going through the caldera, and a low-magnetization zone approximate to 300 m by approximate to 500 m in area, extending over the Hakurei site. Comparison between the results obtained using the vector anomaly and the total intensity anomaly shows that the magnetic field is determined more accurately, especially in areas of sparse data distribution, when the vector anomaly rather than the total intensity anomaly is used. We suggest a geologically motivated model that basaltic volcanism associated with the back-arc rifting occurred after the formation of the caldera, resulting in the formation of the high-magnetization belt underneath the silicic caldera. The Hakurei hydrothermal field lies in the intersection of the basaltic volcanism belt and the caldera wall fault, suggesting a mechanism that hot water generated by the heat of the volcanic activity has been spouting out through the caldera wall fault. The deposit apparently extends beyond the low-magnetization zone, climbing up the caldera wall. This may indicate that hot water rising from the deep through the alteration zone is transported laterally when it comes near the seafloor along fissures and fractures in the caldera wall.

AB Edge intelligence (EI) is becoming one of the research hotspots among researchers, which is believed to help empower intelligent transportation systems (ITS). ITS generates a large amount of data at the network edge by millions of devices and sensors. Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) is at the core of ITS development. By pushing the AI frontier to the network edge, EI enables ITS AI applications to have lower latency, higher security, less pressure on the backbone network and better use edge big data. This paper surveys Edge Intelligence in Intelligent Transportation Systems. We first introduce the challenges ITS faces and explain the motivation of using EI in ITS. We then explore the framework of using EI in ITS, including the EI-based ITS architecture, the data gathering and communication methods, the data processing and service delivery, and the performance indexes. The enabling technologies, such as AI models, the Internet of Things, and Edge Computing technologies used in EI-based ITS, are reviewed intensively. We discuss the edge intelligence applications and research fields in ITS in depth. Typical application scenarios, such as autonomous driving, vehicular edge computing, intelligent vehicular transportation system, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in ITS environment, and rail transportation control and management, are explored. The general platforms of EI, the EI training and inference in ITS, as well as the benchmark datasets, are introduced. Finally, we discuss some of the challenges and future directions of using EI in ITS.

AB Autonomous landing of aerial vehicles is challenging, especially in emergency flight scenarios in which precise information about the vehicle and the environment is required for near-to-ground maneuvers. In this paper, the optic-flow concept based on feature detection is applied to estimate the vertical distance and the velocity vector of a multirotor UAV (MUAV) for landing. The UAV kinematics, the optical flow equations, and the detected feature states, provided by a low-cost monocular camera, are combined to develop a novel appropriate model for estimation. The proposed algorithm applies the variation of detected features, the angular velocities, as well as the Euler angles, measured by the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), to estimate the vertical distance of the UAV to the ground, the MUAV velocity vector, and also to predict the future features position. Extended Kalman filter (EKF) is applied as the estimation method on the coupled optic-flow and kinematic equations. The accuracy of state estimation is enhanced by the idea of multiple-feature tracking. The 6-DOF simulations, laboratory experiments, and comparison of results demonstrate the capability of height and velocity estimation of a MUAV in the landing phase of flight by just applying the low-cost camera information. Monte Carlo simulations have been performed to study the effect of IMU acceleration, and angular velocity measurement noises as well as the number of the detected features on the success probability of the estimation process. The results reveal that increasing the number of detected features, i.e tracking multiple features, increases the estimation accuracy, however, it mainly improves the success probability, which is a more important factor in practical scenarios.

AB Currently, the expectations for autonomous vehi-cles (AVs) are increasing. However, it is expected to take at least a decade to develop a fully AV, where human intervention is completely unrequired. By then, human driving is required if necessary. Currently, when the AV hands over control to the driver, a safe driving environment can be created only if it is possible to determine whether the driver is in an abnormal state. Unfortunately, according to the sensory conflict theory, the risk of motion sickness (MS) is higher in AV than in ordinary vehicles. This is because neither passengers nor drivers can predict the movement path of the vehicle under AV, so there is more dissonance between vision and perception. Because the technology to remove MS when it occurs has not yet been developed, the best way to maintain the driver's good condition is to quickly predict MS through the driver's bio-signals and establish a system to prevent MS through advanced driver assistance systems. It is necessary to quickly predict early MS and provide feedback before it becomes severe. In this study, we collected dry electroencephalogram (EEG) data to predict MS in a real-world driving environment. For MS-based feature extraction, a normalized sample covariance matrix-based feature representation method was used, and they were classified using convolutional neural networks. As a result, we achieved 89.05% (+/- 5.76) accuracy when averaging all four experimental sessions we conducted. We expect our proposed model to be a useful indicator for resolving MS issues in AV environments.

ID EXTRACTION
AB Recently, deep learning methods have made significant progress in solving hyperspectral image (HSI) classification problems of high-dimensional features, band redundancy, and spectral mixture. However, the deep neural network is too complex, with a long training time and high energy consumption, making it difficult to deploy on edge computing devices. In order to solve the above problems, this article proposes a brain-inspired computing framework based on the spiking leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model for HSIs' classification. Then, we design an approximate derivative algorithm to solve the nondifferentiable spike activity of the spiking neuron. The framework uses direct coding to generate spatiotemporal spikes for input HSI and achieves efficient extraction of spatial-spectral features through spiking standard convolution and spiking depthwise separable convolution. Extensive experiments are performed on four benchmark hyperspectral datasets and two public unmanned aerial vehicle-borne hyperspectral datasets. Experiments show that the proposed model has the advantages of high classification accuracy and fewer spiking time steps. The proposed model can save about ten times computational energy consumption compared with the CNN of the same architecture. This research has great significance for overcoming the technical bottleneck of HSI classification based on brain-inspired computing, solving the critical problems of mobile computing in unmanned autonomous systems, and realizing the engineering application of unmanned aerial vehicles and software-defined satellites.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming increasingly popular for applications such as inspections, delivery, agriculture, surveillance, and many more. It is estimated that, by 2040, UAVs/drones will become a mainstream delivery channel to satisfy the growing demand for parcel delivery. Though the UAVs are gaining interest in civil applications, the future of UAV charging is facing a set of vital concerns and open research challenges. Considering the case of parcel delivery, handling countless drones and their charging will become complex and laborious. The need for non-contact based multi-device charging techniques will be crucial in saving time and human resources. To efficiently address this issue, Wireless Power Transmission (WPT) for UAVs is a promising technology for multi-drone charging and autonomous handling of multiple devices. In the literature of the past five years, limited surveys were conducted for wireless UAV charging. Moreover, vital problems such as coil weight constraints, comparison between existing charging techniques, shielding methods and many other key issues are not addressed. This motivates the author in conducting this review for addressing the crucial aspects of wireless UAV charging. Furthermore, this review provides a comprehensive comparative study on wireless charging's technical aspects conducted by prominent research laboratories, universities, and industries. The paper also discusses UAVs' history, UAVs structure, categories of UAVs, mathematical formulation of coil and WPT standards for safer operation.

AB In this paper, we consider the use of a team of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to accomplish a search and rescue (SAR) mission in the minimum time possible while saving the maximum number of people. A novel technique for the SAR problem is proposed and referred to as the layered search and rescue (LSAR) algorithm. The novelty of LSAR involves simulating real disasters to distribute SAR tasks among UAVs. The performance of LSAR is compared, in terms of percentage of rescued survivors and rescue and execution times, with the max-sum, auction-based, and locust-inspired approaches for multi UAV task allocation (LIAM) and opportunistic task allocation (OTA) schemes. The simulation results show that the UAVs running the LSAR algorithm on average rescue approximately 74% of the survivors, which is 8% higher than the next best algorithm (LIAM). Moreover, this percentage increases with the number of UAVs, almost linearly with the least slope, which means more scalability and coverage is obtained in comparison to other algorithms. In addition, the empirical cumulative distribution function of LSAR results shows that the percentages of rescued survivors clustered around the [78% - 100%] range under an exponential curve, meaning most results are above 50%. In comparison, all the other algorithms have almost equal distributions of their percentage of rescued survivor results. Furthermore, because the LSAR algorithm focuses on the center of the disaster, it finds more survivors and rescues them faster than the other algorithms, with an average of 55% similar to 77%. Moreover, most registered times to rescue survivors by LSAR are bounded by a time of 04:50:02 with 95% confidence for a one-month mission time.

AB Anomaly detection from a driver's perspective when driving is important to autonomous vehicles. As a part of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), it can remind the driver about dangers in a timely manner. Compared with traditional studied scenes such as a university campus and market surveillance videos, it is difficult to detect an abnormal event from a driver's perspective due to camera waggle, abidingly moving background, drastic change of vehicle velocity, etc. To tackle these specific problems, this paper proposes a spatial localization constrained sparse coding approach for anomaly detection in traffic scenes, which first measures the abnormality of motion orientation and magnitude, respectively, and then fuses these two aspects to obtain a robust detection result. The main contributions are threefold, as follows. 1) This work describes the motion orientation and magnitude of the object, respectively, in a new way, which is demonstrated to be better than the traditional motion descriptors. 2) The spatial localization of an object is taken into account considering the sparse reconstruction framework, which utilizes the scene's structural information and outperforms the conventional sparse coding methods. 3) Results of motion orientation and magnitude are adaptively weighted and fused by a Bayesian model, which makes the proposed method more robust and able to handle more kinds of abnormal events. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method are validated by testing on nine difficult video sequences that we captured ourselves. Observed from the experimental results, the proposed method is more effective and efficient than the popular competitors and yields a higher performance.

AB One of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals is climate action (SDG-13), and wildfire is among the catastrophic events that both impact climate change and are aggravated by it. In Australia and other countries, large-scale wildfires have dramatically grown in frequency and size in recent years. These fires threaten the world's forests and urban woods, cause enormous environmental and property damage, and quite often result in fatalities. As a result of their increasing frequency, there is an ongoing debate over how to handle catastrophic wildfires and mitigate their social, economic, and environmental repercussions. Effective prevention, early warning, and response strategies must be well-planned and carefully coordinated to minimise harmful consequences to people and the environment. Rapid advancements in remote sensing technologies such as ground-based, aerial surveillance vehicle-based, and satellite-based systems have been used for efficient wildfire surveillance. This study focuses on the application of space-borne technology for very accurate fire detection under challenging conditions. Due to the significant advances in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in recent years, numerous studies have previously been conducted to examine how AI might be applied in various situations. As a result of its special physical and operational requirements, spaceflight has emerged as one of the most challenging application fields. This work contains a feasibility study as well as a model and scenario prototype for a satellite AI system. With the intention of swiftly generating alerts and enabling immediate actions, the detection of wildfires has been studied with reference to the Australian events that occurred in December 2019. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed, trained, and used from the ground up to detect wildfires while also adjusting their complexity to meet onboard implementation requirements for trusted autonomous satellite operations (TASO). The capability of a 1-dimensional convolution neural network (1-DCNN) to classify wildfires is demonstrated in this research and the results are assessed against those reported in the literature. In order to enable autonomous onboard data processing, various hardware accelerators were considered and evaluated for onboard implementation. The trained model was then implemented in the following: Intel Movidius NCS-2 and Nvidia Jetson Nano and Nvidia Jetson TX2. Using the selected onboard hardware, the developed model was then put into practice and analysis was carried out. The results were positive and in favour of using the technology that has been proposed for onboard data processing to enable TASO on future missions. The findings indicate that data processing onboard can be very beneficial in disaster management and climate change mitigation by facilitating the generation of timely alerts for users and by enabling rapid and appropriate responses.

AB Signal, accuracy, and real-time performance of satellite, radar, and machine vision is a subject of concern in various complex agricultural environments. Therefore, the demand for a robust navigation sensor for indoor and vertical agricultural environment remains crucial, and it is a significant subject. In view of this, the relative edge pose detection method based on the ideal target band principle of the lateral center arc array, in this research, a small integrated arc array navigation sensor module based on adaptive detection arc technology, is developed, which costs about $100, autonomous edge navigation position, and attitude detection is realized in facility agriculture environment with continuous structured corridor or roadside features. In this research, a coupling method of reducing the radius of distance sensor arrangement, adjusting the unequal center angle, and increasing the detection distance is used to realize the miniaturization of the arc array arrangement. A semicircular modular rocket was designed to slide and adjust the center angle of the distance sensor, and the longitudinal installation position of the modularized sensor was adjusted by translating the circular arc of the detection; the convenient moving arrangement under different vehicle width and detection arc characteristics is realized. An adaptive construction method of detecting a circular arc based on self-calibrating detection distance of a distance sensor is proposed, which effectively reduces the difficulty of arranging the lateral central circular arc array; the fast construction of lateral detection arc is realized. In addition, in order to improve the accuracy and stability of the pose detection, the Mahalanobis distance algorithm and the standard Kalman filter are used to optimize the estimation of the ranging information and the relative pose of the edge. The experimental results show that the small integrated arc array navigation sensor module can independently construct photoelectric detection arcs with different characteristics to detect the position and attitude of the relative edge. When the road surface is concave and convex, the small integrated arc array navigation sensor module can still maintain the stable position and attitude detection of the relative edge for more than 30 s. In addition, when the walking speed of the autonomous navigation platform is 0.15 m/s to 0.35 m/s, the detection errors of lateral deviation and heading deviation relative to the road edge are less than 40 mm and 4.5 degrees, respectively. The small integrated arc array navigation sensor module is less affected by the change of operating speed, and still has good accuracy and stability. The results show that the modularized edge navigation sensor has the advantages of fast and convenient use, high accuracy, and low cost; it can be applied to autonomous edge navigation control in greenhouse and plant and animal factories.

TI GNSS performance enhancement using measurement estimation in harsh
   environment
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ACCURACY; GPS
AB Global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) are commonly used to measure the position and time globally. A GNSS is convenient owing to its ability to measure accurate position relatively without using assistive tools for navigation by comparing with other sensors. Based on these benefits, the applicable area is expanding to commercial and social uses (e.g., vehicle navigation, smart grids, and smartphone apps). In the future, various services and technologies (e.g., the use of autonomous vehicles, unmanned delivery, and industrial field robots), which make Internet of Things (IOT) more active, will be used in our society. Conversely, the performance of GNSS can degrade in harsh environments, such as urban areas, owing to the property of GNSS, which calculates position and time via satellite signal reception. However, buildings in a city can block navigation satellite signals and generate multi-path errors. The blocked signals exacerbate the dilution of precision (DOP), which indicates the accuracy of the navigation solution and increases the navigation solution error. This study proposes methods to improve navigation performance by leveraging various techniques (e.g., range differences, receiver clock error hold, and virtual satellites). The methods were validated in harsh environments where visible satellites were reduced. In the simulation, each proposed method improved the navigation performance by creating an environment similar to a normal situation, despite the receiver entering a harsh environment. The results confirmed that the navigation performance deteriorated compared to the normal situation where the number of visible satellites decreased. However, the navigation performance was recovered gradually by applying the proposed techniques. Using the proposed methods, navigation performance can be maintained continuously even in situations where satellite signals are blocked.

AB This article presents the design, development, and testing of an ultracompact underwater pulsed digital holographic camera (named weeHoloCam) that has been successfully deployed in the North Sea. With a footprint of 9 cm diameter x 60 cm long and weighing just 3.5 kg, to our knowledge, this is the lightest and most compact system of its kind in the world. It can be easily adapted for mounting on remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). weeHoloCam can record 12 cm(3) of the water column per hologram at 20 Hz and has a capacity to continuously record up to 200 000 holograms, each 5 MB in size. Along with the holographic camera, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-accelerated hologram analysis suite has been developed. The 838 megapixel/s reconstruction speed demonstrated is the highest reported speed for a single FPGA implementation to date. This is an extremely important development as rapid processing of recorded holograms is vital for the viability of subsea holographic cameras. weeHoloCam was successfully trialed in the North Sea, recording close to a hundred thousand holograms and extracting particle images within those holograms at a rate of 190 per min. weeHoloCam has the potential to play an important role in several oceanic studies: spatial and temporal monitoring of plankton species; study of plankton dynamics; study of vertical transport of floc; and monitoring microplastic pollution in the ocean, to name but a few.

AB Modern connected or autonomous vehicles (AVs) are highly complex cyber-physical systems. As a result of the high number of different technologies and connectivity features involved, testing these systems to identify security vulnerabilities is a big challenge. Security testing techniques, such as penetration testing, are often manual methods that are applied comparatively late in the vehicle development process. Thus, vulnerabilities are only detected late or after development, leading to higher costs and more patching effort. To reduce the amount of testing resources in general and enable early and automated testing, model-based testing methods have been established in several domains, such as information technology and the automotive domain. The transfer of model-based testing approaches to automotive security testing could help to detect vulnerabilities earlier than other, manual methods by automatically generating, executing, or simulating security tests. In this study, we review the literature on model-based test approaches in the automotive domain. First, we consider security-independent approaches to obtain an overview of applied models, formalisms, test selection criteria, and test generation techniques. In addition, we investigate, whether and how model-based approaches are applied for automotive security testing. Overall, we identified 63 publications related to model-based testing and 29 publications with regard to model-based security testing. The aim of this study is to provide an overview and direct comparison between these approaches. In this manner, the state of model-based security testing in the automotive domain, current challenges, and potential research areas are determined.

AB Water segmentation is essential for the autonomous driving system of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), which provides reliable navigation for making safety decisions. However, existing methods have only used monocular images as input, which often suffer from the changes in illumination and weather. Compared with monocular images, LiDAR point clouds can be collected independently of ambient light and provide sufficient 3D information but lack the color and texture that images own. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel camera-LiDAR cross-modality fusion water segmentation method, which combines the data characteristics of the 2D image and 3D LiDAR point cloud in water segmentation for the first time. Specifically, the 3D point clouds are first supplemented with 2D color and texture information from the images and then distinguished into water surface points and non-water points by the early 3D cross-modality segmentation module. Subsequently, the 3D segmentation results and features are fed into the late 2D cross-modality segmentation module to perform 2D water segmentation. Finally, the 2D and 3D water segmentation results are fused for the refinement by an uncertainty-aware cross-modality fusion module. We further collect, annotate and present a novel Cross-modality Water Segmentation (CMWS) dataset to validate our proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first water segmentation dataset for USVs in inland waterways consisting of images and corresponding point clouds. Extensive experiments on the CMWS dataset demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly improve image-only-based methods, achieving improvements in accuracy and MaxF of approximately 2% for all the image-only-based methods.

AB Autonomous trust mechanisms enable Internet of Things (IoT) devices to function cooperatively in a wide range of ecosystems, from vehicle-to-vehicle communications to mesh sensor networks. A common property desired in such networks is a mechanism to construct a secure, authenticated channel between any two participating nodes to share sensitive information, nominally a challenging proposition for a large, heterogeneous network where node participation is constantly in flux. This work explores a contract-theoretic framework that exploits the principles of network economics to crowd-source trust between two arbitrary nodes based on the efforts of their neighbors. Each node in the network possesses a trust score, which is updated based on useful effort contributed to the authentication step. The scheme functions autonomously on locally adjacent nodes and is proven to converge onto an optimal solution based on the available nodes and their trust scores. Core building blocks include the use of Stochastic Learning Automata to select the participating nodes based on network and social metrics, and the formulation of a Bayesian trust belief distribution from the past behavior of the selected nodes. An effort-reward model incentivizes selected nodes to accurately report their trust scores and contribute their effort to the authentication process. Detailed numerical results obtained via simulation highlight the proposed framework's efficacy and performance. The performance achieved near-optimal results despite incomplete information regarding the IoT nodes' trust scores and the presence of malicious or misbehaving nodes. Comparison metrics demonstrate that the proposed approach maximized the overall social welfare and achieved better performance compared to the state of the art in the domain.

AB In order to realize an intelligent transportation system (ITS) which will provide smooth urban traffic, autonomous driving, accurate route navigation, etc., enormous computations need to be migrated from cloud centers to edge nodes, especially for the services requiring stringent latency. In addition to base stations and road side units (RSUs), vehicles can be alteratively considered as a kind of computation resources. In this article, a hierarchical vehicular-based architecture which consists of cloud centers and vehicles is investigated. Computation offloading performance in the hierarchical architecture is also studied. In specific, the main components in vehicular networks and their characteristics on communication and computations are presented firstly. Several communication techniques that are essential in enabling computation offloading among these components are then discussed. Secondly, a hierarchical vehicular-based architecture, which integrates the main components, is constructed. Thirdly, a case study on computation offloading in the proposed architecture is conducted. In the concerned scenario, the computation offloading problem is modelled as a multi-dimensional multiple knapsack problem (MMKP). Two algorithms are investigated, among which, the first algorithm is a greedy heuristic method providing a sub-optimal solution with a low computational complexity. The second algorithm is a modified branch and bound (B&B) method, which can obtain the best solution with a high computational complexity. Numerical results are also presented to verify the performance of the two algorithms. It can be demonstrated that the proposed architecture can migrate more computations from cloud centers to vehicular nodes, when the computations require more communication resources.

ID WIRELESS POWER TRANSFER; DESIGN
AB This paper describes the modeling, analysis, and design of a complete (dc-to-dc) inductive wireless power transfer (WPT) system for industrial moving applications. The system operates at 6.78 MHz and delivers up to 150 W to a load moving along a linear path, providing a quasi-constant dc output voltage and maintaining a zero voltage switching operation, regardless of position and load, without any retuning or feedback. The inductive link consists of an array of stationary transmitting coils and a moving receiving coil whose length is optimized to achieve a constant coupling coefficient along the path. Each Tx coil is individually driven by a constant amplitude and phase sinusoidal current that is generated from a GaN-based coupled load-independent Class EF inverter. Two adjacent transmitters are activated at a given time depending on the receiver's position; this effectively creates a virtual series connection between the two transmitting coils. The Rx coil is connected to a passive Class E rectifier that is designed to maintain a constant dc output voltage independent of its load and position. Extensive experimental results are presented to show the performance over different loading conditions and positions. A peak dc-to-dc efficiency of 80% is achieved at 100 W of dc output power and a dc output voltage variation of less than 5% is measured over a load range from 30 to 500 Omega. The work in this paper is foreseen as a design solution for a high-efficient, maintenance-free, and reliable WPT system for powering sliders and mass movers in industrial automation plants.

AB We have designed and built a simple optical sensor called Vibrating Optical Device for the Kontrol of Autonomous robots (VODKA), that was inspired by the "tremor" eye movements observed in many vertebrate and invertebrate animals. In the initial version presented here, the sensor relies on the repetitive micro-translation of a pair of photoreceptors set behind a small lens, and on the processing designed to locate a target from the two photoreceptor signals. The VODKA sensor, in which retinal micro-scanning movements are performed via a small piezo-bender actuator driven at a frequency of 40 Hz, was found to be able to locate a contrasting edge with an outstandingly high resolution 900-fold greater than its static resolution (which is constrained by the interreceptor angle), regardless of the scanning law imposed on the retina. Hyperacuity is thus obtained at a very low cost, thus opening new vistas for the accurate visuo-motor control of robotic platforms. As an example, the sensor was mounted onto a miniature aerial robot that became able to track a moving target accurately by exploiting the robot's uncontrolled random vibrations as the source of its ocular microscanning movement. The simplicity, small size, low mass and low power consumption of this optical sensor make it highly suitable for many applications in the fields of metrology, astronomy, robotics, automotive, and aerospace engineering. The basic operating principle may also shed new light on the whys and wherefores of the tremor eye movements occurring in both animals and humans.

AB Purpose Advances in technology enable companies to collect and analyse data, which were previously not accessible, to either enhance existing business processes or create new ones. The purpose of this paper is to document the role and impact of Big Data Analytics (BDA), and the Internet of Things (IoT), in supporting a large logistics firm's strategy to improve driver safety, lower operating costs, and reduce the environmental impact of their vehicles.
   Design/methodology/approach A single case with embedded units intrinsic case study method was adopted for this research and data were collected from a real-life situation, to create new knowledge about this emerging phenomenon.
   Findings Truck telematics were utilised in order to better understand, and improve, driving behaviours. Remote control centres monitor live sensor data from the company's fleet of vehicles, capturing the likes of speed, location, braking, and engine data, to inform future training programs. A combination of truck telematics and geo-information are being used to enable proactive alerts to be sent to drivers regarding possible upcoming hazards. Camera-based technologies have been adopted to improve driver safety, and fatigue management, capturing evidence of important driving events and storing data directly to the cloud, and BDA is also being used to improve truck routing, recommend optimal fuel purchasing times/locations, and to forecast predictive and proactive maintenance schedules.
   Research limitations/implications The type of data collected by Company A, and similar logistics companies, has the potential to greatly inform researchers investigating autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and the physical internet.
   Practical implications Eco-driving, a practice informed/improved by BDA at Company A, has been linked to reductions in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which bring both economic and environmental benefits. Technologies similar to Truckcam are growing in popularity in some parts of the world, to the point where it is now common practice to use dashcam assess of accidents to establish liability. This has implications for logistics firms, in other parts of the world, where such practices might not yet be so commonplace, and for drivers and society more broadly.
   Social implications Improvements in utilisation and routing have the potential to reduce traffic congestion, which is responsible for losses in productivity, increases in fuel consumption, air pollution and noise, and can incite stress, aggression, anger and unsafe behaviours in drivers. Predictive analytics, which generate refuelling and maintenance schedules, have the potential to be adopted by all vehicle manufacturers, and could generate reductions in customer fuel costs, whilst improving the performance, efficiency, and life expectancy of future motor all vehicles. The high probability of occupations in the logistics industry being replaced by computer automation in the near future is also discussed.
   Originality/value The findings from this research serve as a valuable case example of a real-world deployment of BDA and IoT technologies in the logistics industry, and present implications for practitioners, researchers, and society more widely.

TI Remote Killing and the Fourth Amendment: Updating Constitutional Law to
   Address Expanded Police Lethality in the Robotic Age
SO UCLA LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB In the early morning hours of July 8, 2016, a loud boom echoed between the buildings in downtown Dallas, signaling both the end to a bloody massacre that took the lives of five Dallas-area police officers and the dawn of a new age in American law enforcement. Police officers had killed an armed suspect by affixing a bomb to a remotely controlled vehicle, driving it up to him from a position of relative safety, and detonating it. For the first time in American law enforcement history, police killed by remote control.
   In the aftermath of the incident, much has been written on the evolving field of robotics and the moral, legal, and technological safeguards needed as autonomous, independent-decisionmaking robots are armed and begin patrolling American streets. While this scholarship is important for a future that is undoubtedly coming, the device used in Dallas was not such a robot; it was a remotely controlled vehicle, capable of nothing more than what its human operator commanded. In this Comment, I regard the remotely controlled vehicle as an extension of the officer controlling it and focus on the Fourth Amendment implications of the remote use of lethal force. I examine the current constitutional standard for analyzing the reasonableness of the use of force under Graham v. Connor, and I discuss why it falls short in situations in which the officer has time to consider her options, as any officer engaging an individual via remotely controlled vehicle undoubtedly does.
   To address the shortfalls in current constitutional jurisprudence, I propose the Dallas test, an addendum to the Graham standard, that, while born of the analysis of the remote use of force, should be applied any time an officer has time to think and employs force. I argue that the deference courts give to the decisionmaking of officers on the scene must be tempered in circumstances in which an officer has time to consider her options and when alternative, less-lethal means of seizing the individual are available. In such circumstances, an officer's considered decision to forgo nonlethal alternatives and employ deadly force must be scrutinized more strictly than the Graham standard currently prescribes. Finally, I examine the actions of Dallas police under the new standard I propose. Although I ultimately conclude their actions were reasonable and therefore constitutional, this Comment exposes the gaps in the current standard and proposes a new form that a reasonableness analysis should take when police use of force is not a split-second decision. It makes clear that remote policing is coming and that the current constitutional jurisprudence is ill-equipped to meet it.

AB The transition to intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) is necessary to improve traffic flow in urban areas and reduce traffic congestion. Traffic modeling simplifies the understanding of the traffic paradigm and helps researchers to estimate traffic behavior and identify appropriate solutions for traffic control. One of the most used traffic models is the car-following model, which aims to control the movement of a vehicle based on the behavior of the vehicle ahead while ensuring collision avoidance. Differences between the simulated and observed model are present because the modeling process is affected by uncertainties. Furthermore, the measurement of traffic parameters also introduces uncertainties through measurement errors. To ensure that a simulation model fully replicates the observed model, it is necessary to have a calibration process that applies the appropriate compensation values to the simulation model parameters to reduce the differences compared to the observed model parameters. Fuzzy inference techniques proved their ability to solve uncertainties in continuous-time models. This article aims to provide a comparative analysis of the application of Mamdani and Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference systems (FISs) in the calibration of a continuous-time car-following model by proposing a methodology that allows for parallel data processing and the determination of the simulated model output resulting from the application of both fuzzy techniques. Evaluation of their impact on the follower vehicle considers the running distance and the dynamic safety distance based on the observed behavior of the leader vehicle. In this way, the identification of the appropriate compensation values to be applied to the input of the simulated model has a great impact on the development of autonomous driving solutions, where the real-time processing of sensor data has a crucial impact on establishing the car-following strategy while ensuring collision avoidance. This research performs a simulation experiment in Simulink (MATLAB R2023a, Natick, MA, USA: The MathWorks Inc.) and considers traffic data collected by inductive loops as parameters of the observed model. To emphasize the role of Mamdani and Takagi-Sugeno FISs, a noise injection is applied to the model parameters with the help of a band-limited white-noise Simulink block to simulate sensor measurement errors and errors introduced by the simulation process. A discussion based on performance evaluation follows the simulation experiment, and even though both techniques can be successfully applied in the calibration of the car-following models, the Takagi-Sugeno FIS provides more accurate compensation values, which leads to a closer behavior to the observed model.

AB When a volcano erupts, molten rocks, ash, pyroclastic flow, and debris flow can cause disasters. Debris flow is responsible for enormous damage across large areas. This makes debris flow simulations a crucial means of determining whether to issue an evacuation warning for area residents. For safety purposes, restricted areas are designated around volcanos during eruptions, making it difficult to gather information (such as the amount and permeability of ash) required for precise debris flow simulations. An unmanned observation system, intended for use in such restricted areas, was developed to address this issue. The proposed system is based on a multirotor micro-unmanned aerial vehicle (MUAV) that transports cameras, small devices to measure target environments, and a small robot to active volcanic areas. Several field tests were performed around active volcanoes for validation and system improvement. This study investigates five unmanned systems with field tests. The first one is an autonomous flight to collect three-dimensional (3D) terrain information. The MUAV conducted the long flight at Mt. Unzen-Fugen and evaluated the accuracy and calculation time of the developed 3D terrain model. The second one is a drop-down-type ash-depth measurement scale. The scales were deployed at Mt. Unzen-Fugen and confirmed its function. The third system is a soil-sampling device to estimate permeability. The device is hung from the MUAV by a long tether and collects soil and gravels directly with two rollers, while the MUAV is hovering. Indoor experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the device, and field experiments were conducted to confirm the validation of the system in different volcanic environments. The fourth system is an unmanned surface flow measurement device to estimate permeability. The device carries a water balloon and breaks it when it lands on the ground. By observing water flow with mounted cameras, qualitative permeability can be estimated. Initial experiments were conducted at Mt. Unzen-Fugen to confirm its function. The fifth system is a small ground vehicle with a rainfall sensor deployed by an MUAV. The MUAV carries a capturing net suspended from it and delivers and retrieves the ground vehicle, while it is hovering. Field experiments were conducted at Mt. Asama and Mt. Unzen-Fugen to validate the function of the system. Data obtained by these systems can contribute to the improvement of debris flow simulations developed in the project. In this paper, the above systems and experiments to evaluate them are introduced, and debris flow simulation results are demonstrated to prove the effectiveness of the data obtained by the proposed systems. Each field-test section includes a discussion of the lessons learned.

AB Neurobiological and neuroethological findings on insects can be used to design and construct small robots controlling their navigation on the basis of bio-inspired visual strategies and circuits. Animals' visual guidance is partly mediated by motion-sensitive neurons, which are responsible for gauging the optic flow. Although neurons of this kind were discovered in vertebrates' and invertebrates' visual systems more than 50 years ago, the principles and neural mechanisms involved have not yet been completely elucidated. Here, first, I propose to outline some of the findings we made during the last few decades by performing electrophysiological recordings on identified neurons in the housefly's eye while applying optical stimulation to identified photoreceptors. Whereas these findings shed light on the inner processing structure of an elementary motion detector (EMD), recent studies in which the latest genetic and neuroanatomical methods were applied to the fruitfly's visual system have identified some of the neurons in the visual chain which are possibly involved in the neural circuitry underlying a given EMD. Then, I will describe some of the proof-of-concept robots that we have developed on the basis of our biological findings. The 100-g robot OCTAVE, for example, is able to avoid the ground, react to wind, and land autonomously on a flat terrain without ever having to measure any state variables such as distances or speeds. The 100-g robots OSCAR 1 and OSCAR 2 inspired by the microscanner we discovered in the housefly's eye are able to stabilize their body using mainly visual means and track a moving edge with hyperacuity. These robots react to the optic flow, which is sensed by miniature optic flow sensors inspired by the housefly's EMDs. Constructing a "biorobot'' gives us a unique opportunity of checking the soundness and robustness of a principle that is initially thought to be understood by bringing it face to face with the real physical world. Bio-inspired robotics not only help neurobiologists and neuroethologists to identify and investigate worthwhile problems in animals' sensory-motor systems, but they also provide engineers with ideas for developing novel devices and machines with promising future applications, in the field of smart autonomous vehicles and microvehicles, for example.

AB The current cellular technology and vehicular networks cannot satisfy the mighty strides of vehicular network demands. Resource management has become a complex and challenging objective to gain expected outcomes in a vehicular environment. The 5G cellular network promises to provide ultra-high-speed, reduced delay, and reliable communications. The development of new technologies such as the network function virtualization (NFV) and software defined networking (SDN) are critical enabling technologies leveraging 5G. The SDN-based 5G network can provide an excellent platform for autonomous vehicles because SDN offers open programmability and flexibility for new services incorporation. This separation of control and data planes enables centralized and efficient management of resources in a very optimized and secure manner by having a global overview of the whole network. The SDN also provides flexibility in communication administration and resource management, which are of critical importance when considering the ad-hoc nature of vehicular network infrastructures, in terms of safety, privacy, and security, in vehicular network environments. In addition, it promises the overall improved performance. In this paper, we propose a flow-based policy framework on the basis of two tiers virtualization for vehicular networks using SDNs. The vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication is quite possible with wireless virtualization where different radio resources are allocated to V2V communications based on the flow classification, i.e., safety-related flow or non-safety flows, and the controller is responsible for managing the overall vehicular environment and V2X communications. The motivation behind this study is to implement a machine learning-enabled architecture to cater the sophisticated demands of modern vehicular Internet infrastructures. The inclination towards robust communications in 5G-enabled networks has made it somewhat tricky to manage network slicing efficiently. This paper also presents a proof of concept for leveraging machine learning-enabled resource classification and management through experimental evaluation of special-purpose testbed established in custom mininet setup. Furthermore, the results have been evaluated using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). While concluding the paper, it is shown that the LSTM has outperformed the rest of classification techniques with promising results.

ID BENEFITS; SYSTEMS
AB Objective: In 2006, Motorcycle Autonomous Emergency Braking (MAEB) was developed by a European Consortium (Powered Two Wheeler Integrated Safety, PISa) as a crash severity countermeasure for riders. This system can detect an obstacle through sensors in the front of the motorcycle and brakes automatically to achieve a 0.3 g deceleration if the collision is inevitable and the rider does not react. However, if the rider does brake, full braking force is applied automatically. Previous research into the potential benefits of MAEB has shown encouraging results. However, this was based on MAEB triggering algorithms designed for motorcycle crashes involving impacts with fixed objects and rear-end crashes. To estimate the full potential benefit of MAEB, there is a need to understand the full spectrum of motorcycle crashes and further develop triggering algorithms that apply to a wider spectrum of crash scenarios.
   Methods: In-depth crash data from 3 different countries were used: 80 hospital admittance cases collected during 2012-2013 within a 3-h driving range of Sydney, Australia, 40 crashes with Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 15 collected in the metropolitan area of Florence, Italy, during 2009-2012, and 92 fatal crashes that occurred in Sweden during 2008-2009. In the first step, the potential applicability of MAEB among the crashes was assessed using a decision tree method. To achieve this, a new triggering algorithm for MAEB was developed to address crossing scenarios as well as crashes involving stationary objects.
   In the second step, the potential benefit of MAEB across the applicable crashes was examined by using numerical computer simulations. Each crash was reconstructed twice-once with and once without MAEB deployed.
   Results: The principal finding is that using the new triggering algorithm, MAEB is seen to apply to a broad range of multivehicle motorcycle crashes. Crash mitigation was achieved through reductions in impact speed of up to approximately 10 percent, depending on the crash scenario and the initial vehicle pre-impact speeds.
   Conclusions: This research is the first attempt to evaluate MAEB with simulations on a broad range of crash scenarios using in-depth data. The results give further insights into the feasibility of MAEB in different speed ranges. It is clear then that MAEB is a promising technology that warrants further attention by researchers, manufacturers, and regulators.

TI VPR-Bench: An Open-Source Visual Place Recognition Evaluation Framework

AB Visual place recognition (VPR) is the process of recognising a previously visited place using visual information, often under varying appearance conditions and viewpoint changes and with computational constraints. VPR is related to the concepts of localisation, loop closure, image retrieval and is a critical component of many autonomous navigation systems ranging from autonomous vehicles to drones and computer vision systems. While the concept of place recognition has been around for many years, VPR research has grown rapidly as a field over the past decade due to improving camera hardware and its potential for deep learning-based techniques, and has become a widely studied topic in both the computer vision and robotics communities. This growth however has led to fragmentation and a lack of standardisation in the field, especially concerning performance evaluation. Moreover, the notion of viewpoint and illumination invariance of VPR techniques has largely been assessed qualitatively and hence ambiguously in the past. In this paper, we address these gaps through a new comprehensive open-source framework for assessing the performance of VPR techniques, dubbed "VPR-Bench". VPR-Bench (Open-sourced at: ) introduces two much-needed capabilities for VPR researchers: firstly, it contains a benchmark of 12 fully-integrated datasets and 10 VPR techniques, and secondly, it integrates a comprehensive variation-quantified dataset for quantifying viewpoint and illumination invariance. We apply and analyse popular evaluation metrics for VPR from both the computer vision and robotics communities, and discuss how these different metrics complement and/or replace each other, depending upon the underlying applications and system requirements. Our analysis reveals that no universal SOTA VPR technique exists, since: (a) state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance is achieved by 8 out of the 10 techniques on at least one dataset, (b) SOTA technique in one community does not necessarily yield SOTA performance in the other given the differences in datasets and metrics. Furthermore, we identify key open challenges since: (c) all 10 techniques suffer greatly in perceptually-aliased and less-structured environments, (d) all techniques suffer from viewpoint variance where lateral change has less effect than 3D change, and (e) directional illumination change has more adverse effects on matching confidence than uniform illumination change. We also present detailed meta-analyses regarding the roles of varying ground-truths, platforms, application requirements and technique parameters. Finally, VPR-Bench provides a unified implementation to deploy these VPR techniques, metrics and datasets, and is extensible through templates.

AB A suitable energy management scheme and integrating renewable energy resources (RERs) can significantly increase energy efficiency and the stability of future grids operation. This work modeled a household energy management comprising a microgrid (MG) system and demand response programs (DRPs). Residential loads with price-based tariffs are introduced to reduce peak load demands and energy costs. For incorporating the uncertainties in RERs, their stochastic nature is modeled with a probabilistic method. This paper proposes a joint optimization approach for the optimal planning and operation of grid-connected residential, rural MG integrated into renewable energy and electric vehicles (EVs) in view of DRPs. The investigation focuses on energy saving of residential homes under different DRPs and RERs integration. The EVs are integrated into MG by including photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT), fuel cell (FC), and diesel engines (DEs). A multi-objective optimization problem has been formulated to minimize the operating cost, pollutant treatment cost, and carbon emissions cost defined as C1, C2, and C3, respectively. The load demand has been rescheduled because of three DRPs, i.e., critical peak pricing (CPP), real-time electricity pricing (RTEP), and time of use (TOU). Further, the EV load has also been analyzed in autonomous and coordinated charging strategies. Using a judgement matrix, the proposed multi-objective problem is transformed into a single-objective problem. The results of an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm are compared with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The simulation analysis was accomplished by employing ABC and PSO in MATLAB. The mathematical model of MG was implemented, and the effects of DRPs based MG were investigated under different numbers of EVs and load data to reduce different costs. To analyze the impact of DRPs, the residential, rural MG is implemented for 50 homes with a peak load of 5 kW each and EV load with 80 EVs and 700 EVs, respectively. The simulation results with different test cases are formulated while analyzing the tradeoff between ABC and PSO algorithms. The simulation analysis shows that multiple DRPs, EVs, and RERs offered a substantial trade-off.

AB In the field of aircraft maintenance, regular inspection of fuselage surface during the aircraft life cycle is a vital task to ensure the aircraft quality and flight safety. Currently, the inspection task is generally carried out manually in an indoor hangar, which is with low efficiency and reliability. In this article, a novel system based on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is presented to achieve automated aircraft surface inspection efficiently. The hardware is established with a lightweight and low-cost flight platform, on which a sensor containing an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a camera is equipped for UAV localization. A high-resolution camera is equipped to collect images of fuselage for defect detection. Our inspection framework is mainly composed of two modules: the UAV localization module and the defect detection module. The localization module is designed to estimate the relative pose between the UAV and the aircraft, providing the foundation for image positioning on the aircraft surface. The existing visual-inertial odometry (VIO) approach is adopted to implement the pose estimation. To reduce the large drifts caused by the VIO approach, a novel method is proposed to deploy precalibrated ArUco markers around the aircraft, which serve as external constraints for the VIO objective to realize joint optimization of the camera pose. In addition, an adaptive weighting method is proposed, which takes into consideration the recognition effect of markers to balance the external constraints. The defect detection module aims to detect defects on the fuselage surface from images captured by the high-resolution camera, which is implemented based on deep learning. To address the issue of detection on a few training samples, the transfer learning strategy is exploited to first pretrain the model on a public defect dataset and then fine-tune it on our collected aircraft defect dataset. After detecting the defects, the defective region is reflected on the fuselage surface through the UAV pose on the corresponding frame provided by the localization module, realizing the accurate defect localization. Experiments on both the simulation environment and real data demonstrate the superiority of our proposed external localization module and the effectiveness of the crack detection module.

AB With the prevalence of Aerospace Technologies, the regulations of cybersecurity are becoming smarter, assured, and long-lasting. Modern communication network technologies have enormous growth in the cyber threats and masquerading attacks to steal data. Hence concepts and mechanisms are built and made into regulations for a safer environment. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), often known as drones, are becoming increasingly common, posing new problems in areas such as monitoring, agriculture, weather prediction, surveillance and other fields. This includes a large number of devices that, owing to a lack of energy or a system shutdown, might occasionally send incorrect signals and must be monitored autonomously by drones in remote regions. In this paper, we propose a energy intensive blockchain-based platform for controlling drone operations while ensuring trust and security for all parties involved. The goal of this paper is to explore the extent of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) vulnerability to deceptive (Global Navigation Satellite System) GNSS signals by establishing the necessary conditions for UAV via GPS (Global Positioning System) spoofing. The existing algorithms used to mitigate spoofing attacks have unbounded long-term errors, which increase in time during its performance. An innovative idea is necessitating to eliminate those errors, thereby in the proposed work, Ethereum Blockchain has been implemented to create a blockchain network to mitigate the spoofing attacks. Blockchains are incredibly popular nowadays and is the basic technology for cryptocurrencies. Blockchain technology greatly impacts the applications in UAVs. The proposed methodology uses the network that has to be registered in the aerospace components through the ledger associated with relevant data communication in the Blockchain. When an intruder gets acquired with the data in the network with a single block, it cannot affect the entire network due to the data integrity in the ledgers that has been cryptographically assigned. The blockchain network intermittently verifies the geolocation data so that any outlying data would be detected and eliminated quickly. The data that has been verified is made available for the view of aviation and spacecraft operations through the distributed network. The proposed methodology outperforms the existing methods in intense drift error and, in the case of confidentiality and integrity, it has very low risk when compared to existing methods.

TI Biogas as a boundary object for policy integration - the case of
   Stockholm
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION

DT Article

   Regional policy
AB Policy integration between autonomous policy sectors is a tool for managing interdependent technical systems to avoid suboptimization. Biogas, regarded as a renewable energy carrier usable in the energy and transport systems, is produced from organic material such as municipal organic waste (MOW). It is connected to a number of systems and policy sectors, making biogas management an instructive case for studying policy integration processes. Swedish biogas production has increased in recent years, and in the Stockholm region there has been enormous interest in biogas production for vehicle use since the early 2000s. In this paper biogas will be discussed in the perspective that it is or has potential to be a vital part of three systems: waste, energy, and transportation. The aim is to analyse whether policy integration occurs between the systems and to explore if boundary objects can play a role when understanding policy integration processes. In examining the biogas development process, regional policy documents and interviews with stakeholders in the biogas process are used. The results indicate consensus among regional actors that biogas should be used in vehicles and that MOW should be collected for this purpose, indicating congruence of understanding of biogas. Biogas functions as a boundary object in these cases and contributes to high policy integration between the energy and waste systems. Despite consensus that biogas should be used in the transport system, there is little policy integration between the energy and transport sectors. The policy sectors of transport infrastructure and spatial planning are not concerned with fuel or biogas issues. Public transport policy focuses on the use of biogas for their vehicles, but even if biogas serves as a boundary object it is not developing into policy integration processes. The conclusion is that biogas development has resulted in integrated policymaking between the energy and waste sectors and biogas has served as a strong boundary object which has spurred that development. Between the energy and transport sectors there is little policy integration, and biogas is not a boundary object in the cases of transport infrastructure and spatial planning policy sectors. What this case shows is that if there is a lack of presence of a boundary object it suggests no preconditions for policy integration processes to start. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As one of the commonly used vehicles for underwater detection, underwater robots are facing a series of problems. The real underwater environment is large-scale, complex, real-time and dynamic, and many unknown obstacles may exist in the underwater environment. Under such complex conditions and lack of prior knowledge, the existing path planning methods are difficult to plan, therefore they cannot effectively meet the actual demands. In response to these problems, a three-dimensional marine environment including multiple obstacles is established with the real ocean current data in this paper, which is consistent with the actual application scenarios. Then, we propose an N-step Priority Double DQN (NPDDQN) path planning algorithm, which potently realizes obstacle avoidance in the complex environment. In addition, this study proposes an experience screening mechanism, which screens the explored positive experience and improves its reuse rate, thus efficiently improving the algorithm stability in the dynamic environment. This paper verifies the better performance of reinforcement learning compared with a variety of traditional methods in three-dimensional underwater path planning. Underwater robots based on the proposed method have good autonomy and stability, which provides a new method for path planning of underwater robots. Note to Practitioners-The goal of this study is to provide a new solution for obstacle avoidance in path planning of underwater robots, which is consistent with the dynamic and real-time demands of the real environment. Existing underwater path planning researches lack a consistent environment with the actual application, and therefore we firstly construct a three-dimensional ocean environment with real ocean current data to provide support for the algorithms. Additionally, most of the algorithms are pre-planning methods or require long-time calculation, and there is little research on obstacle avoidance. In the face of obstacle changes, underwater robots with poor adaptability will cause performance decline and even economic losses. The proposed algorithm learns through interaction with the environment, and therefore it does not require any prior experience, and has good adaptability as well as fast inference speed. Especially, in the dynamic environment, algorithm performance is difficult to guarantee due to less positive experience in exploration. The proposed experience screening mechanism improves the stability of the algorithm, so that the underwater robot maintains stable performance in different dynamic environments.

AB Applications of remote sensing using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in agriculture has proved to be an effective and efficient way of obtaining field information. In this study, we validated the feasibility of utilizing multi-temporal color images acquired from a low altitude UAV-camera system to monitor real-time wheat growth status and to map within-field spatial variations of wheat yield for smallholder wheat growers, which could serve as references for site-specific operations. Firstly, eight orthomosaic images covering a small winter wheat field were generated to monitor wheat growth status from heading stage to ripening stage in Hokkaido, Japan. Multi-temporal orthomosaic images indicated straightforward sense of canopy color changes and spatial variations of tiller densities. Besides, the last two orthomosaic images taken from about two weeks prior to harvesting also notified the occurrence of lodging by visual inspection, which could be used to generate navigation maps guiding drivers or autonomous harvesting vehicles to adjust operation speed according to specific lodging situations for less harvesting loss. Subsequently orthomosaic images were geo-referenced so that further study on stepwise regression analysis among nine wheat yield samples and five color vegetation indices (CVI) could be conducted, which showed that wheat yield correlated with four accumulative CVIs of visible-band difference vegetation index (VDVI), normalized green-blue difference index (NGBDI), green-red ratio index (GRRI), and excess green vegetation index (ExG), with the coefficient of determination and RMSE as 0.94 and 0.02, respectively. The average value of sampled wheat yield was 8.6 t/ha. The regression model was also validated by using leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) method, of which root-mean-square error of predication (RMSEP) was 0.06. Finally, based on the stepwise regression model, a map of estimated wheat yield was generated, so that within-field spatial variations of wheat yield, which was usually seen as general information on soil fertility, water potential, tiller density, etc., could be better understood for applications of site-specific or variable-rate operations. Average yield of the studied field was also calculated according to the map of wheat yield as 7.2 t/ha.

AB Many commercially important groupers (Epinephelidae) form fish spawning aggregations (FSA) at specific sites where the spawning stock is concentrated to spawn within a couple of months each year. The concentrated nature and short duration of these FSAs render these species susceptible to fishing pressure leading to their disappearance or decrease in the number of spawning fish. As a result of directed fishing during FSAs many largebodied groupers are now International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red-listed. Puerto Rico within the US Caribbean is where protective measures have been designated for the recovery of grouper species that aggregate to spawn, in particular the threatened (Endangered Species Act) Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus) and sustainability of the red hind (Epinephelus guttatus). The regulations at three marine managed areas (MMAs) off the west coast of Puerto Rico, have been focused on reproductive seasons, through seasonal closures. However, these management zone boundaries may fail to fully encompass fish migration paths and temporal variability in FSAs, exposing threatened species like the Nassau grouper to incidental fishing and poaching. In addition to traditional methods used to study FSAs, passive acoustics represent a relatively new approach to assess the presence and spatio-temporal distribution of aggregating species. Sound production is common among many fishes, including the Nassau and red hind groupers, and is most often associated with courtship and spawning behavior. In this study, we present the results from the deployment of an autonomous surface vehicle equipped with a passive acoustic monitoring system along the insular shelf break that surveyed the MMAs during their peak spawning season. Our observations suggest that known FSA sites are critical habitat for both species and the existence of potential, previously unknown FSAs for multiple grouper species as well, highlighting the importance of spatial and temporal expansion of existing regulations.

AB This paper presents a path tracking algorithm based on a fuzzy control pure tracking model for autonomous navigation of 4WS agricultural machines. The aim of this research is to implement path tracking for unmanned 4WS agricultural machinery and to solve the problem of difficult determination of forward-looking distances in pure tracking algorithms. By using the pure tracking algorithm model and a fuzzy controller, this paper converts the heading deviation and lateral deviation in one control cycle into the sum of lateral deviation as the first input to the fuzzy controller and the vehicle travel speed as the second input to the fuzzy controller, thus outputting the actual forward-looking distance. In order to verify the practicality, accuracy, and path tracking precision of the proposed path tracking algorithm, a straight-line path tracking test under variable speed conditions and a turning path tracking test under non-fixed forward-looking distance conditions were carried out using a test platform after simulation on MATLAB/Simulink in this paper. The test results show that: in the straight-line path tracking process, the maximum overshoot is 0.123 m, and after stable driving, the maximum lateral deviation of the straight-line tracking part is 0.058 m and the steady-state deviation is 0.039 m; in the bow-turn path tracking process, the absolute value of the maximum lateral deviation of the actual driving trajectory of the farm machine from the desired path is 0.139 m, and the average tracking deviation is 0.041 m. It can be seen that the path tracking control algorithm proposed in this paper has good tracking accuracy as well as convergence, and can meet the demand for the autonomous navigation function of 4WS agricultural machinery, which has a certain application value.

AB Objection detection of vehicles and pedestrians in fog is of great significance for intelligent transportation and autonomous driving. Polarization image is beneficial to improve the object detection under adverse weather conditions. This study proposed a polarization image fusion method based on grouped convolutional attention network (GCAnet) to improve the object detection for cars and persons in foggy street scenes. Based on the international available Polar LITIS image dataset, a multi-channel grouped convolution matrix was first constructed to input different types of polarization images. Then, a grouped attention module was added to enhance the features in each type of polarization image, and finally each convolutional matrix was further connected to the detection network in series to perform objection detection. The experimental results prove that three types of polarization image fusion are obviously better than those of any two types of polarization image fusion and one single polarization image; and adding ECA attention module after multi-channel convolution can further enhance the accuracy of I04590 + Pauli + Stokes fused image to the highest value of 76.46%. The improvement of network lightweight shows that the Mobilenet-ECA has increased the speed by 26% with a slightly reduced accuracy. The proposed GCAnet method has significantly surpassed traditional objection detection networks of SSD300, SSD512, Faster R-CNN600, Yolov3, and Yolov4, which has increased the mAP@0.5 by 28.90%, 27.60%, 15.01%, 24.98%, and 16.45%, respectively; and has increased the mAP@0.5 by 9.36% and 6.20% compared to foggy image detection methods of AOD-Net SSD and DeRF-Yolov3-X, respectively. This work demonstrates the potential of GCAnet enabled polarization image fusion technology to be used as an effective foggy objection detection method in the field of intelligent transportation and autonomous driving.

AB Owing to the fundamental nature of all-terrain exploration, autonomous rovers are confronted with unknown environments. This is especially apparent regarding soil interactions, as the nature of the soil is typically Unknown. This work aims at establishing a framework from which the rover call learn from its interaction with the terrains encountered and shows the importance Of Such a method. We introduce a set of rover-terrain interaction (RTI) and remote data metrics that are expressed in different subspaces. In practice, the information characterizing the terrains, obtained from remote sensors (e.g., a camera) and local sensors (e.g., all inertial measurement unit) is used to characterize the respective remote data and RTI model. In each subspace, which call be described as a feature space encompassing either a remote data measurement Or all RTI, similar features are grouped to form classes, and the probability distribution function over the features is learned for each one of those classes. Subsequently, data acquired oil the same terrain are used to associate the corresponding models in each subspace and to build an inference model. Based oil the remote sensor data measured, the RTI model is predicted using the inference model. This process corresponds to a near-to-far approach and provides the most probable RTI metrics of the terrain lying ahead of the rover. The predicted RTI metrics are then used to plan all optimal path with respect to the RTI model and therefore influence the, rover trajectory. The CRAB rover is Used in this work for the implementation and testing of the approach, which we call interactions learned from experiments (RTILE). This article presents RTILE, describes its implementation, and concludes with results from field tests that validate the approach. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Regulation of multi-area power system load frequency in presence of V2G
   scheme
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ELECTRIC VEHICLES; PERFORMANCE
AB The integration of renewable sources (RSs) and the widespread deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) has transitioned from a luxury to a necessity in modern power systems. This results from the sharp increase in electric power demand and public awareness of switching to green energy. However, in addition to load fluctuations and changes in system parameters, these RSs and EVs negatively impact the load frequency (LF). This work presents a LF control for a modern multi-area power system incorporating photovoltaic (PV) and EV chargers. The proposed controller primarily utilizes EV chargers within modern power systems. This approach offers the advantage of using the already present components instead of introducing new ones. The proposed controller comprises the ecological optimization approach (ECO) and the integral controller (I). Both of these components are designed for autonomous vehicle-to-grid (V2G) devices. The proposed control technique is applied to a three-area power system, where the V2G scheme is located in Area-1. Variations in the load, PV power generated, and system parameters are considered to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed (I+ECO+V2G) controller for controlling the LF. To assess the performance of the proposed I+ECO+V2G system, a comparative analysis is conducted to compare its performance with both the I+ECO system and the standard I-controller. The simulation findings demonstrate that implementing the I+ECO and the proposed I+ECO+V2G strategies results in enhanced system stability and decreased LF fluctuations compared to the conventional I-control approach. Furthermore, while comparing the I+ECO control technique to the suggested control strategy I+ECO+V2G, it was seen that the latter reaches steady state values more quickly. The results validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed controller in mitigating the impacts of load disturbances, uncertainties, and nonlinearities within the system. These simulations were performed using MATLAB/SIMULINK. To validate the outcomes of the simulation results, an experimental setup consisting of a real-time dSPACE DS1103 connected to another PC via QUARC pid_e data acquisition card was used. The experimental findings have substantiated the accuracy of the simulation findings about the superiority of the I+ECO+V2G methodology compared to both the I+ECO and I-control methodologies concerning system performance and LF control.

AB Material handling systems (MHSs) are an integral part of logistics functions in manufacturing and service organizations. Material handling equipment (MHE) is considered the pivotal actor of any given MHS. Decisions ranging from the strategic level, such as selecting the proper MHE, capacity, and ownership (in-house or outsourcing) to operational level decisions such as resource allocation, scheduling, and routing of MHEs, are critical to the efficiency of an MHS. Industry practitioners use various methods and tools to evaluate these MHSs to find the best policies for their operations. This study identifies past works related to the performance evaluation and optimisation of MHSs using queueing network models. Moreover, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of identified research questions. The study methodology adopts a systematic literature review, bibliometric, and content analysis techniques proposed in similar research studies. This study provides material logistics scholars and practitioners with a thorough understanding of queueing networks as a modelling tool for analysing MHS applications in various domains.

AB 5G is planned to link not just traditional devices such as tablets and smartphones, but also smart devices, smart homes, autonomous vehicles, and industry 4.0 which significantly increases the amount of traffic over the network. Network function virtualization and software defined networks will be used heavily to create scalably and on-demand 5G architecture using virtual network functions. In this article, we proposed a unique approach to scaling 5G core network resources by predicting traffic load fluctuations using a hybrid model. Most researchers have presented deep learning models to anticipate regular traffic to improve services, however, these recommended models have failed to estimate traffic load during festivals to unexpected changes in traffic conditions. To solve this issue, we introduced CNN+LSTM, a hybrid model that combines CNN, and LSTM to forecast cumulative network traffic across particular intervals to scale up and properly estimate the availability of 5G network resources by leveraging traffic load variations. The suggested model surpasses the other tested deep learning models and existing techniques that forecast the output in both normal and abnormal traffic conditions, according to a comparison of the produced output with existing techniques.

ID VEHICLES; IMPACT; PHASE
AB An adaptive guidance system suitable for the terminal phase trajectory of a hypersonic strike weapon is optimized using reinforcement meta learning. The guidance system maps observations directly to commanded bank angle, angle of attack, and sideslip angle rates. Importantly, the observations are directly measurable from radar seeker outputs with minimal processing. The optimization framework implements a shaping reward that minimizes the line-of-sight rotation rate, with a terminal reward given if the agent satisfies path constraints and meets terminal accuracy and speed criteria. This paper shows that the guidance system can adapt to off-nominal flight conditions, including perturbation of aerodynamic coefficient parameters, actuator failure scenarios, sensor scale factor errors, and actuator lag, while satisfying heating rate, dynamic pressure, and load path constraints, as well as a minimum impact speed constraint. This paper demonstrates precision strike capability against a maneuvering ground target and the ability to divert to a new target, the latter being important to maximize strike effectiveness for a group of hypersonic strike weapons. Moreover, this paper demonstrates a threat evasion strategy against interceptors with limited midcourse correction capability, where the hypersonic strike weapon implements multiple diverts to alternate targets, with the last divert to the actual target.

AB This work explores the application of nonlinear oscillators coupled by an electric field in water, inspired by weakly electric fish. Such coupled oscillators operate in clear and colloidal (mud, bottom silt) water and represent a collective electrochemical sensor that is sensitive to global environmental parameters, the geometry of the common electric field and spatial dynamics of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Implemented in hardware and software, this approach can be used to create global awareness in a group of robots, which possess limited sensing and communication capabilities. Using oscillators from different AUVs enables extension of the range limitations related to the electric dipole of a single AUV. Applications of this technique are demonstrated for detecting the number of AUVs, distances between them, perception of dielectric objects and synchronization of behavior. Recognizing self-/nonself-generated signals by electric fish is re-embodied in a technological way through an 'electrical mirror' for discrimination between 'collective self' and 'collective nonself'. These approaches have been implemented in several research projects with bioinspired/biohybrid systems in fresh and salt water, and electrochemical sensing in fluidic media.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have drawn significant attention from researchers over the last decade due to their wide range of possible uses. Carrying massive payloads concurrent with light UAVs has broadened the aeronautics context, which is feasible using powerful engines; however, it faces several practical control dilemmas. This paper introduces a medium-scale hexacopter, called the Fan Hopper, alimenting Electric Ducted Fan (EDF) engines to investigate the optimum control possibilities for a fully autonomous mission carrying a heavy payload, even of liquid materials, considering calculations of higher orders. Conducting proper aerodynamic simulations, the model is designed, developed, and tested through robotic Gazebo simulation software to ensure proper functionality. Correspondingly, an Ardupilot open source autopilot is employed and enhanced by a model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) for the attitude loop to stabilize the system in case of an EDF failure and adapt the system coefficients when the fluid payload is released. Obtained results reveal less than a 5% error in comparison to desired values. This research reveals that tuned EDFs function dramatically for large payloads; meanwhile, thermal engines could be substituted to maintain much more flight endurance.

TI Quantum decision making in automatic driving
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

ID COGNITION
AB The behavior intention estimation and interaction between Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and human traffic participants are the key problems in Automatic Driving System (ADS). When the classical decision theory studies implicitly assume that the behavior of human traffic participants is completely rational. However, according to the booming quantum decision theory in recent years and actual traffic cases, traffic behaviors and other human behaviors are often irrational and violate the assumptions of classical cognitive and decision theory. This paper explores the decision-making problem in the two-car game scene based on quantum decision theory and compares it with the current mainstream method of studying irrational behavior-Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) model. The comparative analysis proved that the Quantum Game Theory (QGT) model can explain the separation effect which the classical probability model can't reveal, and it has more advantages than CPT model in dealing with game scene decision-making. When two cars interact with each other, the QGT model can consider the interests of both sides from the perspective of the other car. Compared with the classical probability model and CPT model, the QGT is more realistic in the behavior decision-making of ADS.

AB With the rapid development of autonomous driving technologies, it becomes difficult to reconcile the conflict between ever-increasing demands for high process rate in the intelligent automotive tasks and resource-constrained on-board processors. Fortunately, vehicular edge computing (VEC) has been proposed to meet the pressing resource demands. Due to the delay-sensitive traits of automotive tasks, only a heterogeneous vehicular network with multiple access technologies may be able to handle these demanding challenges. In this article, we propose an intelligent task offloading framework in heterogeneous vehicular networks with three Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication technologies, namely Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC), cellular-based V2X (C-V2X) communication, and millimeter wave (mmWave) communication. Based on stochastic network calculus, this article firstly derives the delay upper bounds of different offloading technologies with certain failure probabilities. Moreover, we propose a federated Q-learning method that optimally utilizes the available resources to minimize the communication/computing budgets and the offloading failure probabilities. Simulation results indicate that our proposed algorithm can significantly outperform the existing algorithms in terms of resource cost and offloading failure probability.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) positioning with the correction of imaging aberrations in the photonic platform remains challenging. Here, we combine techniques from nanophotonics and machine vision to significantly improve the imaging and positioning performance. We use a titanium dioxide metalens array operating in the visible region to realize multipole imaging and introduce a cross-correlation-based gradient descent algorithm to analyze the intensity distribution in the image plane. This corrects the monochromatic aberrations to improve the imaging quality. Analysis of the two-dimensional aberration-corrected information in the image plane enables the 3D coordinates of the object to be determined with a measured relative accuracy of 0.60%-1.31%. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the metalens array for arbitrary incident polarization states. Our approach is single-shot, compact, aberration-corrected, polarization-insensitive, and paves the way for future integrated photonic robotic vision systems and intelligent sensing platforms that are feasible on the submillimeter scale, such as face recognition, autonomous vehicles, microrobots, and wearable intelligent devices.

AB Multicore architectures are widely adopted in the emerging real-time applications, such as autonomous vehicles and robotics, where latency is required to be both bounded in the worst case (i.e., time predictability) and low. With the number of processors growing, the conventional memory interconnects, i.e., shared bus, crossbar, and network-on-chip (NoC), suffer high latency due to the increasing logic size of their centralized arbiter, which is deployed for time predictability. In this article, we introduce a novel distributed multimemory interconnect, Meshed Bluetree, and explain its operation. Constructed by coupling a router network with multiple Bluetree-based memory architectures in parallel, Meshed Bluetree allows simultaneous access to multiple memory modules. We present the analysis for the predictable timing behavior of memory access to bound the worst case. The evaluation of FPGA with synthetic memory workloads and real-world benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our work, i.e., as the number of memory modules increases, the latency is reduced with the same scale. This work reports the first time-predictable distributed multimemory interconnect, significantly contributing to multicore real-time systems.

AB The Tactical Driver Behavior modeling problem requires an understanding of driver actions in complicated urban scenarios fromrich multimodal signals including video, LiDARand CAN signal data streams. However, the majority of deep learning research is focused either on learning the vehicle/environment state (sensor fusion) or the driver policy (from temporal data), but not both. Learning both tasks jointly offers the richest distillation of knowledge but presents challenges in the formulation and successful training. In this work, we propose promising first steps in this direction. Inspired by the gating mechanisms in Long ShortTerm Memory units (LSTMs), we propose Gated Recurrent Fusion Units (GRFU) that learn fusion weighting and temporal weighting simultaneously. We demonstrate it's superior performance over multimodal and temporal baselines in supervised regression and classification tasks, all in the realm of autonomous navigation. On tactical driver behavior classification using Honda Driving Dataset (HDD), we report 10% improvement in mean Average Precision (mAP) score, and similarly, for steering angle regression onTORCS dataset, we note a 20% drop in Mean Squared Error (MSE) over the state-of-the-art.

AB The generation and evolution of ocean waves by wind is one of the most complex phenomena in geophysics, and is of great practical significance. Predictive capabilities of respective wave models, however, are impaired by lack of field in situ observations, particularly in extreme Metocean conditions. The paper outlines and highlights important gaps in understanding the Metocean processes and suggests a major observational program in the Southern Ocean. This large, but poorly investigated part of the World Ocean is home to extreme weather around the year. The observational network would include distributed system of buoys (drifting and stationary) and autonomous surface vehicles (ASV), intended for measurements of waves and air-sea fluxes in the Southern Ocean. It would help to resolve the issues of limiting fetches, extreme Extra-Tropical cyclones, swell propagation and attenuation, wave-current interactions, and address the topics of wave-induced dispersal of floating objects, wave-ice interactions in the Marginal Ice Zone, Metocean climatology and its connection with the global climate.

AB This article argues that automobiles can be understood as avatars, or avacars, given the inclusive definition of avatars as mediated (not necessarily digital) representations of human users that facilitate interaction with other users, entities, or environments. Building on an understanding of user-avatar relationships, the article argues that automobiles (and avatars in general) serve as self-representations, social others, and/or utilitarian tools in different degrees. Examples of automotive and digital avatars are classified within this Self-Other-Utility (SOU) framework. The article argues that this framework provides a new and valuable approach to understanding the antecedents and consequences of using avatars. Regarding consequences, in the automotive context, the SOU framework could be used to explain how psychological and social factors influence driving habits (i.e., safety), adoption (e.g., of autonomous vehicles), and brand loyalty. A measurement scale to facilitate such research is offered. After presenting some potential limitations to this approach, the article concludes with counterarguments that reaffirm the value and relevance of this new perspective to communication scholarship.

DE marine renewable energy; maritime markets; power at sea
ID TECHNOLOGY
AB Marine renewable energy (MRE) is in the early stages of contributing to the energy portfolios of the United States and many other nations around the world. Although many MRE developers are designing devices that will harvest energy to contribute to the electrical grid from waves, tides, and ocean currents, a number of other promising maritime markets could be supplied with MRE power at sea. These maritime markets are often less price sensitive, have fewer options than utility-scale electricity markets, and can handle some degree of intermittency. Some of the promising maritime markets that could benefit from co-located power generation include ocean observation nodes, underwater recharge of autonomous vehicles, desalination of seawater for remote coastal areas, offshore aquaculture, shoreline protection and electricity generation, providing electricity and freshwater following coastal emergencies, providing power to islanded and isolated communities, powering and cooling nearshore underwater data centers, recharging of electric surface vessels, and personal charging of electronics. Pairing of MRE power generation with these and other maritime markets is in the early stages, but the potential for synergy and growth of MRE coupled to these markets is promising.

ID TEXTURE
AB In this article, we propose a road detection method based on the fusion of Lidar and image data under the framework of conditional random field. Firstly, Lidar point clouds are projected into the monocular images by cross calibration to get the sparse height images, and then we get high-resolution height images via a joint bilateral filter. Then, for all the training image pixels which have corresponding Lidar points, we extract their features from color image and Lidar point clouds, respectively, and use these features together with the location features to train an Adaboost classifier. After that, all the testing pixels are classified into road or non-road under a conditional random field framework. In this conditional random field framework, we use the scores computed from the Adaboost classifier as the unary potential and take the height value of each pixel and its color information into consideration together for the pairwise potential. Finally, experimental tests have been carried out on the KITTI Road data set, and the results show that our method performs well on this data set.

ID AUTONOMOUS NAVIGATION; MOBILE; ALGORITHM
AB The possibility of identifying the type of multipath environment and receiver motion (e.g. pedestrian, vehicular) using pattern recognition approaches based on multipath parameters is investigated. This allows the receiver to adjust its tracking strategy and optimally tune its tracking parameters to mitigate code multipath effects. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification method with a modified Gaussian kernel is applied in this approach. A set of temporal and spectral features is extracted from the correlation samples of the received signals in different environments to train the classifier. The latter is then used in the structure of stochastic gradient-based adaptive multipath compensation and tracking techniques to tune the signal tracking parameters based on the environment and receiver motion. Simulation and real data measurements using Galileo E1B/C signals are performed to assess the validity of the proposed environment identification approaches and to evaluate the impact of the proposed context-based receiver parameter tuning techniques on tracking performance in multipath environments. Test results showed that the proposed classifiers have an accuracy between 86% and 92%, and the tracking performance improved by about 15%.

AB This paper presents a system for crowdsourcing saliency interest points for 3D photo-textured maps rendered on smartphones and tablets. An app was created that is capable of interactively rendering 3D reconstructions gathered with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle. Through hundreds of thousands of logged user interactions with the models we attempt to data-mine salient interest points. To this end we propose two models for calculating saliency from human interaction with the data. The first uses the view frustum of the camera to track the amount of time points are on screen. The second uses the velocity of the camera as an indicator of saliency and uses a Hidden Markov model to learn the classification of salient and non-salient points. To provide a comparison to existing techniques several traditional visual saliency approaches are applied to orthographic views of the models' photo-texturing. The results of all approaches are validated with human attention ground truth gathered using a remote gaze-tracking system that recorded the locations of the person's attention while exploring the models.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL
LA English
DT Article
ID CONTROL ARCHITECTURES; DESIGN
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can be effectively applied to oceanographic research. However, long-term marine environment measuring is impractical for AUVs because the energy storage is limited. The objective of this paper is to develop the variable buoyancy AUVs with the capacity of landing and bottom-sitting for an extended measuring period and minimum energy consumption. In order to land safely on the expected position on the seafloor, a variable buoyancy system (VBS) has been developed for the AUVs by using water ballast. The ballast operation and landing motion of the AUVs should meet the requirements of landing position/attitude accuracy on the seafloor. The navigation procedure of an AUV for landing and taking-off involves the following steps: deployment; navigation; landing; measuring operation on the seafloor; takeoff; and return navigation. With regard to landing strategy, the bidirectional motion planning method is developed to generate the trajectory for landing on an expected location. The real AUV follows the track which the virtual AUV generates to land on the expected location. A landing controller is designed by using sliding mode fuzzy control (SMFC) technique. The simulation results show that the method performs effectively.

ID TIRE; SENSORS; SYSTEM
AB Recently, the growing trends towards autonomous driving and full automation of terrestrial vehicles have intensified the need for intelligent and interconnected systems to collect and communicate reliable data in real-time. Since the tyres represent the primary sensing system between the vehicle and the ground, it comes natural to designate them to acquire information about their interaction with the road. Intelligent or smart tyre technologies can, indeed, be used to estimate both vehicle's performance and environmental conditions, leading to handling, NVH and comfort improvements. Inspired by some encouraging results found in previous works, in this investigation we present three model-based estimators to detect the forces acting in the contact patch for an intelligent tyre. The underlying mathematical foundation is the Flexible Ring Tyre Model (FRM), which is able to describe the in-plane dynamics of intelligent tyre systems. More specifically, it represents the tyre treadband by means of a flexible ring restrained at its mean radius by a viscoelastic foundation. Due to its relatively simplicity, the FRTM allows to obtain a closed-form solution for the treadband displacements, accelerations and circumferential strain, whilst being accurate enough to capture all the relevant phenomena concerning the tyre dynamics. The governing Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) of the system are reduced to a set of coupled Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) by performing the Fourier series expansion. An optimal observer is then designed based on the Unscented Kalman Filter to account for the nonlinearities which arise when the vertical load acting on the tyre and the friction coefficient are included in the augmented state space representation. The three different technologies considered in this study are: strain, displacement, and acceleration-based intelligent tyres. All of them are shown to be capable of estimating the quantities of interest - the actual state of the system, the normal force and the adhesion coefficient - with high accuracy in very short times. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed approach is validated by considering a step variation in both the vertical load and the available friction. The performances of the observers are finally compared by using the RSS and MSE indices.

As an application, we propose the tracking of a car-type vehicle. In this case, data related to the altitude and the lateral angles have no importance for the visual system. Indeed, to perform the tracking, we only need to know the longitudinal displacements (along the x and y axes) and the orientation along the z-axis. However, those data are necessary for the quadrotor's guidance problem. Thanks to the concept of differential flatness, we demonstrate that if we manage to extract the displacements according to the three axes and the orientation according to the yaw angle (the vertical axis) of the quadrotor, we can control all the other variables of the system. For this, we consider a camera equipped with a vertical stabilizer that keeps it in a vertical position during its movement (a gimbaled camera). Other specialized sensors measure information regarding altitude and lateral angles. In the case of classic 2D visual servoing, the elaboration of the kinematic torsor of the quadrotor in no way guarantees the physical realization of instructions, given that the quadrotor is an under-actuated system. Indeed, the setpoint has a dimension equal to six, while the quadrotor is controlled only by four inputs. In addition, the dynamics of a quadrotor are generally very fast, which requires a high-frequency control law. Furthermore, the complexity of the image processing stage can cause delays in motion control, which can lead to target loss. A new dynamic 2D visual servoing method (Dynamic IBVS) is proposed. This method makes it possible to generate in real time the necessary movements for the quadrotor in order to carry out the tracking of the target (vehicle) using a single point of this target as visual information. This point can represent the center of gravity of the target or any other part of it. A control by flatness has been proposed, which guarantees the controllability of the system and ensures the asymptotic convergence of the generated trajectory in the image plane. Numerical simulations are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

AB Insect wing shapes are diverse and a renowned source of inspiration for the new generation of autonomous flapping vehicles, yet the aerodynamic consequences of varying geometry is not well understood. One of the most defining and aerodynamically significant measures of wing shape is the aspect ratio, defined as the ratio of wing length (R) to mean wing chord ((c) over bar). We investigated the impact of aspect ratio, AR, on the induced flow field around a flapping wing using a robotic device. Rigid rectangular wings ranging from AR = 1.5 to 7.5 were flapped with insect-like kinematics in air with a constant Reynolds number (Re) of 1400, and a dimensionless stroke amplitude of 6.5 (c) over bar (number of chords traversed by the wingtip). Pseudo-volumetric, ensemble-averaged, flow fields around the wings were captured using particle image velocimetry at 11 instances throughout simulated downstrokes. Results confirmed the presence of a high-lift, separated flow field with a leading-edge vortex (LEV), and revealed that the conical, primary LEV grows in size and strength with increasing AR. In each case, the LEV had an arch-shaped axis with its outboard end originating from a focus-sink singularity on the wing surface near the tip. LEV detachment was observed for AR > 1.5 around mid-stroke at similar to 70% span, and initiated sooner over higher aspect ratio wings. At AR > 3 the larger, stronger vortex persisted under the wing surface well into the next half-stroke leading to a reduction in lift. Circulatory lift attributable to the LEV increased with AR up to AR= 6. Higher aspect ratios generated proportionally less lift distally because of LEV breakdown, and also less lift closer to the wing root due to the previous LEV's continuing presence under the wing. In nature, insect wings go no higher than AR similar to 5, likely in part due to architectural and physiological constraints but also because of the reducing aerodynamic benefits of high AR wings.

ID OPTIMIZATION; SYSTEMS
AB A critical part of Automated Material Handling Systems (AMHS) is the task allocation and dispatching strategy employed. In order to better understand and investigate this component, we here present an extensive experimental evaluation of three different approaches with randomly generated, as well as custom designed, environment configurations. While previous studies typically focused on use cases based on highly constrained navigation capabilities (e.g., overhead hoist transport systems), our evaluation is built around highly mobile, free-ranging vehicles, i.e., Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR) that are gaining popularity in a broad range of applications. Consequently, our experiments are conducted using a microscopic agent-based simulation, instead of the more common discrete-event simulation model. Dispatching methods often are built around the assumption of the asynchronous evaluation of an event-based model, i.e., vehicles trigger a cascade of individual dispatching decisions, e.g., when reaching intersections. We find that this does not translate very well to a fleet of highly mobile systems that can change direction at any time. With this in mind, we present formulations of well known dispatching approaches that are better suited for a synchronous evaluation of the dispatching decisions. The formulations are based on the Stable Marriage Problem (SMP) and the Linear Sum Assignment Problem (LSAP). We use matching and assignment algorithms to compute the actual dispatching decisions. The selected algorithms are evaluated in a multi-agent simulation environment. To integrate a centralised fleet management, a digital twin concept is proposed and implemented. By this approach, the fleet management is independent of the implementation of the specific agents, allowing to quickly adapt to other simulation-based or real application scenarios. For the experimental evaluation, two new performance measures related to the efficiency of a material handling system are proposed, Travel Efficiency and Throughput Effort. The experimental evaluation indicates that reassignment mechanisms in the dispatching method can help to increase the overall efficiency of the fleet. We did not find significant differences in absolute performance in terms of throughput rate. Additionally, the difference in performance between SMP- and LSAP-based dispatching with reassignment seems negligible. We conclude with a discussion, where we consider potential confounding factors and relate the findings to previously reported results found in the literature.

AB Purpose A novel fault-tolerant control (FTC) method is proposed to assure the stability of the remote-operated vehicle (ROV) by considering the thruster failure-induced model perturbations. The stability of the ROV with failures is guaranteed and optimized with the determined model perturbation set. The effectiveness of the double-boundary interval fault-tolerant control (DBIFTC) is verified through the experiments and proves that the stability is well maintained, which demonstrates a decent performance. Design/methodology/approach This paper studies a control problem for a multi-vector propulsion ROV by using the DBIFTC method in the presence of thruster failure and external disturbances. The ROV kinematics and dynamical models with multi-vector-arranged thruster failure are investigated and formulated for control system design. Findings In this paper, the authors address the FTC problem of ROV with multi-vector thrusters and propose a DBIFTC scheme. The advantage is that as the kinematic system model of ROV is preanalyzed and identified, the DBIFTC becomes more effective. The mathematical stability of the system under the proposed control scheme can be guaranteed. Research limitations/implications The ROV model used in this paper is based on the system identification of experimental data. Although this model has real experimental value and physical significance, the accuracy can be further improved. Practical implications Cable-controlled underwater ROVs are widely used in military missions and scientific research because of their flexibility, sufficient load capacity and real-time information transmission characteristics. The DBIFTC method proposed in this paper can effectively reduce the problem of underwater vehicle under propeller failure or external disturbance and save unnecessary cost. Social implications The DBIFTC method proposed in this paper can ensure the attitude stability of ROV or other underwater equipment operating in the event of propeller failure or external disturbance. In this way, the robot can better perform undersea work and tasks. Originality/value The kinematics and failure mechanisms of the ROV with multi-vector propulsion system are investigated and established. An optimized DBIFTC scheme is investigated to stabilize ROV yaw attitude under the thruster failure condition. The feasibility and effectiveness of the DBIFTC is experimentally validated.

AB In the paper, a family of novel real-time tuning methods for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) altitude controller in in-flight conditions. The methods allow the controller's gains to be adapted only on the basis of measurements from a basic sensory equipment and by constructing the optimization cost function in an on-line fashion with virtually no impeding computational complexity; in the case of the altitude controller as in this paper for a hexacopter, altitude measurements were used only. The methods are not dependent on the measurement level, and present the approach in a generally applicable form to tuning arbitrary controllers with low number of parameters. Real-world experimental flights, preceded by simulation tests, have shown which method should behave best in a noisy environment when e.g. wind disturbances act on a UAV while it is in autonomous flight. As the methods can potentially be extended to other control loops or controller types, making this a versatile, rapid-tuning tool. It has been shown that a well-tuned controller using the proposed AL-TUNE scheme outperforms controllers that are tuned just to stabilize the system. AL-TUNE provides a new way of using UAVs in terms of adaptivity to changing their dynamic properties and can be deployed rapidly. This enables new applications and extends the usability of fully autonomous UAVs, unlike other tuning methods, which basically require the availability of a UAV model. The core difference with respect to other research from the field is that other authors either use a model of a UAV to optimize the gains analytically or use machine learning techniques, what increases time consumption, whereas the presented methods offer a rapid way to tune controllers, in a reliable way, with deterministic time requirements.

AB Water quality monitoring and predicting the changes in water characteristics require the collection of water samples in a timely manner. Water sample collection based on in situ measurable water quality indicators can increase the efficiency and precision of data collection while reducing the cost of laboratory analyses. The objective of this research was to develop an adaptive water sampling device for an aerial robot and demonstrate the accuracy of its functions in laboratory and field conditions. The prototype device consisted of a sensor node with dissolved oxygen, pH, electrical conductivity, temperature, turbidity, and depth sensors, a microcontroller, and a sampler with three cartridges. Activation of water capturing cartridges was based on in situ measurements from the sensor node. The activation mechanism of the prototype device was tested with standard solutions in the laboratory and with autonomous water sampling flights over the 11-ha section of a lake. A total of seven sampling locations were selected based on a grid system. Each cartridge collected 130 mL of water samples at a 3.5 m depth. Mean water quality parameters were measured as 8.47 mg/L of dissolved oxygen, pH of 5.34, 7 mu S/cm of electrical conductivity, temperature of 18 degrees C, and 37 Formazin Nephelometric Unit (FNU) of turbidity. The dissolved oxygen was within allowable limits that were pre-set in the self-activation computer program while the pH, electrical conductivity, and temperature were outside of allowable limits that were specified by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Therefore, the activation mechanism of the device was triggered and water samples were collected from all the sampling locations successfully. The adaptive water sampling with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-assisted water sampling device was proved to be a successful method for water quality evaluation.

AB Poor condition of roads is a major factor for traffic accidents and damage to vehicles. A significant portion of car accidents is attributed to severe three-dimensional (3D) pavement distresses such as potholes, ruttings, and ravelings. Insufficient road condition assessment is responsible for the poor condition of roads. To inspect the condition of the pavement surfaces more frequently and efficiently, an inexpensive data acquisition system was developed that consists of a consumer-grade RGB-D sensor and an edge computing device that can be mounted on vehicles and collect data while driving vehicles. The RGB-D sensor is used for collecting two-dimensional (2D) color images and corresponding 3D depth data, and the lightweight edge computing device is used to control the RGB-D sensor and store the collected data. An RGB-D pavement surface data set is generated. Furthermore, encoder-decoder deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) consisting of one or two encoders, and one decoder trained on heterogeneous RGB-D pavement surface data are used for pothole segmentation. Comprehensive experiments using different depth encoding techniques and data fusion methods including data- and feature-level fusion were performed to investigate the efficacy of defect detection using DCNNs. Experimental results demonstrate that the feature-level RGB-D data fusion based on the surface normal encoding of depth data outperform other approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy, where the mean intersection over union (IoU) over 10-fold cross-validation of 0.82 is achieved that shows a 7.7% improvement compared with a network trained only on RGB data. In addition, this study explores the efficacy of indirectly using depth information for pothole detection when depth data are not available. Additionally, the semantic segmentation results were utilized to quantify the severity level of the potholes assisting in maintenance decision-making. The result from these comprehensive experiments using an RGB-D pavement surface data set gathered through the proposed data acquisition system is a stepping stone for opportunistic data collection and processing through crowdsourcing and Internet of Things in future smart cities for effective road assessment. Finally, suggestions about the improvement of the proposed system are discussed.

AB This study estimates how many additional cyclist accidents, injuries or fatalities are avoided or mitigated by adding a system which increases braking levels, the Torricelli Vacuum Emergency Brake (VEB), to a state-of-theart Automated Emergency Braking (AEB) system. To obtain a realistic state-of-the-art AEB system, the AEB parameter settings were defined to fulfil but not exceed the performance necessary to achieve a full score in the European New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP). The systems are simulated in a simple but realistic simulation model in MATLAB with varying brake deceleration and sensor field-of-view (FoV).
   This study utilised data from the German In-Depth Accident Study (GIDAS), released in January 2019, and the related Pre-Crash Matrix (PCM), released in February 2019. Cyclist Injury Risk Curves were created from 2,662 GIDAS accidents involving a passenger car and a cyclist. The sample of cyclist accidents from the GIDAS-PCM database used in the final simulations comprised 1,340 collisions between the front of a passenger car and a cyclist. Both data samples were weighted to be representative of Germany as a whole.
   Adding the VEB was found to avoid over 20% more accidents than the AEB alone. Although increasing the FoV from 75 degrees to 180 degrees for the AEB system increases its accident avoidance rate to a level comparable to the VEB, the VEB remains about 8-20% more effective in reducing fatalities and injuries, and thus offers greater safety benefits than simply increasing AEB FoV.
   While the initial accidents in the representative simulation sample are fairly evenly distributed over the vehicle front, the remaining accidents (those that cannot be prevented by AEB or VEB) are more concentrated at the vehicle corners and are further characterized by high cyclist speeds. High cyclist speeds and impact to the vehicle corners potentially increase the relative frequency of head impacts to the stiff A-pillars. We therefore recommend that, for passenger cars, VEB and other advanced AEB systems should be combined with in-crash protection, especially in the A-pillar area, to best protect cyclists from injury.

AB Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with flexible deployment is foreseen to be a major part of the sixth generation (6G) networks. The UAVs connected to the base station (BS), as aerial users (UEs), could exploit machine learning (ML) algorithms to provide a wide range of advanced applications, like object detection and video tracking. Conventionally, the ML model training is performed at the BS, known as centralized learning (CL), which causes high communication overhead due to the transmission of large datasets, and potential concerns about UE privacy. To address this, distributed learning algorithms, including federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL), were proposed to train the ML models in a distributed manner via only sharing model parameters. FL requires higher computational resource on the UE side than SL, while SL has larger communication overhead when the local dataset is large. To effectively train an ML model considering the diversity of UEs with different computational capabilities and channel conditions, we first propose a novel distributed learning architecture, a hybrid split and federated learning (HSFL) algorithm by reaping the parallel model training mechanism of FL and the model splitting structure of SL. We then provide its convergence analysis under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data with random UE selection scheme. By conducting experiments on training two ML models, Net and AlexNet, in wireless UAV networks, our results demonstrate that the HSFL algorithm achieves higher learning accuracy than FL and less communication overhead than SL under IID and non-IID data, and the learning accuracy of HSFL algorithm increases with the increasing number of the split training UEs. We further propose a Multi-Arm Bandit (MAB) based best channel (BC) and best 2-norm (BN2) (MAB-BC-BN2) UE selection scheme to select the UEs with better wireless channel quality and larger local model updates for model training in each round. Numerical results demonstrate it achieves higher learning accuracy than BC, MAB-BC and MAB-BN2 UE selection scheme under non-IID, Dirichlet-nonIID and Dirichlet-Imbalanced data.

AB In recent years, there has been growing enthusiasm for employing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as an innovative technology with significant potential for the next generation of wireless networks. Hence, the Quality of Service (QoS) of clients within the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure can be considerably enhanced by integrating UAVs into wireless systems. However, maximizing QoS and ensuring user information security poses significant challenges in determining the trajectory of UAVs, as they need to account for the mobility and density of users. This article addresses this issue and considers a heterogeneous UAV-assisted network in which UAVs as Base Stations (BSs) have the role of finding the best trajectory based on the movement and density of Ground Users (GUs) in a way that the enhancement of the security of the covered users' information and QoS is guaranteed. To achieve these objectives, we first introduce the Actor-Critic (AC) scheme for the optimal trajectory of UAVs due to the use of a continuous environment with a large number of states and actions. In addition, the accuracy and learning speed of the agent in AC algorithms is higher than in other Reinforcement Learning (RL) schemes. Then, the combination of ordinary Federated Learning (FL) and Distillation Federated Learning (DFL) algorithms with AC is presented to increase the security of users' data, the learning speed of UAVs, and improve the QoS of GUs. In the FL scheme, access to the principal information of users is limited, but it cannot prevent reverse engineering techniques to attain users' data. To intercept such incidents, we use the DFL scheme. Due to the dynamic nature of weight updating in the neural network, this method is associated with a low hacking probability. Simulation results demonstrate that utilizing FL- and DFL-AC algorithms can significantly enhance the learning speed of the proposed schemes, while increasing the downlink rate of users by approximately 1.1% and 1.5%, respectively, compared to the AC method.

AB Recently, much progress has been made toward the development of small-scale aircraft, known broadly as Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs). Until recently, these platforms were exclusively remotely piloted, with no autonomous or intelligent capabilities, due at least in part to stringent payload restrictions that limit onboard sensors. However, the one sensor that is critical to most conceivable MAV missions, such as remote surveillance, is an onboard video camera and transmitter that streams flight video to a nearby ground station. Exploitation of this key sensor is, therefore, desirable, since no additional onboard hardware (and weight) is required. As such, in this paper we develop a general and unified computer vision framework for MAVs that not only addresses basic flight stability and control, but enables more intelligent missions as well. This paper is organized as follows. We first develop a real-time feature extraction method called multiscale linear discriminant analysis (MLDA), which explicitly incorporates color into its feature representation, while implicitly encoding texture through a dynamic multiscale representation of image details. We demonstrate key advantages of MLDA over other possible multiscale approaches (e.g., wavelets), especially in dealing with transient video noise. Next, we show that MLDA provides a natural framework for performing real-time horizon detection. We report horizon-detection results for a range of images differing in lighting and scenery and quantify performance as a function of image noise. Furthermore, we show how horizon detection naturally leads to closed-loop flight stabilization. Then, we motivate the use of tree-structured belief networks (TSBNs) with MLDA features for sky/ground segmentation. This type of segmentation augments basic horizon detection and enables certain MAV missions where prior assumptions about the flight vehicle's orientation are not possible; Again, we report segmentation results for a range of images and quantify robustness to image noise. Finally, we demonstrate the seamless extension of this framework, through the idea of visual contexts, for the detection of artificial objects and/or structures and illustrate several examples of such additional segmentation. This extension thus enables mission profiles that require, for example, following a specific road or the tracking of moving ground objects. Throughout, our approach and algorithms are heavily influenced by real-time constraints and robustness to transient video noise.

AB Autonomous driving represents one of the emerging applications that require both high-precision positions and highly critical timeliness to reach stringent safety standards. We develop a method to potentially achieve global instantaneous decimeter-level positioning by virtue of tightly coupled multi-GNSS triple-frequency observations contributing to precise point positioning (PPP). Inter-system phase biases (ISPBs) for two wide-lane observables are first computed for each station to form inter-GNSS resolvable ambiguities, and then correspondingly two wide-lane fractional-cycle biases (FCBs) are computed for each satellite to recover the integer property of single-station ambiguities. With both ISPB and FCB products, we can accomplish tightly coupled multi-GNSS PPP wide-lane ambiguity resolution (PPP-WAR) using only a single epoch of triple-frequency observations on a global scale. To verify this method, we used 1month of GPS/BeiDou/Galileo/QZSS data from 107 globally distributed stations and 1h of such multi-GNSS data collected on a vehicle moving in an urban area. We found that both ISPB and FCB products could be estimated every 24h with high precisions of around or below 0.1cycles; 83-98% of their day-to-day variations fell within 0.1cycles, facilitating their precise predictions for real-time applications. Using these corrections, we achieved both instantly and reliably ambiguity-fixed solutions at 91.2% of all epochs at the 107 stations on average; the resultant single-epoch positions reached a mean accuracy of 0.22m, 0.18m and 0.63m for the east, north and up components, respectively, in case of abundant triple-frequency observations from over 15 satellites. Similarly, for the vehicle-borne test, we obtained instantaneous PPP-WAR solutions at 99.31% of all epochs and achieved a positioning accuracy of 0.29, 0.35 and 0.77m for the east, north and up components, respectively, which improved significantly the identification of road lanes as opposed to other single-epoch solutions. Finally, we expect that the prospect of instantaneous PPP-WAR in aiding driverless vehicles can be more promising if, whenever possible, integrated with inertial sensors and/or smoothed through multi-epoch data.

ID TASK MIGRATION; MULTIPROCESSORS; ALGORITHM
AB Improvements in processor power and diminishing processor costs coupled with the potential of asynchronous, distributed algorithms promise to expand the frontier of mobile computing networks. In general, a mobile computing network consists of semi-autonomous or autonomous stationary and mobile agents that perform local computations, cooperate, and communicate among themselves to achieve a desired objective. While the stationary entities are connected through a static interconnection network and interact with each other, the mobile units interact dynamically with the stationary entities. Examples of newly emerging mobile computing networks include route guidance in the U.S. Department of Transportation's Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems, distributed scheduling in railway networks, semi-autonomous decision making in the battlefield environment, and the community health care network wherein mobile physicians may interact with remote patient medical records. This paper focuses on the high level principles that underlie the distributed modeling and accurate simulation of mobile computing networks on a parallel processing testbed. The testbed consists of a network of workstations configured as a loosely-coupled parallel processor and it closely resembles reality. A key issue is the representation of the stationary and mobile entities of the mobile computing network through concurrent and interacting processes in the testbed. The nature of the representation will influence the accuracy and performance of the simulation. This paper first reviews a process representation technique that has been proposed in the literature for modeling railway networks and then analyzes its limitations. This strategy is referred to as Virtual Process Migration (VPM). The paper then proposes a new strategy, termed Physical Process Migration (PPM), that aims to address the limitations of VPM. It details the software techniques underlying both approaches, describes their implementations on a realistic testbed, and then contrasts their performance under different representative scenarios. While VPM is capable of modeling modest to large-scale mobile computing networks on a testbed consisting of a few processors, the number of processors of the testbed in PPM must correspond to the number of stationary and mobile entities of the mobile computing network size that is being modeled. Analysis of the simulation results reveals that both VPM and PPM are highly effective and very useful strategies under different circumstances. For a given number of mobile and stationary entities, simulation under PPM is fast when every mobile entity requires significant computation. On the other hand, VPM exhibits superior performance relative to PPM when the number of data elements exchanged by each mobile entity at each hop is significantly high.

AB Tidal flats are internationally protected areas because of their environmental, geological, and economic value. Nevertheless, these are areas where casualties are common among visitors. To ensure the safety of visitors, efforts must be made to understand the geomorphologic characteristics of tidal flats. It is necessary to use three-dimensional (3-D) topographic data to clearly determine when an exposed tidal flat rapidly disappears as a result of periodic tidal fluctuations. Digital elevation models (DEMs) created using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imaging and commercial photogrammetric software to measure tidal flats are produced using ground control points (GCPs). It is difficult to conduct field surveys and readings of image coordinates that correspond to these because tidal flat areas are difficult to access. The distribution of GCPs affects the accuracy of a DEM because the entire test region cannot be covered during a survey. Without GCPs, the DEM generated with the UAV images and photogrammetric software using the structure from the motion technique probably has nonlinear distortion such as a bowl shape. This article proposes a practical method of least-squares 3-D surface matching with a polynomial model (LS3D-PM) to correct a distorted DEM. For this LS3D-PM matching, a global TanDEM-X DEM was used instead of a field survey to collect the GCPs in a tidal flat. Practical testing was conducted using the proposed method. The root-mean-square error with respect to the height decreased from approximately 1.0 to 0.1 m, and the bowl-effect error was eliminated. With the DEM corrected using the proposed method and the classified orthoimages, the exposed tidal flat changes due to seawater invasion were estimated at different times during flood tide. This method has nontrivial technical values for quick and relatively precise DEM generations at a low cost compared to that of other techniques, particularly in emergency situations such as tsunamis, landslides, and earthquakes.

ID TURBULENCE MEASUREMENTS
AB The unsteady wind profile in the atmospheric boundary layer upstream of a modern wind turbine is measured. The measurements are accomplished using a novel measurement approach that is comprised of an autonomous uninhabited aerial vehicle (UAV) that is equipped with a seven-sensor fast-response aerodynamic probe (F7S-UAV). The autonomous UAV enables high spatial resolution (similar to 6.3% of rotor diameter) measurements, which hitherto have not been accomplished around full-scale wind turbines. The F7S-UAV probe developed at ETH Zurich is the key-enabling technology for the measurements. The time-averaged wind profile from the F7S-UAV probe is found to be in very good agreement to an independently measured profile using the UAV. This time-averaged profile, which is measured in moderately complex terrain, differs by as much as 30% from the wind profile that is extrapolated from a logarithmic height formula; therefore, the limited utility of extrapolated profiles, which are commonly used in site assessments, is made evident. The time-varying wind profiles show that at a given height, the velocity fluctuations can be as much as 44% of the time-averaged velocity, therefore indicating that there are substantial loads that may impact the fatigue life of the wind turbine's components. Furthermore, the shear in the velocity profile also subjects the fixed pitch blade to varying incidences and loading. Analysis of the associated velocity triangles indicates that the sectional lift coefficient at midspan of this modern turbine would vary by 12% in the measured time-averaged wind profile. These variations must be accounted in the structural design of the blades. Thus, the measurements of the unsteady wind profile accomplished with this novel measurement system demonstrate that it is a cost effective complement to the suite of available site assessment measurement tools.

AB In global satellite navigation system (GNSS)-denied environments, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation based on visual-inertial odometry (VIO) has been widely studied. However, existing VIO methods still suffer from some practical problems, such as image enhancement oversaturation and unreasonable weighting in backend optimization. Therefore, this article presents monocular VIO with point-line fusion and backend adaptive optimization to improve the positioning accuracy and robustness of UAV navigation systems. In the front end, we proposed an adaptive gamma image correction algorithm for image preprocessing to avoid image oversaturation, which is more conducive to image extraction and matching. Instead of the traditional line segment detector (LSD) line feature extraction algorithm, we employed an improved EDLines algorithm to enhance the efficiency of line feature extraction, better meeting the high dynamic real-time requirements of UAV. In the backend, we proposed a tightly coupled nonlinear adaptive optimization method based on a two-step approach to address the issue of unreasonable static weights. In the first step, we established a factor graph model and performed the first nonlinear optimization based on a priori visual weights. In the second step, we calculated the reprojection error and established a functional model that examines the relationship between the reprojection error and the information matrix. We updated the information matrix using the reprojection error to adaptively adjust the weights of the point features and line features in real time. Finally, we performed a second nonlinear reoptimization. The proposed method was compared with the monocular visual-inertial system (VINS-MONO) (Qin et al. 2018) and point and line features (PL)-VINS (Fu et al. 2020) methods, the experimental results showing that the positioning accuracy of the proposed method on the public EuRoc dataset (Burri et al. 2016) improved by an average of 32.3% compared with the PL-VINS method, and by an average of 33.8% in three real-world scenarios under changing illumination, weak texture, and large-scale complex scenarios. The results demonstrated that the proposed method exhibited better robustness and higher positioning accuracy in various complex environments.

AB Purpose - Heterogeneous teams consisting of unmanned ground vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles are being used for different types of missions such as surveillance, tracking and exploration. Exploration missions with heterogeneous robot teams (HeRTs) should acquire a common map for understanding the surroundings better. The purpose of this paper is to provide a unique approach with cooperative use of agents that provides a well-detailed observation over the environment where challenging details and complex structures are involved. Also, this method is suitable for real-time applications and autonomous path planning for exploration.
   Design/methodology/approach - Lidar odometry and mapping and various similarity metrics such as Shannon entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence, Jeffrey divergence, K divergence, Topsoe divergence, Jensen-Shannon divergence and Jensen divergence are used to construct a common height map of the environment. Furthermore, the authors presented the layering method that provides more accuracy and a better understanding of the common map.
   Findings - In summary, with the experiments, the authors observed features located beneath the trees or the roofed top areas and above them without any need for global positioning system signal. Additionally, a more effective common map that enables planning trajectories for both vehicles is obtained with the determined similarity metric and the layering method.
   Originality/value - In this study, the authors present a unique solution that implements various entropy-based similarity metrics with the aim of constructing common maps of the environment with HeRTs. To create common maps, Shannon entropy-based similarity metrics can be used, as it is the only one that holds the chain rule of conditional probability precisely. Seven distinct similarity metrics are compared, and the most effective one is chosen for getting a more comprehensive and valid common map. Moreover, different from all the studies in literature, the layering method is used to compute the similarities of each local map obtained by a HeRT. This method also provides the accuracy of the merged common map, as robots' sight of view prevents the same observations of the environment in features such as a roofed area or trees. This novel approach can also be used in global positioning system-denied and closed environments. The results are verified with experiments.

AB Technologies utilizing radiological materials across power generation, defence, industry, research and medicine have increased the global inventory of highly active and hazardous materials. Consequently, an amplified threat exists of illicitly obtained materials being used as part of hostile acts. The potential for intentional releases occurs alongside risks from natural disasters or facility accidents. In any such event, it is crucial to rapidly assess the release composition and extent of response and remediation activities. Therefore, the deployment of an effective, resilient and autonomous radiation monitoring network is pivotal both during and after an incident. Underpinning this assessment is a detailed understanding of the pre-event or background, radiation levels, the knowledge of which is also essential in assessing a population's dosimetric exposure to, and impact from anthropogenic and naturally occurring/varying sources of ionizing radiation. Presented here is a fully operational cloud-based spectroscopic radiation mapping platform comprising IoT modules compatible with cellular networks, without modification, in over 180 countries. Combined with locally roaming vehicles, a continuous multi-pass radiological characterization of an urban environment was performed. Such IoT devices are deployable as either individual sensors for specific localized temporal events or integrated over a greater time period (and area) to represent a larger static sensor. Over several months of continued operation, more than 1000 000 individual location-referenced gamma-ray spectra were collected and securely uploaded, in real-time, to an online cloud database and automatically characterized via a custom multi-step workflow. Fine-scale local variations in the radiological fingerprint of a 1 km x 1 km urban area were subsequently rendered in near-real-time to an interactive secure online graphical dashboard for temporal, spatial and spectral interrogation by the user. Considerations for the automated 'elastic' handling of ever-expanding volumes of input data have been carried out, facilitating propagation and expansion of the system's database without human input.

AB The world's oceans are one of the most valuable sources of biodiversity and resources on the planet, although there are areas where the marine ecosystem is threatened by human activities. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are distinctive spaces protected by law due to their unique characteristics, such as being the habitat of endangered marine species. Even with this protection, there are still illegal activities such as poaching or anchoring that threaten the survival of different marine species. In this context, we propose an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) model system for the surveillance of marine areas by detecting and recognizing vessels through artificial intelligence (AI)-based image recognition services, in search of those carrying out illegal activities. Cloud and edge AI computing technologies were used for computer vision. These technologies have proven to be accurate and reliable in detecting shapes and objects for which they have been trained. Azure edge and cloud vision services offer the best option in terms of accuracy for this task. Due to the lack of 4G and 5G coverage in offshore marine environments, it is necessary to use radio links with a coastal base station to ensure communications, which may result in a high response time due to the high latency involved. The analysis of on-board images may not be sufficiently accurate; therefore, we proposed a smart algorithm for autonomy optimization by selecting the proper AI technology according to the current scenario (SAAO) capable of selecting the best AI source for the current scenario in real time, according to the required recognition accuracy or low latency. The SAAO optimizes the execution, efficiency, risk reduction, and results of each stage of the surveillance mission, taking appropriate decisions by selecting either cloud or edge vision models without human intervention.

AB For potatoes, a crop with a specific plant spacing and a large row spacing, continuous spray has problems including low spraying accuracy and washability. In order to improve the utilisation of this crop, this manuscript designed a targeted and variable sprayer. To ensure that the spray function is achieved, the design and verification of the vehicle body and the targeting device of the sprayer were carried out. To guarantee that the automation and precision of spray are improved, the autonomous marching system based on the Ultra-wideband (UWB) module and the targeted and variable spray system based on the Open machine vision (Open MV) module, were built. The experiments showed that the sprayer could follow a preset route, correct its marching direction in time, and provide feedback on its position. The targeted and variable spray was influential on the surface and back of the leaf (about 66%) and more uniform than the general spray mode. Moreover, the sprayer's targeted and variable spray mode reduced the amount of liquid applied by 37.9% compared to the continuous spray mode, significantly improving the liquid utilisation rate.

AB Visual inertial odometry and SLAM algorithms are widely used in various fields, such as service robots, drones, and autonomous vehicles. Most of the SLAM algorithms are based on assumption that landmarks are static. However, in the real-world, various dynamic objects exist, and they degrade the pose estimation accuracy. In addition, temporarily static objects, which are static during observation but move when they are out of sight, trigger false positive loop closings. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel visual-inertial SLAM framework, called DynaVINS, which is robust against both dynamic objects and temporarily static objects. In our framework, we first present a robust bundle adjustment that could reject the features from dynamic objects by leveraging pose priors estimated by the IMU preintegration. Then, a keyframe grouping and a multi-hypothesis-based constraints grouping methods are proposed to reduce the effect of temporarily static objects in the loop closing. Subsequently, we evaluated our method in a public dataset that contains numerous dynamic objects. Finally, the experimental results corroborate that our DynaVINS has promising performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods by successfully rejecting the effect of dynamic and temporarily static objects.

AB Underwater image processing is an intelligence research field that has great potential to help developers better explore the underwater environment. Underwater image processing has been used in a wide variety of fields, such as underwater microscopic detection, terrain scanning, mine detection, telecommunication cables, and autonomous underwater vehicles. However, underwater imagery suffers from strong absorption, scattering, color distortion, and noise from the artificial light sources, causing image blur, haziness, and a bluish or greenish tone. Therefore, the enhancement of underwater imagery can be divided into two methods: 1) underwater image dehazing and 2) underwater image color restoration. This paper presents the reason for underwater image degradation, surveys the state-of-the-art intelligence algorithms like deep learning methods in underwater image dehazing and restoration, demonstrates the performance of underwater image dehazing and color restoration with different methods, introduces an underwater image color evaluation metric, and provides an overview of the major underwater image applications. Finally, we summarize the application of underwater image processing.

AB It is very challenging to detect traffic signs using a high-precision real-time approach in realistic scenes with respect to driver-assistance systems for driving vehicles and autonomous driving. To address this challenge, in this paper, a new detection scheme (named MSA & x005F;YOLOv3) is proposed to accurately achieve real-time localization and classification of small traffic signs. First, data augmentation is achieved using image mixup technology. Second, a multi-scale spatial pyramid pooling block is introduced into the Darknet53 network to enable the network to learn object features more comprehensively. Finally, a bottom-up augmented path is designed to enhance the feature pyramid in YOLOv3, and the result is to achieve accurate localization of objects by utilizing fine-grained features effectively in the lower layers. According to the tests on the TT100K dataset (which is a dataset for traffic sign detection), the performance of the proposed MSA & x005F;YOLOv3 is better than that of YOLOv3 in detecting small traffic signs. The detection speed of MSA & x005F;YOLOv3 is 23.81 FPS, and the mAP (mean Average Precision) reaches up to 86 & x0025;.

AB Industrial plants are going to face a deep renewing process within the Industry 4.0 scenario. New paradigms of production lines are foreseen in the very near future, characterized by a strict collaboration between humans and robots and by a high degree of flexibility. Such envisaged improvements will require the smart use of proper sensors at very different levels. This paper investigates three different aspects of this industrial renewing process, based on three different ways of exploiting sensors, toward a new paradigm of a production line. The provided contributions, offering various types of innovation and integration, are relative to: (i) a virtual sensor approach for manual guidance, increasing the potentialities of a standard industrial manipulator, (ii) a smart manufacturing solution to assist the operator's activity in manual assembly stations, through an original exploitation of multiple sensors, and (iii) the development of an advanced robotic architecture for a flexible production line, in which a team of autonomous mobile robots acts as a meta-sensor net supporting traditional automated guided vehicles. Accurate analyses of existing state-of-the-art solutions compared with the proposed ones are offered for the considered issues.

DE Collaborative consumption; Practice theory; Social change
ID SHARING ECONOMY
AB Collaborative consumption indicates the emergence and rapid spread of a new set of consumption practices. Originally praised as an antidote to an unsustainable market economy, there is growing concern that collaborative consumption increasingly follows a conventional market rationality of payments and profits, thereby undermining its initial social and 'civil society' aspects. This article investigates the future of collaborative consumption through case studies of the Peerby and MyWheels platforms, which represent new social practices of borrowing and renting. We use the sociological theories of Theodore Schatzki and Randall Collins to analyse the key factors that determine the present and future trajectories of these practices. We show how human agency and emotions in a dynamic between companies, practices, and practitioners are crucial in shaping the future of collaborative consumption. The findings suggest two diverging trajectories: one that sticks to the social aspects of connecting people through sharing things, and another that heads towards impersonal forms of collaborative consumption. The latter is primarily organized by companies, which introduce new rules (payments and insurances) and technologies (drones and autonomous vehicles) to make the shared use of things more fast, efficient, and profitable.

AB Sharing traffic information on the vehicular network can help in the implementation of intelligent traffic management, such as car accident warnings, road construction notices, and driver route changes to reduce traffic congestion earlier. In the future, in the case of autonomous driving, traffic information will be exchanged more frequently and more immediately. Once the exposed traffic incident is incorrect, the driving route will be misleading, and the driving response may be in danger. The blockchain ensures the correctness of data and tampers resistance in the consensus mechanism, which can solve such similar problems. This paper proposes a proof-of-event consensus concept applicable to vehicular networks rather than proof-of-work or proof-of-authority approaches. The traffic data are collected through the roadside units, and the passing vehicles will verify the correctness when receiving the event notification. In addition, a two-phase transaction on blockchain is introduced to send warning messages in appropriate regions and time periods. The simulation results show that the proposed mechanism can effectively feedback the correctness of traffic events and provide traceable events with trust verification.

AB The rut formation during forest operations is an undesirable phenomenon. A methodology is being proposed to measure the rut depth distribution of a logging site by photogrammetric point clouds produced by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The methodology includes five processing steps that aim at reducing the noise from the surrounding trees and undergrowth for identifying the trails. A canopy height model is produced to focus the point cloud on the open pathway around the forest machine trail. A triangularized ground model is formed by a point cloud filtering method. The ground model is vectorized using the histogram of directed curvatures (HOC) method to produce an overall ground visualization. Finally, a manual selection of the trails leads to an automated rut depth profile analysis. The bivariate correlation (Pearson's r) between rut depths measured manually and by UAV photogrammetry is r = 0.67. The two-class accuracy a of detecting the rut depth exceeding 20 cm is a = 0.65. There is potential for enabling automated large-scale evaluation of the forestry areas by using autonomous drones and the process described.

AB This article explores the integrated optimization problem of location assignment and sequencing in multi-shuttle automated storage/retrieval systems under the modified 2n-command cycle pattern. The decision of storage and retrieval (S/R) location assignment and S/R request sequencing are jointly considered. An integer quadratic programming model is formulated to describe this integrated optimization problem. The optimal travel cycles for multi-shuttle S/R machines can be obtained to process S/R requests in the storage and retrieval request order lists by solving the model. The small-sized instances are optimally solved using CPLEX. For large-sized problems, two tabu search algorithms are proposed, in which the first come, first served and nearest neighbour are used to generate initial solutions. Various numerical experiments are conducted to examine the heuristics' performance and the sensitivity of algorithm parameters. Furthermore, the experimental results are analysed from the viewpoint of practical application, and a parameter list for applying the proposed heuristics is recommended under different real-life scenarios.

ID TRACKING
AB Recently, pedestrian detection systems have become an important technology in the development of the advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) for the autonomous car. The histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) is currently the most basic algorithm for detecting pedestrians, but it treats the entire body of the pedestrian as one single feature. In other words, if the entire body of the pedestrian is not visible, the detection rate under HOG decreases markedly. To solve this problem, we propose a detection system using a deformable part model (DPM) that divides the pedestrian data into two parts using a latent support vector machine (SVM)-based machine-learning technique. Experimental results show that our approach achieves better performance in a detection system than the existing method. In practice, there are many occlusions in the environment in front of the vehicle. For example, the surrounding transport facilities, such as a car or another obstacle, can occlude a pedestrian. These occlusions can increase the false detection rate and cause difficulties during the detection process. Our proposed method uses a different approach and can easily be applied in real-world scenarios, regardless of occlusions.

AB This paper presents a practical formation motion control scheme for robotic swarms based on single-view distance estimation, which is performed using a single nonsophisticated camera on each robot agent, and the prior information about the heights of the robots and other objects in the environment. Here, a nonsophisticated camera means one that has limited field of view and limited resolution. First, the vision mechanism is analyzed, and a single-view distance estimation scheme is designed. Then, a set of decentralized control laws, to be incorporated with distance estimation scheme, is introduced to move the robotic swarm in formation from an arbitrary initial position to an arbitrary final position without deforming the formation shape. The robots do not have any global positioning sensors, and they do not communicate with each other. The stability and performance of the overall system are analyzed mathematically. Later, practical issues are discussed regarding the proposed scheme, and the effects of delay and quantization in distance estimation are formally analyzed. Finally, we present experimental results demonstrating the performance of the proposed control scheme in real time.

AB The use of robots in society could be expanded by using reinforcement learning (RL) to allow robots to learn and adapt to new situations online. RL is a paradigm for learning sequential decision making tasks, usually formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). For an RL algorithm to be practical for robotic control tasks, it must learn in very few samples, while continually taking actions in real-time. In addition, the algorithm must learn efficiently in the face of noise, sensor/actuator delays, and continuous state features. In this article, we present texplore, the first algorithm to address all of these challenges together. texplore is a model-based RL method that learns a random forest model of the domain which generalizes dynamics to unseen states. The agent explores states that are promising for the final policy, while ignoring states that do not appear promising. With sample-based planning and a novel parallel architecture, texplore can select actions continually in real-time whenever necessary. We empirically evaluate the importance of each component of texplore in isolation and then demonstrate the complete algorithm learning to control the velocity of an autonomous vehicle in real-time.

AB The present paper proposes a successful application of differential evolution (DE) optimized fuzzy logic supervisors (FLS) to improve the quality of Solutions that extended Kalman filters (EKFs) can offer to solve simultaneous localization and mapping, (SLAM) problems for mobile robots and autonomous vehicles. The utility of the proposed system can be readily appreciated in those Situations where an incorrect knowledge of Q and R matrices of EKF can significantly degrade the SLAM performance. A fuzzy supervisor has been implemented to adapt the R matrix of the EKF online. in order to improve its performance. The free parameters of the fuzzy supervisor are suitably optimized by employing the DE algorithm, a comparatively recent method, popularly employed now-a-days for high-dimensional parallel direct search problems. The utility of the proposed system is aptly demonstrated by solving the SLAM problem for a mobile robot with several landmarks and with wrong knowledge of sensor statistics. The system could successfully demonstrate enhanced performance in comparison with usual EKF-based Solutions for identical environment situations.

AB With the increases in the levels of automation and computerization, supervisory control systems are becoming increasingly common in commercial and military applications. A supervisory control system consists of one or more human operators interacting with highly automated components such as those seen in satellite ground control, flexible manufacturing systems, or nuclear power plants. Humans typically perform cognitively intense tasks such as monitoring, planning, real-time control, and troubleshooting, and are ultimately responsible for the safe and efficient operation of the overall system. Although developments on supervisory control have led to useful applications in interface design and automation, there is a scarcity of research that empirically evaluates human decision making in supervisory control through emulation of task performance using knowledge-based systems. In the context of dynamic planning involving simulated search and rescue missions using ground based autonomous robots and uninhabited aerial vehicles, we developed a knowledge-based system that mimics supervisory control performance. This paper describes the application domain, the details of the simulation model, and the implementation and assessment of a knowledge-based system that mimics human supervisory control performance.

AB Steerable needles have the potential for accurate needle tip placement even when the optimal path to a target tissue is curvilinear, thanks to their ability to steer, which is an essential function to avoid piercing through vital anatomical features. Autonomous path-following controllers for steerable needles have already been studied, however they remain challenging, especially because of the complexities associated to needle localization. In this context, the advent of fiber Bragg Grating (FBG)-inscribed multicore fibers (MCFs) holds promise to overcome these difficulties. Objective: In this study, a closed-loop, 3-D path-following controller for steerable needles is presented. Methods: The control loop is closed via the feedback from FBG-inscribed MCFs embedded within the needle. The nonlinear guidance law, which is a well-known approach for path-following control of aerial vehicles, is used as the basis for the guidance method. To handle needle-tissue interactions, we propose using Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) because of its robustness within hard-to-model environments. We investigate both linear and nonlinear ADRC, and validate the approach with a Programmable Bevel-tip Steerable Needle (PBN) in both phantom tissue and ex vivo brain, with some of the experiments involving moving targets. Results: The mean, standard deviation, and maximum absolute position errors are observed to be 1.79 mm, 1.04 mm, and 5.84 mm, respectively, for 3-D, 120 mm deep, path-following experiments. Conclusion: MCFs with FBGs are a promising technology for autonomous steerable needle navigation, as demonstrated here on PBNs. Significance: FBGs in MCFs can be used to provide effective feedback in path-following controllers for steerable needles.

SO JOURNAL OF AIRCRAFT
LA English
DT Article
AB The Atlantis Project is a wing-based autonomous sailing vessel, based on a Prindle-19 catamaran, that has demonstrated line following under automatic control to an accuracy of better than 0.3 meters. This work details both the design of the wing section and the configuration analysis for a free-rotating, aerodynamically actuated wingsail that is used as the main propulsion system. Based on numerical airflow analysis using PANDA and XFOIL of the low Reynolds number aerodynamic performance, a symmetric section with a small trailing-edge flap is used in a conventional arrangement (tail-behind the main section). This allows efficient sailing to both port and starboard, as well as retaining high-lift coefficients for broad reaches. The inability of the flow to withstand adverse pressure gradients at the typically low Reynolds number causes separation with flap deflection, thus necessitating a narrow-chord flap that is deflected through a large angle for high-lift applications. The designed section has a C-Lmax of 1.8 at a Reynolds number of 229,000, and a flap deflection of 45 deg. The wing section is 21% thick, with a 13 % plain flap to achieve this maximum lift coefficient. Four different configurations are evaluated for stability and swept radius (the farthest distance that the entire wingsail reaches as it rotates about the mast). The configurations evaluated are 1) conventional, 2) canard, 3) flying wing, and 4) free-floating canard. The canard and the flying wing cannot be made passively stable with a high coefficient of lift, whereas the free-floating canard and the conventional configuration achieve the stability criteria. The free-floating conard has a larger swept radius and has issues with stall stability that are not covered by this simplifled analysis, thus the conventional configuration (tail behind the wing) is determined best for this application.

AB This work represents a new paradigm for the dynamics and control of maneuvering flexible aircraft. Using the system concept, the theory integrates seamlessly all the necessary material from the areas of analytical dynamics, structural dynamics, aerodynamics, and controls. It includes automatically all six rigid-body degrees of freedom and elastic deformations, as well as the gravity, propulsion, aerodynamic, and control forces, in addition to forces of an external nature, such as gusts. The seamless integration is achieved by using the same reference frame and the same variables to describe the aircraft motions and the forces acting on it, including the aerodynamic forces. The formulation is modular in nature, in the the sense that the structural model, the aerodynamic theory, and the controls method can be replaced by any other ones to better suit different types of aircraft, provided certain criteria are satisfied. A perturbation approach permits the separation of the equations of motion into a flight dynamics problem for the maneuvering aircraft rigid-body translations and rotations and an extended perturbation problem for the elastic deformations and perturbations in the rigid-body variables, where the second problem is subject to inputs from the maneuvering aircraft. The formulation is ideally suited for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and in particular for autonomous UAVs requiring autopilots. A numerical example presents a variety of time simulations of rigid-body perturbations and elastic deformations for two cases, 1) a steady level flight and 2) a level steady turn maneuver. All the time simulations were carried out on a 1-GHz personal computer, which is particularly important for autonomous UAVs, as the required onboard computer is likely to be much closer to a personal computer than to a multiprocessor supercomputer. The unified theory is expected to stimulate new interest in aeronautics research, ultimately providing a useful tool for the analysis and design of flexible aircraft.

AB The realization of intelligent mining is the only method for realizing high-quality development in the coal industry. As the forefront working link in mine production, achieving automatic roadway tunneling control is key to improving production efficiency, enhancing intelligence, and reducing accident rates at fully mechanized tunneling working faces. Among various detection techniques, machine vision technology stands out with advantages of non-contact measurement, rich information acquisition, and high detection accuracy. The detection and control of tunneling equipment groups based on machine vision has become a research hotspot in the intelligence process of coal mines. This study first introduces the key technologies of a visual detection system, including camera calibration, image preprocessing, feature extraction, visual matching, target segmentation and recognition, visual measurement, and 3D reconstruction. It then elaborates on detection principles, workflows, limitations, precautions, and development status of various vision detection systems in practical application scenarios at tunneling faces, such as tunneling equipments, anchoring systems, transportation systems, and safety auxiliary systems, which significantly improve production safety and efficiency. Finally, considering challenging work conditions and strong interference in mines, the successful adaptation of machine vision to excavation sites relies on addressing technical challenges related to poor environment adaptability, limited imaging field of view, and low intelligence level. Furthermore, according to existing research results and the current technical status, this paper forecasts key technologies that need to be developed in the future for coal mine intelligent equipment systems based on machine vision, including multi-sensor information fusion, equipment group collaborative control, and digital twin-driven remote monitoring.

AB Various autonomous or assisted driving strategies have been facilitated through the accurate and reliable perception of the environment around a vehicle. Among the commonly used sensors, radar has usually been considered as a robust and cost-effective solution even in adverse driving scenarios, e.g., weak/strong lighting or bad weather. Instead of considering fusing the unreliable information from all available sensors, perception from pure radar data becomes a valuable alternative that is worth exploring. In this paper, we propose a deep radar object detection network, named RODNet, which is cross-supervised by a camera-radar fused algorithm without laborious annotation efforts, to effectively detect objects from the radio frequency (RF) images in real-time. First, the raw signals captured by millimeter-wave radars are transformed to RF images in range-azimuth coordinates. Second, our proposed RODNet takes a snippet of RF images as the input to predict the likelihood of objects in the radar field of view (FoV). Two customized modules are also added to handle multi-chirp information and object relative motion. The proposed RODNet is cross-supervised by a novel 3D localization of detected objects using a camera-radar fusion (CRF) strategy in the training stage. Due to no existing public dataset available for our task, we create a new dataset, named CRUW, (1) (1) The dataset and code are available at https://www.cruwdataset.org/. which contains synchronized RGB and RF image sequences in various driving scenarios. With intensive experiments, our proposed cross-supervised RODNet achieves 86% average precision and 88% average recall of object detection performance, which shows the robustness in various driving conditions.

AB Mid-ocean ridge axes are marked by segmentation of the axes and underlying magmatic systems. Fine-scale segmentation has mainly been studied along fast-spreading ridges. Here we offer insight into the third- and fourth-order segmentation of intermediate-spreading ridges and their temporal evolution. The Alarcon Rise and the Endeavour Segment have similar spreading rates (49 and 52.5 mm/year, respectively) but contrasting morphologies that vary from an axial high with a relatively narrow axial summit trough to an axial valley. One-meter resolution bathymetry acquired by autonomous underwater vehicles, lava geochemistry, and ages from sediment cores is combined with available seismic reflection profiles to analyze variations in (1) geometry and orientation of the axial summit trough or valley, (2) seafloor depth near the axis, and (3) distribution of hydrothermal vents, (4) lava chemistry, and (5) flow ages between contiguous axes. Along both intermediate-spreading segments, third- and fourth-order discontinuities and associated segments are similar in dimension to what has been observed along fast-spreading ridges. The Alarcon Rise and the Endeavour Segment also allow the study of the evolution of fine-scale segmentation over periods of 300 to 4,000 years. Comparison between old and young axes reveals that the evolution of fine-scale segmentation depends on the intensity of the magmatic activity. High magmatic periods are associated with rapid evolution of third-order segments, while low magmatic activity periods, dominated by tectonic deformation and/or hydrothermal activity, are associated with little to no change in segmentation. Plain Language Summary Structure and morphology of two intermediate-rate spreading ridge axes were analyzed in 1-m resolution bathymetry collected using autonomous underwater vehicles. The observations are combined with information on the distribution of hydrothermal vents, lava flow ages, and geochemistry, and, where available, the geometry of the magma lens. The aim is to determine the third- and fourth-order segmentation of the volcanic axis along intermediate-spreading ridges and their evolution related to cycles in magma supply. The study focuses on two ridge segments, the Alarcon Rise and the Endeavour Segment, that have similar spreading rates but are in magmatic and tectonic phases, respectively, which has resulted in contrasting morphology. Our analysis shows that along both segments the third- and fourth-order segments and their associated discontinuities are similar in geometry to those observed along fast-spreading ridges, independent of the magmatic activity. However, the intensity of magmatic activity impacts the evolution of segmentation with segments that remain at the same position during tectonic or low magmatic periods and propagate, decrease, or disappear during high magmatic periods.

AB As a large-scale public transport mode, the driving safety of high-speed rail has a profound impact on public health. In this study, we determined the most efficient multi-modal warning interface for automatic driving of a high-speed train and put forward suggestions for optimization and improvement. Forty-eight participants were selected, and a simulated 350 km/h high-speed train driving experiment equipped with a multi-modal warning interface was carried out. Then, the parameters of eye movement and behavior were analyzed by independent sample Kruskal-Wallis test and one-way analysis of variance. The results showed that the current level 3 warning visual interface of a high-speed train had the most abundant warning graphic information, but it failed to increase the takeover efficiency of the driver. The visual interface of the level 2 warning was more likely to attract the attention of drivers than the visual interface of the level 1 warning, but it still needs to be optimized in terms of the relevance of and guidance between graphic-text elements. The multi-modal warning interface had a faster response efficiency than the single-modal warning interface. The auditory-visual multi-modal interface had the highest takeover efficiency and was suitable for the most urgent (level 3) high-speed train warning. The introduction of an auditory interface could increase the efficiency of a purely visual interface, but the introduction of a tactile interface did not improve the efficiency. These findings can be used as a basis for the interface design of automatic driving high-speed trains and help improve the active safety of automatic driving high-speed trains, which is of great significance to protect the health and safety of the public.

AB In this paper, based on the fusion of Lidar and Radar measurement data, high-definition probabilistic maps, and a tailored particle filter, a Real-Time Monte Carlo Localization (RT_MCL) method for autonomous cars is proposed. The lidar and radar devices are installed on the ego car, and a customized Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is used for their data fusion. Lidars are accurate in determining objects' positions and have a much higher spatial resolution. On the other hand, Radars are more accurate in measuring objects velocities and perform well in extreme weather conditions. Therefore, the merits of both sensors are combined using the UKF to provide pole-like static-objects pose estimations that are well suited to serve as landmarks for vehicle localization in urban environments. These pose estimations are then clustered using the Grid-Based Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (GB-DBSCAN) algorithm to represent each pole landmarks in the form of a source-point model to reduce computational cost and memory requirements. A reference map that includes pole landmarks is generated off-line and extracted from a 3-D lidar to be used by a carefully designed Particle Filter (PF) for accurate ego-car localization. The particle filter is initialized by the combined GPS+IMU reading and used an ego-car motion model to predict the states of the particles. The data association between the estimated landmarks by the UKF and that in the reference map is performed using Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. The proposed pipeline is implemented using the high-performance language C++ and utilizes highly optimized math and optimization libraries for best real-time performance. Extensive simulation studies have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the RT_MCL in both longitudinal and lateral localization.

AB As more and more applications rely on Artificial Intelligence (AI), it is inevitable to explore the associated safety and security risks, especially for sensitive applications where physical integrity is at risk. One of the most interesting challenges that come with AI are adversarial attacks being a well-researched problem in the visual domain, where a small change in the input data can cause the Neural Network (NN) to make an incorrect prediction. In the radar domain, AI is not that widespread yet but the results that AI applications produce are very promising, which is why more and more applications based on it are being used. This work presents three possible attack methods that are particularly suitable for the radar domain. The developed algorithms generate universal adversarial attack patches for all sorts of radar applications based on NN. The main goal of the algorithms, apart from the computation of universal patches, is the identification of sensitive areas in the raw radar data input which than can be examined more closely. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that deals with calculating universal patches on raw radar data, which is of great importance especially for interference analysis. The developed algorithms have been verified on two data sets. One in the field of autonomous driving where the attacks lead to a steering misprediction of up to 0.3 for the steering value which is within [-1,1], with the results also being successfully tested on a demonstrator. The other data set originated from a gesture recognition task, where the attacks decreased the accuracy, originally at 97.0% up to a minimum of 16.5%, which is slightly above 12.5% being the accuracy for a purely random prediction.

AB The tracking and positioning of transmission lines is a key element for UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) to achieve autonomous inspection of transmission lines. Current methods are vulnerable to weather and environmental factors, have high costs, and have difficulties in data processing. Therefore, this paper proposes a transmission line tracking and localization method based on the electric field sensor array, which calculates the current UAV's heading angle deflection angle, the distance between the transmission line and the UAV, and the elevation angle, providing a new idea to solve the problem of UAV inspection of transmission lines. At the same time, the electric field distribution of different arrangements of three-phase transmission lines was analyzed using COMSOL to determine the flight area of the UAV. By comparing the electric field distribution of the UAV flight area and single-phase transmission lines, it was verified that the current method is also applicable in the three-phase transmission line scenario, and it was further verified that the sensor array used can sense the change of the UAV position in the flight area, indicating that the electric field sensor array can realize the transmission line tracking and localization of transmission lines. The experimental results showed that, in the three-phase transmission line scenario, when the sensor array moves along the transmission straight wire, the maximum absolute error of the heading angle deflection angle calculated according to this method was 8.2 degrees, the maximum absolute error of the distance between the array and the transmission line was 19.3 cm, and the maximum absolute error of the elevation angle was 11.37 degrees; the error was within a reasonable range and can be used for the UAV to realize autonomous inspection.

AB China is experiencing severe environmental degradation, particularly air pollution. To explore whether air pollutants are spatially correlated (i.e., trans-boundary effects) and to analyse the main contributing factors, this research investigates the annual concentration of the Air Quality Index (AQI) and 13 polluting sectors in 30 provinces and autonomous regions across China. Factor analysis, the linear regression model and the spatial auto-regression (SAR) model are employed to analyse the latest data in 2014. Several important findings are derived. Firstly, the global Moran's I test reveals that the AQI of China shows a distinct positive spatial correlation. The local Moran's I test shows that significant high-high AQI agglomeration regions are found around the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area and the regions of low-low AQI agglomeration all locate in south China, including Yunnan, Guangxi and Fujian. Secondly, the effectiveness of the SAR model is much better than that of the linear regression model, with a significantly improved R-squared value from 0.287 to 0.705. A given region's AQI will rise by 0.793% if the AQI of its ambient region increases by 1%. Thirdly, car ownership, steel output, coke output, coal consumption, built-up area, diesel consumption and electric power output contribute most to air pollution according to AQI, whereas fuel oil consumption, caustic soda output and crude oil consumption are inconsiderably accountable in raising AQI. Fourthly, the air quality in Beijing and Tianjin is under great exogenous influence from nearby regions, such as Hebei's air pollution, and cross-boundary and joint efforts must be committed by the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in order to control air pollution.

AB Insects such as flies or bees, with their miniature brains, are able to control highly aerobatic flight maneuvres and to solve spatial vision tasks, such as avoiding collisions with obstacles, landing on objects, or even localizing a previously learnt inconspicuous goal on the basis of environmental cues. With regard to solving such spatial tasks, these insects still outperform man-made autonomous flying systems. To accomplish their extraordinary performance, flies and bees have been shown by their characteristic behavioral actions to actively shape the dynamics of the image flow on their eyes ("optic flow"). The neural processing of information about the spatial layout of the environment is greatly facilitated by segregating the rotational from the translational optic flow component through a saccadic flight and gaze strategy. This active vision strategy thus enables the nervous system to solve apparently complex spatial vision tasks in a particularly efficient and parsimonious way. The key idea of this review is that biological agents, such as flies or bees, acquire at least part of their strength as autonomous systems through active interactions with their environment and not by simply processing passively gained information about the world. These agent-environment interactions lead to adaptive behavior in surroundings of a wide range of complexity. Animals with even tiny brains, such as insects, are capable of performing extraordinarily well in their behavioral contexts by making optimal use of the closed action-perception loop. Model simulations and robotic implementations show that the smart biological mechanisms of motion computation and visually-guided flight control might be helpful to find technical solutions, for example, when designing micro air vehicles carrying a miniaturized, low-weight on-board processor.

AB The autonomous UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) navigation has recently gained an increasing interest from both academic and industrial sectors due to its potential uses in various fields and especially, the need for social distancing during the pandemic. Many works have adopted a deep reinforcement learning (RL) method with experience replay called deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to control the motion of UAV, and gain high accuracy results in static and simplified environments. However, they are still far from being ready for real world adoption in that the UAVs have to operate under complex and dynamic conditions. We also found that using only DDPG makes the learning process prone to oscillation and is inefficient for tasks having high dimensional action-state spaces. Furthermore, the goal reward mechanism in traditional reward functions brings a bias to the state, which resembles the one at the goal area and leads to erroneous action selection. To get closer to being ready for real world adoption, we proposed a novel method that enables UAVs to be capable of handling motion control in realistic environments. The first component of our proposed method is point cloud data (PCD) simplification with truncated icosahedron structure which converts enormous PCD into a few essential data points. In the second component of our method, we replace the traditional goal reward mechanism with a new mechanism called Augmentative Backward Reward (ABR) function to dispense the goal reward to transitions proportionately to its participation. By integrating simplified PCD and ABR, we achieved significantly better results when compared with using only the-state-of-the-art, TD3. In addition, we tested the proposed method with another navigation task, BipedalWalkerHardcore, a testbed for RL, and the result is still better and steadier than of TD3. These results indicate that the proposed method is robust.

AB Recent development on autonomous and connected trucks (ACT) has provided the freight industry with the new option of using truck platooning to improve their fuel efficiency, traffic throughput, and safety. However, closely spaced and longitudinally aligned trucks impose frequent and concentrated loading on pavements, which often accelerates pavement deterioration and increase the life-cycle costs for the highway agency. Also, effectiveness of truck platooning can only be maximized in dedicated lanes, and its benefits and costs need to be properly balanced between stakeholders. This paper proposes a network design model to optimize (i) placement of dedicated truck platoon lanes and toll price in a highway network, (ii) pooling and routing of ACT traffic from multiple origins and destinations to utilize these lanes, and (iii) configuration of truck platoons within these lanes (e.g., lateral displacements and vehicle separations). The problem is formulated as an integrated bi-level optimization model. The upper level makes decisions on converting existing highway lanes into dedicated platoon lanes, as well as setting user fees. The lower level decisions are made by independent shippers regarding the choice of routes, use of platoon lanes vs. regular lanes, and they collectively determine truck traffic in all lanes. Link cost functions for platoon lanes are obtained by simultaneously optimizing, through dynamic programming, pavement rehabilitation activities and platoon configuration in the pavement's life cycle. A numerical case study is used to demonstrate the applicability and performance of the proposed model framework over the Illinois freeway system. It is shown that the freight traffic is effectively channelized on a few corridors of platoon lanes and, by setting proper user fees to cover pavement rehabilitation costs, system-wide improvements for both freight shippers and highway agencies can be achieved.

AB The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), colloquially known as drones, has grown rapidly over the past two decades and continues to expand at a rapid pace. This has resulted in the production of many research papers addressing the use of UAVs in a variety of applications, such as forest firefighting. The main purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of UAV-based forest-fire-extinguishing activity (FFEA) operations. To achieve this goal, a systematic literature review was conducted to answer a specific set of questions, which were carefully formulated to address the results of research conducted between 2008 and 2021. This study aims to (i) expand our understanding of the development of UAVs and their current contributions to the FFEA; (ii) identify particularly novel or unique applications and characteristics of UAV-based fire-extinguishing systems; (iii) provide guidance for exploring and revising further ideas in this field by identifying under-researched topics and other areas in which more contributions are needed; and (iv) explore the feasibility of using UAV swarms to enable autonomous firefighting in the forest without human intervention. Of the 1353 articles systematically searched across five databases (Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library, Science Direct, Scopus, and IEEE Explore), 51 highly relevant articles were found to meet the inclusion criteria; therefore, they were analyzed and discussed. The results identified several gaps in this field of study among them the complexity of coordination in multi-robotic systems, the lack of evaluation and implementation of fire extinguishing systems, the inability of handling multiple spot fires, and poor management of time and resources. Finally, based on the conducted review, this paper provides significant research directions that require further investigations by researchers in this field including, the deployment of UAV-based Swarm Robotics, further study on the characteristics of the fire extinguishing systems; design more effective area coverage; and the propose of a self-firefighting model that enables individuals to decide on the course of events efficiently and locally for better utilization and management of time and resources.

AB In this paper, we investigate a mixed-traffic control problem considering uncertainties of HDVs flow. The challenges mainly lie in modeling the stochastic characteristics of mixed-traffic flow and developing less-conservative algorithm to deal with the uncertainties. To tackle the problem, we propose a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) strategy based on data-driven distributionally robust optimization (DRO). First, a stochastic mixed-traffic model, extended from cell transmission model, is proposed to describe the traffic dynamics. Then, utilizing historical traffic data, an incremental principal component analysis (IPCA) based method is given to construct ambiguity set and incorporate generalized moment information of uncertainties. Based on the above predictive model and ambiguity set, a DRO-based MPC problem is formulated and further converted into an equivalent dual form for efficient solutions, i.e., ramp metering and variable speed limit control. Finally, simulation results based on real data collected in Shanghai, China, demonstrate that our proposed strategy can significantly reduce traffic congestion, achieving 5.74% total travel time reduction compared to robust MPC.

AB This study presents a novel methodology for robust classification of image quality, a critical task in the domain of computer vision. The ability to accurately and promptly classify an image as being of inferior quality, due to factors such as lighting, focus, encoding, and compression, is crucial for a wide range of applications, including autonomous vehicles, web search technologies, smartphones, and digital cameras. Moreover, this capability holds significant potential for numerous industrial applications, particularly in the realm of quality assurance in manufacturing processes or outgoing inspections. In response to this requirement, a novel automated system is proposed herein, employing an optimization algorithm to categorize images into six distinct classes: motion blur, white noise, Gaussian blur, poor illumination, JPEG 2000, and high-quality reference images. The proposed framework is evaluated against existing methodologies using a selection of publicly available datasets. Both subjective and objective assessment results will be presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. This work underscores the potential of leveraging optimized deep learning techniques for robust and automatic image quality classification, thereby paving the way for improved quality assurance across diverse industries.

AB Point cloud is a major representation format of 3D objects and scenes. It has been increasingly applied in various applications due to the rapid advances in 3D sensing and rendering technologies. In the field of autonomous driving, point clouds captured by spinning Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) devices have become an informative data source for road environment perception and intelligent vehicle control. On the other hand, the massive data volume of point clouds also brings huge challenges to point cloud transmission and storage. Therefore, establishing compression frameworks and algorithms that conform to the characteristics of point cloud data has become an important research topic for both academia and industry. In this paper, a geometry compression method dedicated to spinning LiDAR point cloud was proposed taking advantage of the prior information of the LiDAR acquisition procedure. Rate-distortion optimizations were further integrated into the coding pipeline according to the characteristics of the prediction residuals. Experimental results obtained on different datasets show that the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art G-PCC predictive geometry coding method with reduced runtime at both the encoder and decoder sides.

ID VISION; LIGHT
AB This paper focuses on exploring ways to improve the performance of LiDAR imagers through fog. One of the known weaknesses of LiDAR technology is the lack of tolerance to adverse environmental conditions, such as the presence of fog, which hampers the future development of LiDAR in several markets. Within this paper, a LiDAR unit is designed and constructed to be able to apply temporal and polarimetric discrimination for detecting the number of signal photons received with detailed control of its temporal and spatial distribution under co-polarized and cross-polarized configurations. The system is evaluated using different experiments in a macro-scale fog chamber under controlled fog conditions. Using the complete digitization of the acquired signals, we analyze the natural light media response, to see that due to its characteristics it could be directly filtered out. Moreover, we confirm that there exists a polarization memory effect, which, by using a polarimetric cross-configuration detector, allows improvement of object detection in point clouds. These results are useful for applications related to computer vision, in fields like autonomous vehicles or outdoor surveillance where many variable types of environmental conditions may be present.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB With the advent of rapid globalization and the inter-border supply chain network, the reliability and efficiency of transportation systems have become even more critical. Indeed, trans-continental highways need particular attention due to their important role in sustaining globalization. In this context, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) can actively enhance the safety, mobility, productivity, and comfort of trans-continental highways. However, ITS efficiency depends greatly on the roads where they are deployed, on the availability of power and connectivity, and on the integration of future connected and autonomous vehicles. To this end, high altitude platform station (HAPS) systems, due to their mobility, sustainability, payload capacity, and communication/caching/computing capabilities, are seen as a key enabler of future ITS services for trans-continental highways; this paradigm is referred to as HAPS-ITS. The latter is envisioned as an active component of ITS systems to support a plethora of transportation applications, such as traffic monitoring, accident reporting, and platooning. This article discusses how HAPS systems can enable advanced ITS services for trans-continental highways, presenting the main requirements of HAPS-ITS and a detailed case study of the Trans-Sahara highway.

AB 5G and beyond mobile systems target a plethora of emerging industrial and entertainment verticals that incur extra overhead to the network. These verticals are characterized by vigorous, continuous, and conflicting requirements that make the desired system's mission strenuous and more challenging. These verticals, such as autonomous driving, will accommodate immersive services, including virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) and Holography services. Immersive services, in particular, have strict requirements for latency, throughput, and positioning. This article discusses VR-based remote services' potential, which occupies an important place among immersive services such as remote surgery, remote space control, and remote driving of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or cars. Such services require an ultra-low Glass-to-Glass latency to avoid any failure and accidents when remotely controlling devices. We evaluate an immersive remote control service from the end-to-end communication perspectives using different camera devices that stream real-time 360 degrees videos to a VR Head Mounted Device (HMD). The obtained results demonstrate the challenges of such service and the need for more advanced and optimized techniques, devices, and protocols to achieve less than 20 ms of Glass-to-Glass latency.

AB With high efficiency and good scalability, Robotic Mobile Fulfilment Systems (RMFS) are increasingly applied in various warehouses, especially the e-commerce warehouses with rigid order completion time. RMFS requires less workers and provide more punctual service for customers. The existing literature on RMFS is based on single-deep non-compact layout. As land supply is limited and expensive in urban area, it's essential to consider compact storage in RMFS. This paper is the first to model and evaluate the multi-deep compact RMFS. We develop a semi-open queueing network (SOQN) model to characterise the multi-deep compact RMFS and solve it by Approximate Mean Value Analysis (AMVA). The obtained approximate analytic solutions of system throughput, robot utilisation, and queue length were verified and assessed through simulations. The numerical experiments investigated the effects of different configuration of the lane depth, number of picking aisles, arrangement of picking stations and the number of robots on performance. Our research can provide useful guidelines for warehouse planners and managers for designing and operating multi-deep compact RMFS.

AB Recent advancements in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have provided an opportunity to create autonomous devices, robots, and machines characterised particularly with the ability to make decisions and perform tasks without human mediation. One of these devices, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones are widely used to perform tasks like surveillance, search and rescue, object detection and target tracking, and many more. Efficient real-time object detection in aerial videos is an urgent need, especially with the increasing use of UAV in various fields. The sensitivity in performing said tasks demands that drones must be efficient and reliable. This paper presents our research progress in the development of applications for the identification and detection of person using the convolutional neural networks (CNN) YOLO-v2 based on the camera of drone. The position and state of the person are determined with deep-learning-based computer vision. The person detection results show that YOLO-v2 detects and classifies object with a high level of accuracy. For real-time tracking, the tracking algorithm responds faster than conventionally used approaches, efficiently tracking the detected person without losing it from sight.

AB In this study, a self-sorting sensor was developed with the ability to distinguish between different pressure regimes and translate the pressure to electrical signals. Specifically, the self-sorting sensor can distinguish between soft and hard pressure like the human skin, without any software assistance and complicated circuits. To achieve the self-sorting property, Janus-like jagged structures were prepared via an all-solution process of spontaneous chemical patterning; they comprised electrically semi-insulating vertices and highly conductive valleys. This unique structure facilitates the detection and determination of the intensities and types of pressure by providing a significant gap between the current levels of two types of states, similar to the function of fibers in the human tactile system. The fabricated sensors also exhibit high sensitivity and durability as well as low power consumption, as demonstrated by the electronic skin and ternary Morse signal applications. Compared with conventional wearable pressure sensors, this sensor can detect signals without additional programming; thus, it is highly suitable for delay-sensitive, energy-efficient sensor applications such as driverless vehicles, autonomous artificial intelligence technology, and prosthetic devices.

AB A hover-capable insect-inspired flying robot that can remain long in the air has shown its potential use for both confined indoor and outdoor applications to complete assigned tasks. In this letter, we report improvements in the flight endurance of our 15.8 g robot, named KUBeetle-S, using a low-voltage power source. The robot is equipped with a simple but effective control mechanism that can modulate the stroke plane for attitude stabilization and control. Due to the demand for extended flight, we performed a series of experiments on the lift generation and power requirement of the robot with different stroke amplitudes and wing areas. We show that a larger wing with less inboard wing area improves the lift-to-power ratio and produces a peak lift-to-weight ratio of 1.34 at 3.7 V application. Flight tests show that the robot employing the selected wing could hover for 8.8 minutes. Moreover, the robot could perform maneuvers in any direction, fly outdoors, and carry payload, demonstrating its ability to enter the next phase of autonomous flight.

AB The Mexican research journal Veterinaria Mexico has been published without interruption by the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Zootechnics (FMVZ) at the National Autonomous University Of Mexico (UNAM) since 1970. Analysis of the 518 studies published in the 40 issues of the journal from 1989 to 1998 showed that research articles were the most frequent type of contribution to the journal representing 60%. Subject areas of the contributions were mainly pathology, followed by reproduction, parasitology and pharmacology, corresponding to 47% of the total. Bovine were the most studied species appearing in almost a quarter of the papers followed by poultry, pigs and dogs, all with approximately 10% each. Authors from the FMVZ participated in only 33% of papers indicating the importance of this journal as a vehicle for the publication of results from other national and international institutions. One hundred and eighty contributions were found for the FMVZ published in co-authorship with other institutions within the UNAM or with other national institutions, whereas contributions in international collaboration of the FMVZ amounted to 19. Finally, foreign institutions were responsible for 67 contributions without the FMVZ, and national institutions for 228.

AB A laser imaging detection and ranging (LIDAR) is one of the key sensors for autonomous driving. In order to improve its performance of the measurable distance, especially toward the front-side direction of the vehicle, this paper presents rapid revolution speed control of a brushless DC (BLDC) motor with a cyclostationary command signal. This enables the increase of the signal integration time for the designated direction, and thus improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while maintaining the averaged revolution speed. We propose the use of pre-emphasis circuits to accelerate and decelerate the revolution speed of the motor rapidly, by modifying the command signal so as to enhance the transition of the speed. The adaptive signal processing can adjust coefficients of the pre-emphasis filter automatically, so that it can compensate for the decayed response of the motor and its controller. Experiments with a 20-W BLDC motor prove that the proposed technique can achieve the actual revolution speed output to track the designated speed profile ranging from 600 to 1400 revolutions per minute (rpm) during one turn.

AB Driving a car is a highly visual task. Despite the trend towards increased driver assistance and autonomous vehicles, drivers still need to interact with the car for both driving and non-driving relevant tasks, at times simultaneously. The often-resulting high cognitive load is a safety issue, which can be addressed by providing the driver with alternative feedback modalities, such as haptics. Recent trends in the automotive industry are moving towards the seamless integration of control elements through touch-sensitive surfaces. Psychological knowledge on optimally utilizing haptic technologies remains limited. The literature on automotive haptic feedback consists mainly of singular findings without putting them into a broader user context with respect to haptic design of interfaces. Moreover, haptic feedback has primarily been limited to the confirmation of control actions rather than the searching or finding of control elements, the latter of which becomes particularly important considering the current trends. This paper presents an integrated framework on haptic processing in automotive user interfaces and provides guidelines for haptic design of user interfaces in car interiors.

AB Cooperative navigation aims at improving positioning accuracy of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). In this paper, a dual leaders cooperative navigation method is proposed based on Cross Entropy (CE) algorithm. Since the trajectories of the slave AUVs are assumed to be predetermined, the Markov Decision Process (MDP) is also integrated in the proposed algorithm to generate optimal trajectories of master AUVs from the perspective of probability. Firstly, the navigation model and cost functions are established for the cooperative navigation system with multiple masters and slaves. Then, the CE algorithm is used to train the system with help of MDP to obtain the path of the master AUVs. In the simulation, the cooperative localization trajectories of the slave AUVs are obtained by Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and are compared with other positioning methods. The results show that the trajectories of dual master AUVs obtained by the proposed algorithm can not only reduce the observation error of the slave AUVs in the system effectively, but also keep relative measurement distance between the master AUVs and the slave AUVs in a suitable range.

ID ROUTING PROTOCOL
AB Data collection is the core function of underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs). Lately, ambulatory data gathering methods are being popularized in real applications. However, due to present mobile underwater data collection investigations that are on the basis of 2-D scenarios, the associated approaches are not suitable for 3-D UASNs. Additionally, mobile-element-assisted data collection usually brings special issues on obstacle avoidance. Accordingly, we propose a probabilistic neighborhood location-point covering set-based data collection algorithm with obstacle avoidance for 3-D UASNs. The proposed algorithm initially generates a space lattice set to establish the probabilistic neighborhood location-point covering set for data collection, so as to optimize the data collection latency. Then, an autonomous underwater vehicle traverses only location points in the constructed covering set with a hierarchical grid-based obstacle avoidance strategy. The simulation experiments are performed to verify the proposed algorithm compared with other existing underwater data collection algorithms. Simulations show that our proposed algorithm achieves better performance in terms of data collection latency, data collection efficiency, and obstacle avoidance.

AB Complex robotic systems often have to operate in large environments. At the same time, their dynamic is complex enough that path planning algorithms need to reason about the differential constraints of these systems. On the other hand, such robotic systems are typically expected to operate with speed that is commensurate with that of humans. This poses stringent limitation on available planning time. A common approach is to use a two-dimensional(2-D) global planner for long range planning, and a short range higher dimensional planner or controller capable of satisfying all of the constraints on motion. However, this approach is incomplete and can result in oscillations or even the inability to find a path to the goal. In this paper, we present an approach to solve this problem by combining the global and local path planning problem into a single search scheme using a combined 2-D and higher dimensional state space. The proposed approach is demonstrated and validated in simulation and experiment with a significantly asymmetric differential drive robot. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID GLIDE SLOPE CONTROL
AB Precision placement of guided airdrop systems necessarily requires some mechanism enabling effective directional control of the vehicle. Often this mechanism is realized through asymmetric deflection of the parafoil canopy trailing-edge brakes. In contrast to conventional trailing-edge deflection used primarily for lateral steering, upper-surface bleed air spoilers have been shown to be extremely effective for both lateral and longitudinal (i.e., glide slope) control of parafoil and payload systems. Bleed air spoilers operate by opening and closing several spanwise slits in the upper surface of the parafoil canopy, thus creating a virtual spoiler from the stream of expelled ram air. The work reported here considers the autonomous landing performance of a small-scale parafoil and payload system using upper-surface bleed air spoilers exclusively for both lateral steering and glide slope control. Landing accuracy statistics computed from a series of Monte Carlo simulations in a variety of atmospheric conditions and experimental flight tests were found to be in good agreement. Median miss distances for the combined lateral and longitudinal control logic are on the order of 13m, indicating an improvement in landing accuracy of nearly 50% over similar systems employing only lateral steering control.

AB The sonar of dolphins has developed over millions of years of evolution and has achieved excellent performance levels. Using the excellent performance of the dolphins sonar as an inspiration, bio-inspired wideband acoustic sensing methods for underwater target detection and tracking are being developed. In this study the authors explore what they expect to gain from such a wideband sonar. The systems wideband sensors are based on bottlenose dolphins sonar, covering a frequency band from around 30 to 150 kHz and having a frequency dependent beamwidth considerably larger than that of conventional imaging sonars. The system can be made relatively compact and is suitable for mounting on a variety of platforms including small-scale autonomous underwater vehicles to allow the sonar to operate in a similar way to that used by dolphins. In contrast to high-resolution image processing techniques, detection and classification in the wideband system are based on pattern recognition methods applied to the echo spectra. The authors highlight the properties of the transducers needed for such a system indicating how these properties may be exploited to give improved sonar performance. The results obtained from such a system are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach.

TI Goal-Based Operations: An Overview
SO JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Operating robotic space missions via time-based command sequences has become a limiting factor in the exploration, defense, and commercial sectors. Command sequencing was originally designed for comparatively simple and predictable missions, with safe-mode responses for most faults. This approach has been increasingly strained to accommodate today's more complex missions, which require advanced capabilities such as autonomous fault diagnosis and response, vehicle mobility with hazard avoidance, opportunistic science observations, etc. Goal-based operation changes the fundamental basis of operations from imperative command sequences to declarative specifications of operational intent and termed goals. Execution based on explicit intent simplifies operator workload by focusing on what to do rather than how to do it. The move toward goal-based operations, which has already begun in some space missions, involves changes and opportunities in several places: operational processes and tools, human interface design, planning and scheduling, control architecture, fault protection, and verification and validation. Further, the need for future interoperation among multiple goal-based systems suggests that attention be given to areas for standardization. This overview paper defines the concept of goal-based operations, reviews a history of steps in this direction, and discusses the areas of change and opportunity through comparison with the prevalent operational paradigm of command sequencing.

AB This paper presents a labeling methodology for marine life data using a weakly supervised learning framework. The methodology iteratively trains a deep learning model using non-expert labels obtained from crowdsourcing. This approach enables us to converge on a labeled image dataset through multiple training and production loops that leverage crowdsourcing interfaces. We present our algorithm and its results on two separate sets of image data collected using the Seabed autonomous underwater vehicle. The first dataset consists of 10,505 images that were point annotated by NOAA biologists. This dataset allows us to validate the accuracy of our labeling process. We also apply our algorithm and methodology to a second dataset consisting of 3,968 completely unlabeled images. These image categories are challenging to label, such as sponges. Qualitatively, our results indicate that training with a tiny subset and iterating on those results allows us to converge to a large, highly annotated dataset with a small number of iterations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology quantitatively, we tabulate the mean average precision (mAP) of the model as the number of iterations increases.

AB In anchor-free environments, where no devices with known positions are available, the error growth of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) localization and target tracking is unbounded due to the lack of references and the accumulated errors in inertial measurements. This paper aims to improve the localization and tracking accuracy by involving current information as extra references. We first integrate current measurements and maps with belief propagation and design a distributed current-aided message-passing scheme that theoretically solves the localization and tracking problems. Based on this scheme, we propose particle-based cooperative localization and target tracking algorithms, named CaCL and CaTT, respectively. In AUV localization, CaCL uses the current measurements to correct the predicted and transmitted position information and alleviates the impact of the accumulated errors in inertial measurements. With target tracking, the current maps are applied in CaTT to modify the position prediction of the target which is calculated through historical estimates. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methods are validated through various simulations by comparisons with alternative methods under different trajectories and current conditions.

AB Research demonstrates that digital technologies stimulate industrial transformation by enabling new interdependencies with firms outside and across firm and industry boundaries. However, we know little about the degree of novelty and breadth of digital technologies that have the potential to transform industries. Understanding the degree of novelty (spanning from radical to incremental) and breadth (spanning from one sector to multiple sectors) of digital technologies is important for measuring their impact on industrial transformation. Through a topic modelling research approach on autonomous vehicle technology patents from firms operating in Sweden and a confirmatory survey with the inventors of those patents, this paper reveals 26 digital technology topics that are transforming the automotive industry. The digital technology topics are distributed across four ideal-typical technology categories for transformation: augmenting, spanning, transforming, and disrupting. This study illustrates the value of studying digital technologies' transformative nature using an integrating framework; it reveals that digital technologies in the automotive industry have mainly incremental characteristics but that these characteristics provide necessary preconditions for the few more radical technologies to achieve their potential in transforming the industry.

AB Monocular 3D object detection has recently become prevalent in autonomous driving and navigation applications due to its cost-efficiency and easy-to-embed to existent vehicles. The most challenging task in monocular vision is to estimate a reliable object's location cause of the lack of depth information in RGB images. Many methods tackle this ill-posed problem by directly regressing the object's depth or take the depth map as a supplement input to enhance the model's results. However, the performance relies heavily on the estimated depth map quality, which is bias to the training data. In this work, we propose depth-adaptive convolution to replace the traditional 2D convolution to deal with the divergent context of the image's features. This lead to significant improvement in both training convergence and testing accuracy. Second, we propose a ground plane model that utilizes geometric constraints in the pose estimation process. With the new method, named GAC3D, we achieve better detection results. We demonstrate our approach on the KITTI 3D Object Detection benchmark, which outperforms existing monocular methods.

AB Delivery using autonomous vehicles for medical and emergency supplies is a potential way to avoid unsafe and unpredictable factors. However, its implementation is hindered due to several key issues. A major dilemma is understanding curved alleyways in street scenes. These can be seen as compositions of non-Manhattan structures, which can help us estimate their original posture in three-dimensional scenes. We propose a new methodology to understand curved alleyways, and to bridge the gap between two-dimensional scene understanding and three-dimensional environment reconstruction from a monocular camera. Angle projections are assigned to clusters. Coplanar surfaces, which can compose fold structures, are estimated. Curved alley scenes are approximately represented by Manhattan and non-Manhattan fold structures, and approximated in the reconstruction of alley scenes. With geometric features, the algorithm requires no prior training or knowledge of the camera's internal parameters. We compared the estimated layout to the ground truth and measured the percentage of incorrectly classified pixels. The results showed that the algorithm can successfully understand alley scenes including both Manhattan and curved non-Manhattan structures.

AB With the rapid development of autonomous vehicles and mobile robotics, the desire to advance robust light detection and ranging (Lidar) detection methods for real world applications is increasing. However, this task still suffers in degraded visual environments (DVE), including smoke, dust, fog, and rain, as the aerosols lead to false alarm and dysfunction. Therefore, a novel Lidar target echo signal recognition method, based on a multi-distance measurement and deep learning algorithm is presented in this paper; neither the backscatter suppression nor the denoise functions are required. The 2-D spectrogram images are constructed by using the frequency-distance relation derived from the 1-D echo signals of the Lidar sensor individual cell in the course of approaching target. The characteristics of the target echo signal and noise in the spectrogram images are analyzed and determined; thus, the target recognition criterion is established accordingly. A customized deep learning algorithm is subsequently developed to perform the recognition. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the Lidar detection performance in DVE.

AB Replacing mechanical optical beam steering devices with non-mechanical electro-optic devices has been a long-standing desire for applications such as space-based communication, LiDAR and autonomous vehicles. While promising progress has been achieved to non-mechanically deflect light with high efficiency over a wide angular range, significant limitations remain towards achieving large aperture beam steering with a tunable steering direction. In this paper, we propose a unique liquid crystal based Pancharatnam Phase Device for beam steering which can provide both tunability and a fast response times in a format scalable to large apertures. This architecture employs a linear array of phase control elements to locally control the orientation of the liquid crystal director into a cycloidal pattern to deflect transmitted light. The PCEs are comprised of a fringe field switching electrode structure that can provide a variable in-plane electric field. Detailed modeling of the proposed design is presented which demonstrates that such a device can achieve a high degree of uniformity as it rotates the LC molecules over the 180 degrees angular range required to create a Pancharatnam phase device.

AB The propeller of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) operates at low Reynolds number in laminar to turbulent transition region. The performance of these propellers can be calculated accurately using RANSE solver with gamma - Re-theta transition model. In this study, the global and local hydrodynamic characteristics of open and ducted propeller are investigated using the gamma - Re(theta )transition model. The capability of the gamma - Re-theta transition model to capture laminar to turbulent transition on the surface of the open propeller is demonstrated by comparison with published experimental results. The application of transition model for the propeller K-a-4-70 inside the duct 19A shows that the centrifugal forces are dominant at low Reynolds number and the flow is mainly directed in the radial direction. The transition model is able to predict complex flow physics such as leading-edge separation, tip leakage vortex, and the separation bubble on outer surface of the duct. The accurate prediction of these flow phenomenon can lead to correct calculation of global hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the propeller at low Reynolds number.

AB In order to improve the accuracy and enhance stability of the tracking system of wheel-footed robot, the lateral control problem in the process of wheel movement is discussed. First, according to the structure and movement characteristics of the robot, we establish robotic four-wheel steering dynamic model considering the linear profile of the tire. Second, a sliding mode control (SMC) method based on tracking expected yaw rate is proposed. A virtual path between the current position of the robot and the road is planned in real time. The current expected yaw rate of the robot is calculated according to the virtual path and the robot tracks the expected yaw rate through the SMC method. Using this method alone may cause that the robot could not able to track the path precisely, especially in the road with large curvature. Therefore, we add steering prediction control to achieve better lateral control. The simulation results show that the improved control method has a greater effect on the lateral control accuracy of the robot.

AB This study develops a 6-DOF mathematical model for a robotic fish that considers surge, sway, heave, roll, pitch, and yaw. The model considers the conditions of a fish swimming in ocean current perturbations similar to the ocean current perturbations of the slender-body autonomous underwater vehicles. For swimming and turning behaviors, a nonlinear, dynamic, carangiform locomotion model is derived by using a planar four-link model. A 2-DOF barycenter mechanism is proposed to provide body stabilization and to serve as an actuating device for active control design. A barycenter control scheme is developed to change the center of gravity of the robot fish body by moving balancing masses along two axes. The projected torque on x and y axes propel pitch and roll angles to the desired settings. A Stabilizing controller, fish-tail mechanism, rigid body dynamics, and kinematics are incorporated to enable the fish robot to move in three dimensional space. Simulation results have demonstrated maneuverability and control system performance of the developed controller which is proposed to conduct path tracking of the robot fish as it swims under current perturbations.

AB Small-scale helicopters are very attractive because of their unique features. However, autonomous flight control for small-scale helicopters is still a challenging work because they are naturally unstable, strongly nonlinear, and sensitive to disturbances. In this paper, we focus on the design of a height and attitude active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) for a small-scale helicopter constructed in our lab. Firstly, a comprehensive nonlinear model for the platform is presented, which is obtained through first principles modeling and system identification. The controller is designed using backstepping technique incorporated with extended state observer (ESO), which is used to estimate the unknown disturbances. Then, the estimate is introduced into the control law to compensate for the disturbances. The design specifications of military rotorcraft are introduced to guide the controller design to achieve specified control performance. Considering the physical limitations, reference models are designed to shape the desired control responses. At last, several flight simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller. The results show that the proposed controller works well and Level 1 performance can be achieved.

AB This paper provides an overview of the progress Ifremer has made recently in fisheries acoustics and the study of small pelagic fish by: i) pushing observation frontiers using a range of platforms including an autonomous underwater vehicle, AUV, ii) developing measuring instruments and methods and iii) studying fish distributions. Presently, information from several frequencies of single-beam echosounders is routinely collected together with data from the ME70 multibeam echosounder. For onboard data acquisition control the HERMES software was developed. The new MOVIES 3D software includes modules for simultaneous realistic 3D visualisation and post-processing such as bottom detection, school extraction and calculation of descriptors and integration of all acoustic data. Several data analysis methods are being developed and some initial results are presented. Finally, results on the spatial distribution of small pelagic fish schools in the Bay of Biscay illustrate the role that acoustics can play, and are already playing, in the implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries.

AB We present, for the first time, an analysis of the error signatures captured during pulsed laser microprobe testing of high-speed digital SiGe logic circuits. 127-bit shift. registers, configured using various circuit level latch hardening schemes and incorporated into the circuit for radiation effects self test serve as the primary test vehicle. Our results indicate significant variations in the observed upset rate as a function of strike location and latch architecture. Error information gathered on the sensitive transistor nodes within the latches and characteristic upset durations agree well with recently reported heavy-ion microprobe data. These results support the growing credibility in using pulsed laser testing as a lower-cost alternative to heavy-ion microprobe analysis of sensitive device and circuit nodes, as well as demonstrate the efficiency of the autonomous detection and error approach for high speed bit-error rate testing. Implications for SEU hardening in SiGe are addressed and circuit-level and device-level Radiation Hardening By Design recommendations are made.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB A new method is presented to solve multi-objective multidisciplinary optimization (M-MDO) problems. This M-MDO method is applicable to multi-objective optimization problems that can be decomposed hierarchically into multi-objective subproblems and whose objective functions are either separable or additively separable. In the decomposition, the subproblems may have both common and unique objectives. The method uses a multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) to optimize the multi-objective subproblems; hence, it is referred to as a multi-objective multidisciplinary genetic algorithm (M-MGA). It is shown that for any Pareto point of the original (single-level) problem, M-MGA generates at least one point that is noninferior with respect to that Pareto point. Also a comparison is shown between the computational complexity of M-MGA and a single-level MOGA in terms of number of functions calls. The M-MGA is demonstrated by two engineering examples: the design of a speed reducer and the design of a payload for an undersea autonomous vehicle. In both examples, the generated solutions are similar to solutions generated by solving the examples as single-level problems. M-MGA produces relatively the same solutions from one M-MGA run to another.

TI Map-based free navigation for autonomous vehicles
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB A general method for the construction of a map-based navigation system is proposed, which is based on a Kalman filter and can be equipped with many commercially available navigation sensors. A prototype has been implemented using a laser rangefinder and a 2D model of the natural environment. No artificial landmarks are necessary. The computing rime required for matching the measurement data with the model elements is low and independent of the model size. This is achieved by precompiling the navigation map to form a lookup table. The classical Kalman filter algorithm is modified to take into account the different speeds of the absolute and relative sensors as well as the computing time of the algorithm itself. A systematic way is given to decouple the time when absolute measurement data ave taken from the time when these data are processed. Loss of track resulting from errors in the navigation map or incorrect dead reckoning is detected by comparing the real measurement data with on-line simulated measurement data. The on-fine simulation is performed in real time using the same lookup table which is utilized for the matching process. For industrial applications this self-supervision is an essential feature.

AB Consider a disaster scenario where search and rescue workers must search difficult to access buildings during an earthquake or flood. Often, finding survivors a few hours sooner results in a dramatic increase in saved lives, suggesting the use of drones for expedient rescue operations. Entropy can be used to quantify the generation and resolution of uncertainty. When searching for targets, maximizing mutual information of future sensor observations will minimize expected target location uncertainty by minimizing the entropy of the future estimate. Motion planning for multi-target autonomous search requires planning over an area with an imperfect sensor and may require multiple passes, which is hindered by the submodularity property of mutual information. Further, mission duration constraints must be handled accordingly, requiring consideration of the vehicle's dynamics to generate feasible trajectories and must plan trajectories spanning the entire mission duration, something which most information gathering algorithms are incapable of doing. If unanticipated changes occur in an uncertain environment, new plans must be generated quickly. In addition, planning multipass trajectories requires evaluating path dependent rewards, requiring planning in the space of all previously selected actions, compounding the problem. We present an anytime algorithm for autonomous multipass target search in natural environments. The algorithm is capable of generating long duration dynamically feasible multipass coverage plans that maximize mutual information using a variety of techniques such as E-admissible heuristics to speed up the search. To the authors' knowledge this is the first attempt at efficiently solving multipass target search problems of such long duration. The proposed algorithm is based on best first branch and bound and is benchmarked against state of the art algorithms adapted to the problem in natural Simplex environments, gathering the most information in the given search time.

AB Toxoplasma gondii, the causative agent of toxoplasmosis, is an obligate intracellular protozoan pathogen. The parasite invades and replicates within virtually any warm blooded vertebrate cell type. During parasite invasion of a host cell, the parasite creates a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that originates from the host cell membrane independent of phagocytosis within which the parasite replicates. While IFN-dependent-innate and cell mediated immunity is important for eventual control of infection, innate immune cells, including neutrophils, monocytes and dendritic cells, can also serve as vehicles for systemic dissemination of the parasite early in infection. An approach is described that utilizes the host innate immune response, in this case macrophages, in a forward genetic screen to identify parasite mutants with a fitness defect in infected macrophages following activation but normal invasion and replication in naive macrophages. Thus, the screen isolates parasite mutants that have a specific defect in their ability to resist the effects of macrophage activation. The paper describes two broad phenotypes of mutant parasites following activation of infected macrophages: parasite stasis versus parasite degradation, often in amorphous vacuoles. The parasite mutants are then analyzed to identify the responsible parasite genes specifically important for resistance to induced mediators of cell autonomous immunity. The paper presents a general approach for the forward genetics screen that, in theory, can be modified to target parasite genes important for resistance to specific antimicrobial mediators. It also describes an approach to evaluate the specific macrophage antimicrobial mediators to which the parasite mutant is susceptible. Activation of infected macrophages can also promote parasite differentiation from the tachyzoite to bradyzoite stage that maintains chronic infection. Therefore, methodology is presented to evaluate the importance of the identified parasite gene to establishment of chronic infection.

ID ROCKFALLS
AB The automation of heavy-duty machinery and vehicles used in underground mines is a growing tendency which requires addressing several challenges, such as the robust detection of rocks in the production areas of mines. For instance, human assistance must be requested when using autonomous LHD (Load-Haul-Dump) loaders in case rocks are too big to be loaded into the bucket. Also, in the case of autonomous rock breaking hammers, oversized rocks need to be identified and located, to then be broken in smaller sections. In this work, a novel approach called Rocky-CenterNet is proposed for detecting rocks. Unlike other object detectors, Rocky-CenterNet uses ellipses to enclose a rock's bounds, enabling a better description of the shape of the rocks than the classical approach based on bounding boxes. The performance of Rocky-CenterNet is compared with the one of CenterNet and Mask R-CNN, which use bounding boxes and segmentation masks, respectively. The comparisons were performed on two datasets: the Hammer-Rocks dataset (introduced in this work) and the Scaled Front View dataset. The Hammer-Rocks dataset was captured in an underground ore pass, while a rock-breaking hammer was operating. This dataset includes challenging conditions such as the presence of dust in the air and occluded rocks. The metrics considered are related to the quality of the detections and the processing times involved. From the results, it is shown that ellipses provide a better approximation of the rocks shapes' than bounding boxes. Moreover, when rocks are annotated using ellipses, Rocky-CenterNet offers the best performance while requiring shorter processing times than Mask-RCNN (4x faster). Thus, using ellipses to describe rocks is a reliable alternative. Both the datasets and the code are available for research purposes.

AB Every year, flood hits the world economy by billions of dollars, costs thousands of human and animal lives, destroys a vast area of land and crops, and displaces large populations from their homes. The flood affected require a time-critical help, and a delay may cause the loss of precious human lives. The ground rescue operations are difficult to carry out because of the unavailability of transport infrastructure. However, drones, Unmanned Vehicles, can easily navigate to the areas where road networks have been destroyed or become ineffective. The fleet participating in the rescue operation should have drones with different capabilities in order to make the efforts more successful. A majority of existing systems in the literature offered a centralized system for these drones. However, the performance of the existing system starts decreasing as the required number of tasks increases. This research is based on the hypothesis that a distributed intelligent method is more effective than the centralized technique for relief operations performed by multiple drones. The research aims to propose a distributed method that allows a fleet of drones with diverse capabilities to communicate and collaborate, so that the task completion rate of rescue operations could be increased. The proposed solution consists of three main modules: 1) communication and message transmission module that enables collaboration between drones, 2) realignment module that allows drones to negotiate and occupy the best position in the air to optimize the coverage area, 3) situation monitoring module that identifies the ground situation and acts accordingly. To validate the proposed solution, we have performed a simulation using AirSim simulator and compared the results with the centralized system. The proposed distributed method performed better than legacy systems. In the future, the work can be extended using reinforcement learning and other intelligent algorithms.

TI Moving Time UCAV Maneuver Decision Based on the Dynamic Relational

ID AUTONOMOUS AIR COMBAT; MAKING METHOD
AB To improve the accuracy and real-time performance of autonomous decision-making by the unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), a decision-making method combining the dynamic relational weight algorithm and moving time strategy is proposed, and trajectory prediction is added to maneuver decision-making. Considering the lack of continuity and diversity of air combat situation reflected by the constant weight in situation assessment, a dynamic relational weight algorithm is proposed to establish an air combat situation system and adjust the weight according to the current situation. Based on the dominance function, this method calculates the correlation degree of each subsituation and the total situation. According to the priority principle and information entropy theory, the hierarchical fitting function is proposed, the association expectation is calculated by using if-then rules, and the weight is dynamically adjusted. In trajectory prediction, the online sliding input module is introduced, and the long- and short-term memory (LSTM) network is used for real-time prediction. To further improve the prediction accuracy, the adaptive boosting (Ada) method is used to build the outer frame and compare with three traditional prediction networks. The results show that the prediction accuracy of Ada-LSTM is better. In the decision-making method, the moving time optimization strategy is adopted. To solve the problem of timeliness and optimization, each control variable is divided into 9 gradients, and there are 729 control schemes in the control sequence. Through contrast pursuit simulation experiments, it is verified that the maneuver decision method combining the dynamic relational weight algorithm and moving time strategy has a better accuracy and real-time performance. In the case of using prediction and not using prediction, the adaptive countermeasure simulation is carried out with the current more advanced Bayesian inference maneuvering decision-making scheme. The results show that the UCAV maneuvering decision-making ability combined with accurate prediction is better.

AB Passive acoustic monitoring techniques provide a useful alternative to visual surveys for monitoring of marine mammals since they are less affected by adverse weather conditions. An autonomous unmanned Wave Glider, equipped with a towed hydrophone and recording system was used to collect acoustic data in the Brazilian offshore waters of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean between 6 and 25 February 2016. Nearly continuous data were obtained during this period (light and dark hours) for the 750 km traveled. There were 165,130 high-frequency detections in 31 encounters, including 1789 whistles, 389 burst-pulse sounds, and 162,952 echolocation clicks. A total of 705 low-frequency tonal signals were recorded in 5 encounters. Although high-frequency detections occurred at all hours of the day, the majority occurred during dark hours. Low-frequency detections were not evenly spread through all hours of the day, with the majority of them occurring during dark hours. High-frequency and low-frequency detections represented 26% and 3% of the recording hours, respectively. Duration, the number of emissions, and ocean depth varied among acoustic encounters. Encounters composed by high-frequency sounds were separated into seven different groups, probably different species. One of the encounters presented whistles that were previously recorded in the Rio de Janeiro Coast for Steno bredanensis (Rough-toothed dolphins). All of the low-frequency encounters were composed of a type of Balaenoptera brydei (Bryde's whales) call. This type of data collection is un-precedented for the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean and highlighted the use of the sampled area by delphinids on different days and different times of the day, including the dark hours.

AB Mobility is a significant robotic task. It is the most important function when robotics is applied to domains such as autonomous cars, home service robots, and autonomous underwater vehicles. Despite extensive research on this topic, robots still suffer from difficulties when moving in complex environments, especially in practical applications. Therefore, the ability to have enough intelligence while moving is a key issue for the success of robots. Researchers have proposed a variety of methods and algorithms, including navigation and tracking. To help readers swiftly understand the recent advances in methodology and algorithms for robot movement, we present this survey, which provides a detailed review of the existing methods of navigation and tracking. In particular, this survey features a relation-based architecture that enables readers to easily grasp the key points of mobile intelligence. We first outline the key problems in robot systems and point out the relationship among robotics, navigation, and tracking. We then illustrate navigation using different sensors and the fusion methods and detail the state estimation and tracking models for target maneuvering. Finally, we address several issues of deep learning as well as the mobile intelligence of robots as suggested future research topics. The contributions of this survey are threefold. First, we review the literature of navigation according to the applied sensors and fusion method. Second, we detail the models for target maneuvering and the existing tracking based on estimation, such as the Kalman filter and its series developed form, according to their model-construction mechanisms: linear, nonlinear, and non-Gaussian white noise. Third, we illustrate the artificial intelligence approach-especially deep learning methods-and discuss its combination with the estimation method.

AB The existing ultrasonic obstacle avoidance robot only uses an ultrasonic sensor in the process of obstacle avoidance, which can only be avoided according to the fixed obstacle avoidance route. Obstacle avoidance cannot follow additional information. At the same time, existing robots rarely involve the obstacle avoidance strategy of avoiding pits. In this study, on the basis of ultrasonic sensor obstacle avoidance, visual information is added so the robot in the process of obstacle avoidance can refer to the direction indicated by road signs to avoid obstacles, at the same time, the study added an infrared ranging sensor, so the robot can avoid potholes. Aiming at this situation, this paper proposes an intelligent obstacle avoidance design of an autonomous mobile robot based on a multi-sensor in a multi-obstruction environment. A CascadeClassifier is used to train positive and negative samples for road signs with similar color and shape. A multi-sensor information fusion is used for path planning and the obstacle avoidance logic of the intelligent robot is designed to realize autonomous obstacle avoidance. The infrared sensor is used to obtain the environmental information of the ground depression on the wheel path, the ultrasonic sensor is used to obtain the distance information of the surrounding obstacles and road signs, and the information of the road signs obtained by the camera is processed by the computer and transmitted to the main controller. The environment information obtained is processed by the microprocessor and the control command is output to the execution unit. The feasibility of the design is verified by analyzing the distance acquired by the ultrasonic sensor, infrared distance measuring sensors, and the model obtained by training the sample of the road sign, as well as by experiments in the complex environment constructed manually.

AB In last years, automotive is pushing to the continuous development of more performing and less expensive measuring systems for supporting advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). In that scenario, light detection and rangings (LiDARs) are one of the key enabling technologies. This has led and will lead to the availability of more and more LiDAR systems and manufacturers. Given the relevance of the topic, in recent years, many studies and some national and international standards have been proposed or updated. However, such methods and standards are more focused on the analysis of the overall system performance and do not allow to investigate specific aspects of LiDAR systems. As an example, despite the relevance that spot size and divergence have on the evaluation of the performance of the LiDAR system, such parameters are not always, if ever, fully provided by LiDARs manufacturers and, to the best of our knowledge, no standard nor measurement method has been previously proposed for their analysis. In this article, we propose novel methods for the characterization and comparison of LiDAR systems with particular focus on the analysis of the spatiotemporal arrangement of beams spots, and beams divergences and profiles. The proposed method has been exploited for the analysis of the MRS1000 LiDAR system by Sick. The obtained results indicated that the MRS1000 simultaneously emits three spots triangularly arranged. As an example, at 6 m distance, such a triangle has a height of about approximate to 4 cm and a base that varies from approximate to 6 to approximate to 11 cm depending on the LiDAR settings.

AB An electromiographic (EMG)-based human-machine interface (HMI) is a communication pathway between a human and a machine that operates by means of the acquisition and processing of EMG signals. This article explores the use of EMG-based HMIs in the steering of farm tractors. An EPOC, a low-cost human-computer interface (HCI) from the Emotiv Company, was employed. This device, by means of 14 saline sensors, measures and processes EMG and electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from the scalp of the driver. In our tests, the HMI took into account only the detection of four trained muscular events on the driver's scalp: eyes looking to the right and jaw opened, eyes looking to the right and jaw closed, eyes looking to the left and jaw opened, and eyes looking to the left and jaw closed. The EMG-based HMI guidance was compared with manual guidance and with autonomous GPS guidance. A driver tested these three guidance systems along three different trajectories: a straight line, a step, and a circumference. The accuracy of the EMG-based HMI guidance was lower than the accuracy obtained by manual guidance, which was lower in turn than the accuracy obtained by the autonomous GPS guidance; the computed standard deviations of error to the desired trajectory in the straight line were 16 cm, 9 cm, and 4 cm, respectively. Since the standard deviation between the manual guidance and the EMG-based HMI guidance differed only 7 cm, and this difference is not relevant in agricultural steering, it can be concluded that it is possible to steer a tractor by an EMG-based HMI with almost the same accuracy as with manual steering.

TI Human-machine interfaces based on EMG and EEG applied to robotic systems
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Two different Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs) were developed, both based on electro-biological signals. One is based on the EMG signal and the other is based on the EEG signal. Two major features of such interfaces are their relatively simple data acquisition and processing systems, which need just a few hardware and software resources, so that they are, computationally and financially speaking, low cost solutions. Both interfaces were applied to robotic systems, and their performances are analyzed here. The EMG-based HMI was tested in a mobile robot, while the EEG-based HMI was tested in a mobile robot and a robotic manipulator as well.
   Results: Experiments using the EMG-based HMI were carried out by eight individuals, who were asked to accomplish ten eye blinks with each eye, in order to test the eye blink detection algorithm. An average rightness rate of about 95% reached by individuals with the ability to blink both eyes allowed to conclude that the system could be used to command devices. Experiments with EEG consisted of inviting 25 people ( some of them had suffered cases of meningitis and epilepsy) to test the system. All of them managed to deal with the HMI in only one training session. Most of them learnt how to use such HMI in less than 15 minutes. The minimum and maximum training times observed were 3 and 50 minutes, respectively.
   Conclusion: Such works are the initial parts of a system to help people with neuromotor diseases, including those with severe dysfunctions. The next steps are to convert a commercial wheelchair in an autonomous mobile vehicle; to implement the HMI onboard the autonomous wheelchair thus obtained to assist people with motor diseases, and to explore the potentiality of EEG signals, making the EEG-based HMI more robust and faster, aiming at using it to help individuals with severe motor dysfunctions.

AB In this paper, a concept of adaptive capture for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles(AUVs) using parallel mechanism with configurable platform is proposed. By leveraging the deformation ca-pabilities of the configurable platform, the mechanism can capture AUVs of various sizes and orientations while also expanding its workspace, thereby increasing the success rate of grasping. Firstly, the mechanism design is conducted, a novel parallel mechanism consisting of three identical chains with a three-fold symmetrical Bricard platform is proposed. Secondly, the ki-nematics are obtained, based on which the workspace analysis is performed, and numerical verification is conducted. Thirdly, the Jacobian matrix is derived and verified, and the singularity analysis is carried out. Finally, the concept of a high-quality workspace tailored for the AUVs recovery scenarios is proposed. To achieve a maximum high-quality workspace while maintaining a compact mechanism structure, two indicators are proposed to evaluate the volume and shape of the workspace, and a multi-objective parameter optimization of the mechanism is conducted. The optimized mechanism can be effortlessly scaled to cover the target workspace while preserving minimal dimensions and compact structure.

AB This article proposed an undersea simultaneous wireless power and data transfer system. It can achieve 1 Mb/s communication rate for autonomous underwater vehicles. DDQ coil was used to design an integrated magnetic coupling mechanism that decoupled the power channel from the data channel. In order to obtain 1 Mb/s communication rate in seawater, the frequency characteristics and eddy current loss of DDQ coil in seawater are studied. By establishing the steady-state and dynamic models of the data channel, the data gain and dynamic response time (DRT) of the amplitude shift keying modulation are accurately calculated. The influences of the parameters on data gain and DRT are analyzed in seawater, and the design procedure of system parameters is proposed. Finally, a 884 W prototype in seawater is built. The power transfer efficiency of the prototype is 94.3%, and the communication rate is up to 1 Mb/s. The experimental results prove the correctness of the theoretical analysis in this article.

AB The Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor has become essential to achieving a high level of autonomous driving functions, as well as a standard Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). LiDAR capabilities and signal repeatabilities under extreme weather conditions are of utmost concern in terms of the redundancy design of automotive sensor systems. In this paper, we demonstrate a performance test method for automotive LiDAR sensors that can be utilized in dynamic test scenarios. In order to measure the performance of a LiDAR sensor in a dynamic test scenario, we propose a spatio-temporal point segmentation algorithm that can separate a LiDAR signal of moving reference targets (car, square target, etc.), using an unsupervised clustering method. An automotive-graded LiDAR sensor is evaluated in four harsh environmental simulations, based on time-series environmental data of real road fleets in the USA, and four vehicle-level tests with dynamic test cases are conducted. Our test results showed that the performance of LiDAR sensors may be degraded, due to several environmental factors, such as sunlight, reflectivity of an object, cover contamination, and so on.

AB This article investigates the working principle of the inductive power transfer (IPT) system from the perspectives of electromagnetic field distribution. According to the limitations of frequency and transmission distance, it is proved in this paper that the IPT system works in the near field, where the energy density of the magnetic field is much stronger than that of the electric field. Therefore, only the magnetic field in the IPT system needs to be considered in approximate power analysis. The mutual inductance model of the IPT system is an approximate and simplified form of the electromagnetic field model. The complex form of the Poynting vector of the IPT system is integrated over an intermediate infinite plane of the two coils to reveal the power transfer characteristics including the active and reactive power. When the system is in full resonance, only active power is transferred without reactive power, which is consistent with the results obtained from the circuit model. This article is useful to provide an insight into the power flow and energy distribution of the IPT system.

AB Inspired by animals' long-distance migration behaviors, we proposed a novel and reliable long-distance true navigation method based on the measurement of geomagnetic fields. By establishing a 2-D gradient approaching a coordinate plane with geomagnetic intensity and inclination, long-distance true navigation can be achieved from any starting spot in this area. Without other calibration and auxiliary information, this navigation method is highly independent, which can be used in electromagnetic shielding circumstances, such as a deep ocean. The geomagnetic intensity and inclination gradients are estimated with real-time measurement of the geomagnetic field along the navigation trajectory. With estimated local gradients, a 2-D gradient approaching algorithm can be applied to predict the heading direction, and the agent can press on toward the destination step by step. Theoretical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations verified the feasibility and practicality of this method, proving its robustness in the presence of interference and different measurement errors. It can be a promising candidate in the design of navigation systems used in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) or platforms.

AB Digitalisation of urban metabolism circularity provides policymakers, urban managers, planners and administrators with a useful tool for identifying, controlling and evaluating a wide range of data concerning the flows of social, environmental and economic resources. This approach is based on the crucial role of fixed and mobile digital infrastructures such as real-time monitoring stations, GPS tracking sensors, augmented reality, virtual sharing platforms, social media dashboards, smart grids, and the like in the development and strengthening of the quality and efficiency of the circularity of resources. For these reasons, the integration of digital technologies in mobility, waste, water and wastewater management, energy efficiency, safety, and so on, represents a crucial aspect for cities involved in the circularity of their urban metabolism. Through a systematic literature review and case study approaches, the analysis disclose a wide-range of initiatives adopted by several European circular cities that optimise the circularity of urban metabolic flows, and contributes to the efforts in increasing understanding and awareness of the digitalisation driven by the urban metabolism circularity.

TI Transepistemic abduction: reasoning across epistemic domains

DE Transepistemic abduction; transdisciplinary reasoning; epistemology
ID ECO-COGNITIVE MODEL; LOGIC
AB Frequently people draw on different domains of knowledge to reach a conclusion that seems reasonable despite being difficult to justify from the perspective of a single domain. For example, there appears to be no reason for ethics to involve mathematics, nor is there a mechanism in mathematics to embrace moral questions; however, both ethics and mathematics are likely to be involved in resolving questions about how an autonomous vehicle should make decisions in a social context. In this paper, we present a specialized mode of reasoning, transepistemic abduction (TeA), which establishes how two agents, in order to satisfactorily explain a phenomenon, reason across two epistemic domains despite each agent being ignorant of the other's domain knowledge.
   We formalize TeA with epistemic logic and provide a naturalized example that brings together a psychosocial agent and a computational agent for the analysis of subjective text. We find that interaction between agents is critical to the process of TeA and that there are limits to the formalization while remaining true to naturalized reasoning. We conclude with some important implications of these findings for future work in this area.

AB Human behavior prediction models enable robots to anticipate how humans may react to their actions, and hence are instrumental to devising safe and proactive robot planning algorithms. However, modeling complex interaction dynamics and capturing the possibility of many possible outcomes in such interactive settings is very challenging, which has recently prompted the study of several different approaches. In this work, we provide a self-contained tutorial on a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) approach to human behavior prediction which, at its core, can produce a multimodal probability distribution over future human trajectories conditioned on past interactions and candidate robot future actions. Specifically, the goals of this tutorial paper are to review and build a taxonomy of state-of-the-art methods in human behavior prediction, from physics-based to purely data-driven methods, provide a rigorous yet easily accessible description of a data-driven, CVAE-based approach, highlight important design characteristics that make this an attractive model to use in the context of model-based planning for human-robot interactions, and provide important design considerations when using this class of models.

ID SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION
AB In this paper, an adaptive unscented Kalman filter (AUKF) algorithm is applied to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), based on adaptation of a scaling parameter. The scaling parameter is a design parameter in the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which can improve the quality of the approximation. An adaptive method is designed to find the suitable value for the scaling parameter to improve the accuracy of estimation. It is demonstrated that the proposed methodology significantly reduces the state estimation error and improves the navigation accuracy of an autonomous vehicle. Also, it is highlighted that the computational cost is not much affected by increasing the number of observations, especially in the SLAM application in which the number of landmarks is growing through estimation. A comparison between UKF and AUKF algorithms is also provided for the SLAM application. The efficiency and the robustness of the proposed algorithm are investigated by applying noise of different orders in simulation results. In addition, non-credibility indices are used to compare the relative performance of AUKF and UKF. The results illustrate that AUKF-SLAM is more accurate than UKF-SLAM.

DT Editorial Material
AB Multimedia research has long moved beyond laboratory experiments and is being rapidly deployed in real-life applications including advertisements, search, security, automated driving, and healthcare. Hence, the developed algorithms now have a direct impact on the individuals using the above mentioned services and the society as a whole. While there is a huge potential to benefit the society using such technologies, there is also an urgent need to identify the checks and balances to ensure that the impact of such technologies is ethical and positive. For instance, if the multimedia technologies are being used to detect and protect pedestrians from accidents by autonomous vehicles, then the pedestrian detection performance needs to be equitable across demographic descriptors, such as gender and race of the pedestrians. Similarly, while logs of driving behaviors are important in many applications, making such information available to corporate entities and third parties could raise important privacy challenges. This position article aims to: first, increase the awareness of such concepts and existing legal constraints in the multimedia research community, second, initiate a discussion on community guidelines on how to conduct multimedia research in a lawful and ethical manner, and third, identify some important research directions to support a vision of lawful and ethical multimedia research.

AB Multi-object tracking (MOT) plays a crucial role in various platforms. Occlusion and insertion among targets, complex backgrounds and higher real-time requirements increase the difficulty of MOT problems. Most state-of-the-art MOT approaches adopt the tracking-by-detection strategy, which relies on compute-intensive sliding windows or anchoring schemes to detect matching targets or candidates in each frame. In this work, we introduce a more efficient and effective spatial-temporal attention scheme to track multiple objects in various scenarios. Using a semantic-feature-based spatial attention mechanism and a novel Motion Model, we address the insertion and location of candidates. Some online-learned target-specific convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were used to estimate target occlusion and classify by adapting the appearance model. A temporal attention mechanism was adopted to update the online module by balancing current and history frames. Extensive experiments were performed on Karlsruhe Institute of Technologyand Toyota Technological Institute (KITTI) benchmarks and an Armored Target Tracking Dataset (ATTD) built for ground-armored targets. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieved outstanding tracking performance and met the actual application requirements.

AB This study deals with the autonomous evasive maneuver strategy of unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV), which is threatened by a high-performance beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missile (AAM). Considering tactical demands of achieving self-conflicting evasive objectives in actual air combat, including higher miss distance, less energy consumption and longer guidance support time, the evasive maneuver problem in BVR air combat is defined and reformulated into a multi-objective optimization problem. Effective maneuvers of UCAV used in different evasion phases are modeled in three-dimensional space. Then the three-level decision space structure is established according to qualitative evasive tactical planning. A hierarchical multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (HMOEA) is designed to find the approximate Pareto-optimal solutions of the problem. The approach combines qualitative tactical experience and quantitative maneuver decision optimization method effectively. Simulations are used to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach. The results show that the obtained set of decision variables constitutes nondominated solutions, which can meet different evasive tactical requirements of UCAV while ensuring successful evasion.

AB A novel statistical model is presented to quantify situation awareness in the operation of small civilian Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). Today, the vast majority of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) operation takes place under Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) of a human operator, who is wholly responsible for the safety of the flight. As operation begins to move to Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS), it is likely that this responsibility will become shared between operator and the increasingly autonomous UAS itself. Before we seek to quantify the safety of such a system, it is beneficial to analyse the safety of existing Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) operations to provide a target level of safety. Prior to considering any on-board decision making, it is essential to ensure that the artificial situation awareness system of a UAS in Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) is at least as good as awareness of a human operator. The paper provides a probabilistic theory and model for the high-level abstractions of situation awareness to guide future assessment of BVLOS operations.

AB A new algorithm, called rapidly exploring random tree of trees (RRTOT) is proposed, that aims to address the challenge of planning for autonomous structural inspection. Given a representation of a structure, a visibility model of an onboard sensor, an initial robot configuration and constraints, RRTOT computes inspection paths that provide full coverage. Sampling based techniques and a meta-tree structure consisting of multiple RRT* trees are employed to find admissible paths with decreasing cost. Using this approach, RRTOT does not suffer from the limitations of strategies that separate the inspection path planning problem into that of finding the minimum set of observation points and only afterwards compute the best possible path among them. Analysis is provided on the capability of RRTOT to find admissible solutions that, in the limit case, approach the optimal one. The algorithm is evaluated in both simulation and experimental studies. An unmanned rotorcraft equipped with a vision sensor was utilized as the experimental platform and validation of the achieved inspection properties was performed using 3D reconstruction techniques.

AB Type-2 Fuzzy Logic has emerged recently in Artificial Intelligence as a promising technique in control and decision making. According to the literature, type-2 fuzzy logic controllers (FLC) have been successfully applied in several applications. However, the big complexity in conceiving a controller consists fundamentally in fixing the membership functions of the fuzzy parameters, specifically on how to fix the footprint of uncertainties associated to antecedent and consequent parts, which depends strongly on the current used application. In the case of real-robot navigation, modelling a fuzzy controller is quite tricky, given the presence of several types of uncertainties. In addition, at the level of autonomous navigation, several challenges may arise : how to carefully avoid obstacles, keep the vehicle safe, avoid slipping and most importantly reach the target. In this paper, we proposed an adaptive learning type-2 FLC for a robot navigation. From an initial space which represents a feasible solution, we used the PSO to find a smooth solution with less oscillations. The designed structure achieved good performance shown in the "iRobot Create" robot.

AB Weed control is a basic agricultural practice, typically achieved through herbicides and mechanical weeders. Because of the negative environmental impacts of these tools, alternative solutions are being developed and adopted worldwide. Following recent technical developments, an autonomous laser-based weeding system (ALWS) now offers a possible solution for sustainable weed control. However, beyond recent proof of performance, little is known about the adoption potential of such a system. This study assesses the adoption potential of ALWS, using a mixed-method approach. First, six macro-environmental factors regarding the adoption of ALWS were determined. This assessment is referred to as a Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental (PESTLE) analysis and is conducted in a form of a literature review initiated by expert consultations. Second, a range of European stakeholders' perceptions of ALWS was evaluated in four focus-group discussions (n = 55), using a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats (SWOT) analysis. The factors identified in the PESTLE and SWOT analyses were subsequently merged to provide a comprehensive overview of the adoption potential of ALWS. Labour reduction, precision treatment and environmental sustainability were found to be the most important advantages of ALWS. High costs and performance uncertainty were identified as the main weaknesses. To promote the adoption of ALWS, this study recommends the following: (1) Concrete performance results, both technical and economic, should be communicated to farmers. (2) Farmers' knowledge of precision agriculture should be improved. (3) Advantage should be taken of policies that are favourable towards non-chemical methods and the high demand for organic products. This article also extensively discusses regulatory barriers, the risks posed to the safety of both humans and the machines involved, technological challenges and requirements, and policy recommendations related to ALWS adoption.

AB This article presents a trajectory planning method for autonomous surface vessels that is compliant with Rule 8 and rules 13-17 from the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). The method is suitable for operation in restricted waters, where it both handles collision avoidance with static obstacles, and also considers the available room to maneuver when determining the appropriate safe distance to other vessels. The trajectory planner is formulated as a finite-horizon nonlinear model predictive controller, minimizing the deviation from a reference trajectory and the acceleration. Collision avoidance with static obstacles is included through the use of convex free sets. Collision avoidance with other traffic is done by assigning so-called target ship domains to each vessel, and formulating constraints for that domain. COLREGs rules 13-15 and 17 are included by first classifying each vessel-to-vessel encounter to find which rule applies, and subsequently assigning an encounter-specific domain to the opposing vessel. The domain is designed so that if the trajectory does not violate the domain, compliance with COLREGs rules 13-15 and partial compliance with Rule 17 is ensured. Furthermore, compliance with COLREGs Rule 8 and Rule 16 is included through a novel method for calculating the objective function cost-gains. By constructing windows of reduced tracking error and acceleration cost, the start time, duration and magnitude of a maneuver can be controlled, and hence readily apparent maneuvers made in ample time can be facilitated. The method's effectiveness and its completeness in terms of COLREGs compliance is demonstrated through an extensive set of simulations of vessel-to-vessel encounters in open waters. Furthermore, the robustness of the method is demonstrated through a set of complex simulations in confined areas with several maneuvering vessels. In all simulations, the method demonstrates compliance with COLREGs Rule 8 and rules 13-17.

AB Automated Mobility on Demand (AMoD) is a concept that has recently generated much discussion. In cases where large-scale adoption of an automated taxi service is anticipated, the service's impacts may become relevant to key transport system metrics, and thus to transport planners and policy-makers as well. In light of this increasingly important question, this paper presents an agent-based transport simulation with (single passenger) AMoD. In contrast to earlier studies, all scenario data (including demand patterns, cost assumptions and customer behaviour) is obtained for one specific area, the city of Zurich, Switzerland. The simulation study fuses information from a detailed bottom-up cost analysis of mobility services in Switzerland, a specifically tailored Stated-Preferences survey about automated mobility services conducted in the canton of Zurich, and a detailed agent-based transport simulation for the city, based on MATSim. Methodologically, a comprehensive approach is presented that iteratively runs these components to derive states in which service cost, waiting times and demand are in equilibrium for a cost-covering AMoD operator with predefined fleet size. For Zurich, several cases are examined, with 4,000 AMoD vehicles leading to the maximum demand of around 150,000 requests per day that can be attracted by the system. Within these parameters, the simulation results show that customers are willing to accept average waiting times of around 4 min at a price of 0.75 CHF/km. Further cost covering cases with lower demand are presented, where either smaller fleet sizes lead to higher waiting times, or larger fleet sizes lead to higher costs. While our simulations indicate that an AMoD system in Zurich can bring benefits to the users, they show that the system impact is largely negative. Caused by modal shifts, our simulations show an increase of driven distance of up to 100%. All examined fleet configurations of the unregulated, cost-covering, single-passenger, door-to-door AMoD service are found to be highly counter-productive on a path towards a more shared and active transport system. Accordingly, policy recommendations for regulation are discussed.

AB Drones are unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) utilized for a broad range of functions, including delivery, aerial surveillance, traffic monitoring, architecture monitoring, and even War-field. Drones confront significant obstacles while navigating independently in complex and highly dynamic environments. Moreover, the targeted objects within a dynamic environment have irregular morphology, occlusion, and minor contrast variation with the background. In this regard, a novel deep Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) based data-driven strategy is proposed for drone navigation in the complex and dynamic environment. The proposed Drone Split-Transform-and-Merge Region-and-Edge (Drone-STM-RENet) CNN is comprised of convolutional blocks where each block methodically implements region and edge operations to preserve a diverse set of targeted properties at multi-levels, especially in the congested environment. In each block, the systematic implementation of the average and max-pooling operations can deal with the region homogeneity and edge properties. Additionally, these convolutional blocks are merged at a multi-level to learn texture variation that efficiently discriminates the target from the background and helps obstacle avoidance. Finally, the Drone-STM-RENet generates steering angle and collision probability for each input image to control the drone moving while avoiding hindrances and allowing the UAV to spot risky situations and respond quickly, respectively. The proposed Drone-STM-RENet has been validated on two urban cars and bicycles datasets: udacity and collision-sequence, and achieved considerable performance in terms of explained variance (0.99), recall (95.47%), accuracy (96.26%), and F-score (91.95%). The promising performance of Drone-STM-RENet on urban road datasets suggests that the proposed model is generalizable and can be deployed for real-time autonomous drones navigation and real-world flights.

AB For many years, the use of new computer systems to control various elements of everyday human life has been observed. Separate systems manage access control; others are used to control blinds and roller shutters; and others manage systems in the garden. Many of these systems can be integrated using available systems. This paper presents an example of an access control management system based on the Raspberry Pi microcomputer and shows an analysis of its performance, accuracy, and possibility of improvement. This study used official devices manufactured by the Raspberry Pi Foundation; however, it is possible to create a similar system with custom parts. This project used open-source software. The authors argued that it is possible to create an autonomous vehicle access control system using microcomputers and optical character recognition technology. Using simple devices, the plate recognition system was built and tested, proving the thesis that it is possible to build an access control system using available devices. This also confirms the thesis that microcomputers can be used to control other systems in the human environment.

AB Depth and surface normal estimations are important for 3D geometric perception, which has numer-ous applications including autonomous vehicles and robots. In this paper, we propose a lightweight Multi-stage Information Diffusion Network (MIDNet) for the simultaneous prediction of depth and sur-face normals from a single RGB image. To obtain semantic and detail-preserving features, we adopt a high-resolution network as our backbone to learn multi-scale features, which are then fused into shared features for the two tasks. To mutually boost each task, a Cross-Correlation Attention Module (CCAM) is proposed to adaptively integrate information for the prediction of the two tasks in multiple stages, in-cluding feature-level information interaction and task-level information interaction. Ablation studies show that the proposed multi-stage information diffusion strategy can boost the performance gain for the two tasks at different levels. Compared to current state-of-the-art methods on the NYU Depth V2, Stanford 2D-3D-Semantic and KITTI datasets, our method achieves superior performance for both monocular depth and surface normal estimation.

AB Risk assessment and collision avoidance are extremely important for the safe navigation of surface ships. In this paper, we propose a regulation aware dynamic path planning method based on uncertain velocity obstacles for intelligent ships. Specifically, we first use the fuzzy logic theory to evaluate the real-time collision risk of the own ship. Based on the closest point of approach criterion, considering the influences of the relative bearing, the distance, and ship speed ratio, the collision risk is used to activate the path planning process. Moreover, we consider the various ship encountering scenarios including crossing, overtaking and head-on. To deal with the uncertainties in the target ship information, the relative cone angle of the traditional velocity obstacles are systematically expanded using a robust tube idea. The reachable velocity set of the own ship is accordingly divided into three subsets that meet the rules specified by COLREGs in crossing, overtaking and head-on scenarios. Real automatic identification system (AIS) data in an area of the Yangtze River in Wuhan, China, is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

ID TRACKING
AB Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is widely used in the perception of physical environment to complete object detection and tracking tasks. The current methods and datasets are mainly developed for autonomous vehicles, which could not be directly used for roadside perception. This paper presents a 3D point cloud stitching method for object detection with wide horizontal field of view (FoV) using roadside LiDAR. Firstly, the base detection model is trained by KITTI dataset and has achieved detection accuracy of 88.94. Then, a new detection range of 180 degrees can be inferred to break the limitation of camera's FoV. Finally, multiple sets of detection results from a single LiDAR are stitched to build a 360 degrees detection range and solve the problem of overlapping objects. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been evaluated using KITTI dataset and collected point clouds. The experimental results show that the point cloud stitching method offers a cost-effective solution to achieve a larger FoV, and the number of output objects has increased by 77.15% more than the base model, which improves the detection performance of roadside LiDAR.

TI DSVN: A Flexible and Secure Data-Sharing Model for VANET Based on

DE VANET; data sharing; CP-ABE; blockchain; attribute revocation
AB Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) is an important part of the modern intelligent transportation system, which can provide vehicle communication at a certain distance. More importantly, VANET can provide route planning and autonomous driving for drivers by analyzing data. However, VANET's data privacy and security are a huge challenge when serving drivers. In this paper, we propose a VANET data-sharing model (DSVN) that combines ciphertext-based attribute encryption (CP-ABE), blockchain, and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). DSVN uses an outsourced and revocable ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (ORCP-ABE) scheme, which is improved based on CP-ABE. ORCP-ABE uses key encryption key (KEK) trees to manage user attribute groups and revoke user-level attributes. It eliminates redundant attributes in the access policy by attribute-weighted access trees. Moreover, DSVN has no single point of failure. We demonstrate the indistinguishability under the chosen-plaintext attack (IND-CPA) security of DSVN by a game based on the computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption. Experimental results show that DSVN can store and share data with low overhead. Additionally, it can revoke attributes of users safely.

AB Compact and low-power CMOS-compatible hardware can be used for on-chip optical neural networks (ONNs), enabling affordable and portable image classification solutions for applications like autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and optical communication. In this work, we propose a novel one-dimensional Optical Convolutional Neural Network (OCNN) architecture that significantly reduces the number of learnable parameters required for an ONN. Our OCNN achieves an impressive accuracy of over 96% as a pattern classifier, utilizing only 90 learnable parameters, leading to a simpler structure compared to existing on-chip ONNs. Additionally, our OCNN demonstrates scalability and robustness, with an accuracy exceeding 89% in handwritten digit classification. The OCNN's convolutional layer employs a lenslet 4f system for convolving desired kernels on input images, while an on-chip lens facilitates the desired Fourier Transform effortlessly. The subsequent layer consists of a single metaline layer, implementing a fully connected layer. By parallelizing pre-trained OCNNs, an on-chip deep convolutional neural network (CNN) can be realized, where each OCNN functions as a separate kernel within a conventional CNN.

AB Pedestrian flow models contribute to the effective design and operation of pedestrian spaces. In real traffic, pedestrians usually adjust their walking state in the movement procession according to perceptual information. Subject to the human capability, certain errors would exist between the perceptual information and the real traffic information, which can greatly affect the pedestrian flow performance. This paper proposes a bidirectional pedestrian flow model considering the effect of perceived uncertainty of preceding pedestrian information. In the linear and nonlinear stability analysis, we derive the stability criterion and modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation of the proposed model. The kink-antikink solitary wave solution can be acquired via solving the above mKdV equations, which provides insight into the essential property of the formation and propagation of traffic jams near the neutral stability curve. Numerical examples demonstrate that the uncertainty terms and the perception time of pedestrians directly affect the pedestrian congestion. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The relationship between polymetallic nodules (Mn nodules) and deep-sea stratigraphy is relatively poorly studied and the role of sediment thickness in determining nodule occurrence is an active field of research. This study utilizes geophysical observations from three types of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) data (multibeam bathymetry, sub-bottom profiles and underwater photography) in order to assess this relationship. Multibeam bathymetry was processed with a pattern recognition approach for producing objective geomorphometric classes of the seafloor for examining their relation to sediment thickness and nodule occurrence. Sub-bottom profiles were used for extracting sediment thickness along a dense network of tracklines. Close-range AUVphotography data was used for automated counting of polymetallic nodules and their geometric features and it served as ground truth data. It was observed that higher nodule occurrence were related to layers with increased sediment thickness. This evidence reveals the role of local seafloor heterogeneity in nodule formation and suggests that unique patterns of local stratigraphy may affect geochemical processes that promote polymetallic nodule development at local scales.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB In this article, we investigated the efficiency of a magnetic resonant wireless power transfer (MR-WPT) in conducting medium and found out an optimal frequency for designing the system. In conducting environment, the eddy current loss is generated by the high-frequency alternating currents in the coils. It is manifested by increased radiation resistance of resonator coil leads to decrease the quality factor (Q-factor), which reduces the wireless power transfer (WPT) efficiency in conducting medium. The Q-factor of the resonator coil strongly depending on the conductivity, frequency, and thickness of conducting block. Two MR-WPT systems operating at 10.0 MHz and 20.0 MHz are implemented to study the effect of conducting medium on efficiency. The achieved results indicated that the 20.0 MHz system has higher efficiency at a conductivity smaller than 6.0 S/m. However, at the larger conductivity, the 10.0 MHz system is more efficient. The results provide a method to determine the optimal frequency of a WPT system operating in the conducting medium with various conductivities and thickness blocks. This method can be used to design MR-WPT systems in numerous situations, such as autonomous underwater vehicles and medical implants.

TI A Model of Ridesourcing Demand Generation and Distribution
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
ID TRAVEL
AB Ridesourcing has experienced exponential growth in recent years, yet its impact on individual travel are unclear and have not been adequately examined. Recently, an Austin-based ridesourcing company released a large dataset containing disaggregate trip-level information. In this research, we use this new dataset in tandem with several publicly available data sources to estimate two models: a spatially lagged multivariate count model, which is used to describe how many trips are generated in a specific zone on both weekdays and weekend days; and a fractional split model, which helps us identify the characteristics of zones that attract ridesourcing trips. Our results show spatial dependence in ridesourcing trips among proximally located zones, as well as correlation between weekday and weekend day trips originating in a zone. Another interesting finding is the identification of a possible substitution effect between ridesourcing and transit use for weekday trips. Moreover, our results suggest that different income segments in the population may use ridesourcing for different activity purposes. From a travel behavior researcher perspective, the results in this paper identify aggregate area-level variables impacting ridesourcing, which can guide future efforts to better understand the demand for ridesourcing as well as the demand for autonomous and connected vehicles.

AB Effective extraction of road boundaries plays a significant role in intelligent transportation applications, including autonomous driving, vehicle navigation, and mapping. This paper presents a new method to automatically extract 3-D road boundaries from mobile laser scanning (MLS) data. The proposed method includes two main stages: supervoxel generation and 3-D road boundary extraction. Supervoxels are generated by selecting smooth points as seeds and assigning points into facets centered on these seeds using several attributes (e.g., geometric, intensity, and spatial distance). 3-D road boundaries are then extracted using the a-shape algorithm and the graph cuts-based energy minimization algorithm. The proposed method was tested on two data sets acquired by a RIEGL VMX-450 MLS system. Experimental results show that road boundaries can be robustly extracted with an average completeness over 95%, an average correctness over 98%, and an average quality over 94% on two data sets. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods is demonstrated.

AB Target localization, which aims to estimate the location of an unknown target, is one of the key issues in applications of underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs). However, the resource-constrained property of an underwater environment such as noise makes target localization a challenging problem. This paper considers a consensus estimation-based approach to the target localization problem in UASNs. To detect and acquire the position of the target, a hybrid architecture is applied to UASNs, where autonomous underwater vehicles provide self-location and clock synchronization for sensor nodes. Built on this architecture, a trilateration method coupled with a regional optimal solution is provided to estimate the rough localization of a target. Furthermore, a consensus estimation-based algorithm is designed for the regional optimal solution, such that localization accuracy is improved. In the presence of measurement and communication noises, localization error and asymptotic unbiasedness for the estimation algorithm are also investigated. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed localization approach can avoid the occurrence of no-solution while improving the localization accuracy. In addition, the hybrid communication architecture can reduce the number of transmissions compared with egalitarian decentralized networks. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper tackles the development of distributed control reconfiguration and fault accommodation strategies for consensus achievement in multiagent systems in the presence of faulty agents whose actuators are unable to produce their nominal control efforts. A faulty agent can adversely affect and prevent the team from reaching agreement and lead to catastrophic mission performance degradations. To ensure that the faulty team pursues its consensus objectives, in this paper, on-line distributed control reconfiguration strategies are developed that employ only nearest neighbor information to guarantee the team consensus while minimizing a local cost performance index. Toward the above end, the distributed Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations for the faulty agent are derived and novel reconfigured controllers are designed by solving the above equations subject to the faulty agent dynamics and network structure constraints to ensure fault accommodation of the entire team. Our proposed reconfigurable controllers are applied to a network of autonomous underwater vehicles subject to actuator faults to demonstrate and illustrate the effectiveness and capabilities of our proposed fault recovery control strategies.

AB This paper investigates the hydrodynamics issues that are associated with AUVs (autonomous underwater vehicles) as they approach a cone-shaped dock, which is proposed by most AUV docking systems for the AUV's protection and simplification. However, this docking system is more sensitive to the hydrodynamic interactions between the dock and the ocean currents. The purpose is to exploit the hydrodynamic susceptibility in AUV docking with the dock and to identify a probable design for AUV control during docking. To achieve this purpose, numerical simulations of an AUV docking with a dock are conducted based on the dynamic mesh method. This paper illustrates the numerical methodology for AUV docking simulation. To increase the accuracy of the numerical simulation, turbulence models and grid-dependence problems are first studied. Then, 3D (three-dimensional) numerical simulations show the dependence of the AUV fluid forces near the dock on various velocities, accelerations, dock shapes, gliding modes, cross currents from several directions and rudder angles. The hydrodynamic behaviors of an AUV docking with a dock are obtained, which provide helpful suggestions for successful docking. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The requirement that mobile robots become independent of external sensors, such as GPS, and are able to navigate in an environment by themselves, means that designers have few alternative techniques available. An increasingly popular approach is to use computer vision as a source of information about the surroundings. This paper presents an implementation of computer vision to hold a quadrocopter aircraft in a stable hovering position using a low-cost, consumer-grade, video system. However, such a system is not able to stabilize the aircraft on its own and must rely on a data-fusion algorithm that uses additional measurements from on-board inertial sensors. Special techniques had to be implemented to compensate for the increased delay in the closed-loop system with the computer vision system, i.e., video timestamping to determine the exact delay of the vision system and a slight modification of the Kalman filter to account for this delay. At the end, the validation results of the proposed filtering technique are presented along with the results of an autonomous flight as a proof of the proposed concept.

ID SUBBAND
AB Recent advances in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and underwater communication technology have promoted a surge of research activity within the area of signal and information processing. A new application is proposed herein for capturing and processing underwater video onboard an untethered AW, then transmitting it to a remote platform using acoustic telemetry. Since video communication requires a considerably larger bandwidth than that provided by an underwater acoustic channel, the data must be massively compressed prior to transmission from the AUV. Past research has shown that the low contrast and low-detailed nature of underwater imagery allows for low-bit-rate coding of the data by wavelet-based image-coding algorithms. In this work, these findings have been extended to the design of a wavelet-based hybrid video encoder which employs entropy-constrained vector quantization (ECVQ) with overlapped block-based motion compensation. The ECVQ codebooks were designed from a statistical source model which describes the distribution of high subband wavelet coefficients in both intraframe and prediction error images. Results indicate that good visual quality can be achieved for very low bit-rate coding of underwater video with our algorithm.

AB Research has recently grown on multi-agent systems (MAS) and their coordination and secure cooperative control, for example in the field of edge-cloud computing. MAS offers robustness and flexibility compared to centralized systems by distributing control across decentralized agents, allowing the system to adapt and scale without overhaul. The collective behavior emerging from agent interactions can solve complex tasks beyond individual capabilities. However, controlling high-order nonlinear MAS with unknown dynamics raises challenges. This paper proposes an enhanced genetic algorithm strategy to enhance secure cooperative control performance. An efficient encoding method, adaptive decoding schemes, and heuristic initialization are introduced. These innovations enable compelling exploration of the solution space and accelerate convergence. Individual enhancement via load balancing, communication avoidance, and iterative refinement intensifies local search. Simulations demonstrate superior performance over conventional algorithms for complex control problems with uncertainty. The proposed method promises robust, efficient, and consistent solutions by adapting to find optimal points and exploiting promising areas in the space. This has implications for securely controlling real-world MAS across domains like robotics, power systems, and autonomous vehicles.

AB Semantic segmentation finds wide-ranging applications and stands as a crucial task in the realm of computer vision. It holds significant implications for scene comprehension and decision-making in unmanned systems, including domains such as autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles, robotics, and healthcare. Consequently, there is a growing demand for high precision in semantic segmentation, particularly for these contents. This paper introduces DPNet, a novel image semantic segmentation method based on the Deeplabv3 plus architecture. (1) DPNet utilizes ResNet-50 as the backbone network to extract feature maps at various scales. (2) Our proposed method employs the BiFPN (Bi-directional Feature Pyramid Network) structure to fuse multi-scale information, in conjunction with the ASPP (Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling) module, to handle information at different scales, forming a dual pyramid structure that fully leverages the effective features obtained from the backbone network. (3) The Shuffle Attention module is employed in our approach to suppress the propagation of irrelevant information and enhance the representation of relevant features. Experimental evaluations on the Cityscapes dataset and the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms current approaches, showcasing superior semantic segmentation accuracy.

AB In this work, we address the single robot navigation problem within a planar and arbitrarily connected workspace. In particular, we present an algorithm that transforms any static, compact, planar workspace of arbitrary connectedness and shape to a disk, where the navigation problem can be easily solved. Our solution benefits from the fact that it only requires a fine representation of the workspace boundary (i.e., a set of points), which is easily obtained in practice via SLAM. The proposed transformation, combined with a workspace decomposition strategy that reduces the computational complexity, has been exhaustively tested and has shown excellent performance in complex workspaces. A motion control scheme is also provided for the class of non-holonomic robots with unicycle kinematics, which are commonly used in most industrial applications. Moreover, the tuning of the underlying control parameters is rather straightforward as it affects only the shape of the resulted trajectories and not the critical specifications of collision avoidance and convergence to the goal position. Finally, we validate the efficacy of the proposed navigation strategy via extensive simulations and experimental studies.

AB Hyperspectral data classification is one of the fundamental problems in remote sensing. Several algorithms based on supervised machine learning have been proposed to address it. The performance, however, of the proposed algorithms is inherently dependent on the amount and quality of annotated data. Due to recent advances in hyperspectral imaging and autonomous (unmanned) aerial vehicles collecting new hyperspectral data is an easy task. Annotating those data, however, is a tedious, time-consuming and costly task requiring the in-situ presence of human experts. One way to loosen the requirement of a large number of annotated data is the shift to semi-supervised learning combined with highly sample-efficient tensor-based neural networks. This study provides a comprehensive experimental analysis of the performance of a variety of graph-based semi-supervised learning techniques combined with tensor-based neural network embeddings for the problem of hyperspectral data classification. Experimental results suggest that the combination of tensor-based neural network embeddings with graph-based semi-supervised learning can significantly improve the classification results minimizing human annotation effort.

ID BEHAVIORAL ADAPTATION; TASK; EEG; PERFORMANCE; FATIGUE; SYSTEMS
AB As automated vehicles become more common, there is a need for precise measurement and definition of when and in what ways a driver can use a mobile phone in L2 autonomous driving mode, for how long it can be used, the complexity of the call content, and the accumulated mental workload. This study uses a 2 (driving mode) x 2 (call content complexity) x 6 (driving stage) three-factor mixed experimental design to investigate the effect of these factors on the driver's mental workload by measuring the driver's performance on Detection response tasks, pupil diameter, and EEG components in various brain regions in the alpha band. The results showed that drivers' mental workload levels converge between manual and automatic driving modes as the duration of driving increases, regardless of the level of complexity of the mobile phone conversation. This suggests that mobile phone conversations can also disrupt the driver's cognitive resource balance in L2 automatic driving mode, as it increases mental workload while also impairing the normal functioning of brain functions such as cognitive control, problem solving, and judgment, thereby compromising driving safety.

ID SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION
AB This research is inspired by the challenge of providing situational awareness to a ship looking for leads in the ice to navigate the Canadian Arctic. To address this challenge, this paper proposes piecewise-deterministic quasi-static simultaneous localization and mapping (PDQS-SLAM). PDQS-SLAM relaxes the static assumption that is inherent to traditional SLAM algorithms by incorporating landmark kinematic motion models in the graph construction. It then generalizes to more complex dynamic environments by detecting inevitable disruptions to the landmark's motion model. This is achieved by augmenting the definition of a loop closure factor to include a state, governed by a finite state machine, that captures the edge's behaviour over time. Simulations and laboratory experiments demonstrate that the localization and mapping errors of PDQS-SLAM in a dynamic environment with mobile landmarks that experience changes in their motion model were similar to the baseline static SLAM in a static environment. This represents a capability that is needed for persistent autonomous operations in complex environments populated with slowly-evolving landmarks, such as the Canadian marine Arctic.

   scene flow estimation
AB Scene flow allows autonomous vehicles to reason about the arbitrary motion of multiple independent objects which is the key to long-term mobile autonomy. While estimating the scene flow from LiDAR has progressed recently, it remains largely unknown how to estimate the scene flow from a 4-D radar - an increasingly popular automotive sensor for its robustness against adverse weather and lighting conditions. Compared with the LiDAR point clouds, radar data are drastically sparser, noisier and in much lower resolution. Annotated datasets for radar scene flow are also in absence and costly to acquire in the real world. These factors jointly pose the radar scene flow estimation as a challenging problem. This work aims to address the above challenges and estimate scene flow from 4-D radar point clouds by leveraging self-supervised learning. A robust scene flow estimation architecture and three novel losses are bespoken designed to cope with intractable radar data. Real-world experimental results validate that our method is able to robustly estimate the radar scene flow in the wild and effectively supports the downstream task of motion segmentation.

AB Digital technologies, such as advanced analytics, autonomous vehicles or the Internet of Things, are often touted as means to substantially improve operations. While this potential has been frequently highlighted and evidenced from single case applications, we still lack a deeper theoretical understanding of the underlying mechanisms how digital technologies can support process improvement in general, and lean practices more specifically. In this paper, we use a qualitative study based on focus group design to understand how manufacturing and supply chain management professionals perceive the potential of digital technologies in support of lean practices. We identify eight digital waste reduction mechanisms that illustrate how digital technologies can support lean practices. These include a cluster of mechanisms that augment operational execution in terms of speed and precision of execution, as well as flexibility in space and time. Furthermore, we identify a second cluster of mechanisms that augment decision-making through visibility, feedback, engagement, and prevention. In terms of managerial implications, our findings provide firms with a structured approach how to identify those digital technologies that can most effectively support their respective process improvement activities.

AB Virus-like nanoparticles (VLPs) have been used as an attractive means in cancer immunotherapy because of their unique intrinsic immunostimulatory properties. However, for treating metastatic tumors in the peritoneal cavity, such as ovarian cancer, multiple injections of therapy are needed due to the large peritoneal space and fast excretion of therapy. Here, it is reported on the development of active VLP delivery vehicles for the treatment of peritoneal ovarian tumors using biocompatible Q beta VLPs-loaded Mg-based micromotors. The autonomous propulsion of such Q beta VLPs-loaded Mg-micromotors in the peritoneal fluid enables active delivery of intact immunostimulatory Q beta VLPs to the peritoneal space of ovarian tumor bearing mice, greatly enhancing the local distribution and retention of Q beta VLPs. Such improved distribution and longer retention time of Q beta in the peritoneal cavity leads to enhanced immunostimulation and therefore increased survival rate of tumor-bearing mice compared to a passive Q beta treatment. For clinical translation, the active delivery of VLPs holds great promise for tumor immunotherapy toward the treatment of different types of primary and metastatic tumors in the peritoneal cavity.

AB High precision and reliability attitude measurement play an important role in autonomous unmanned navigation. Finding inspiration from desert ants, known as highly efficient navigators who can find their way after foraging for hundreds of meters from their home in hostile environments, we propose an attitude measurement method using polarization skylight and gravitational field. Contrary to the previous method, we utilize three-dimensional polarization vectors and any one-dimensional output of the accelerometers to calculate attitudes. In addition, we designed an accelerometer component selection algorithm, which is to select the one-dimensional component with the minimum motion acceleration from the output of the three-dimensional accelerometer. With this method, even if the carriers remain in a maneuvering state, the motion acceleration of the vehicle will have less impact on the accuracy of attitude measurement. To evaluate the performance of our method, the outdoor experiment was carried out to compare our method with existing traditional methods. Comparison results show that our method has higher measurement accuracy than others and is still applicable in the case of carriers maneuvering in practice under a clear sky.

AB Currently, pilots maximise the performance of Seaglider underwater gliders by manually selecting their set-up parameters. Building on existing procedures based on the assumption of steady-state motions, a recommender system for the trim and flight parameters has been developed to aid trainee pilots and enable round-the-clock operations. The system has been validated with data from 12 missions run in waters off the United Kingdom and Australia, representative of a range of oceanographic conditions. The recommended trim parameters present a maximum difference of 14% from the values selected by the pilots, whereas pilots are found not to change the flight parameters. Additionally, suggestions are made to improve operational practices to further improve the accuracy of the recommender system. As a result, the developed system is expected to greatly help trainee pilots achieve expertise in a much smaller time frame than standard practice. Additionally, thanks to its high precision, the recommender system can be used to autonomously select the trim and flight parameters of Seagliders for night operations in the future.

AB In this paper, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) location prediction (ALP)-based data collection scheme (ALP) has been proposed to overcome high and unbalanced energy consumption for underwater wireless sensor networks. In our scheme, an AUV travels around the network, follows a predefined trajectory, and collects data from the sensor nodes. The nodes near the trajectory send their data to the AUV directly, while the others send data to their neighbors that are closer to the trajectory. To overcome the "hot region" problem, which means the nodes near the trajectory of the AUV consume energy faster and die early, a trajectory adjustment mechanism is applied. A mathematical model is proposed to adjust the trajectory periodically. To guarantee an efficient communication between the nodes and the AUV, a reliable time mechanism is proposed. In this mechanism, only the nodes with a sufficient amount of time are capable to communicate and send their data to the AUV directly. The analyses and simulation results validate that our proposed ALP prolongs the network lifetime and has a higher packet delivery ratio than the existing protocols.

ID INDOOR PLACES; RECOGNITION; RANGE
AB Semantic place categorization, which is one of the essential tasks for autonomous robots and vehicles, allows them to have capabilities of self-decision and navigation in unfamiliar environments. In particular, outdoor places are more difficult targets than indoor ones due to perceptual variations, such as dynamic illuminance over 24 hours and occlusions by cars and pedestrians. This paper presents a novel method of categorizing outdoor places using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which take omnidirectional depth/reflectance images obtained by 3D LiDARs as the inputs. First, we construct a large-scale outdoor place dataset named Multi-modal Panoramic 3D Outdoor (MPO) comprising two types of point clouds captured by two different LiDARs. They are labeled with six outdoor place categories: coast, forest, indoor/outdoor parking, residential area, and urban area. Second, we provide CNNs for LiDAR-based outdoor place categorization and evaluate our approach with the MPO dataset. Our results on the MPO dataset outperform traditional approaches and show the effectiveness in which we use both depth and reflectance modalities. To analyze our trained deep networks, we visualize the learned features.

DE UAV; three-dimensional reconstruction; image processing; height map;
   real time
AB This article describes a simple and quite affordable tool called LTIUAV3D, for terrain three-dimensional reconstruction, using a low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a personal computer. The 3D model does not require GPS information, because it is built exclusively from monocular images obtained by the onboard camera. To solve the scale factor of the 3D model, an artificial marker is used as a reference, so the obtained height map is metrically precise and correct. An important characteristic of LTIUAV3D is that the 3D model is built in real time, as the UAV flies over the terrain, with incremental updates every second.
   For the height map obtained, the estimation errors are less than 4%, so the 3D model could be used for path planning and autonomous navigation of UAVs. Also, the LTIUAV3D tool can get a much more precise and detailed 3D model, in an offline process, with height estimation errors less than 1%.
   This tool makes available, to a large number of users both individuals and academics, a robust foundation for the development of new applications of UAVs.

AB Underwater optical cameras are widely used for security monitoring in ocean, such as earthquake prediction and tsunami alarming. Optical cameras recognize objects for autonomous underwater vehicles and provide security protection for sea-floor networks. However, there are many issues for underwater optical imaging, such as forward and backward scattering, light absorption, and sea snow. Many underwater image processing techniques have been proposed to overcome these issues. Among these techniques, the depth map gives important information for many applications of the post-processing. In this paper, we propose a Kinect-based underwater depth map estimation method that uses a captured coarse depth map by Kinect with the loss of depth information. To overcome the drawbacks of low accuracy of coarse depth maps, we propose a corresponding reconstruction architecture that uses the underwater dual channels prior dehazing model, weighted enhanced image mode filtering, and inpainting. Our proposed method considers the influence of mud sediments in water and performs better than the traditional methods. The experimental results demonstrated that, after inpainting, dehazing, and interpolation, our proposed method can create high-accuracy depth maps.

ID COMMUNICATION
AB Autonomous driving in road trains, a.k.a. platooning, may reduce fuel consumption considerably if the inter-vehicle distances are kept short. However, to do this, the intra-platoon communication must not only be reliable but also able to meet strict deadlines. While time-triggered messages are the foundation of most distributed control applications, platooning is likely to also require dissemination of event-driven messages. While much research work has focused on minimizing the age of periodic messages, state-of-the-art for disseminating event-driven messages is to let all nodes repeat all messages and focus on mitigating broadcast storms. We derive an efficient message dissemination scheme based on relay selection which minimizes the probability of error at the intended receiver(s) for both unicast and broadcast, without degrading the performance of co-existing time-triggered messages. We present a full analysis of the resulting error probability and delay, when relayers, selected by our algorithm, are used to disseminate messages within a platoon. Numerical results indicate that the proposed relaying policy significantly enhances the reliability for a given delay.

ID SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION; SLAM; RANSAC
AB SLAM is a popular task used by robots and autonomous vehicles to build a map of an unknown environment and, at the same time, to determine their location within the map. This paper describes a SLAM-based, probabilistic robotic system able to learn the essential features of different parts of its environment. Some previous SLAM implementations had computational complexities ranging from O(Nlog(N)) to O(N-2), where N is the number of map features. Unlike these methods, our approach reduces the computational complexity to O(N) by using a model to fuse the information from the sensors after applying the Bayesian paradigm. Once the training process is completed, the robot identifies and locates those areas that potentially match the sections that have been previously learned. After the training, the robot navigates and extracts a three-dimensional map of the environment using a single laser sensor. Thus, it perceives different sections of its world. In addition, in order to make our system able to be used in a low-cost robot, low-complexity algorithms that can be easily implemented on embedded processors or microcontrollers are used.

AB This paper presents an integrated system for navigation parameter estimation using sequential aerial images, where navigation parameters represent the position and velocity information of an aircraft for autonomous navigation, The proposed integrated system is composed of two parts: relative position estimation and absolute position estimation. Relative position estimation recursively computes the current position of an aircraft by accumulating relative displacement estimates extracted from two successive aerial images, Simple accumulation of parameter values decreases the reliability of the extracted parameter estimates as an aircraft goes on navigating, resulting in a large position error. Therefore, absolute position estimation is required to compensate for the position error generated in relative position estimation. Absolute position estimation algorithms by image matching and digital elevation model (DEM) matching are presented. In image matching, a robust-oriented Hausdorff measure (ROHM) is employed, whereas in DEM matching the algorithm using multiple image pairs is used. Experiments with four real aerial image sequences show the effectiveness of the proposed integrated position estimation algorithm.

ID SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION
AB In recent years, computer vision has transformed fields such as medical imaging, object recognition, and geospatial analytics. One of the fundamental tasks in computer vision is semantic image segmentation, which is vital for precise object delineation. Autonomous driving represents one of the key areas where computer vision algorithms are applied. The task of road surface segmentation is crucial in self-driving systems, but it requires a labor-intensive annotation process in several data domains. The work described in this paper aims to improve the efficiency of image segmentation using a convolutional neural network in a multi-sensor setup. This approach leverages lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) annotations to directly train image segmentation models on RGB images. Lidar supplements the images by emitting laser pulses and measuring reflections to provide depth information. However, lidar's sparse point clouds often create difficulties for accurate object segmentation. Segmentation of point clouds requires time-consuming preliminary data preparation and a large amount of computational resources. The key innovation of our approach is the masked loss, addressing sparse ground-truth masks from lidar point clouds. By calculating loss exclusively where lidar points exist, the model learns road segmentation on images by using lidar points as ground truth. This approach allows for seamless blending of different ground-truth data types during model training. Experimental validation of the approach on benchmark datasets shows comparable performance to a high-quality image segmentation model. Incorporating lidar reduces the load on annotations and enables training of image-segmentation models without loss of segmentation quality. The methodology is tested by experiments with diverse datasets, both publicly available and proprietary. The strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method are also discussed. The work facilitates efficient use of point clouds for image model training by advancing neural network training for image segmentation.

AB The driver's takeover behavior is critical to safety during automated driving in fog zones. This paper aims to explore the influence mechanism of takeover behavior, this paper analyzes the influence of various factors on takeover behavior from the perspective of event duration, and the influence mechanism of takeover behavior can be promoted. A takeover behavior test platform of L3 automated driving technology was developed based on a driving simulator, and a high-fidelity driving simulation experiment was carried out with the fog zone selected as the takeover scenario. The takeover request time (TOR) was set as 5 s and 10 s, and the no-driving-related task (NDRT) was set as work tasks and entertainment tasks. 42 drivers were invited to participate in the experiment where takeover behavior data were obtained. Takeover response time and takeover correct time are representative indicators of takeover behavior, which are extracted from takeover response and takeover performance. The survival analysis (the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional-hazards method) was used to explore the effects of factors (gender, age, driving age, TOR, NDRT) on survival time (takeover response time, takeover correct time). The KM model results show that driver attribute factors (gender, age, and driving age) had significant difference on takeover response time. Females were more cautious about the takeover, and their response time is shorter than that of males. The takeover response time increased with age and driving age, with statistical difference. Only TOR had a statistical difference in the takeover correct time, while other factors had no statistical significance. The takeover correct time of TOR-10 s (median = 8.50 s) is higher than the TOR-5 s (median = 3.65 s). However, the mean value of takeover correct time corresponding to 5 s is higher than 10 s. The Cox model results are consistent with the KM model, and the model results show that external variables (TOR, NDRT) have significant influence on the takeover correct time. The work task requires more immersion, and the longer time it takes for drivers to recover the situational awareness of driving, which leads to an increase in the takeover correct time. Based on the survival analysis method, this research studies the influence of factors on takeover behavior from the perspective of the duration of takeover events, which can lay a foundation for in-depth study on the influence mechanism about takeover behavior. The study can also provide references for the improvement of drivers' takeover behavior, and the optimization design of the takeover warning system.

AB The character of continental rifting processes in the northern part of the Okinawa Trough remains largely unknown due to the absence of an obvious axial rift zone or recent rift-related volcanism in the region. This paper describes the discovery of a tectonically and magmatically active rift zone in the northern trough, and discusses the nature of the rift. Ship-based bathymetry identified a group of NE-SW-trending surface lineaments on the western margin of the northern trough that form a small rift structure. The newly discovered rift, named the Uji Rift, is similar to 30 km long, similar to 10 km wide and similar to 180 m deep. A seismic reflection profile near the rift confirmed the existence of well-developed normal faults with large displacements, suggesting that the rift was formed by backarc rifting. A previously unknown volcanic edifice, named West Uji Knoll, which consists of multiple cones with pronounced summits and high acoustic backscatter characteristics, also exists within the rift. High-resolution mapping with an autonomous underwater vehicle at one of the cones confirmed the existence of lava flow and eruptive fissure morphologies. Lava flows cover the pre-existing lineaments that form the Uji Rift. The flows are undissected by any lineaments, suggesting that West Uji Knoll is a young submarine volcano and the most recent eruptions likely occurred after rifting activity in the early or late Pleistocene. Active magmatism is also inferred from evidence of hydrothermal venting, such as the existence of an acoustic plume and sharp temperature increases of up to similar to 0.06 degrees C, even at a depth of similar to 100 m above the seafloor. In addition, three bubble plumes were detected near the cones by the shipboard multibeam sonar, suggesting emission of magmatic gases. Our volcano-tectonic observations show that the Uji Rift developed at an unusual location, similar to 170 km behind the arc volcanic front. Continental rifting in the northern Okinawa Trough is considered to extend onshore at the Beppu-Shimabara Rift Zone in SW Japan. However, due to the small number of submarine studies in this area, where and how the rifting is developing in the trough and has extended from the ocean to the continent is poorly understood. As an active rift, the Uji Rift provides an important constraint on the continuity of rifting in the Okinawa Trough, as well as new insights into the propagation and migration processes of continental rifting in subduction systems.

AB Accurate and safety-assured navigation is demanded by future autonomous systems such as automated vehicles and urban air mobility (UAM). These systems usually integrate multiple sensors to improve navigation accuracy and require the corresponding integrity monitoring architecture to ensure integrity. In response, we implement the Solution Separation-based Kalman filter integrity monitoring (SS-KFIM) technique to achieve fault detection and protection level evaluation for multi-sensor integrated navigation. In our implementation, the filter bank management strategies to handle sensor-in and sensor-out events are discussed. Besides, we consider the faults in state initialization and propagation phases aside from those at the measurement-update stage. Furthermore, our implementation can accommodate the cases where the all-in-view filter is not optimal in a least-squares sense. Simulations are conducted with an illustrative example where an inertial navigation system, global navigation satellite systems, and visual odometry are integrated for a UAM task. The results prove the high effectiveness and extended applicability of our implementation of the SS-KFIM algorithm.

DE Context modeling; unsupervised learning; anomaly detection; kernel

AB Model-checking and verification using Kripke structures and computational tree logic* (CTL*) use abstractions from the model/process/application to create the state-transition graphs that verify the model behavior. This scheme of profiling the performance of a process imports that the depth of the process operation correlates with the level abstraction. However, because of state explosion problems, these abstractions tend to restrict the scope to create manageable execution states. Therefore, for context modeling, this procedure does not generate a fine-grained behavioral model as generated states limit the ability of the abstraction to capture the execution time interactions amongst the processes, the hardware, and the kernel. Hence, in this paper, we present an end-to-end framework that comprises auto-encoders and probabilistic models to understand the behavior of system processes and detect deviant behaviors. We test this framework with a publicly available dataset generated from an autonomous aerial vehicle (UAV) application and the results show that by creating a fine-grained model that exploits previously unharnessed properties of the system calls, we can create a dynamic anomaly detection framework that evolves as the threats change.

AB This paper presents the guidance algorithm for the circular formation flight of multiple fixed-wing UAVs. The formation guidance law aims at reducing both the radial and the phase angle error with respect to the moving reference point located at a fixed distance from the leader UAV. To this end, the proposed guidance law generates the desired course angle and the inertial speed commands for each follower UAV. The control commands are then converted to the roll angle and the airspeed commands for the autopilot. The theoretical stability proof is rigorously analyzed via the Lyaupunov method. The performance of the proposed control law is compared with the existing vector-field formation guidance scheme via numerical simulation. After the extensive validation using the hardware-in-the-loop simulation environment which includes the mesh network communication system, the flight test are performed to demonstrate not only the performance of the proposed algorithm but also the robustness to the wind disturbance.

AB Modern social trends are intensively transforming supply chains and the last mile as their most complex and most expensive segment. For the realization of the last mile, various solutions can be defined which combine initiatives, technologies, and concepts of city logistics. The successful implementation of these solutions depends on the characteristics of the city, the goals of stakeholders, and the ability to achieve economic, social, and environmental sustainability. In accordance with that, this paper defines innovative sustainable last mile solutions and evaluates their potential application in the real-life logistics system of the city. As evaluation requires consideration of a large number of criteria, this is a problem of multicriteria decision-making, and for solving it, a novel hybrid model that combines Delphi, FARE (Factor Relationship), and VIKOR (Visekriterijumska Optimizacija i Kompromisno Resenje) methods in the fuzzy environment has been developed. The applicability of the model is demonstrated in the example of evaluating the last mile solution for the central business district of the City of Belgrade. A combination of microconsolidation centers and autonomous vehicles is obtained as the most favorable solution.

AB In the integrated navigation system using extended Kalman filter (EKF), the state error conventionally uses linear approximation to tackle the commonly nonlinear problem. However, this error definition can diverge the filter in some adverse situations due to significant distortion of the linear approximation. By contrast, the nonlinear state error defined in the Lie group satisfies the autonomous equation, which thus has distinctively better convergence property. This work proposes a novel strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) nonlinear state error defined in the Lie group and derives the SINS equations of the Lie group EKF (LG-EKF) for the MIMU/GNSS/magnetometer integrated navigation system. The corresponding measurement equations are also derived. A land vehicle field test has been conducted to evaluate the performance of EKF, ST-EKF (state transformation extended Kalman filter) and LG-EKF, which verifies LG-EKF's superior estimation accuracy of the heading angle as well as the other two horizontal angles (pitch and roll). The LG-EKF proposed in this paper is unlimited in the choice of sensors, which means it can be applied with both high-end and low-end inertial sensors.

AB 3D motion estimation is an important prerequisite for the autonomous operation of vehicles and robots in dynamic environments. This work presents FeatFlow, a novel neural network architecture to estimate 3D motions from unstructured point clouds. Specifically, we learn deep geometric features to estimate the dense scene flow and the ego-motion of the platform. We build a scene flow estimation pipeline by an encoder-decoder architecture which comprises three novel modules: feature extractor, motion embedder, and flow decoder. By using a point-score layer to assign scores to the extracted features in a learning procedure, the feature extractor effectively extracts keypoints and features that are most significant for estimating the relative transformation between two consecutive point clouds. The whole model adaptively learns the required robust descriptors to represent a variety of point motions at the object or scene level. We evaluated our approach on synthetic data from FlyingThings3D, and real-world LiDAR scans from KITTI and Oxford RobotCar. Our network successfully generalizes to datasets with different patterns, outperforming various baselines and achieving state-of-the-art performance. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This Perspective examines the relationship between hardware platforms and the competency awareness of a neural network, highlighting how hardware developments can impact uncertainty estimation quality, and exploring the innovations required in order to build competency-aware neural networks in resource constrained hardware platforms.
   The ability to estimate the uncertainty of predictions made by a neural network is essential when applying neural networks to tasks such as medical diagnosis and autonomous vehicles. The approach is of particular relevance when deploying the networks on devices with limited hardware resources, but existing competency-aware neural networks largely ignore any resource constraints. Here we examine the relationship between hardware platforms and the competency awareness of a neural network. We highlight the impact of two key areas of hardware development - increasing memory size of accelerator architectures and device-to-device variation in the emerging devices typically used in in-memory computing - on uncertainty estimation quality. We also consider the challenges that developments in uncertainty estimation methods impose on hardware designs. Finally, we explore the innovations required in terms of hardware, software, and hardware-software co-design in order to build future competency-aware neural networks.

AB Image-level structural recognition is an important problem for many applications of computer vision such as autonomous vehicle control, scene understanding, and 3D TV. A novel method, using image features extracted by exploiting predefined templates, each associated with individual classifier, is proposed. The template that reflects the symmetric structure consisting of a number of components represents a stage-a rough structure of an image geometry. The following image features are used: a histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) features showing the overall object shape, colors representing scene information, the parameters of the Weibull distribution features, reflecting relations between image statistics and scene structure, and local binary pattern (LBP) and entropy (E) values representing texture and scene depth information. Each of the individual classifiers learns a discriminative model and their outcomes are fused together using sum rule for recognizing the global structure of an image. The proposed method achieves an 86.25% recognition accuracy on the stage dataset and a 92.58% recognition rate on the 15-scene dataset, both of which are significantly higher than the other state-of-the-art methods.

AB We propose a sampling-based motion-planning algorithm equipped with an information-theoretic convergence criterion for incremental informative motion planning. The proposed approach allows dense map representations and incorporates the full state uncertainty into the planning process. The problem is formulated as a constrained maximization problem. Our approach is built on rapidly exploring information-gathering algorithms and benefits from the advantages of sampling-based optimal motion-planning algorithms. We propose two information functions and their variants for fast and online computations. We prove an information-theoretic convergence for an entire exploration and information-gathering mission based on the least upper bound of the average map entropy. A natural automatic stopping criterion for information-driven motion control results from the convergence analysis. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms using three scenarios: comparison of the proposed information functions and sensor configuration selection, robotic exploration in unknown environments, and a wireless signal strength monitoring task in a lake from a publicly available dataset collected using an autonomous surface vehicle.

AB Exploring underwater acoustic sensing networks to detect and monitor ocean characteristics provides a novel approach for marine environment monitoring, disaster warning and resource exploration. However, factors such as underwater acoustic communication, ocean currents and sensor power prevent the direct adoption of terrestrial wireless sensing networks. Moreover, most previous studies have simply increased the number of nodes while ignoring the interference caused by high node density. In this paper, data collection in an offshore tidal scenario is investigated by table forwarding based election (TFBE) scheme. To balance node energy and reduce energy consumption of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), the improved algorithm (TFBE-A) is proposed. Meanwhile, in this scheme, we adopt AUVs to assist in collecting and put forward a 3D precision adjustable trajectory planning (3DPATP) algorithm. To better perform 3DPATP, the maximum minimum error estimation algorithm is presented to simplify the computer operations. Additionally, we study the probability distribution function of nodes in space, providing a foundation for arranging nodes and optimizing topology. Simulation results indicate that our algorithm outperforms compared strategies, particularly in latency and energy consumption.

AB The growing interest in intelligent automation adoption and development in tourism presents many potential solutions for sustainable tourism issues. To map the current landscape of research on intelligent automation in sustainable tourism, a systematic review was conducted of 213 scholarly articles. Five major themes were identified: intelligent automation to enhance tourist experience, preserve heritage, promote quality of life, measure tourist experience, and conserve the environment. Scholarly work on this topic has paid more attention to the economic and sociocultural aspects of sustainability but less to addressing environmental issues. To uncover further research gaps, this study outlines sustainability transition pathways using two dimensions: sustainability inclusion and tourist involvement. Twenty-three distinct AI-based innovations were mapped onto the pathways to reveal future research directions. The findings explain the lack of AI-based solutions that offer high levels of sustainability inclusion and tourist involvement. Thus, this study proposes the "AI4GoodTourism" framework, inferring that intelligent automation with high sustainability inclusion levels can scale up the marginal contributions that tourists provide collectively. This framework serves to guide future research and development for various stakeholders who are progressing sustainable tourism agendas through intelligent automation.

TI Lightweight lane line detection based on learnable cluster segmentation

SO IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Pixel segmentation is one of the most commonly used deep learning methods for modern lane line detection. Although deep segmentation outperforms traditional methods, there are two main problems: slow speed and limited receptive field. In response to these problems, this paper proposes a lightweight lane line detection algorithm based on learnable cluster segmentation and self-attention mechanism, which has extremely fast speed and the ability to adapt to real scenes. The lane detection process is considered as clustering under row segmentation. The data is processed through row segmentation and fed into a self-attention mechanism. In addition to the benchmark dataset for lane detection, the algorithm was ported to real vehicles for real-time road testing. Two tests show that our method performs very well on TuSimple, with an accuracy of 97.15%, an F1 score of 73.5 on CULane, and a speed of 142.7 frames per second (FPS), which solves the problem of slow cluster segmentation, while improving the accuracy of row segmentation. In the new scenario, the method has a misjudgment rate of only 6.7% for lane line points, which is suitable for the high standard requirements of autonomous driving.

AB Terrain irregularities in natural environments present mobility challenges for autonomous robots and vehicles. Loosely consolidated sandy slopes flow unpredictably when perturbed, often leading to locomotion failure. Systematic experiments with various robot morphologies on flowable terrains feature open-loop quasistatic gait strategies that remodel the terrain to aid locomotor kinematics. On a sloped terrain of granular media near the critical angle, a laboratory-scale rover robot induces a flow via a localized fluidization gait to remodel local terrain and succeed in locomotion. A Bayesian optimization machine learning approach that modulates this gait strategy then finds a pattern of selectively fluidizing and solidifying terrain to climb slopes rapidly. In a biped walker robot, a cleated foot design dynamically manipulates the stress fields of flowable slopes. The deeply submerged cleats remodel the shear response of the material by creating jammed regions behind them which then improve forward progression by reducing slip when compared to a flat foot. The "robophysics" approach of systematic experiments exploring terrain reconfiguration combined with future machine learning models of flowable terrain evolution can augment gait discovery for future robots.

AB Active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is an effective technique to handle uncertainties. Extended state observer (ESO), as the key component of ADRC, is often introduced to estimate the states and the total disturbance. Some finite-time extended state observers (FTESOs) were studied to improve the estimation performance. However, the existing FTESOs only use the fractional power term as the correction item, whose convergence rate is small when the estimation error is far from the equilibrium. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes a fast finite-time extended state observer (FFTESO) for a type of nonlinear systems with uncertainties, by which all the states and the total disturbance of the systems are estimated. The designed FFTESO is composed of three terms. Compared with the traditional FTESO, the linear term is utilized to speed up the convergence rate. Besides, the switching term is employed to guarantee the finite-time convergence. Finally, the FFTESO-based finite-time controller is developed for the wheeled mobile robot. Experimental results demonstrate the validation of the proposed method.

AB Between 24 January and 15 February 2020, small uncrewed aircraft systems (sUASs) were deployed to Morgan Lewis (Barbados) as part of the Atlantic Tradewind Ocean-Atmosphere Mesoscale Interaction Campaign (ATOMIC), a sister project to the ElUcidating the RolE of Cloud-Circulation Coupling in ClimAte (EUREC(4)A) project. The observations from ATOMIC and EUREC(4)A were aimed at improving our understanding of trade-wind cumulus clouds and the environmental regimes supporting them and involved the deployment of a wide variety of observational assets, including aircraft, ships, surface-based systems, and profilers. The current paper describes ATOMIC observations obtained using the University of Colorado Boulder RAAVEN (Robust Autonomous Aerial Vehicle - Endurant Nimble) sUAS. This platform collected nearly 80 h of data throughout the lowest kilometer of the atmosphere, sampling the near-shore environment upwind from Barbados. Data from these platforms are publicly available through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Center for Environmental Intelligence (NCEI) archive. The primary DOI for the quality-controlled dataset described in this paper is https://doi.org/10.25921/jhnd-8e58 (de Boer et al., 2021).

AB Vision-guided autonomous underwater vehicles based on remote sensing play an important role in ocean missions. However, some problems exist in underwater visual perception, such as color distortion, low contrast, and fuzzy details, which restrict the applications of underwater visual tasks. Most of the state-of-the-art image enhancement methods are still limited in scene adaptability, recovery accuracy, and real-time processing. To solve these problems, we propose an underwater sensing scene image enhancement method called a multiscale feature fusion network (MFFN). To extract the multiscale feature, the measure merging the feature extraction module, the feature fusion module, and the attention reconstruction module is designed. This measure can also enhance the adaptability and visual effect of the scene. Moreover, we propose multiple objective functions for supervised training to match the nonlinear mapping. Based on the qualitative and quantitative evaluations, the proposed method produces competitive performance compared with some state-of-the-art methods, and the perception and statistical quality of underwater images are enhanced effectively.

AB A proper detection and classification of defects in steel sheets in real time have become a requirement for manufacturing these products, largely used in many industrial sectors. However, computers used in the production line of small to medium size companies, in general, lack performance to attend real-time inspection with high processing demands. In this paper, a smart deep convolutional neural network for using in real-time surface inspection of steel rolling sheets is proposed. The architecture is based on the state-of-the-art SqueezeNet approach, which was originally developed for usage with autonomous vehicles. The main features of the proposed model are: small size and low computational burden. The model is 10 to 20 times smaller when compared to other networks designed for the same task, and more than 700 times smaller than general networks. Also, the number of floating-point operations for a prediction is about 50 times lower than the ones used for similar tasks. Despite its small size, the proposed model achieved near-perfect accuracy on a public dataset of 1800 images of six types of steel rolling defects.

AB In recent years, the boom of the quadcopter industry resulted in a broad range of real-world applications which highlighted the urgent need to improve quadcopter control quality. Typically, external disturbances, such as wind, parameter uncertainties caused by payload variations, or the ground effect, can severely degrade the quadcopter's altitude control performance. Meanwhile, widely used controllers like the proportional-integral-derivative control cannot guarantee control performance when the system is critically affected by factors that exhibit a high degree of variability with time. In this paper, an adaptive control algorithm is proposed to improve quadcopter altitude tracking performance in the presence of both the ground effect and a time-varying payload. First, we derive an adaptive altitude control algorithm using the sliding mode control technique to account for these uncertainties in the quadcopter dynamics model. Second, we apply Lyapunov theory to analyze the stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, we conduct several numerical simulations and experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Haze removal is an essential requirement in autonomous vehicle applications for identifying different objects on the road. Most of the available techniques are based on different constraints/ priors. The important parameters required for recovering the ground truth from hazy image are transmission map and air light. In this paper, we proposed a learning-based Encoder-Decoder deep learning architecture for transmission map estimation. Based on the assumption that at least twenty percent of the outdoor image includes with sky region and hence airlight is calculated as average of the twenty percent brightest pixels of the image. These two parameters namely transmission map and airlight were applied in atmospheric scattering model for ground truth image recovery. In Encoder-Decoder architecture, Max pooling layer, dropout layer was used for feature learning and efficient generalization respectively. The proposed architecture was trained on different datasets like NYU Depth data set, FRIDA and RESIDE Dataset for better generalization on unseen data. Experimental results shows that the proposed method has shown better performance compared to the existing state of the art methods.

AB In the future, Air Traffic Control (ATC) will have to cope with a radical change in air traffic. Apart from the probable increase in traffic that will push the system to its limits, the insertion of new aerial vehicles such as drones into the airspace - with different flight performances, and utterly different objective - will increase its complexity. Current research aims at increasing the level of automation and/or partial delegation of the control to on-board systems. In this work, we investigate the collision avoidance management problem using a decentralized distributed approach. We propose an autonomous and generic multi-agent system to address this complex problem, where mobile entities are agents, that use a finite set of discrete speed vector modifications to follow their trajectories while avoiding separation losses. We validate our system using a state-of-the-art benchmark. The results underline the adequacy of our local and cooperative approach to efficiently solve the studied problem, competing with centralized methods. Additionally, the conducted sensitivity analysis underlines the robustness of our approach regarding some used parameters.

AB We consider scenarios where a swarm of unmanned vehicles (UxVs) seek to satisfy a number of diverse, spatially distributed objectives. The UxVs strive to determine an efficient plan to service the objectives while operating in a coordinated fashion. We focus on developing autonomous high-level planning, where low-level controls are leveraged from previous work in distributed motion, target tracking, localization, and communication. We rely on the use of state and action abstractions in a Markov decision processes framework to introduce a hierarchical algorithm, Dynamic Domain Reduction for Multi-Agent Planning, that enables multi-agent planning for large multi-objective environments. Our analysis establishes the correctness of our search procedure within specific subsets of the environments, termed 'sub-environment' and characterizes the algorithm performance with respect to the optimal trajectories in single-agent and sequential multi-agent deployment scenarios using tools from submodularity. Simulated results show significant improvement over using a standard Monte Carlo tree search in an environment with large state and action spaces.

ID RECOVERY
AB Dense depth cues are important and have wide applications in various computer vision tasks. In autonomous driving, LIDAR sensors are adopted to acquire depth measurements around the vehicle to perceive the surrounding environments. However, depth maps obtained by LIDAR are generally sparse because of its hardware limitation. The task of depth completion attracts increasing attention, which aims at generating a dense depth map from an input sparse depth map. To effectively utilize multi-scale features, we propose three novel sparsity-invariant operations, based on which, a sparsity-invariant multi-scale encoder-decoder network (HMS-Net) for handling sparse inputs and sparse feature maps is also proposed. Additional RGB features could be incorporated to further improve the depth completion performance. Our extensive experiments and component analysis on two public benchmarks, KITTI depth completion benchmark and NYU-depth-v2 dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. As of Aug. 12th, 2018, on KITTI depth completion leaderboard, our proposed model without RGB guidance ranks 1st among all peer-reviewed methods without using RGB information, and our model with RGB guidance ranks 2nd among all RGB-guided methods.

AB The construction industry is a major economic sector, but it is plagued with inefficiencies and low productivity. Robotics and automated systems have the potential to address these shortcomings; however, the level of adoption in the construction industry is very low. This paper presents an investigation into the industry-specific factors that limit the adoption in the construction industry. A mixed research method was employed combining literature review, qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis. Three focus groups with 28 experts and an online questionnaire were conducted. Principal component and correlation analyses were conducted to group the identified factors and find hidden correlations. The main identified challenges were grouped into four categories and ranked in order of importance: contractor-side economic factors, client-side economic factors, technical and work-culture factors, and weak business case factors. No strong correlation was found among factors. This study will help stakeholders to understand the main industry-specific factors limiting the adoption of robotics and automated systems in the construction industry. The presented findings will support stakeholders to devise mitigation strategies.

AB Underwater structural damage inspection has mainly relied on diver-based visual inspection, and emerging technologies include the use of remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) for improved efficiency. With the goal of performing an autonomous and robotic underwater inspection, a novel Tactile Imaging System for Underwater Inspection (TISUE) is designed, prototyped, and tested in this paper. The system has two major components, including the imaging subsystem and the manipulation subsystem. The novelty lies in the imaging subsystem, which consists of an elastomer-enabled contact-based optical sensor with specifically designed artificial lighting. The completed TISUE system, including optical imaging, data storage, display analytics, and a mechanical support subsystem, is further tested in a laboratory experiment. The experiment demonstrates that high-resolution and high-quality images of structural surface damage can be obtained using tactile touch-and-sense' imaging, even in a turbid water environment. A deep learning-based damage detection framework is developed and trained. The detection results demonstrate the similar detectability of five damage types in the obtained tactile images to images obtained from regular (land-based) structural inspection.

DT Article
AB The increasing development of autonomous intelligent systems, such as smart vehicles, smart homes, and social robots, poses new challenges to face. Among them, ensuring that such systems behave lawfully is one of the crucial topics to be addressed for improving their employment in real contexts of daily life. In this work, we present an approach for norm compliance in the context of open and goal-directed intelligent systems working in dynamic normative environments where goals, services, and norms may change. Such an approach complements a goal-directed system modifying its goals and the way to achieve them for taking norms into accounts, thus influencing the practical reasoning process that goal-oriented systems implement for figuring out what to do. The conformity to norms is established at the goal level rather than at the action level. The effect of a norm that acts at the goal level spreads out at the lower level of actions, thus also improving system flexibility. Recovery mechanisms are provided to face exceptional situations that could be caused by normative changes. A case study in the field of the business organizations is presented for demonstrating the strengths of the proposed solution.

AB A safety guaranteed formation control problem for waterjet unmanned surface vehicles (USV) under the consideration of unmodeled dynamics, environmental disturbances, input saturation, and output constraints is addressed in this paper. The leader-follower method and line-of-sight (LOS) strategy are employed to achieve the desired formation structure. Firstly, two tan-type barrier Lyapunov functions (BLF) are designed to limit the formation errors always within a predefined range to avoid collisions and keep communications, it can also relax the assumption of each USV's initial position to random. Besides, a bioinspired neurodynamics method is involved to avoid the appearance of the virtual velocity differential terms in the control law, which is different from the traditional dynamic surface method and makes it easier to implement in practice. Further, adaptive neural networks (NN) are used to approximate unmodeled dynamics and an auxiliary dynamics system is introduced to handle the input saturation. It is proved that the uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals in the control system can be achieved. Finally, simulation studies show the effectiveness of the proposed control law.

AB Air-launched autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are subjected to huge impact loads in the early stage of water entry, which may cause structural damage or failure of electronic components, especially in the case of high speed water entry. Therefore, it is very imperative to carry out experimental and numerical research on the impact loads of air-launched AUVs. An experimental study of the water entry of air-launched AUVs with different launch velocities and angles was conducted using high-speed photography and sensing technology. The axial and radial accelerations of AUVs under different working conditions at the early stage of water entry were obtained. Furthermore, a coupled finite element technique and the smooth particle hydrodynamics method (FEM-SPH) is employed to model the water entry process of air-launched AUVs. Numerical simulation results such as the peak of impact acceleration were compared with the presented experiment results. The good agreement between the experimental results and the numerical simulation results revealed the capability and accuracy of the numerical algorithm in solving the problem of AUV water entry.

AB For multi-Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (multi-AUV) system task assignment and path planning, a novel Glasius Bio-inspired Self-Organising Map (GBSOM) neural networks algorithm is proposed to solve relevant problems in a Three-Dimensional (3D) grid map. Firstly, a 3D Glasius Bio-inspired Neural Network (GBNN) model is established to represent the 3D underwater working environment. Using this model, the strength of neural activity is calculated at each node within the GBNN. Secondly, a Self-Organising Map (SOM) neural network is used to assign the targets to a set of AUVs and determine the order of the AUVs to access the target point. Finally, according to the magnitude of the neuron activity in the GBNN, the next AUV target point can be autonomously planned when the task assignment is completed. By repeating the above three steps, access to all target points is completed. Simulation and comparison studies are presented to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can overcome the speed jump problem of SOM algorithms and path planning in the 3D underwater environments with static or dynamic obstacles.

ID RADIO
AB Within the challenging environment of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), networked control systems such as platooning guidance of autonomous vehicles require innovative mechanisms to provide real-time communications. Although several proposals are currently under discussion, the design of a rapid, efficient, flexible, and reliable medium access control mechanism which meets the specific constraints of such real-time communications applications remains unsolved in this highly dynamic environment. However, cognitive radio (CR) combines the capacity to sense the radio spectrum with the flexibility to adapt to transmission parameters in order to maximize system performance and has thus become an effective approach for the design of dynamic spectrum access (DSA) mechanisms. This paper presents the enhanced noncooperative cognitive division multiple access (ENCCMA) proposal combining time division multiple access (TDMA) and frequency division multiple access (FDMA) schemes with CR techniques to obtain a mechanism fulfilling the requirements of real-time communications. The analysis presented here considers the IEEE WAVE and 802.11p as reference standards; however, the proposed medium access control (MAC) mechanism can be adapted to operate on the physical layer of different standards. The mechanism also offers the advantage of avoiding signaling, thus enhancing system autonomy as well as behavior in adverse scenarios.

AB In this paper, a distributed adaptive control architecture is proposed for cooperative tracking of uncertain dynamical multi-agent systems over an undirected network. Adaptive cooperative tracking controllers with both static and adaptive coupling gains are developed using local information obtained from neighboring agents. Neural networks together with filtering adaptive laws are employed to enable fast learning in the presence of unmodeled uncertainties and external disturbances. Moreover, this result is extended to the output feedback case in which only partial state information of each agent can be measured. Observer-based adaptive cooperative tracking controllers with static and adaptive coupling are developed, and a parameter dependent Riccati equation is employed to derive the stability of the overall multi-agent systems. Compared with the existing results, a distinct feature of the developed controllers enables fast learning using large adaptive gains with guaranteed low frequency control signals. Two illustrative examples are given to validate the efficacy of the proposed approaches. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water jet thruster, which is a marine system that creates a jet of water for propulsion, has several advantages such as low noise, good anti-cavitation characteristics and maneuvering characteristics. The reaction thrust characteristics of water jet for conical nozzles directly determine the speed of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). Theoretical, numerical and experimental Studies have been carried out to investigate the effects of the nozzle geometries as well as inlet conditions on the reaction thrust of water jet in this paper. The experimental results show that: 1) the reaction thrust is proportional to inlet pressure, the square of flow rate and 2/3 power exponent of input power; 2) the diameter of cylinder column for conical nozzle has great influence on the reaction thrust characteristics; 3) the best values of the half cone angle and the cylinder column length exist to make the reaction thrust coefficient to reach the maximum under the same inlet conditions. Those provide a basis for nozzles design and have significant value, especially for developing high performance and efficiency water jet propulsion unit.

DT Article
AB A novel speech communications system using a modulated laser beam has been developed for short-range applications in which high directionality is an exploitable feature. Although it was designed for certain underwater applications, such as speech communications between divers or between a diver and the surface, it may equally be used for air applications. With some modification it could be used for secure diver-to-diver communications in the situation where untethered divers are swimming close together and do not want their conversations monitored by intruders. Unlike underwater acoustic communications, where the transmitted speech may be received at ranges of hundreds of metres omnidirectionally, a laser communication link is very difficult to intercept and also obviates the need for cables that become snagged or broken. Further applications include the transmission of speech and data, including the short message service (SMS), from a fixed installation such as a sea-bed habitat; and data transmission to and from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), particularly during docking manoeuvres. The performance of the system has been assessed subjectively by listening tests, which revealed that the speech was intelligible, although of poor quality due to the speech algorithm used.

AB A two-stage variable speed limits (VSL) modelling framework is proposed to enhance traffic safety and efficiency at freeway bottlenecks with mixed traffic flow comprising both human-driven and autonomous vehicles. The first-stage macroscopic VSL control framework is based on an extended cell transmission model (ECTM) and a VSL optimal control model. The ECTM serves as a traffic state predictor and characterises mixed traffic flow by modelling various characteristics such as driving behaviours and flow performance. The ECTM-based optimal control model aims to improve safety and efficiency. The second-stage microscopic validation framework is designed using the VISSIM_COM to validate the effectiveness and sophistication of the proposed VSL strategy. The proposed strategy is compared with a fixed speed limit strategy (FSL) and a VSL strategy considering only efficiency improvement (VSL_E). The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy improves traffic efficiency compared to the FSL and significantly outperforms VSL_E in traffic safety.

AB A new cross-modal image matching method is proposed to solve the problem that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are difficult to navigate in GPS-free environment and night environment. In this algorithm, infrared image or visible image is matched with satellite visible image. The matching process is divided into two steps, namely, coarse matching and fine alignment. Based on the dense structure features, the coarse matching algorithm can realize the position update above 10 Hz with a small amount of computation. Based on the end-to-end matching network, the fine alignment algorithm can align the multi-sensor image with the satellite image under the condition of interference. In order to obtain the position and heading information with higher accuracy, the fusion of the information after visual matching with the inertial information can restrain the divergence of the inertial navigation position error. The experiment shows that it has the advantages of strong anti-interference ability, strong reliability, and low requirements on hardware, which is expected to be applied in the field of unmanned navigation.

AB Marine debris is a problem both for the health of marine environments and for the human health since tiny pieces of plastic called "microplastics " resulting from the debris decomposition over the time are entering the food chain at any levels. For marine debris detection and removal, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are a potential solution. In this letter, we focus on the efficiency of AUV vision for real-time marine debris detection. First, we improved the efficiency of a class of state-of-the-art object detectors, namely EfficientDets [1], by 1.5% AP on D0, 2.6% AP on D1, 1.2% AP on D2 and 1.3% AP on D3 without increasing the GPU latency (see Fig. 1). Subsequently, we created and made publicly available a dataset for the detection of in-water plastic bags and bottles and trained our improved EfficientDets on this and on two public datasets for marine debris detection. Finally, we began the testing of real-time detection performance on a simulator of marine environments.

ID DRIVER BEHAVIOR; MODEL
AB Traffic congestion is a frequent problem on most urban roads. This may be due to incorrect configuration of traffic signals but planning analysis should also include a study of human behavior, which, often imprudent, contributes to traffic congestion. The aim of this paper is to analyze the influence of human factors and their reaction to the environment on the impact of traffic performance through waiting time. For this purpose, an agent-based simulation is developed to represent the autonomous and social behavior of road users. The waiting of vehicles at signals is modeled on the basis of a queuing system. Simulations and experiments are based on the analysis of the age of the people and the condition of the pavement. Results show that people's age is the most important factor influencing their behavior on the road. It is also shown external factors that also affect driver response and thus signal impact, such as the condition of the pavement. Finally, traffic performance, measured by waiting time, depends strongly on the behavior of people facing signals, according to their characteristics and factors present in the environment.

AB In this paper, the blockage problem of the optical link between AGV (autonomous ground vehicles) and AP (access point) in the logistics-warehousing VLC (visible light communication) network is analyzed. First, based on the random geometric model, a link-blockage model is proposed. Given the position of AGV, AP and obstacle, the blockage state of the VLC link between AGV and AP can be obtained through this model. Then, an AP-placement scheme based on the link-blockage model is proposed. Under this AP placement, AGVs in any position have a reliable link that is not affected by obstacles. During the movement of AGV, the VLC link of AGV will not be interrupted by a random blockage. Finally, the effectiveness of the link-blockage model is demonstrated by the shadow method. In this paper, the link outage probability and the data rate under different AP heights, AP spacings and the number of obstacles are simulated. Simulation results show that the VLC link can keep uninterrupted under the AP placement proposed in this paper.

AB In this paper, the formation coordination control of discrete-time distributed leaderless multiple autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) system with double independent position-velocity communication topology and control inputs on a nonconvex set is studied. Firstly, the problem of formation coordination control of multi-AUV system is transformed into the problem of formation consensus of multi-AUV system, and the consistent state of leaderless multi-AUV system formation was defined. Secondly, considering the existence of bounded communication delay and nonconvex control input constraints for multi-AUV system formation under weak communication conditions, a formation consistent constraint controller algorithm for discrete-time leaderless multi-AUV system with double independent communication topology is proposed by introducing constraint operators. By using the properties of graph theory, random matrix and SIA matrix, and selecting appropriate controller parameters, the multi-AUV system formation can reach the defined consensus state. Furthermore, the unbounded communication delay of multi-AUV system formation is studied. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed controller constraint algorithm is effective.

AB This paper describes the use of a single hydrophone to estimate the motion parameters of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) from the underwater acoustic signal excited by its propulsion motor. First, the frequency range of the hydroacoustic signal radiated by the AUV motor is determined, and a detection and recognition model is designed. In the case of uniform linear motion of the AUV, the geometric relationship between the Doppler frequency shift curve of the sound source is derived and the motion model of the sound source and sound line propagation is established. An estimation algorithm for the motion parameters of multiple AUVs based on data from a single hydrophone is derived. Then, for Doppler underwater acoustic signals disturbed by independent identically distributed noise with an arbitrary probability distribution, a cumulative phase difference power amplification instantaneous frequency estimation method is proposed. This method is based on the sum of multiple logarithmic functions. Finally, the effectiveness and accuracy of the algorithm in estimating the motion parameters of multiple AUVs are verified through simulations and experiments.

DT Article
DE Autonomous vehicle navigation; deep learning for visual perception;
   monocular depth estimation
AB Monocular depth estimation (MDE) in the self-supervised scenario has emerged as a promising method as it refrains from the requirement of ground truth depth. Despite continuous efforts, MDE is still sensitive to scale changes especially when all the training samples are from one single camera. Meanwhile, it deteriorates further since camera movement results in heavy coupling between the predicted depth and the scale change. In this paper, we present a scale-invariant approach for self-supervised MDE, in which scale-sensitive features (SSFs) are detached away while scale-invariant features (SIFs) are boosted further. To be specific, a simple but effective data augmentation by imitating camera zooming process is proposed to detach SSFs, making the model robust to scale changes. Besides, a dynamic cross-attention module is designed to boost SIFs by fusing multi-scale cross-attention features adaptively. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that the detaching and boosting strategies are mutually complementary in MDE and our approach achieves new State-of-The-Art performance against existing works from 0.097 to 0.090 w.r.t absolute relative error. The code will be made public soon.

ID NAVIGATION SYSTEM; PERFORMANCE
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) play an increasingly essential role in the field of polar ocean exploration, and the Doppler velocity log (DVL)-aided strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) is widely used for it. Due to the rapid convergence of the meridians, traditional inertial navigation mechanisms fail in the polar region. To tackle this problem, a transverse inertial navigation mechanism based on the earth ellipsoidal model is designed in this paper. Influenced by the harsh environment of the polar regions, unknown and time-varying outlier noise appears in the output of DVL, which makes the performance of the standard Kalman filter degrade. To address this issue, a robust Kalman filter algorithm based on Mahalanobis distance is used to adaptively estimate measurement noise covariance; thus, the Kalman filter gain can be modified to weight the measurement. A trial ship experiment and semi-physical simulation experiment were carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively resist the influence of DVL outliers and improve positioning accuracy.

DE autonomous driving; high-definition map; localization; path planning
AB High-definition (HD) mapping is a promising approach to realize highly automated driving (AD). Although HD maps can be applied to all levels of autonomy, their use is particularly beneficial for autonomy levels 4 or higher. HD maps enable AD systems to see beyond the field of view of conventional sensors, thereby providing accurate and detailed information regarding a driving environment. An HD map is typically separated into a pointcloud map for localization and a vector map for path planning. In this paper, we introduce two separate but successive HD map generation workflows. Of the several stages involved, the registration and mapping processes are essential for creating the pointcloud and vector maps, respectively. To facilitate the readers' understanding, the processes of these two stages have been recorded and uploaded online. HD maps are typically generated using open-source software (OSS) tools. CloudCompare and ASSURE, as representative tools, are used in this study. The generated HD maps are validated with localization and path-planning modules in Autoware, which is also an OSS stack for AD systems. The generated HD maps enable environmental-monitoring vehicles to successfully operate at level 4 autonomy.

AB Biomimetic flapping-foil thrusters can operate efficiently while offering desirable levels of thrust required for the propulsion of a small vessel or an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). These systems have been studied both as main propulsion devices and for augmenting ship propulsion in waves. In this work, the unsteady hydrofoil loads are used to calculate the source terms of the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FW-H) equation which is applied to model noise propagation in the underwater ocean acoustic environment. The solution provided by a simplified version of the Farassat formulation in free space is extended to account for a bounded domain and an inhomogeneous medium, characterizing the sea acoustic waveguide. Assuming the simplicity azimuthal symmetry of the environmental parameters, a numerical model is developed based on a Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) scheme, incorporating free-surface and seabed effects, in the presence of a variable sound speed profile. For the treatment of the outgoing radiating field, a Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) technique is implemented. Numerical results are presented illustrating the applicability of the method.

AB In this letter, we propose a novel approach to generate a synthetic aerial dataset for application in UAV monitoring. We propose to accentuate shape-based object representation by applying texture randomization. A diverse dataset with photorealism in all parameters such as shape, pose, lighting, scale, viewpoint, etc. except for atypical textures is created in a 3D modelling software Blender. Our approach specifically targets two conditions in aerial images where texture of objects is difficult to detect, namely challenging illumination and objects occupying only a small portion of the image. Experimental evaluation of YOLO and Faster R-CNN detectors trained on synthetic data with randomized textures confirmed our approach by increasing the mAP value (17 and 3.7 percentage points for YOLO; 20 and 1.1 percentage points for Faster R-CNN) on two test datasets of real images, both containing UAV-to-UAV images with motion blur. Testing on different domains, we conclude that the more the generalisation ability is put to the test, the more apparent are the advantages of the shape-based representation.

AB In order to meet the requirements of the high-precision positioning for the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the complex and time-varying marine environments, a novel partitioned matrix-based parameter update method embedded in variational Bayesian (PMPU-VB) is proposed to deal with the positioning accuracy problem caused by the inaccurate predicted error covariance and measurement noise matrices. By employing the variational Bayesian (VB) method, the accurate predicted error covariance matrix and the measurement noise matrix can be obtained. Subsequently, the PMPU-VB, which employs the accurate predicted error covariance matrix and measurement noise matrix, is used as a substitute of the traditional Gaussian filtering (GF) algorithm, to update the probability density function (PDF) of the state vector. The state vector is defined to follow the Gaussian distribution, and the parameters of the Gaussian distribution are deduced by using the proposed partitioned matrix-based parameter update method. Finally, the accurate position information of the AUV can be obtained. Therefore, the more precise state vector and the error covariance matrix are acquired. The experiments results illustrate that the PMPU-VB has higher estimate accuracy, better stability and robustness than other comparison algorithms.

AB In recent years the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has considerably grown in the civil sectors, due to their high flexibility of use. Currently, two important key points are making them more and more successful in the civil field, namely the decrease of production costs and the increase in navigation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a Kalman filtering-based sensor fusion algorithm, using a low cost navigation platform that contains an inertial measurement unit (IMU), five ultrasonic ranging sensors and an optical flow camera. The aim is to improve navigation in indoor or GPS-denied environments. A multi-rate version of the Extended Kalman Filter is considered to deal with the use of heterogeneous sensors with different sampling rates, and the presence of non-linearities in the model. The effectiveness of the proposed sensor platform is evaluated by means of numerical tests on the dynamic flight simulator of a quadrotor. Results show high precision and robustness of the attitude estimation algorithm, with a reduced computational cost, being ready to be implemented on low-cost platforms.

AB In this paper, the analysis, design and fabrication of an Octorotor Miniature Aerial Vehicle (MAV) are presented. This rotorcraft setup can act as an autonomous robot in outdoor environments to carry and move high payloads, and can thus also be used in object manipulation tasks. Within this paper, the system design, dynamic modeling, control system design, and its implementation are elaborated. The design procedure for this MAV includes two mechanics and electronics sub systems, which are thoroughly discussed. The mechanical design covers the aerodynamics analysis, body components, and propulsion system implementation. The electronic design includes hardware selection and control system design for the presented aerial robot. Since the MAV flies in outdoor environments, it additionally has to cope with windy conditions. Hence, the stabilization control scheme is considered along the lines of usual PID controllers. The attitude controller, as well as the inner and outer control loops, are fully studied, and a Fuzzy-PID controller is developed to improve the performance. Finally, considering maneuvers in two case studies, simulation and implementation results are studied and compared. (c) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB The structural condition of bridges is generally assessed using manual visual inspection. However, this approach consumes labor, time, and capital, and produces subjective results. Therefore, industries today are using automated visual inspection approaches, which quantify and localize damages such as cracks using robots and computer vision. This paper proposes an instant damage identification and localization approach that uses an image capturing and geo-tagging system and deep convolutional neural network for crack detection. The image capturing and geo-tagging allows the geo-tagging of three-dimensional coordinates and camera pose data with bridge inspection images; the deep convolutional neural network is trained for automated crack identification. The damages extracted by the convolutional neural network are instantly transformed into a global bridge damage map, with georeferencing data acquired using the image capturing and geo-tagging. This method is experimentally validated through a lab-scale test on a wall and a field test on a bridge to demonstrate the performance of the instant damage map.

   Policy Gradient Algorithm
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB Deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm operating over continuous space of actions has attracted great attention for reinforcement learning. However, the exploration strategy through dynamic programming within the Bayesian belief state space is rather inefficient even for simple systems. Another problem is the sequential and iterative training data with autonomous vehicles subject to the law of causality, which is against the i.i.d. (independent identically distributed) data assumption of the training samples. This usually results in failure of the standard bootstrap when learning an optimal policy. In this paper, we propose a framework of m-out-of-n bootstrapped and aggregated multiple deep deterministic policy gradient to accelerate the training process and increase the performance. Experiment results on the 2D robot arm game show that the reward gained by the aggregated policy is 10%-50% better than those gained by subpolicies. Experiment results on the open racing car simulator (TORCS) demonstrate that the new algorithm can learn successful control policies with less training time by 56.7%. Analysis on convergence is also given from the perspective of probability and statistics. These results verify that the proposed method outperforms the existing algorithms in both efficiency and performance.

AB This study proposes holistic network performability as a reliability index of multiple autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) (multi-AUV) cooperative systems and deduces the reliability of communication links. Temperature and salinity vary in different areas of the sea. The influence mechanism of temperature and salinity on holistic network performability is discussed. An example is provided to show the influences of temperature and salinity on holistic network performability. Corresponding trends of holistic network performability with the influences of temperature and salinity can be obtained. The trends show that the holistic network performability of multi-AUV cooperative systems exhibit ladder-like increases with temperature and salinity. In each ladder, the value of holistic network performability changes rapidly at high salinity or low temperature. The study on the change of the reliability of multi-AUV cooperative systems under different temperatures and salinities provides a theoretical basis for the reliability research of multi-AUV cooperative systems and provides reference for future practical application of multi-AUV cooperative systems and other network systems.

AB Aiming at the problems of huge exhaust noise and air bubbles caused by sewage blowing-off at an inappropriate time for a submarine ST, a sewage level detection system is designed, which can detect in real-time the sewage level using a weighing sensor to achieve quantitative sewage blowing-off. Therefore, the theoretical analysis of the sewage blowing-off is carried out, and the process of the sewage blowing-off is simulated by a VOF model of Fluent. From the simulation, the gas-liquid volume distribution diagram, the volume curve of the sewage, and the flow rate curve of the outlet sewage are obtained. Furthermore, the installation and detection method of the weighing sensor are described in detail. Finally, an experimental test system for simulating the sewage blowing-off is established, and an ultrasonic liquid level sensor, capacitance level sensor, and weighing sensor are tested. By comparing the effects of the three sensors, the result shows that the weighing sensor is the most effective for real-time sewage level detection during the process of sewage blowing-off and can effectively reduce the exhaust noise of the sewage blowing-off system.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB The topology of formation is an important factor that directly affects the performance of multiple autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) cooperative localisation (MACL). This study presents a new optimisation design method, and the main contributions are as follows: (i) the evaluation function of the observable performance is constructed based on Cramer-Rao lower bound and Fisher information matrix considering the factors such as the situation of multiple leaders and multiple followers (MLs-MFs) and the correlation between acoustic ranging error and distance. (ii) In view of the uncertainty of the location information, the Monte Carlo method was applied to complete the reconstruction of the evaluation function and the formation configuration in the possible distribution region is optimised. (iii) A step recursive strategy based on annealing idea is proposed to solve the constraint equation for ML-MF system. The simulation results show that the MACL system composed of three leaders (3Ls) and one follower or 3Ls and three followers can complete the optimal formation configuration under position certainty or uncertainty. In addition, the proposed recursive strategy makes the iterative result no longer dependent on the selection of initial position, and the iterative process is no longer interfered by the local optimal solution.

AB Object detection is one of the most important and challenging branches of computer vision, which has been widely applied in people's life, such as monitoring security, autonomous driving and so on, with the purpose of locating instances of semantic objects of a certain class. With the rapid development of deep learning algorithms for detection tasks, the performance of object detectors has been greatly improved. In order to understand the main development status of object detection pipeline thoroughly and deeply, in this survey, we analyze the methods of existing typical detection models and describe the benchmark datasets at first. Afterwards and primarily, we provide a comprehensive overview of a variety of object detection methods in a systematic manner, covering the one-stage and two-stage detectors. Moreover, we list the traditional and new applications. Some representative branches of object detection are analyzed as well. Finally, we discuss the architecture of exploiting these object detection methods to build an effective and efficient system and point out a set of development trends to better follow the state-of-the-art algorithms and further research.

AB Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are used in many robotic task classes from soccer to household chores. Determining an approximately optimal action policy for POMDPs is PSPACE-complete, and the exponential growth of computation time prohibits solving large tasks. This paper describes two techniques to extend the range of robotic tasks that can be solved using a POMDP. Our first technique reduces the motion constraints of a robot and, then, uses state-of-the-art robotic motion planning techniques to respect the true motion constraints at runtime. We then propose a novel task decomposition that can be applied to some indoor robotic tasks. This decomposition transforms a long time horizon task into a set of shorter tasks. We empirically demonstrate the performance gain provided by these two techniques through simulated execution in a variety of environments. Comparing a direct formulation of a POMDP to solving our proposed reductions, we conclude that the techniques proposed in this paper can provide significant enhancement to current POMDP solution techniques, extending the POMDP instances that can be solved to include large continuous-state robotic tasks.

AB In this paper, a novel kriging-based multi-fidelity method is proposed. Firstly, the model uncertainty of low-fidelity and high-fidelity models is quantified. On the other hand, the prediction uncertainty of kriging-based surrogate models(SM) is confirmed by its mean square error. After that, the integral uncertainty is acquired by math modeling. Meanwhile, the SMs are constructed through data from low-fidelity and high-fidelity models. Eventually, the low-fidelity (LF) and high-fidelity (HF) SMs with integral uncertainty are obtained and a proposed fusion algorithm is implemented. The fusion algorithm refers to the Kalman filter's idea of optimal estimation to utilize the independent information from different models synthetically. Through several mathematical examples implemented, the fused SM is certified that its variance is decreased and the fused results tend to the true value. In addition, an engineering example about autonomous underwater vehicles' hull design is provided to prove the feasibility of this proposed multi-fidelity method in practice. In the future, it will be a helpful tool to deal with reliability optimization of black-box problems and potentially applied in multidisciplinary design optimization.

AB Flocking is the way in which populations of animals like birds, fishes, and insects move together. In such cases, the global behavior of the team emerges as a consequence of local interactions among the neighboring members. This paper approaches the problem of letting a group of robots flock by resorting to a behavior-based control architecture, namely Null-Space-based Behavioral (NSB) control. Following such a control architecture, very simple behaviors for each robot are defined and properly arranged in priority in order to achieve the assigned mission. In particular, flocking is performed in a decentralized manner, that is, the behaviors of each robot only depend on local information concerning the robot's neighbors. In this paper, the flocking behavior is analyzed in a variety of conditions: with or without a moving rendez-vous point, in a two-or three-dimensional space and in presence of obstacles. Extensive simulations and experiments performed with a team of differential-drive mobile robots show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB In this paper, the trajectory tracking problem of controlling a constrained quadrotor with unmeasurable system states in an environment with stochastic wind-gust disturbance is considered. The mathematical model of the quadrotor is divided into the translational system and the rotational system, while only the measurement output of the quadrotor can be accessed. A new output-based control method is developed for solving this problem. In the translational control system, an output feedback stochastic model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is proposed to generate the optimal control sequence with less conservativeness, by taking into account the information on the distribution of the disturbances and the uncertainty resulting from the attitude tracking error. The closed-loop probabilistic constraints satisfaction, the recursive feasibility and the stability of the algorithm are further proved. In the rotational system, the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) method to estimate and compensate for external disturbances is leveraged and robust control for attitude tracking is accomplished. The convergence of the disturbance estimator and the stability proof are provided. Finally, the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy are verified by an illustrative example.

AB Robust and fast image recognition and matching is an important task in the underwater domain. The primary focus of this work is on extracting subsea features with sonar sensor for further Autonomous Underwater Vehicle navigation, such as the robotic localization and landmark mapping applications. With the assistance of high-resolution underwater features in the Side Scan Sonar (SSS) images, an efficient feature detector and descriptor, Speeded Up Robust Feature, is employed to seabed sonar image fusion task. In order to solve the nonlinear intensity difference problem in SSS images, the main novelty of this work is the proposed Underwater Wireless Sensor Network-based Delaunay Triangulation (UWSN-DT) algorithm for improving the performances of sonar map fusion accuracy with low computational complexity, in which the wireless nodes are considered as underwater feature points, since nodes could provide sufficiently useful information for the underwater map fusion, such as the location. In the simulated experiments, it shows that the presented UWSN-DT approach works efficiently and robustly, especially for the subsea environments where there are few distinguishable feature points.

TI MFAN: Mixing Feature Attention Network for trajectory prediction
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION
LA English
DT Article
DE Mixing feature attention; Trajectory prediction; Domain adaption
AB Accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding agents is essential for autonomous vehicles, where the key challenge is to understand the complex interactions among agents. Previous works treat all interacted features between agents equally in modeling interaction, while neglecting their different importance to the interaction, thus inevitably limiting the interaction modeling ability. Besides, existing methods suffer from significant performance degradation when domain shifts, resulting in severely deviant prediction from reality. To address these issues, we propose a novel prediction framework, dubbed Mixing Feature Attention Network (MFAN). Specifically, the proposed mixing feature attention is a parallel design to adaptively determine the importance of different interacted features and simultaneously capture the global interaction feature to improve interaction modeling. Meanwhile, the spatial global interaction is modeled from a spatial edge-featured graph input to capture the enhanced spatial interaction. The temporal motion pattern is modeled from a temporal edge-featured graph input to enhance the domain adaption. Finally, we estimate the parameters of bivariant Gaussian distribution for trajectory prediction. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance in trajectory prediction while maintaining low computational complexity and performs accurate prediction even when domain shifts.

AB Active tracking of space noncooperative object that merely relies on vision camera is greatly significant for autonomous rendezvous and debris removal. Considering its Partial Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) property, this letter proposes a novel deep recurrent neural network architecture, named as recurrent and attention module based active visual tracking (RAMAVT), incorporating Multi-Head Attention (MHA) module and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) layer that remarkably improve the representative ability of neural network with almost no extra computational cost. It has been successfully applied to value-based and policy gradient-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm, and learned to drive the chasing spacecraft to follow arbitrary space noncooperative object with high-frequency and near-optimal velocity control commands. Extensive experiments and robustness evaluations implemented on space non-cooperative object active tracking (SNCOAT) benchmark show the betterment and robustness of our method compared with other state-of-the-art active visual trackers. In addition, we make further ablation study and interpretability research on RAMAVT of which validity and rationality have been demonstrated.

AB This paper investigates the event-triggered-based pursuing and surrounding control of a multi-robotic fish system. A distributed surrounding control framework is put forward to deploy the whole system and enclose the dynamic evader into a convex hull. In particular, distributed kinematics-based motion predictions are hold for common agents in the multi-robotic fish system in addition to the evader. Based on the optimal state estimations, an innovative model-based event-triggered mechanism is tailored rather than frequent interactions to evaluate the importance of the messages. Afterwards, a two-stage position-based surrounding control method is provided. By arbitrating the trade-off between the control performance and interaction frequency, the event-triggered function is regulated to delicately execute the surrounding control task while sharply slashing the interactions. Finally, adequate simulations and experiments are conducted to ensure the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Therefore, whether for communication energy conservation or attack defense, the proposed method shows its significance for future marine assignments.

AB The bionic flapping-wing aircraft has the advantages of high flexibility and strong concealment; however, in the existing flapping-wing aircraft, the platform performance is influenced by the payload capacity, endurance, and durability; additionally, the mission capability is constrained, making it challenging to put into use in real-world scenarios. In response to this issue, this article offers a thorough design approach for a large-span flapping-wing aircraft, focusing on effective flapping wings, effective flapping mechanism design, and enhancement of flapping mechanism reliability, and ultimately realizing the design and verification of a new bionic flapping-wing aircraft with a large wingspan, called "Cloud Owl". It has a wingspan of 1.82 m and weighs 980 g. The aircraft is capable of autonomous flight and remote control, and it can carry a range of mission-specific equipment. More than 200 flights have been made by "Cloud Owl" so far in Xi'an, Beijing, Tianjin, Tibet, Ganzi, and other places. It has evolved into a flapping-wing aircraft platform with exceptional stability, payload capacity, and long endurance.

AB Recent advances in 3D object detection typically learn voxel-based or point-based representations on point clouds. Point-based methods preserve precise point positions but incur high computational load, whereas voxel-based methods rasterize unordered points into voxel grids efficiently but give rise to an accuracy bottleneck. To take advantage of voxel-and point-based representations, we develop an effective and efficient 3D object detector via a novel voxel-point geometry abstraction scheme. Our motivation is to use coarse voxel representation to accelerate proposal generation while using precise point representation to facilitate proposal refinement. For voxel representation learning, we propose a context enrichment module with a novel 3D sparse interpolation layer to augment raw points with multi-scale context. We further develop a point-based RoI pooling module with explicit position augmentation for proposal refinement. Extensive experiments on the widely used KITTI Dataset and the latest Waymo Open Dataset show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art point-voxel-based methods while running at 24 FPS on the TITAN XP GPU.

AB Cooperative localization (CL) is a popular research topic in the area of localization. Research is becoming more focused on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and robots and less on pedestrians. This is because UAVs and robots can work in formation, but pedestrians cannot. In this study, we develop an adaptive decentralized cooperative localization (DCL) algorithm for a group of firefighters. Every member maintains a local filter and estimates the position and the relative measurement noise covariance is estimated rather than a fixed value. We derived the explicit expressions for the inter-member collaboration instead of using approximations. This method reduces the influence of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) errors in the ultra-wideband (UWB) ranging on the CL, eliminating the need for fixed UWB anchors. The proposed algorithm was validated by two experiments designed in the building and forest environments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improved the accuracy of localization, and the proposed algorithm suppressed the localization errors by 14.23% and 47.01% compared to the decentralized cooperative localization extended Kalman filter (DCLEKF) algorithm, respectively.

AB The launch and recovery of equipment such as remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) is a critical task that defines the operability limits of many marine operations. This paper considers the analysis of control systems that are designed to maximize the operability limits for launch and recovery of a ROV from a small unmanned surface vessel (USV). We use numerical simulation for the analysis, where the method combines recent approaches for wave compensating dynamic positioning, active heave compensation, and positioning control of the ROV with multi-body dynamic simulation of the surface vessel and ROV, including hydrodynamic forces and dynamic interactions from wires that depend on the ROV depth and moonpool. The results show that the choice of control algorithms and their tuning parameters has a significant effect on the system's operability, and should be carefully designed and tuned to optimize the operability limits for any given sea state, weather and operational setup. The results show that numerical analysis with a system's simulation is an effective tool to verify operability and its sensitivity to various parameters for the given ROV recovery application.

AB A heuristic fast marching (FM*)-based comprehensive path planning system involving task allocation, initial planning, and replanning is presented for the robotic floating garbage cleaning mission. There are three primary contributions in this paper. First, to tackle the invalidation of the Euclidean distance metric in the obstacle environment, the task allocation is modeled as a travelling salesman problem (TSP) employing the FM*-based distance metric in order to obtain an optimal travel sequence. Second, to meet the maneuverability constraint from the surface robot and avoid the collision, a Gaussian filter is employed to adjust the curvature radius of the generated path. Third, for an efficient replanning, a neural network-based replanning point generator with the input of garbage movement vector is provided to strike a compromise for the distance cost and the computational burden. Moreover, a case study and a virtual obstacle experiment in the laboratory water tank demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed comprehensive path planning system. This work lays a firm foundation for the development of intelligent equipment for aquatic environment protection.

AB Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) allows for high-resolution imagery of the seafloor with a quality that approaches that of an optical camera. Identifying seabed types within SAS images can prove very useful in a setting where autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are used, since information about the bottom type can be used to determine the behavior of the AUV. In this article, we present a new algorithm for the automatic detection of different seabed types based on SAS image texture. Using a Gaussian process classification (GPC) model, we were able to predict the seabed type, as well as an uncertainty estimate on this prediction. The GPC-based model is able to learn the most informative textures from a training data set, and by construction is robust against outliers or data points that are very different from those in the training set. An additional benefit of the model is that it can be easily configured to hit the desired tradeoff between computational complexity and accuracy.

AB Semantic segmentation plays a vital role in autonomous vehicles. Fusing the rich details of RGB image and the illumination robustness of thermal image has great potential to improve the performance of RGB-T semantic segmentation. In multispectral feature fusion, the current main methods are less effective in the characterization of correlations and complementarities of RGB-T. In order to generate robust cross-spectral fusion features, we propose a multispectral fusion transformer network (MFTNet). Specifically, we first design an MFT module to handle the intraspectra correlation and the interspectra complementarity of RGB-T in the multispectral fusion encoder. MFT effectively enhances the RGB-T feature representation under various challenges. Then, an optimization strategy with progressive deep supervision (PDS) loss is proposed to directly supervise the upper and lower layers of the decoder. This strategy can guide the decoder to achieve precise segmentation in a coarse-to-fine manner. Finally, plenty of experimental results prove the effectiveness of our method. On the MFNet dataset, MFNet achieved 74.7 mAcc and 57.3 mIoU, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is a promising technology for enabling future internet-of-things applications particularly with battery-limited devices including autonomous vehicles, mobile robots, and distributed sensors. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in millimeter wave (mmWave) SWIPT because a wider energy coverage is provided by mmWave power transfer using a large antenna array than lower frequency solutions. However, research on mmWave SWIPT systems is lacking especially with practical hardware in spite of its importance. In particular, transmitter, information receivers, and nonlinear energy harvesters should be jointly designed under the constraints of transmit power and analog-digital hybrid beamforming structure. In this paper, we develop a joint design of transmit power allocation, beamforming, and receive power splitting for SWIPT downlink systems in wideband mmWave channel. The proposed scheme relies on the limited feedback of channel information. Also, the rate-energy region of the proposed mmWave SWIPT system is analyzed and the performance is verified by simulations.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE STORAGE; THROUGHPUT; DESIGN; TIME
AB Automatic warehouses need to balance speed, cost, flexibility, and energy consumption to support the responsiveness, efficiency, and sustainability of modern supply chains. This paper explores environmentally friendly velocity and acceleration configurations of the Shuttle-Based Storage and Retrieval Systems (SBS/RS) under throughput requirement. This study develops an energy consumption model for the SBS/RS with cross shuttles operating on a dual-command-cycle basis and estimates the maximum throughput, travel time and energy consumption. Numerical experiments explore the optimal velocity profiles with the least energy consumption under different throughput requirements. The results show that the lift velocity and acceleration are the leading factors influencing energy consumption. Increasing the accelerations of aisle and cross shuttles can moderately reduce travel times and improve storage efficiency, without hurting energy consumption. Besides, this paper also identifies the relationship between throughput capacity and energy consumption. Overall, this study provides insights on the SBS/RS configurations under given throughput requirements and environmental performance and builds a green decision-making basis for automatic warehouse designers and managers.

DT Article

ID UAV; TRACKING
AB Pose measurement is a necessary technology for UAV navigation. Accurate pose measurement is the most important guarantee for a UAV stable flight. UAV pose measurement methods mostly use image matching with aircraft models or 2D points corresponding with 3D points. These methods will lead to pose measurement errors due to inaccurate contour and key feature point extraction. In order to solve these problems, a pose measurement method based on the structural characteristics of aircraft rigid skeleton is proposed in this paper. The depth information is introduced to guide and label the 2D feature points to eliminate the feature mismatch and segment the region. The space points obtained from the marked feature points fit the space linear equation of the rigid skeleton, and the UAV attitude is calculated by combining with the geometric model. This method does not need cooperative identification of the aircraft model, and can stably measure the position and attitude of short-range UAV in various environments. The effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method are verified by experiments on a visual simulation platform. The method proposed can prevent aircraft collision and ensure the safety of UAV navigation in autonomous refueling or formation flight.

AB The development of the smart ocean requires that various features of the ocean be explored and understood. The Underwater Internet of Things (UIoT), an extension of the Internet of Things (IoT) to the underwater environment, constitutes powerful technology for achieving the smart ocean. This article provides an overview of the UIoT with emphasis on current advances, future system architecture, applications, challenges, and open issues. The UIoT is enabled by the most recent developments in autonomous underwater vehicles, smart sensors, underwater communication technologies, and underwater routing protocols. In the coming years, the UIoT is expected to bridge diverse technologies for sensing the ocean, allowing it to become a smart network of interconnected underwater objects that has self-learning and intelligent computing capabilities. This article first provides a horizontal overview of the UIoT. Then, we present a five-layer system architecture for the future UIoT, which consists of a sensing, communication, networking, fusion, and application layer. Finally, we suggest the current challenges and the future UIoT research trends, in which cloud computing, fog computing, and artificial intelligence are combined.

DT Article
ID WATER; SPECTRA
AB Marine measurement instrumentation, such as free-floating wave buoys, drones, and autonomous unmanned vehicles, often propagates in different directions and velocities relative to the fluid and waves. Convention assumes that these different instrumentations provide Galilean invariant descriptions of the wave field. Herein, it is shown that Galilean invariance exists for the water wave problem only in a restricted sense. The impact of this loss of invariance is investigated using a new formulation of the water wave problem, which is generalized for both current and an arbitrary inertial viewer. In the still water limit, the boundary value problem is shown to be non-invariant under Galilean transformations. This impacts the dispersion relation and interpretation of measurements. It also explains the appearance of wave modes on current, which have no analogy on still water. These modes do not appear in a still water formulation because it is a degenerate representation exhibiting a loss of Galilean symmetries. The approach provides a more complete solution of the wave-current boundary value problem by making a clear distinction between current and viewer velocity effects. Numerical examples that demonstrate the importance of the results on calculating wave characteristics are given.

TI Clustering Cloud-Like Model-Based Targets Underwater Tracking for AUVs

DT Article
DE AUV; data association; clustering cloud-like model; underwater objects
   tracking
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) rely on a mechanically scanned imaging sonar that is fixedly mounted on AUVs for underwater target barrier-avoiding and tracking. When underwater targets cross or approach each other, AUVs sometimes fail to track, or follow the wrong target because of the incorrect association of the multi-target. Therefore, a tracking method adopting the cloud-like model data association algorithm is presented in order to track underwater multiple targets. The clustering cloud-like model (CCM) not only combines the fuzziness and randomness of the qualitative concept, but also achieves the conversion of the quantitative values. Additionally, the nearest neighbor algorithm is also involved in finding the cluster center paired to each target trajectory, and the hardware architecture of AUVs is proposed. A sea trial adopting a mechanically scanned imaging sonar fixedly mounted on an AUV is carried out in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Experiment results demonstrate that compared with the joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) and near neighbor data association (NNDA) algorithms, the new algorithm has the characteristic of more accurate clustering.

AB This paper discusses results of the CLOUD-MAP(Collaboration Leading Operational UAS Development for Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics) project dedicated to developing, fielding, and evaluating integrated small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) for enhanced atmospheric physics measurements. The project team includes atmospheric scientists, meteorologists, engineers, computer scientists, geographers, and chemists necessary to evaluate the needs and develop the advanced sensing and imaging, robust autonomous navigation, enhanced data communication, and data management capabilities required to use sUAS in atmospheric physics. Annual integrated evaluation of the systems in coordinated field tests are being used to validate sensor performance while integrated into various sUAS platforms. This paper focuses on aspects related to atmospheric sampling of thermodynamic parameters with sUAS, specifically sensor integration and calibration/validation, particularly as it relates to boundary layer profiling. Validation of sensor output is performed by comparing measurements with known values, including instrumented towers, radiosondes, and other validated sUAS platforms. Experiments to determine the impact of sensor location and vehicle operation have been performed, with sensor aspiration a major factor. Measurements are robust provided that instrument packages are properly mounted in locations that provide adequate air flow and proper solar shielding.

AB High-resolution, near-seafloor magnetic data have been acquired over the 16 degrees N hypermagmatic segment of the East-Pacific Rise using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle. This survey proves to be ideal to test the relative efficiency of various inversion methods applied to data acquired at a more or less constant altitude above the seafloor. Unlike other methods, a recently published Bayesian inversion preserves the short wavelengths and allows for the resolution of a high-resolution reduced-to-the-pole magnetic anomaly. This anomaly unveils the presence of several laterally adjacent dykes associated with individually separated Axial Summit Troughs. The observation of such anomalies, and therefore of shallow dykes, confirms the hypermagmatic character of the segment in a location where complex magma chambers have been imaged in seismic reflection studies. Variable intensity of the magnetic anomalies reflects the depth of the dyke swarms and, ultimately, the timing and style of eruptive events, helping to constrain the spreading axis evolution.

AB Robots are meant to replace humans for a broad variety of everyday tasks, such as environmental monitoring or patrolling large public areas for security assurance. The main focus of researchers and practitioners has been on providing tailored software and hardware solutions for very specific and often complex tasks. On one hand, these solutions show great potential and provide advanced capabilities for solving the specific task. On the other hand, the polarized attention to task-specific solutions makes them hard to reuse, customize, and combine. In this paper we propose a family of domain-specific modeling languages for the specification of civilian missions of mobile multi-robot systems. These missions are meant to be described in terms of models that are: 1) closer to the general problem domain; 2) independent from the underlying technologies; 3) ready to be analyzed, simulated, and executed; and 4) extensible to new application domains, thus opening up the use of robots to even non-technical operators. Moreover, we show the applicability of the proposed family of languages in two real-world application domains: unmanned multicopters and autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is the task of determining a path that passes over all points of an area or volume of interest while avoiding obstacles. This task is integral to many robotic applications, such as vacuum cleaning robots, painter robots, autonomous underwater vehicles creating image mosaics, demining robots, lawn mowers, automated harvesters, window cleaners and inspection of complex structures, just to name a few. A considerable body of research has addressed the CPP problem. However, no updated surveys on CPP reflecting recent advances in the field have been presented in the past ten years. In this paper, we present a review of the most successful CPP methods, focusing on the achievements made in the past decade. Furthermore, we discuss reported field applications of the described CPP methods. This work aims to become a starting point for researchers who are initiating their endeavors in CPP. Likewise, this work aims to present a comprehensive review of the recent breakthroughs in the field, providing links to the most interesting and successful works. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

DE Calibration; Autonomous vehicles; Solid state LiDAR; Multi-sensor fusion
AB This work proposes an extrinsic calibration approach designed for the alignment of a monocular camera with a prism-spinning solid-state LiDAR. Challenges arise due to the absence of adjacent laser rings, which are essential for the detection of line or plane features, in solid-state LiDAR systems. Additionally, the existence of a distinct type of outlier, designated as 'vacant points', complicates the task of feature extraction, particularly those reliant on depth variation. In contrast to existing methods that leverage reflectivity variation in depth-continuous measurements to circumvent this issue, we use depth discontinuous measurements to retain more valid features by efficient removal of the vacant points. The detected 3D corners thus contain more robust a priori information than usual which, together with the 2D corners detected by camera and constrained by our proposed rules, produce accurate extrinsic estimates. The efficacy of our algorithm is thoroughly evaluated through real-world field experiments, encompassing both qualitative and quantitative performance assessments. The results show its superiority over existing algorithms. Moreover, robustness tests demonstrate the algorithm's resilience, particularly in feature-barren outdoor environments. The code is available on GitHub.

AB A combined Truck-drone system that delivers packages from a warehouse to multiple customers is investigated. The truck movements are restricted to the potential stops from which the drone with limited capacity takes off or lands. The aim is to determine both the best or 'optimal' sequence of the drone delivery trips and the best or 'optimal' trucks stops that will minimize the total combined truck drone delivery cost. This is an innovative delivery process which also falls under the umbrella of last mile delivery which is known to be one of the most challenging activities within logistics. The problem is first formulated as a 0-1 Linear programming model. A Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) algorithm is then designed. The proposed metaheuristic is assessed on test problems from the online TSP library. A sensitivity analysis which examines the effect of a neighborhood removal, and the neighborhood sequencing is carried out. The metaheuristic has also shown to be reliable when tested against our mathematical model using the commercial optimizer CPLEX. Interesting overall results are discovered which demonstrate the robustness of the proposed VNS.

AB The probability of collisions at sea has increased in recent years. Furthermore, passive collision avoidance has some disadvantages, such as low economic efficiency, while active collision avoidance techniques have some limitations. As a result of the advancement of computer technology, active collision avoidance techniques have also been optimized by using artificial intelligence-based methods. The purpose of this paper is to further the development of the field. After reviewing some passive collision avoidance schemes, the paper discusses the potential of active obstacle avoidance techniques. A time-tracing approach is used to review the evolution of active obstacle avoidance techniques, followed by a review of the main traditional active obstacle avoidance techniques. In this paper, different artificial intelligence algorithms are reviewed and analyzed. As a result of the analysis and discussion in this paper, some limitations in this field are identified. In addition, there are some suggestions and outlooks for addressing those limitations. In a way, the paper can serve as a guide for the development of the field.

AB DRONEVAC describes a highly innovative concept to treat and transport severely injured or medically endangered patients. It is based on the most recent scientific data revealing that the combination of very few but effective lifesaving maneuvers with an autonomous most rapid airborne transport might have a substantial impact on patient survival. DRONEVAC is planned as an addition to existing rescue systems for preserving critical resources, such as medical staff or transportation vehicles. It can be utilized in potential mass casualty incidents in the civil setting, such as flooding and terrorist bombing as well as for military scenarios. The medical concept is very pragmatic: first line treatment is applied based on the MARCH criteria from tactical combat casualty care (TCCC): bleeding control by tourniquets and hemostatics, airway control by nasopharyngeal tube and needle thoracic decompression, hypothermia prevention by heating inside the drone. Additionally, the vital signs of the patient are monitored using telemedical devices and the operator can communicate with the trauma victim to prevent panic reactions. Transport is performed by an autonomously flying high-tech hexacopter drone.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-assisted data collection is an efficient approach to im-plementing smart ocean. However, the data collec-tion in time-varying ocean currents is plagued by two critical issues: AUV yaw and sensor node movement. We propose an adaptive AUV-assisted data collection strategy for ocean currents to address these issues. First, we consider the energy consumption of an AUV in conjunction with the value of information (VoI) over the sensor nodes and formulate an optimization prob-lem to maximize the VoI-energy ratio. The AUV yaw problem is then solved by deriving the AUV's reach-able region in different ocean current environments and the optimal cruising direction to the target nodes. Finally, using the predicted VoI-energy ratio, we se-quentially design a distributed path planning algorithm to select the next target node for AUV. The simula-tion results indicate that the proposed strategy can uti-lize ocean currents to aid AUV navigation, thereby re-ducing the AUV's energy consumption and ensuring timely data collection.

AB Priority-based logistics and the polarization of drones in civil aviation will cause an extraordinary disturbance in the ecosystem of future airborne intelligent transportation networks. A dynamic invention needs dynamic sophistication for sustainability and security to prevent abusive use. Trustworthy and dependable designs can provide accurate risk assessment of autonomous aerial vehicles. Using deep neural networks and related technologies, this study proposes an artificial intelligence (AI) collaborative surveillance strategy for identifying, verifying, validating, and responding to malicious use of drones in a drone transportation network. The dataset for simulation consists of 3600 samples of 9 distinct conveyed objects and 7200 samples of the visioDECT dataset obtained from 6 different drone types flown under 3 different climatic circumstances (evening, cloudy, and sunny) at different locations, altitudes, and distance. The ALIEN model clearly demonstrates high rationality across all metrics, with an F1-score of 99.8%, efficiency with the lowest noise/error value of 0.037, throughput of 16.4 Gbps, latency of 0.021, and reliability of 99.9% better than other SOTA models, making it a suitable, proactive, and real-time avionic vehicular technology enabler for sustainable and secured DTS.

AB Traffic sign detection and recognition (TSDR) plays an important role in the fields for assistant driving, autonomous vehicle and so on. However, due to the complexity of real driving scene and variety of traffic signs, many challenging problems occurred, such as inaccurate color segmentation and time consumption of recognition algorithm based on deep learning. This paper describes an approach for efficiently detection and recognizing in real world scenarios. First of all, a traffic sign region of interest extraction algorithm based on multi-color space is proposed, the fusion future of HSV and RGB color space can obtain better color segmentation for the SVM classifier. Next a novel multi-scale two-stage lightweight network (MSTSN) is investigated, which adopts a coarse-to-fine strategy to improve recognition accuracy. Specially, the candidate Region of Interests (ROIs) are fed into a binary classification layer and only positive ones are further classified with multi-class classification network. The deeply separable convolution, residual structure and feature enhancement module is the bottleneck of MSTSN, which obtains more discriminative features and meets requirement for real-time performance. The experimental results successfully demonstrate effectiveness of our method.

AB A self-contained autonomous dead reckoning (DR) system is desired to complement the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) for land vehicles, for which the odometer-aided inertial navigation system (ODO/INS) is a classical solution. In this study, we use a wheel-mounted MEMS IMU (Wheel-IMU) to substitute the odometer, and further, investigate three types of measurement models, including the velocity measurement, displacement increment measurement, and contact point zero-velocity measurement, in the Wheel-IMU based DR system. The measurement produced by the Wheel-IMU along with the non-holonomic constraint (NHC) are fused with INS through an error-state extended Kalman filter (EKF). Theoretical discussion and field tests illustrate the feasibility and equivalence of the three measurements in terms of the overall DR performance. The maximum horizontal position drifts are all less than 2% of the total travelled distance. Additionally, the displacement increment measurement model is less sensitive to the lever arm error between the Wheel-IMU and the wheel center.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB Drivable area detection is one of the essential functions of autonomous vehicles. However, due to the complexity and diversity of unknown environments, it remains a challenge specifically on rough roads. In this paper, we propose a systematical framework for drivable area detection, including ground segmentation and road labelling. For each scan, the point cloud is projected onto two different planes simultaneously, generating an elevation map and a range map. Different from the existing methods based on mathematical models, we accomplish the ground segmentation using image processing methods. Subsequently, road points will be filtered out from ground points and used to generate the road area with the assistance of a range map. Meanwhile, a two-step search method is utilized to create the reachable area from an elevation map. For the robustness of drivable area detection, Bayesian decision theory is introduced in the final step to fuse the road area and the reachable area. Since we explicitly avoid complex three-dimensional computation, our method, from both empirical and theoretical perspectives, has a high real-time capability, and experimental results also show it has promising detection performance in various traffic situations.

AB The multiple light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system has been attached to numerous autonomous vehicles to reduce blind spot risks and increase measurement resolution. It is also important to accurately aligning multi-LiDAR data because misaligned sensor data can affect the localization and perception algorithms of LiDAR sensors. However, precise extrinsic parameter estimation is a challenging research area because the feature points in LiDAR data cannot be precisely aligned owing to the LiDAR resolution. In this paper, we proposed a targetless multi-LiDAR calibration method without any initial information. In the proposed approach, a random sample consensus (RANSAC)-based plane fitting technique was utilized for plane extraction, and cross-feature points were extracted from the polar view transform of segmented planes. To resolve the discontinuity problem of optimization, a nonlinear optimization method was utilized, and the experiments were performed within a structured environment. Overall, the experimental results showed that the proposed method yields comparable results with state-of-the-art methods.

AB Research in quantum communications networks (QCNs), where multiple users desire to generate or transmit common quantum-secured information, is still in its beginning stage. To solve for the problems of both discrete variable- and continuous variable-quantum key distribution (QKD) schemes in a simultaneous manner as well as to enable the next generation of quantum communication networking, in this Special Issue paper we describe a scenario where disconnected terrestrial QCNs are coupled through low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite quantum network forming heterogeneous satellite-terrestrial QCN. The proposed heterogeneous QCN is based on the cluster state approach and can be used for numerous applications, including: (i) to teleport arbitrary quantum states between any two nodes in the QCN; (ii) to enable the next generation of cyber security systems; (iii) to enable distributed quantum computing; and (iv) to enable the next generation of quantum sensing networks. The proposed QCNs will be robust against various channel impairments over heterogeneous links. Moreover, the proposed QCNs will provide an unprecedented security level for 5G+/6G wireless networks, Internet of Things (IoT), optical networks, and autonomous vehicles, to mention a few.

AB Traditional dense stereo estimation algorithms measure photo-similarity to calculate the disparity between image pairs. SymStereo is a new framework of matching cost functions that measure symmetry to evaluate the possibility of two pixels being a match. This article proposes a fully functional real-time parallel 3D reconstruction pipeline that uses dense stereo-based photo-symmetry. The logN variant of SymStereo achieves superior results for images with slanted surfaces, when compared with other algorithms (Antunes and Barreto in Int J Comput Vis 1-22, 2014). This is of particular interest for areas of computer vision such as the processing of datasets for urban scene reconstruction and also for tracking in robotics or intelligent autonomous vehicles. The output results obtained are analyzed by tuning distinct matching cost, aggregation and refinement parameters, targeting the most suitable combinations for slant dominated images. Also, the parallel approach for the aforementioned pipeline consists of a hybrid dual GPU system capable of calculating from 2 up to 132 volumes per second for high- and low-resolution images, respectively.

AB Although a number of solutions exist for the problems of coverage, search, and target localization-commonly addressed separately-whether there exists a unified strategy that addresses these objectives in a coherent manner without being application specific remains a largely open research question. In this paper, we develop a receding-horizon ergodic control approach, based on hybrid systems theory, that has the potential to fill this gap. The nonlinear model-predictive control algorithm plans real-time motions that optimally improve ergodicity with respect to a distribution defined by the expected information density across the sensing domain. We establish a theoretical framework for global stability guarantees with respect to a distribution. Moreover, the approach is distributable across multiple agents so that each agent can independently compute its own control while sharing statistics of its coverage across a communication network. We demonstrate the method in both simulation and in experiment in the context of target localization, illustrating that the algorithm is independent of the number of targets being tracked and can be run in real time on computationally limited hardware platforms.

AB This paper presents a symbolic pattern analysis method for robust feature extraction from sidescan sonar images that are generated from autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The proposed data-driven algorithm, built upon the concepts of symbolic dynamics and automata theory, is used for detection of mines and mine-like objects in the undersea environment. This real-time algorithm is based on symbolization of the data space via coarse graining, i.e., partitioning of the two-dimensional sonar images. The statistical information, in terms of stochastic matrices that serve as features, is extracted from the symbolized images by construction of probabilistic finite state automata. A binary classifier is designed for discrimination of detected objects into mine-like and nonmine-like categories. The pattern analysis algorithm has been validated on sonar images generated in the exploration phase of a mine hunting operation; these data have been provided by the Naval Surface Warfare Center. The algorithm is formulated for real-time execution on limited-memory commercial-of-the-shelf platforms and is capable of detecting objects on the seabed-bottom.

AB We have researched on long horizontal time-reversal communication in the deep ocean, to be used for communication with autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in future, and proposed the method of combining time reversal with adaptive equalization. The pervious at-experiments were carried out at the ranges from 10 to 100 km with a virtual time-reversal array. In our latest sea trial, the experiment for passive time-reversal communication was executed with a real receiver array at the range of 300 km. This was the first implementation of time-reversal communication at such a range as an experiment intended for communication including the source movement. In this experiment, the source was suspended from the research vessel, thus drifted due to the ship motion. The proposed method could achieve error-free demodulation in spite of such drifting motion. The M-sequence signal and chirp pulse were used as the probe signal for passive time reversal. The results in case of M-sequence were better than those in case of chirp pulse.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH

ID MOBILE ROBOT; ALGORITHM; OBSTACLES
AB The standard shortest path planning problem determines a collision-free path of shortest distance between two distinct locations in an environment scattered with obstacles. This problem, in:fact, corresponds to a special case of the weighted region problem, in which the environment is partitioned into a set of regions, with some regions (obstacles) having an associated weight of infinity and other regions (free space) having a weight of 1. For the general weighted region problem, the environment consists of regions, each of which is associated with a certain weight factor A path through the weighted region incurs a cost that is determined by the geometric distance of the path in that region times that region's weight factor. The weighted region problem can be used to model path planning for autonomous vehicles over different environmental terrains. This paper studies the problem of computing a shortest path between two distinct locations through a 2D or 3D environment consisting of weighted regions. The authors propose a novel cell decomposition approach based on new framed-subspace data structures: the weighted framed-quadtree and the weighted framed-octree.

AB This paper reports new results in the development of Linguistic Geometry towards concurrent multiagent aerospace systems. This formal theory is intended to discover the inner properties of human expert heuristics, which have been successful in a certain class of complex control systems, and apply them to different systems. The Linguistic Geometry relies on the formalization of search heuristics of the highly-skilled human experts, which allow for the decomposition of a complex system into a dynamic hierarchy of subsystems, and thus solve intractable problems by reducing the search dramatically. In this paper, we consider briefly the Linguistic Geometry tools and their application to multiagent systems represented 2D optimization problems for autonomous robotic vehicles in aerospace environment. First, we consider only serial motions, then we relax these constraints by allowing the cooperating agents move simultaneously if necessary while the motions of opposing agents alternate. Next we relax these constraints completely by allowing all the agents move simultaneously if necessary. A comparison of the searches for serial and concurrent cases shows that search reduction achieved in all types of problems with concurrent motions is even more dramatic than it was in the serial one.

AB Despite the increased access to scientific publications and data as a result of open science initiatives, access to scientific tools remains limited. Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones) can be a powerful tool for research in disciplines such as agriculture and environmental sciences, but their use in research is currently dominated by proprietary, closed source tools. The objective of this work was to collect, curate, organize and test a set of open source tools for aerial data capture for research purposes. The Open Science Drone Toolkit was built through a collaborative and iterative process by more than 100 people in five countries, and comprises an open-hardware autonomous drone and off-the-shelf hardware, open-source software, and guides and protocols that enable the user to perform all the necessary tasks to obtain aerial data. Data obtained with this toolkit over a wheat field was compared to data from satellite imagery and a commercial hand-held sensor, finding a high correlation for both instruments. Our results demonstrate the possibility of capturing research-grade aerial data using affordable, accessible, and customizable open source software and hardware, and using open workflows.

AB In the present literature, various algorithms are available for computing the shortest path between two objects. The maximum number of these algorithms compute the shortest path either between two static objects or one static object and one dynamic object. This article presents an insight to integrated Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) based smart devices for tracking mobile rogue objects based on dynamic source and dynamic destination optimal cost estimation. This device considers any two mobile objects to estimate the shortest path between them. The proposed Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based algorithm considers the property of dead-end removal and nth path exploration with efficient self-loop removal strategy. To review the performance of the proposed algorithm, experimentations are carried out and compared with several well-established shortest cost estimation techniques available in the literature - Floyd Warshall, Bellman Ford, Dijkstra, A* algorithms and the only dynamic shortest path algorithm. The detailed algorithmic comparisons clearly indicate the superiority of the proposed one over the existing dynamic and present state-of-the-art shortest path estimation methodologies.

AB This paper aims to achieve highly accurate mapping results and real time pose estimation of autonomous vehicle by using the normal distribution transform (NDT) algoritm. A factor graph optimization algorithm (FGO-NDT) is proposed to address the poor real-time performance and pose drift errors of the NDT algorithm. Smooth point cloud data are obtained by multisensor calibration and data preprocessing. NDT registration is then used for lidar odometry and feature matching. The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data and loop detection results are added to the factor graph framework as the pose constraint factors to optimize the pose trajectory and eliminate the pose drift error generated during mapping. In addition, a sliding window method is used for map registration to extract a local map to shorten the map loading time. Thus, the real-time performance of creating point cloud maps of large scenes is significantly improved. Several experiments are conducted in different environments to verify the accuracy and performance of the FGO-NDT. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can eliminate the pose estimation error caused by drift, improve the local structure, and reduce and root mean square error.

AB To achieve a fully autonomous navigation for unmanned surface vessels (USVs), a robust control capability is essential. The control of USVs in complex maritime environments is rather challenging as numerous system uncertainties and environmental influences affect the control performance. This paper therefore investigates the trajectory tracking control problem for USVs with motion constraints and environmental disturbances. Two different controllers are proposed to achieve the task. The first approach is mainly based on the backstepping technique augmented by a virtual system to compensate for the disturbance and an auxiliary system to bound the input in the saturation limit. The second control scheme is mainly based on the normalisation technique, with which the bound of the input can be limited in the constraints by tuning the control parameters. The stability of the two control schemes is demonstrated by the Lyapunov theory. Finally, simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controllers. The introduced solutions enable USVs to follow complex trajectories in an adverse environment with varying ocean currents.

ID CHALLENGES
AB As one of the key technologies for realizing a fully digitalized world, the Internet of Things (IoT) requires ubiquitous connections across both land and sea. However, due to lack of infrastructure such as optical fibers and base stations, maritime communications inevitably face a highly complex and heterogeneous environment, which greatly challenges the connection reliability and traffic steering efficiency for future service-oriented maritime IoT. With the recent burgeoning application of artificial intelligence (AI) in many fields, an AI-empowered autonomous network for maritime IoT is envisioned as a promising solution. However, AI typically involves training/learning processes, which require realistic data/environment in order to obtain valuable outcomes. To this end, this article proposes the parallel network, which can be regarded as the "digital twin" of the real network and is responsible for realizing four key functionalities: self-learning and optimizing, state inference and network cognition, event prediction and anomaly detection, and knowledge database and snapshots. We then explain how various AI methods can facilitate the operation of the parallel- network-driven maritime network. A case study is provided to demonstrate the idea. Research directions are also outlined for further studies.

ID SUPPRESSION
AB In this study, we propose a method to recognize road environments with automotive frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar systems. For automotive radar systems on the road, diverse road environments are observed. Each road environment generates unnecessary echoes known as clutter, and the magnitude distribution of received radar signal varies depending on road structures. Therefore, it is necessary to classify the road environment and adopt a target detection algorithm suitable for each road environment characteristic. To recognize the road environment in advance, it is necessary to identify the section where the road environment changes. In this paper, we define a changed road area as a transition region, and we classify the road environment and transition regions to improve the road environment recognition performance. Road environments are recognized by applying convolutional neural networks to the frequency-domain received signals of 77 GHz FMCW automotive radar systems. Experimental results in real-road environments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 100% recognition performance, which is better if compared with that of the conventional methods.

AB In the era of a ubiquitous Internet of Things and fast artificial intelligence advance, especially thanks to deep learning networks and hardware acceleration, we face rapid growth of highly decentralized and intelligent solutions that offer functionality of data processing closer to the end user. Internet of Things usually produces a huge amount of data that to be effectively analyzed, especially with neural networks, demands high computing capabilities. Processing all the data in the cloud may not be sufficient in cases when we need privacy and low latency, and when we have limited Internet bandwidth, or it is simply too expensive. It poses a challenge for creating a new generation of fog computing that supports artificial intelligence and selects the architecture appropriate for an intelligent solution. In this article, we show from four perspectives, namely, hardware, software libraries, platforms, and current applications, the landscape of components used for developing intelligent Internet of Things solutions located near where the data are generated. This way, we pinpoint the odds and risks of artificial intelligence fog computing and help in the process of selecting suitable architecture and components that will satisfy all requirements defined by the complex Internet of Things systems.

AB This paper introduces a new method for calculating distances between matrix sequences of different length. Matrix sequences are often used in spatiotemporal analysis, a field of research combining topological frameworks and temporal reasoning. The Qualitative Trajectory Calculus, a spatiotemporal calculus using matrix sequences, is used as an example in this paper. Since current approaches for comparing sequences are not suitable to calculate distances between matrix sequences of different length, a new method is proposed. The method is based on sequence alignment and uses the Levenshtein distance metric as starting point. The method is presented in general at first, followed by an application to QTC-matrix sequences and a three cushion billiards movement pattern detection example. Possible applications in expert and intelligent systems are discussed, such as human-robot interaction with multiple robots, and automated traffic analysis of (autonomous) vehicle interactions. The proposed method, however, can be applied in a broad range of domains, whenever distances need to be calculated between matrix sequences of different length. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A new acoustic positioning method for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) that uses a single underwater hydrophone is proposed in this paper to solve problems of Long Baseline (LBL) array laying and communication synchronisation problems among all hydrophones in the traditional method. The proposed system comprises a Strapdown Inertial Navigation System (SINS), a single hydrophone installed at the bottom of the AUV and a single underwater sound source that emits signals periodically. A matrix of several virtual hydrophones is formed with the movement of the AUV. In every virtual LBL window, the time difference from the transmitted sound source to each virtual hydrophone is obtained by means of a Smooth Coherent Transformation (SCOT) weighting cross-correlation in the frequency domain. Then, the recent location of the AUV can be calculated. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method can effectively compensate for the position error of SINS. Thus, the positioning accuracy can be confined to 2 m, and the method achieves good applicability. Compared with traditional underwater acoustic positioning systems, the proposed method can provide great convenience in engineering implementation and can reduce costs.

AB This paper presents path planning using reconfigurable analog very large scale integrated (AVLSI) circuits. Existing research has shown that custom AVLSI circuits known as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) can theoretically be used for path planning. There are two main drawbacks to using custom ASICs: 1) circuit designs are fixed to some extent (not changeable) and 2) long design cycle/fabrication time (order of months). Reconfigurable analog circuits called field-programmable analog arrays (FPAAs) have been used to implement a variety of AVLSI circuits in a short time (order of minutes). This paper presents an algorithm for mapping a robot's environment onto an FPAA, and then presents hardware results using an FPAA to implement the path-planning algorithm. Experimental results and analysis are presented for 24 environment scenarios. Digital search methods like breadth-first search have solutions which scale on the order of O(4(d)) whereas this paper will show our analog solution is on the order of O(d) where d is the depth of the solution.

AB Recently, stereo matching processors have been adopted in real-time embedded systems such as intelligent robots and autonomous vehicles, which require minimal hardware resources and low power consumption. Meanwhile, thanks to the through-silicon via (TSV), three-dimensional (3D) stacking technology has emerged as a practical solution to achieving the desired requirements of a high-performance circuit. In this paper, we present the benefits of 3D stacking and process technology scaling on stereo matching processors. We implemented 2-tier 3D-stacked stereo matching processors with GlobalFoundries 130-nm and Nangate 45-nm process design kits and compare them with their two-dimensional (2D) counterparts to identify comprehensive design benefits. In addition, we examine the findings from various analyses to identify the power benefits of 3D-stacked integrated circuit (IC) and device technology advancements. From experiments, we observe that the proposed 3D-stacked ICs, compared to their 2D IC counterparts, obtain 43% area, 13% power, and 14% wire length reductions. In addition, we present a logic partitioning method suitable for a pipeline-based hardware architecture that minimizes the use of TSVs.

Military influence meant that the norms surrounding technologies were mainly determined by departments of defense, national governments, and international organizations. Today, technology developers focus more attention on the hundreds of millions of technology users around the world than on the smaller numbers of users within governments and militaries, leaving governments little scope for influence over technology's development and use. Well-known technologies that challenge militaries' traditional dominance and threaten their control over technology's uses include autonomous vehicles, cyber technologies, and artificial intelligence. As future generations of consequential technologies mature, perhaps including quantum computing and virtual reality, the challenges faced by governments and militaries will only increase. Because governments and international institutions lack methods to successfully grapple with new or not-yet-developed technologies, societies as a whole must be vigilant to the threats that such technologies pose and must address the stark imbalance between the resources dedicated to developing new technologies and the resources dedicated to governing them.

AB This paper addresses the design of a decentralized safety controller for two agents, subject to communication delay and imperfect measurements. The control objective is to ensure safety, meaning that the state of the two-agent system does not enter an undesired set in the state space. Assuming that we know a feedback map designed for the delay free-case, we propose a state estimation strategy which guarantees control agreement between the two agents. We present an estimation technique for bounded communication delays, assuming that the agents share the same internal clock, and extend it for infinitely-distributed communication delays by determining a lower bound for the probability of safety. We also explain how the proposed approach can be extended to a general system of N agents and discuss efficient computation of our estimation strategy. Performance of the controller and relevance of the proposed approach are discussed in light of simulations performed for a collision avoidance problem between two semi-autonomous vehicles at an intersection.

AB We introduce a graph-based informative path planning algorithm for a mobile robot which explicitly handles time. The objective function must be submodular in the samples taken by the robot, and the samples obtained are allowed to depend on the time at which the robot visits each location. Using a submodular objective function allows our algorithm to handle problems with diminishing returns, e.g. the case when taking a sample provides less utility when other nearby points have already been sampled. We give a formal description of this framework wherein an objective function that maps the path of the robot to the set of samples taken is defined. We also show how this framework can handle the case in which the robot takes samples along the edges of the graph. A proof of the approximation guarantee for the algorithm is given. Finally, quantitative results are shown for three problems: one simple example with a known Gaussian process model, one simulated example for an underwater robot planning problem using data from a well-known ocean modeling system, and one field experiment using an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) measuring wireless signal strength on a lake.

ID DESIGN
AB This paper outlines a case study on an integrated starter-generator-torque-booster (ISGtB) for a hybrid propulsion system, with a particular focus on the generator operation in the low-speed range. The propulsion system consists of an internal combustion (IC) engine and a brushless dc machine and is intended to drive a street scooter. The complex functionality of the ISGtB, some outstanding characteristics of modern IC engines, stringent demands on the generated supply voltage, and operational principle of the selected electrical machine are the reasons for our research on the generator operation. An ac-dc converter and its control are proposed. By utilizing MOSFET transistor reverse conduction characteristics, the idea of synchronous rectification, and the principle of boost switching conversion, several improvements in the generator characteristics are accomplished. The proposed solution, enabling each of the three-phase converter legs to operate as an autonomous boost converter with synchronously driven upper transistors instead of using body diodes, extends the generator operation range below the nominal rotational speed and offers simple yet efficient energy flow control.

ID ECHOLOCATION; PERCEPTION; FORM
AB Today's low-cost automotive ultrasonic sensors perform distance measurements of obstacles within the close range of vehicles. For future parking assist systems and autonomous driving applications, the performance of the sensors should be further increased. This paper examines the processing of sensor data for the classification of different object classes and traversability of obstacles using a single ultrasonic sensor. The acquisition of raw time signals, transformation into time-frequency images, and classification using machine learning methods are described. Stationary and dynamic measurements at a velocity of 0.5 m/s of various objects have been carried out in a semi-anechoic chamber and on an asphalt parking space. We propose a scalogram-based signal processing chain and a convolutional neural network, which outperforms a LeNet-5-like baseline. Additionally, several methods for offline and online data augmentation are presented and evaluated. It is shown that carefully selected augmentation methods are useful to train more robust models. Accuracies of 90.1% are achieved for the classification of seven object classes in the laboratory and 66.4% in the outdoor environment. Traversability is correctly classified at an accuracy of 96.4% and 91.5%, respectively.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB Advanced robotics and autonomous vehicles rely on filtering and sensor fusion techniques to a large extent. These mobile applications need to handle the computations onboard at high rates while the computing capacities are limited. Therefore, any improvement that lowers the CPU time of the filtering leads to more accurate control or longer battery operation. This article introduces a generic computational relaxation for the unscented transformation (UT) that is the key operation of the Unscented Kalman filter-based applications. The central idea behind the relaxation is to pull out the linear part of the filtering model and avoid the calculations for the kernel of the nonlinear part. The practical merit of the proposed relaxation is demonstrated through a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) implementation that underpins the superior performance of the algorithm in the practically relevant cases, where the nonlinear dependencies influence only an affine subspace of the image space. The numerical examples show that the computational demand can be mitigated below 50% without decreasing the accuracy of the approximation. The method described in this article is implemented and published as an open-source C++ library RelaxedUnscentedTransformation on GitHub.

AB Information technology has become eminent in the development of modern cars. More than 50 Electronic Control Units (ECUs) realize vehicular functions in hardware and software, ranging from engine control and infotainment to future autonomous driving systems. Not only do the connections to the outside world pose new threats, but also the in-vehicle communication between ECUs, realized by bus systems such as Controller Area Network (CAN), needs to be protected against manipulation and replay of messages. Multiple countermeasures were presented in the past making use of Message Authentication Codes and time stamps and message counters, respectively, to provide message freshness, most prominently AUTOSARs Secure Onboard Communication (SecOC). In this paper, we focus on the latter ones. As one aspect of this paper, using an adequate formal model and proof, we will show that the currently considered solutions exhibit deficiencies that are hard if not impossible to overcome within the scope of the respective approaches. We further present a hardware-based approach that avoids these deficiencies and formally prove its freshness properties. In addition, we show its practicability by a hardware implementation. Finally, we evaluate our approach in comparison to counter-based solutions currently being used.

TI FPR-Fast Path Risk Algorithm to Evaluate Collision Probability
SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Collision avoidance; probability and statistical methods
ID ROBOT NAVIGATION; SAFETY
AB As mobile robots and autonomous vehicles become increasingly prevalent in human-centred environments, there is a need to control the risk of collision. Perceptual modules, for example machine vision, provide uncertain estimates of object location. In that context, the frequently made assumption of an exactly known free-space is invalid. Clearly, no paths can be guaranteed to be collision free. Instead, it is necessary to compute the probabilistic risk of collision on any proposed path. The FPR algorithm, proposed here, efficiently calculates an upper bound on the risk of collision for a robot moving on the plane. That computation orders candidate trajectories according to (the bound on) their degree of risk. Then paths within a user-defined threshold of primary risk could be selected according to secondary criteria such as comfort and efficiency. The key contribution of this letter is the FPR algorithm and its 'convolution trick' to factor the integrals used to bound the risk of collision. As a consequence of the convolution trick, given $K$ obstacles and $N$ candidate paths, the computational load is reduced from the naive $O(NK)$, to the qualitatively faster O(N+K).

AB An increasing number of pressure sensors are built in Si MEMS bridge structure using resistance devices. Recently, due to advance in autonomous driving and vehicles, numerous research in stability and sensitivity of pressure sensors have been conducted. In this research, metal diaphragm surface treatment characteristics, when MEMS devices are adhesived to the structure, to which pressure is transferred from the metal diaphragm, were studied. For surface structure shape, sand blasting process was used for the surface treatment. It is known that during the sand blasting process, adhesive strength increases with increases in penetration of the adhesive material and in surface roughness which results from an increase in powder sizes. However, based on the result obtained from this experiment, the uniformity of roughness determines adhesion, after a certain level of roughness is reached. Past a particular size of a SiC ceramic powder, adhesion shows decreasing trend because the thickness of adhesive materials decreases due to local variation in the surface. We could verify that in order to optimize the adhesion of the adhesive material from the sand blasting treatment, SiC ceramic powder sizes and treatment pressure need to be optimized.

Recent applications of mobile robots have used distributed architectures based on communication networks. A technology that has been widely used as an embedded network is the CAN protocol. The implementation of the ISO11783 standard represents the standardization of the CAN for application in agricultural machinery. This work describes the design and implementation of an electronic architecture for a mobile agricultural robot. The discussions are focused on the developed architecture, the wireless communication system for teleoperation and the distributed control based on CAN protocol and ISO11783. The evaluation of the developed system was based on the analysis of performance parameters such as motor response and architectural time delay obtained with the robot operation. The results show that the developed architecture can be applied for teleoperation and distributed control of agricultural robots meeting the requirements for accurate robot movement and an acceptable response time for robot control commands and supervision.

AB The World Wide Web serves as a leading vehicle for information dissemination by offering information services, such as product information, group interactions, or sales transactions. Three major factors affect the performance and reliability of information services for the Web, namely the distribution of information which has resulted from the globalization of information systems, the heterogeneity of information sources, and the sources' instability caused by autonomous evolution. This paper focuses on integrating existing information sources, available via the Web, in the delivery of information services. The primary objective of the paper is to provide mechanisms for structuring and maintaining domain models for Web applications. These mechanisms are based on conceptual modeling techniques, where concepts are being defined and refined within a metadata repository through the use of instantiation, specialization and attribution. Also, active databases techniques are exploited to provide robust mechanisms for maintaining a consistent domain model in a rapidly evolving environment, such as the Web. Therefore, the main contribution of the paper lies in the provision of an architecture for semi-automatic generation and maintenance of user-oriented, semantic-based domain models that describe distributed heterogeneous information sources.

AB Target detection and sonar contact classification with active sonar systems are not trivial especially when operating in coastal and shallow water environments with multipath propagation, high reverberation and clutter. It is even more difficult when the sonar receiver is hosted on unmanned platforms with limited maneuvering capabilities unable to perform long-lasting tracking procedures. In such environments with high clutter density, real-time classification algorithms to discriminate target contacts from clutter contacts become crucial. This paper describes a method for active sonar clutter classification that exploits the large number of undesired contacts to learn the "fingerprint" of the environmental clutter and thus to identify the target contacts as anomalies. The paper introduces the method to obtain the features of detected sonar contacts from the beamformed signal of a triplet array of hydrophones that can be towed by an autonomous underwater vehicle. The paper also shows the performance of the proposed unsupervised classification algorithm with real data collected at sea and compares it to what has been achieved by using a convolutional neural network. The results show the capability of the proposed anomaly detection algorithm to properly deal with a variety of clutter contacts without requiring labeling of training data.

AB Autonomous navigation of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) in dynamic and unknown environments is a complex and challenging task. Current works rely on assumptions to solve the problem. The MAV's pose is precisely known, the dynamic obstacles can be explicitly segmented from static ones, their number is known and fixed, or they can be modeled with given shapes. In this letter, we present a method for MAV navigation in dynamic uncertain environments without making any of these assumptions. The method employs a particle-based dynamic map to represent the local environment and predicts it to the near future. Collision risk is defined based on the predicted maps and a series of risk-aware spatio-temporal (RAST) safety corridors are constructed, which are finally used to optimize a dynamically-feasible collision-free trajectory for the MAV. We compared our method with several state-of-the-art works in 12000 simulation tests in Gazebo with the physical engine enabled. The results show that our method has the highest success rate at different uncertainty levels. Finally, we validated the proposed method in real experiments.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) based on remote-sensing technology have been widely applied in various underwater tasks. However, the complex underwater environment leads to challenges such as color distortion, blurred details, and fog effects in the underwater image directly acquired by AUVs. Although numerous existing methods aim to remove the color cast and restore image details, their effectiveness is still limited. This letter proposes a new method based on a deformable convolutional network and constrained by contrastive learning for underwater image enhancement. First, we propose a deformable convolutional residual block (DCRB) to achieve a more precise restoration of texture details by adaptively adjusting the convolution kernel shape. At the same time, we utilize the long-skip connection method of the U-Net architecture to preserve information that is prone to loss in shallow networks. Second, we propose a color contrastive loss function to compare the color difference between distorted images and the ground truth, resulting in a more realistic enhanced image. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods regarding image quality and visual appeal.

AB This study proposes an integrated docking approach for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), which directly generate control force and torque from visual guidance features to drive precise AUV docking. Accurate docking control has been constructed as nonlinear offset-free model predictive control (OFNMPC) problem to effectively deal with external disturbances, model mismatch, and various other constraints. For the problem of state and disturbance estimation required by OFNMPC, observers have been presented based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and moving horizon estimation (MHE). A visual observation model is proposed so that the observer can directly use visual measurements. OFNMPC was integrated with EKF and MHE, and the proposed OFNMPC-EKF and OFNMPC-MHE docking approaches were applied to an actual AUV model. The simulation results show that the proposed approaches could drive the AUV to complete accurate docking along a reasonable trajectory based on visual measurements. The navigation, guidance, and control functions of docking were effectively integrated. It was observed that in the presence of external disturbances and measurement noise, OFNMPC-EKF has better robustness.

AB Real-time six degrees-of-freedom pose estimation with ground vehicles represents a relevant and well-studied topic in robotics due to its many applications such as autonomous driving and 3D mapping. Although some systems already exist, they are either not accurate or they struggle in real-time settings. In this letter, we propose a fast, accurate and modular LiDAR SLAM system for both batch and online estimation. We first apply downsampling and outlier removal, to filter out noise and reduce the size of the input point clouds. Filtered clouds are then used for pose tracking, possibly aided by a pre-tracking module, and floor detection, to ground optimize the estimated trajectory. Efficient multi-steps loop closure and pose optimization, achieved through a g2o pose graph, are the last steps of the proposed SLAM pipeline. We compare the performance of our system with state-of-the-art point cloud-based methods, LOAM, LeGO-LOAM, A-LOAM, LeGO-LOAM-BOR, LIO-SAM and HDL, and show that the proposed system achieves equal or better accuracy and can easily handle even cases without loops. The comparison is done evaluating the estimated trajectory displacement using the KITTI (urban driving) and Chilean (underground mine) datasets.

AB Rapid and precise air operation mission planning is a key technology in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) autonomous combat in battles. In this paper, an end-to-end UAV intelligent mission planning method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed to solve the shortcomings of the traditional intelligent optimization algorithm, such as relying on simple, static, low-dimensional scenarios, and poor scalability. Specifically, the suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) mission planning is described as a sequential decision-making problem and formalized as a Markov decision process (MDP). Then, the SEAD intelligent planning model based on the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is established and a general intelligent planning architecture is proposed. Furthermore, three policy training tricks, i.e., domain randomization, maximizing policy entropy, and underlying network parameter sharing, are introduced to improve the learning performance and generalizability of PPO. Experiments results show that the model in this work is efficient and stable, and can be adapted to the unknown continuous high-dimensional environment. It can be concluded that the UAV intelligent mission planning model based on DRL has powerful intelligent planning performance, and provides a new idea for researching UAV autonomy.

AB Increasing demand for faster and more agile Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs, drones) is observed in many scenarios, including but not limited to medical supply or Search-and-Rescue (SAR) missions. Exceptional maneuverability is critical for robust obstacle avoidance during autonomous flights. A novel modification to the Model Predictive Controller (MPC) is proposed, which drastically improves the speed of the attitude controller of our quadcopter drone. The modified MPC is suitable for the onboard microcontroller and the 400 Hz main control loop. The peak and total energy consumption and the performance of the attitude controllers are assessed: the modified MPC and the default Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID). The tests were conducted in a custom-implemented Flight Mode in the ArduCopter software stack, securing the drone in a test harness, which guarantees the experiments are repetitive. The ultimate MPC greatly increases maneuverability of the drone and may inspire more research related to faster obstacle avoidance and new types of hybrid attitude controllers to balance the agility and the power consumption.

AB Suberin is a natural polyester providing the impermeability and mechanical damping of the plant cell walls. It is fascinating because ester bonds in the suberin can be easily hydrolyzed to provide various functional chemical precursors for further applications. This study investigates an unprecedented way to tailor energy-absorbing capabilities in silica-reinforced styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) composites by introducing depolymerized suberin derivatives (DSDs) extracted from cork and potato periderm. The filler-matrix couplings were experimentally and analytically investigated through dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and the Huber-Vilgis model. The DSDs modified silica-polymer interfaces seem to offer a substantial increase in strength, toughness, and energy-absorption by nearly 47 %, 336 %, and 126 %, respectively, compared to bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)tetrasulfide (TESPT)-coupled elastomers, without sacrificing the modulus. These findings could inspire natural materials enabled composite design for high energy-absorbing materials and provide a breakthrough in utilizing natural resources for next-generation structures such as urban air mobility or autonomous electrical vehicle, which typically require multifunctional performances including lightweight, high strength, and energy-absorbing capability.

DE Real-time programming languages; real-time specification for Java;
   model-driven engineering
AB Many applications in emerging scenarios, such as autonomous vehicles, intelligent robots, and industrial automation, are safety-critical with strict timing requirements. However, the development of real-time systems is error prone and highly dependent on sophisticated domain expertise, making it a costly process. This article utilises the principles of model-driven engineering (MDE) and proposes two methodologies to automate the development of real-time Java applications. The first one automatically converts standard time-sharing Java applications to real-time Java applications, using a series of transformations. It is in line with the observed industrial trend, such as for the big data technology, of redeveloping existing software without the real-time notion to realise the real-time features. The second one allows users to automatically generate real-time Java application templates with a lightweight modelling language, which can be used to define the real-time properties-essentially a synthesis process. This article opens up a new research direction on development automation of real-time programming languages and inspires many research questions that can be jointly investigated by the embedded systems, programming languages as well as MDE communities.

AB Nowadays, the development of robots and smart tractors for the automation of sowing, harvesting, weeding etc. is transforming agriculture. Farmers are moving from an agriculture where everything is applied uniformly to a much more targeted farming. This new kind of farming is commonly referred to as precision agriculture. However for autonomous guidance of these agricultural machines and even sometimes for weed detection an accurate detection of crop rows is required. In this paper we propose a new method called CRowNet which uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) and the Hough transform to detect crop rows in images taken by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The method consists of a model formed with SegNet (S-SegNet) and a CNN based Hough transform (HoughCNet). The performance of the proposed method was quantitatively compared to traditional approaches and it showed the best and most robust result. A good crop row detection rate of 93.58% was obtained with an IoU score per crop row above 70%. Moreover the model trained on a given crop field is able to detect rows in images of different types of crops.

AB In this paper, we propose a periodic solution to the problem of persistently covering a finite set of interest points with a group of autonomous mobile agents. These agents visit periodically the points and spend some time carrying out the coverage task, which we call coverage time. Since this periodic persistent coverage problem is NP-hard, we split it into three subproblems to counteract its complexity. In the first place, we plan individual closed paths for the agents to cover all the points. Second, we formulate a quadratically constrained linear program to find the optimal coverage times and actions that satisfy the coverage objective. Finally, we join together the individual plans of the agents in a periodic team plan by obtaining a schedule that guarantees collision avoidance. To this end, we solve a mixed-integer linear program that minimizes the time in which two or more agents move at the same time. Eventually, we apply the proposed solution to an induction hob with mobile inductors for a domestic heating application and show its performance with experiments on a real prototype.

AB Despite a growing understanding of the importance of mesophotic ecosystems, they remain relatively unexplored globally, and particularly in the Indian Ocean. The composition of benthic communities of the Ningaloo Marine Park in deeper water (> 20 m) was determined using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Environmental variables collected by the AUVs as well as geomorphological variables derived from high-resolution multibeam bathymetry were used to explain the distribution of these communities. Imagery was classified for benthic biota, and non-hierarchical k-means clustering was used to identify community groups. Overall, 12 community groups were identified which fell into three broad categories: (1) coral-dominated, (2) CCA-dominated; and (3) macroalgae- and filter-feeder-dominated. Specific deeper water communities (> 50 m) were characterised by the presence of sponges or other non-photosynthetic filter feeders. Corals were confined to depths < 40 m, and cover was high (29-40%). Generalised additive models identified the importance of substrate (cover of sand, rock, and gravel/pebbles), geomorphological variables (slope and bathymetric position index) and temperature in the distribution of communities.

DT Article
DE Structural pattern recognition; Decision rationales;
   Expectation-Maximization; Navigation; UAV
AB This paper reports on the statistical embedding of a structural pattern recognition system into the autonomous navigation of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A rule-based system is used for the recognition of visual landmarks such as bridges in aerial views. In principle, rule-based systems can be designed and coded with no training data at hand, but a sound interpretation and utilization of the achieved results needs statistical inference and representative data sets of sufficient coverages. Flying a UAV with an experimental system is expensive, risky, and legally questionable. Therefore, we chose a virtual globe as a camera simulator providing arbitrary amounts of training and test data. The expected positions of landmarks in the aerial views are modeled by mixture models representing inliers, outliers, and intermediate forms which stem from similar structures appearing frequently in the vicinity of landmarks. The parameters of the corresponding likelihood functions are estimated by the Expectation-Maximization method. Using these estimates, we carry out tests and compare the results for heuristic, pessimistic, optimistic, and Bayesian decision rationales. This performance evaluation reveals the superiority of the Bayesian approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fossil energy depletion and fight against climate change force humanity to decarbonize the economy. By year 2050 CO2 emissions will have to reduce globally at least 85%, and probably over 95% in developed countries.
   The modeling of the transportation of people and commodities in the Basque Autonomous Community (Spain) in year 2008 has allowed us to draw some conclusions about the challenges ahead. The exploration of several scenarios modeled in order to reduce energy consumption in transport shows that mobility in a decarbonized world will have to be more efficient, electrified when moving people and freight on land, based on renewable generation, and organized in such a way that guarantees very high occupancies of vehicles. All these elements will be indispensable, and even not sufficient if they are still not complemented with a reduction of mobility in absolute terms, so that economic transportation intensity the ratio between transportation and whole economic activity recovers to levels seen in the world four decades ago, prior to the development of present hypermobility.

AB Asteroids are believed to be the remnants of the material from which the Solar System formed. This view is supported by the way the predominating asteroid type changes with increasing distance from the Sun within the asteroid belt. Highspeed collisions between asteroids are gradually resulting in their break-up. The size distribution of kilometer-sized asteroids implies that the presently undetected population of sub-kilometer asteroids far outnumber the known larger objects. Sub-kilometer asteroids are expected to provide unique insight into the evolution of the asteroid belt and to the meteorite-asteroid connection. We propose a space mission to detect and characterize sub-kilometer asteroids between Jupiter and Venus. The mission is named "Bering" after the famous navigator and explorer Vitus Bering. A key feature of the mission is an advanced payload package, providing full on board autonomy of both object detection and tracking, which is required in order to study fast moving objects in deep space. The autonomy has the added advantage of reducing the cost of running the mission to a minimum, thus enabling science to focus on the main objectives. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Underwater Internet of Things (IoUT) shows significant future potential in enabling a smart ocean. Underwater sensor network (UWSN) is a major form of IoUT, but it faces the problem of reliable data collection. To address these issues, this paper considers the use of the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) as mobile collectors to build reliable collection systems, while the value of information (VoI) is used as the primary measure of information quality. This paper first builds a realistic model to characterize the behavior of sensor nodes and the AUV together with challenging environments. Then, improved deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is used to dynamically plan the AUV's navigation route by jointly considering the location of nodes, the data value of nodes, and the status of the AUV to maximize the data collection efficiency of the AUV. The results of the simulation show the dynamic data collection scheme is superior to the traditional path planning scheme, which only considers the node location, and greatly improves the efficiency of AUV data collection.

AB Service area analysis is crucial for determining the accessibility of public facilities in smart cities. However, the acquisition of service areas using conventional approaches has been limited. First, investigating traffic flow is difficult, as this factor varies significantly over time and space. Second, obtaining service areas of mobile facilities/targets has remained a challenge owing to a lack of data and methods. To address these problems, this study proposes an efficient big-data-driven approach that utilizes large-scale taxi GPS location data collected over two years within Seoul City and distributed computation to obtain the average travel time values on fine-grained grid cells of 100 m x 100 m resolution. On-the-fly visualization methods were then established with an ability to construct isochrone maps of service areas in near-real-time. This enabled performing accurate service area analysis of mobile facilities/targets dynamically. The proposed solution can be effectively used in various applications, such as optimizing the ride-sharing services or the routes of autonomous electric vehicles in future smart cities, as demonstrated in this study.

AB Image processing has led its applications to scale to almost all areas encompassing the emergent interdisciplinary fields of computers, electronics, mechanical, civil, and more. There are several discrete models in image processing to identify characteristic of an object under surveillance. In smart emergency applications, accuracy and precision on attributes of these objects are paramount. Hence there is a need to enhance the image processing algorithms used to measure an object's distance, size, and color from any altitude. The paper demonstrates Hybrid Image Processing Model (HIPM) using Triangle similarity, Pixel Per Metric (PPM), CIELAB color space, and Douglas-Peucker algorithm to compute the distance of an object from the camera, the size, color, and shape of an object from the image, respectively. This work emphasises on leveraging image processing techniques for assisting emergency aircraft landing. Results were obtained with five real-time image sets, each consisting of 50 images, and proved HIPM is efficient and reliable, with an accuracy of 99.84% and a mean error rate of 0.08. This work also discusses the model's capability to function in accordance with the need of autonomous vehicles and military events.

AB With the increasing demand for the application of multiple quadrotors, improving their autonomous flight ability in unknown environments has become one of the research focuses in the robot field. In this paper, a distributed obstacle avoidance controller is proposed with three elaborate control terms: obstacle avoidance term, inter-robot collision avoidance term, and formation reconstruction. Firstly, an online local obstacle avoidance algorithm is designed based on the obstacle avoidance behavior of the pigeon flock and potential field theory. Then, inspired by the spring-damped system, an inter-robot collision avoidance algorithm is designed based on Hooke's law with damping. Furthermore, based on the consensus theory and local neighboring information, a distributed formation reconstruction controller is designed. Finally, the simulation and quantitative analysis are carried out in Gazebo simulation platform. For practical application, an outdoor experimental platform with six quadrotors is constructed to verify the practicability of the proposed method. The results show that the three control terms are compatible with each other to achieve obstacle avoidance and can achieve formation control for quadrotors.(c) 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) real-time object detection and tracking is an important task in the case of autonomous vehicles and road and railway smart mobility, in order to allow them to analyze their environment for navigation and obstacle avoidance purposes. In this paper, we improve the efficiency of 3D monocular object detection by using dataset combination and knowledge distillation, and by creating a lightweight model. Firstly, we combine real and synthetic datasets to increase the diversity and richness of the training data. Then, we use knowledge distillation to transfer the knowledge from a large, pre-trained model to a smaller, lightweight model. Finally, we create a lightweight model by selecting the combinations of width, depth & resolution in order to reach a target complexity and computation time. Our experiments showed that using each method improves either the accuracy or the efficiency of our model with no significant drawbacks. Using all these approaches is especially useful for resource-constrained environments, such as self-driving cars and railway systems.

ID PARTIAL INFORMATION
AB The disposal of unexploded ordnance (UXOs) at sea is a global problem. The mapping and remediation of historic UXOs can be assisted by autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) carrying sensor payloads such as synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) and optical cameras. AUVs can image large areas of the seafloor in high resolution, motivating an automated approach to UXO detection. Modern methods commonly use supervised machine learning which requires labelled examples from which to learn. This work investigates the often-overlooked labelling process and resulting dataset using an example historic UXO dumpsite at Skagerrak. A counterintuitive finding of this work is that optical images cannot be relied on for ground truth as a significant number of UXOs visible in SAS images are not in optical images, presumed buried. Given the lack of ground truth, we use an ordinal labelling scheme to incorporate a measure of labeller uncertainty. We validate this labelling regime by quantifying label accuracy compared to optical labels with high confidence. Using this approach, we explore different taxonomies and conclude that grouping objects into shells, bombs, debris, and natural gave the best trade-off between accuracy and discrimination.

AB In this article, the problem of constant yet deferred output constraint for uncertain strict-feedback nonlinear systems is studied. By ``deferred output constraint,'' we mean that the system output is free/released from any constraint in the initial interval and then preserves within a bounded region right after a finite time. Due to such a form of output constraint, the normally employed Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF)-based results become invalid because the corresponding BLF is undefined in the initial period. The problem will be rather complicated yet challenging if computation and communication constraints are taken into account. By developing an error-based nonlinear function and constructing a prescribed-time scaling function, together with the approximate ability of neural networks, a varying threshold-based event-triggering adaptive neural control algorithm is presented such that not only the deferred output constraint can be ensured and the network resources can be saved but also the tracking error is able to converge to a pregiven region in a prescribed time. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control.

AB The integration of satellite and terrestrial networks has become inevitable in the next generations of communications networks due to emerging needs of ubiquitous connectivity of remote locations. New and existing services and critical infrastructures in remote locations in sea, on land and in space will be seamlessly connected through a diverse set of terrestrial and non-terrestrial communication technologies. However, the integration of terrestrial and non-terrestrial systems will open up both systems to unique security challenges that can arise due to the migration of security challenges from one to another. Similarly, security challenges can also arise due to the incompatibility of distinct systems or incoherence of security policies. The resulting security implications, thus, can be highly consequential due to the criticality of the infrastructures such as space stations, autonomous ships, and airplanes, for instance.

AB Underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) provide temporary links, which is of great significance when it comes to dealing with abnormal situations or emergencies in Internet of underwater things (IoUT). However, UASNs are susceptible to changes and uncertainties in network topology, channel conditions, etc., which can easily lead to frequent link interruptions. In this paper, we introduce a link failure prediction mechanism and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-assisted routing holes repairing mechanism for routing design of UASNs in uncertain ocean environments, to save system energy consumption and improve network connectivity. The proposed link failure prediction mechanism takes into account residual energy of sensor nodes, node drifting information, and uncertain ocean ambient noise. When the energy of multiple sensor nodes is exhausted, the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is adopted to calculate the optimal repair location, and an AUV is used for fixed point repairing. The proposed method can effectively reduce the energy consumption of sensor nodes, increase the packet delivery ratio, and extend the life of entire network of UASNs. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Probabilistic state-estimation approaches offer a principled foundation for designing localization systems, because they naturally integrate sequences of imperfect motion and exteroceptive sensor data. Recently, probabilistic localization systems utilizing appearance-invariant visual place recognition (VPR) methods as the primary exteroceptive sensor have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in the presence of substantial appearance change. However, existing systems 1) do not fully utilize odometry data within the motion models, and 2) are unable to handle route deviations, due to the assumption that query traverses exactly repeat the mapping traverse. To address these shortcomings, we present a new probabilistic topometric localization system which incorporates full 3-dof odometry into the motion model and furthermore, adds an "off-map" state within the state-estimation framework, allowing query traverses which feature significant route detours from the reference map to be successfully localized. We perform extensive evaluation on multiple query traverses from the Oxford RobotCar dataset exhibiting both significant appearance change and deviations from routes previously traversed. In particular, we evaluate performance on two practically relevant localization tasks: loop closure detection and global localization. Our approach achieves major performance improvements over both existing and improved state-of-the-art systems.

AB This article formalizes, under a single common multisensor-based predictive control framework, five different types of parking maneuvers: perpendicular, diagonal for both forward and backward motions, and parallel for backward motions. Since, from a practical point of view, forward parallel parking is usually not advisable, it is not addressed in this work. By moving the effort from motion planning to control, the parking tasks can be completely defined solely from the detected empty parking spots. Additionally, the classical compromise between completeness and computational efficiency when compared to exploration-based path planning techniques is eliminated. The results of a few individual cases are presented and compared against a state-of-the-art path planning approach to illustrate the behavior and performance of the proposed framework as well as results from exhaustive simulations to assess its convergence. As shown in the convergence analyses, the presented approach allows us to park from virtually any sensible initial pose. Finally, real experimentation using a robotized Renault ZOE shows the validity and robustness in the convergence domain of the presented approach.

AB In general, infrared (IR) images are generated based on the temperature distribution of the objects of interest by detecting the thermal IR radiation emitted from these objects with the help of sensors. However, the generation of information-specific IR images can enable "intelligent" entities such as autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence robots with IR detection features to use IR images for exchanging information. In this context, here, we examine a method of realizing IR-image-based information using IR laser projection. With our approach, two- and three-dimensional IR images could be generated by converting near-IR rays to far-IR rays based on the heat generated by a laser. Importantly, the IR signals do not adversely affect humans or interfere with electronic devices. The proposed IR display can be used to exchange specific information among IR-detection-enabled entities without being detected by the human eye. Therefore, it is expected to overcome the problem of light pollution due to the indiscriminate use of displays and human-health-related problems arising from the exposure to electromagnetic wave-based information transmission.

AB The rapid development of the internet of things and autonomous vehicles requires plenty of sensors to monitor environmental conditions continuously. Hence, the high energy density and reliable power supply are demanded. The nonlinear oscillator has been widely utilized to enhance the output performance of piezoelectric and electromagnetic energy harvesters, which can operate in high-energy orbits under proper excitation frequencies. Here, the nonlinear oscillator-based triboelectric nanogenerator (NL-TENG) is proposed based on the grating structure. The mechanism to boost the output of the NL-TENG is analyzed and discussed with an electromechanical coupling model proposed, and the impacts of excitation frequency, external resistance, and spring stiffness were investigated. The peak power of the fabricated NL-TENG is 22 mW, which is 3 times enlarged compared to the traditional linear configuration. Furthermore, the stable and continuous power output of up to 244 W/m(3) is demonstrated, which can power a calculator and a large quantity of light-emitting diodes persistently. This study presents a new perspective to boost the output of the TENG by utilizing the benefits from the nonlinear oscillator.

AB Consistent and accurate global positioning is a crucial problem for autonomous vehicles and robots. It is especially challenging in situations with a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) being intermittently degraded. We propose an adaptive fusion system, namely, GNSS/visual-inertial navigation system (GVINS), which adaptively fuses GNSS and visual-inertial odometry (VIO) to achieve consistent and accurate global positioning, even in GNSS intermittently degraded scenarios. Compared with existing methods, GVINS can provide positioning under an Earth-fixed geographic coordinate, rather than a local tangent plane (LTP) coordinate, as long as any GNSS measurement presents in the trajectory. To adaptively fuse VIO and GNSS, we first use an inertial measurement unit (IMU) preintegration-based depth uncertainty estimation method to evaluate the accuracy of VIO. Then, in the optimization backend, we perform an innovative overparameterized, 15 degree-of-freedom pose-graph fusion. An alternating minimization (AM) algorithm is used to efficiently solve this problem. Evaluation results on both public and custom-built data sets demonstrate that GVINS outperforms state-of-the-art fusion methods in both accuracy and stability in GNSS intermittently degraded environments.

AB Panoramic stitching technology provides an effective solution for expanding visual detection range of the autonomous underwater vehicle. However, absorption and scattering of light in the water seriously deteriorate the underwater imaging in terms of distance and quality, especially the scattering sharply decreases the underwater image contrast and results in serious blur. This reduces the number of matching feature points between the underwater images to be stitched, while fewer matched points generated make image registration and stitching difficult. To solve the problem, a joint framework is established, which firstly involves a convolutional neural network-like algorithm composed of a symmetric convolution and deconvolution framework for underwater image enhancement. Then, it proposes an improved convolutional neural network-random sample consensus method based on VGGNet-16 framework to generate more correct matching feature points for image registration. The fusion method based on Laplacian pyramid is applied to eliminate artificial stitching traces and correct the position of stitching seam. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework can restore the color and detail information of underwater images and generate more effective and sufficient matching feature points for underwater sequence images stitching.

ID FUTURE
AB The 'Internet of Things' has brought increased demand for artificial intelligence-based edge computing in applications ranging from healthcare monitoring systems to autonomous vehicles. Quantization is a powerful tool to address the growing computational cost of such applications and yields significant compression over full-precision networks. However, quantization can result in substantial loss of performance for complex image classification tasks. To address this, we propose a principal component analysis (PCA)-driven methodology to identify the important layers of a binary network, and design mixed-precision networks. The proposed Hybrid-Net achieves a more than 10% improvement in classification accuracy over binary networks such as XNOR-Net for ResNet and VGG architectures on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets, while still achieving up to 94% of the energy efficiency of XNOR-Nets. This work advances the feasibility of using highly compressed neural networks for energy-efficient neural computing in edge devices. Neural networks are often implemented with reduced precision in order to meet the tight energy and memory budget required by edge computing devices. Chakraborty et al. develop a technique for assessing which layers can be quantized, and by how much, without sacrificing too much on performance.

ID LATERAL-LINE; LOCALIZATION; EQUATIONS
AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) has become a hotspot in the field of robot in recent years. As a special kind of AUV, the robotic fish can achieve better propulsion efficiency and maneuverability than traditional AUVs. Studies show that robotic fish formation can save energy and perform more complex tasks than single robotic fish, but it is difficult to maintain a stable formation because the nearby environmental condition is hard to obtain. Inspired by the lateral line system (LLS) of fish, this paper constructs a predictive model of flow velocity and a judgement model of spacing between individual platforms for robotic fish formation through monitoring sensors on robotic fish surface. The models are built by methods of polynomial fitting and neural networks based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. The results show that the flow velocity predicted by our model could reduce the error to 0.4%, and the spacing judgement accuracy could reach at least 80%. The findings are useful for maintaining a stable formation and will provide significant guidance for the control of robotic fish formation and sensor installation position on the robotic fish surface.

ID TRAJECTORY TRACKING CONTROL; ATTITUDE-CONTROL
AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) at low altitude flight may significantly degrade their performance and the safety under wind disturbances and incorrect operations. This paper presents a robust control strategy for UAVs to achieve good performance of low altitude flight and disturbance rejection. First, a novel second-order hexacopter dynamics is established and the position tracking is translated to the altitude and the rotational angle tracking problem. An integrated control scheme is created to deal with the challenges faced by hexacopter at low altitude flight, in which the influence of near-ground threshold distance and the desired roll, pitch, and yaw are analyzed. Moreover, an improved flying altitude planner and an attitude planner for low altitude conditions are designed respectively to avoid the overturning risk due to the big reaction torque and external disturbances. Second, a sliding-mode-based altitude tracking controller and an attitude tracking controller are designed to reduce the tracking errors and improve the robustness of the system. Finally, the proposed control scheme is tested on simulation and experiment platforms of multi-rotor UAV to show the feasibility and accurate trajectory tracking at low altitude flight.

AB Visual understanding of 3-D environments in real time, at low power, is a huge computational challenge. Often referred to as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), it is central to applications spanning domestic and industrial robotics, autonomous vehicles, and virtual and augmented reality. This paper describes the results of a major research effort to assemble the algorithms, architectures, tools, and systems software needed to enable delivery of SLAM, by supporting applications specialists in selecting and configuring the appropriate algorithm and the appropriate hardware, and compilation pathway, to meet their performance, accuracy, and energy consumption goals. The major contributions we present are: 1) tools and methodology for systematic quantitative evaluation of SLAM algorithms; 2) automated, machine-learning-guided exploration of the algorithmic and implementation design space with respect to multiple objectives; 3) end-to-end simulation tools to enable optimization of heterogeneous, accelerated architectures for the specific algorithmic requirements of the various SLAM algorithmic approaches; and 4) tools for delivering, where appropriate, accelerated, adaptive SLAM solutions in a managed, JIT-compiled, adaptive runtime context.

AB Most marine mammals, such as sperm whales and long-finned pilot whales, always produce call pulses with certain characteristics for echolocation, communication, and so on. Generally, the enemy's underwater reconnaissance system almost always classifies these biological signals as ocean noise and then filters them out. Based on this fact, this article provides our attempts at a novel steganography to conceal digital communications in the constructed communication frame composed of original marine mammal call pulses. We first put forward a screening scheme to pick out high-quality call pulses from the original marine mammal call pulses. Next, we discuss how to design a secure, camouflaged, and covert communication frame according to the characteristics of marine mammal call pulses. Both the time delay difference among communication codes and the number of communication codes are simultaneously used to convey the digital information. The ambiguity function and correlation technique are utilized to select communication codes from original whale call pulses. In the end, experiments were performed to demonstrate the validity and security of the bio-inspired steganography. The presented bio-inspired steganography is able to serve a variety of underwater military communications, such as submarine communications and autonomous underwater vehicle communications.

AB This paper investigates the use of reinforcement learning for the navigation of an over actuated, i.e. more control inputs than degrees of freedom, marine platform in unknown environment. The proposed approach uses an online least-squared policy iteration scheme for value function approximation in order to estimate optimal policy, in conjunction with a low-level control system that controls the magnitude of the linear velocity, and the orientation of the platform. Primary goal of the proposed scheme is the reduction of the consumed energy. To that end, we propose a variable reward function that depends on the energy consumption of the platform. We evaluate our approach in a complex and realistic simulation environment and report results concerning its performance on estimating optimal navigation policies under different environmental disturbances, and position CPS measurement noise. The proposed framework is compared, in terms of energy consumption, to a baseline approach based on virtual potential fields. The results show that the marine platform successfully discovers the target point following a sub-optimal path, maintaining reduced energy consumption.

AB This paper is an experience report of team Halmstad from the participation in a competition organised by the i-GAME project, the Grand Cooperative Driving Challenge 2016. The competition was held in Helmond, The Netherlands, during the last weekend of May 2016. We give an overview of our car's control and communication system that was developed for the competition following the requirements and specifications of the i-GAME project. In particular, we describe our implementation of cooperative adaptive cruise control, our solution to the communication and logging requirements, as well as the high level decision making support. For the actual competition we did not manage to completely reach all of the goals set out by the organizers as well as ourselves. However, this did not prevent us from outperforming the competition. Moreover, the competition allowed us to collect data for further evaluation of our solutions to cooperative driving. Thus, we discuss what we believe were the strong points of our system, and discuss postcompetition evaluation of the developments that were not fully integrated into our system during competition time.

TI ControlShell: A software architecture for complex electromechanical
   systems
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Real-time system software is notoriously complex. Large projects must balance the special needs of real-time software-such as clock management, control systems, and strategy-with the needs of interacting teams of programmers, managers, and long-term maintenance personnel. Successful projects require a solid software architecture, an intuitive graphical programming paradigm, a well-developed reuse system, and powerful system services.
   This paper walks through the methodology and application of ControlShell, the component-based real-time programming system. ControlShell provides an integrated development environment for building complex electromechanical systems. II targets complex systems that require both cyclic data processing and strategic event management and sequencing.
   ControlShell is specifically designed to facilitate team development of complex electromechanical systems. Teams must share and reuse code; ControlShell provides component-level code sharing and reuse. Complex systems require flexibility; ControlShell gains flexibility by supporting independent module-level code generation. Large systems are most easily designed as independent parts; ControlShell encourages easy interconnectivity of objects. Finally, complex systems are modal; ControlShell features a unique configuration-control system for changing operating modes.
   The paper concludes by examining the application of this framework to a dual-arm robotic work cell, a subsystem of the Space Shuttle Launch Processing System, and an underwater autonomous vehicle.

ID MODEL; ALIGNMENT
AB Many practical systems, such as target tracking, navigation systems, autonomous vehicles, and other applications, are usually applied in dynamic conditions. Thus, the actual noise statistics characteristics of these systems are generally time varying and unknown, which will deteriorate the state estimation accuracy of the Kalman filter (KF) and even cause filter diverging. To address this issue, this paper proposes an adaptive process noise covariance (Qk)-based variational Bayesian adaptive Kalman filter (AQ-VBAKF) algorithm. Firstly, the adaptive factor is introduced to self-tune the process noise covariance; the adaptive factor is obtained based on the innovation sequences, which can adapt to the input measurement values. Then, the VB solution is applied to approximate the time variant and unknown measurement noise covariance. Therefore, this proposed algorithm can adjust the process noise covariance and the measurement noise covariance simultaneously based on the variable input signals, which can improve the self-adaptive ability of the state estimation filter in dynamic conditions. According to the dynamic target tracking test results, the proposed AQ-VBAKF outperforms several other existing filtering methods in estimation accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.

AB As one of the crucial sensors for environment sensing, frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars are widely used in modern vehicles for driving assistance/autonomous driving. However, the limited frequency bandwidth and the increasing number of equipped radar sensors would inevitably cause mutual interference, degrading target detection and producing safety hazards. In this paper, a deep learning-based interference mitigation (IM) approach is proposed for FMCW radars by using the dilated convolution for network construction and a designated contrast learning strategy for training. The dilated convolution enlarges the receptive field of the neural network, and the designated contrastive learning strategy enforces to distinguish better between interferences and desired signals. The results of numerical simulation and experimental data processing show that the dilated convolution-based IM network, compared to the traditional convolution-based ones, can achieve a higher Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR) and target detection rate. Moreover, the designated contrastive learning strategy enables a better and more stable IM performance without increasing the complexity of the network, which can facilitate faster signal processing.

AB We propose a navigation system combining sensor-aided inertial navigation and prior-map-based localization to improve the stability and accuracy of robot localization in structure-rich environments. Specifically, we adopt point, line, and plane features in the navigation system to enhance the feature richness in low-texture environments and improve the localization reliability. We additionally integrate structure prior information of the environments to constrain the localization drifts and improve the accuracy. The prior information is called structure priors and parameterized as low-dimensional relative distances/angles between different geometric primitives. The localization is formulated as a graph-based optimization problem that contains sliding-window-based variables and factors, including Inertial Measurement Unit, heterogeneous features, and structure priors. A limited number of structure priors are selected based on the information gain to alleviate the computation burden. Finally, the proposed framework is extensively tested on synthetic data, public data sets, and, more importantly, on the real Unmanned Aerial Vehicle flight data obtained from both indoor and outdoor inspection tasks. The results show that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the accuracy and robustness of localization for autonomous robots in civilian applications.

AB The Spacecraft Atmosphere Monitor (SAM.) is a scientific payload, which includes a Paul quadrupole ion trap (QIT) mass spectrometer and has been continuously operated onboard the International Space Station (ISS) between August 2019 and July 2021. S.A.M. measures the chemical composition of ISS cabin air and reports on major constituents (N-2, O-2, Ar, CO2, and CH4) once every 2 s. Each second, S.A.M. measures one hundred individual mass spectra stored in 4800 ins-long channels. This report presents the autonomous onboard data analysis software that calibrates the mass spectrum, removes the residual gas background signal, identifies species of interest, and reports relevant abundances. In addition, we describe a ground-based analysis of downloaded S.A.M.'s data to extract the H, C, N, O, and Ar isotope ratios. We also describe experiments, requested by the ISS Vehicle office, to ascertain if benzene was present in the ISS cabin air (it was not). We demonstrate that S.A.M. instrument measures isotope ratios with precision and accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art laboratory-size magnetic sector mass spectrometers. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB The growing advocacy of thermal imagery in applications, such as autonomous vehicles, surveillance, and COVID-19 detection, necessitates accurate object detection frameworks for the thermal domain. Conventional methods could fall short, especially in situations with poor lighting, for instance, detection during night-time. In this paper, we propose a paced multi-stage block-wise framework for effectively detecting objects from thermal images. Our approach utilizes the pre-existing knowledge of deep neural network-based object detectors trained on large-scale natural image data to enhance performance in the thermal domain constructively. The employed, multi-stage approach drives our model to achieve higher accuracies. And the introduction of the pace parameter during domain adaption enables efficient training. Our experimental results demonstrate that the framework outperforms previous benchmarks on the FLIR ADAS dataset on the person, bicycle, and car categories. We have also illustrated further analysis of the framework, such as the effect of its components on accuracy and training efficiency, its generalizability to other thermal datasets, and its superior performance on night-time images in contrast to state-of-the-art RGB object detectors.

AB Aiming at the difficult problem of motion control of under-actuated and X-rudder autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), the present work adopts deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for its posture control. First, an AUV agent is trained with deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm in a simulation environment, and three-degree-of-freedom posture control of the AUV at a constant speed, fixed roll, variable pitch, and variable yaw, is successfully achieved. Subsequently, the AUV's yaw angle range is extended, and the control failure problem when AUV's yaw angle approaches a critical value is solved, realizing the rapid deployment of the DRL algorithm for AUV control. On this basis, the position-tracking task of AUV for targets in different orientations in three-dimensional space is completed, achieving a six-degree-of-freedom control of AUV. Additionally, by decomposing the trajectory control task of AUV in three-dimensional space into multiple positiontracking missions, the trajectory control of AUV in the underwater horizontal plane and underwater threedimensional space is realized, demonstrating the significant task generalization ability of the control methods proposed.

AB Groups of battery powered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are effective in a variety of scenarios that require autonomous cooperation to achieve a goal. However, the complexity of modeling and analyzing UAV cooperation in situations with stochastic elements leads to unique challenges. This paper introduces a framework for one such problem domain, the multi-UAV persistent search and retrieval task with stochastic target appearances (PSR-STA), in which UAVs continuously search an area for stochastically appearing targets to retrieve and deliver them to collector locations. Design decisions are introduced for understanding how to successfully simulate multi-UAV PSR-STA. Common tools for analyzing search algorithm effectiveness through statistical and graphical methods are presented. A case study of multi-UAV park cleanup is implemented to demonstrate the framework, where algorithms for choosing the locations of collectors and charging stations based on stochastic target appearance models are proposed, methods for continuous multi-UAV operation over a long period time are demonstrated, and the differences in effectiveness between four coverage search patterns are analyzed.

AB The strengthening of the railway mode is one of the main policies that can help to achieve more sustainable future mobility. A methodology is presented to estimate future transport demand scenarios over the medium (2030) and long term (2050) considering three trip lengths: urban, regional, and long distance for two trip purposes: work and leisure. The objective of the scenarios is to answer the question: would railways benefit from a 10% drop in car usage? Qualitative techniques have been applied, based on in-depth interviews and focus groups, as well as a stated preference survey where the people sampled answered to different scenarios which included the presence of a new train, with a high level of service, and other possible new modes of transport such as autonomous cars and buses. The results obtained using Best-Worst discrete choice models show that the rail mode could capture a significant part of the demand from the car over all three journey lengths, but especially for long distance, if the new rail mode were introduced.

AB Control system security is enhanced by the ability to detect malicious attacks on sensor measurements. Dynamic watermarking can detect such attacks on linear time-invariant systems. However, existing theory focuses on attack detection and not on the use of watermarking in conjunction with attack mitigation strategies. In this article, we study the problem of switching between two sets of sensors: One set of sensors has high accuracy but is vulnerable to attack, whereas the second set of sensors has low accuracy but cannot be attacked. The problem is to design a sensor switching strategy based on attack detection by dynamic watermarking. This requires new theory because existing results are not adequate to control or bound the behavior of sensor switching strategies that use finite data. To overcome this, we develop new finite sample hypothesis tests for dynamic watermarking in the case of bounded disturbances, using the modern theory of concentration of measure for random matrices. Our resulting switching strategy is validated with a simulation analysis in an autonomous driving setting, which demonstrates the strong performance of our proposed policy.

AB A high fidelity fluid-structure interaction simulation may require many days to run, on hundreds of cores. This poses a serious burden, both in terms of time and economic considerations, when repetitions of such simulations may be required (e.g. for the purpose of design optimization). In this paper we present strategies based on (constrained) Bayesian optimization (BO) to alleviate this burden. BO is a numerical optimization technique based on Gaussian processes (GP) that is able to efficiently (with minimal calls to the expensive FSI models) converge towards some globally working admissible design, as gauged using a black box objective function. In this study we present a principled design evolution that moves from FSI model verification, through a series of Bridge Simulations (bringing the verification case incrementally closer to the application), in order that we may identify material properties for an underwater, unmanned, autonomous vehicle (UUAV) sail plane. We are able to achieve fast convergence towards an working admissible design, using a small number of FSI simulations (a dozen at most), even when selecting over several design parameters, and while respecting optimization constraints.

AB The application of the position-position architecture for enabling position synchronization of two robotic agents has been proven effective in the fields of telemanipulation and rendezvous of autonomous vehicles. Nevertheless, the approaches presented to this date with the purpose of rendering the position-position architecture passive under the presence of time-delays and packet-loss are only partially able to fulfil that goal. This owes to the fact that they mostly focus on passivating the system, at the cost of transparency. Such an issue becomes even more critical in the presence of position drift caused by most passivation methods. This letter presents a novel control approach that enhances the position synchronization of agents suffering from delayed coupling, by introducing a local proxy reference to one of the agents and only closing the feedback loop when it can preserve stability. The concept is free of position drift and promises less conservatism, without having any prior information about system parameters or prior assumptions regarding time-delay. It has been experimentally validated for time-varying round-trip delays of up to 2 s.

DT Article
DE automotive radar sensors; cybersecurity; attack resilient radar DSP
AB In this paper, we propose a novel 77 GHz automotive radar sensor, and demonstrate its cyberattack resilience using real measurements. The proposed system is built upon a standard Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar RF-front end, and the novelty is in the DSP algorithm used at the firmware level. All attack scenarios are based on real radar signals generated by Texas Instruments AWR series 77 GHz radars, and all measurements are done using the same radar family. For sensor networks, including interconnected autonomous vehicles sharing radar measurements, cyberattacks at the network/communication layer is a known critical problem, and has been addressed by several different researchers. What is addressed in this paper is cyberattacks at the physical layer, that is, adversarial agents generating 77 GHz electromagnetic waves which may cause a false target detection, false distance/velocity estimation, or not detecting an existing target. The main algorithm proposed in this paper is not a predictive filtering based cyberattack detection scheme where an "unusual" difference between measured and predicted values triggers an alarm. The core idea is based on a kind of physical challenge-response authentication, and its integration into the radar DSP firmware.

AB Oil and gas companies are drilling and developing fields in the Arctic Ocean, which is an environment with ice floes. These companies must protect their platforms from ice floe collisions. One proposal is to use a system that consists of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and docking stations. The AUVs measure the under-water topography of the ice floes, while the docking stations launch the AUVs and recharge their batteries. Given resource constraints, we optimize locations and quantities for the docking stations and the AUVs, as well as the AUV scheduling policies, to maximize security of the platform. We model the system using a multistage stochastic facility location problem to optimize the docking station locations, the AUV allocations, and the scheduling policies of the AUVs. A two-stage stochastic facility location problem and two efficient online scheduling heuristics provide lower bounds and upper bounds for the multistage model. Even though the model is motivated by an oil industry project, most of the modeling and optimization methods apply more broadly to two-dimensional radial detection.

AB A Sensor Equipped Aquatic (SEA) swarm is a sensor cloud that drifts with water currents and enables 4-D (space and time) monitoring of local underwater events such as contaminants, marine life, and intruders. The swarm is escorted on the surface by drifting sonobuoys that collect data from the underwater sensors via acoustic modems and report it in real time via radio to a monitoring center. The goal of this study is to design an efficient anycast routing algorithm for reliable underwater sensor event reporting to any surface sonobuoy. Major challenges are the ocean current and limited resources (bandwidth and energy). In this paper, these challenges are addressed, and HydroCast, which is a hydraulic-pressure-based anycast routing protocol that exploits the measured pressure levels to route data to the surface sonobuoys, is proposed. This paper makes the following contributions: a novel opportunistic routing mechanism to select the subset of forwarders that maximizes the greedy progress yet limits cochannel interference and an efficient underwater dead end recovery method that outperforms the recently proposed approaches. The proposed routing protocols are validated through extensive simulations.

ID CONSENSUS
AB Increasingly, incidental sensing capabilities are being leveraged for wide-area situational awareness of complex network processes. For instance, sensors embedded on miners' body suits are envisioned for sensing for chemical hazards, blog data is being used to track disease spread, and autonomous vehicle platforms can incidentally measure environmental conditions while engaging in mission tasks. This paper explores how sparse incidental measurements can be used in tandem with models for the network processes, to gain situational awareness. Specifically, we study reconstruction and forecasting of a network diffusion process by a single stochastically-transitioning observer (where the transition process is not necessarily Markov). Conditions are obtained on the observer's transition model and the diffusion process, such that the process state (scene) can be recovered from the incidental-measurement sequence. Additionally, the minimum-variance scene estimator and its performance are characterized, when the measurements are subject to additive white Gaussian noise. Two illustrative examples are also developed. The formal analyses and examples indicate that incidental measurements can permit effective reconstruction of network processes under broad conditions, albeit with some delay and error cost.

AB This paper deals with vision-based localization techniques in structured underwater environments. For underwater robots, accurate localization is necessary to perform complex missions successfully, but few sensors are available for accurate localization in the underwater environment. Among the available sensors, cameras are very useful for performing short-range tasks despite harsh underwater conditions including low visibility, noise, and large areas of featureless scene. To mitigate these problems, we design artificial landmarks to be utilized with a camera for localization, and propose a novel vision-based object detection technique and apply it to the Monte Carlo localization (MCL) algorithm, amap-based localization technique. In the image processing step, a novel correlation coefficient using a weighted sum, multiple-template-based object selection, and color-based image segmentation methods are proposed to improve the conventional approach. In the localization step, to apply the landmark detection results to MCL, dead-reckoning information and landmark detection results are used for prediction and update phases, respectively. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated by experiments with an underwater robot platform and the results are discussed.

TI Vision-Based SLAM System for Small UAVs in GPS-Denied Environments

AB Vision-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control is a core technology in global positioning system (GPS)-denied environments. However, small UAVs have difficulty processing image data in real time because of their limited payload capacity and relatively weak processor. Development of an image-processing system that is suitable for small UAVs is therefore needed. In this paper, an approach for a vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system for small UAVs is suggested. For real-time localization, a method wherein Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi-based localization and tracking are performed within small UAVs in real time is adopted. At the same time, scale-invariant feature transform-based mapping and more accurate localization are performed at the ground-control station. A vision-based three-dimensional map-building method for small UAVs using a monocular camera is also proposed. The proposed method first extracts straight-line information from images and calculates their equations in three-dimensional space. It then constructs plane information from line information.

AB Contingency analysis and reaction is a critical task that needs to be carried out by every aircraft to guarantee its safe operation. Managing emergencies in unmanned aircraft systems is a complex problem due to the automated nature of the vehicle and the potential lack of situational awareness that the pilot may face. It is well-known from the short history of unmanned aircraft systems accidents that many of them are directly attributable to pilot errors when trying to manage an unexpected contingency. Additionally, the lost-link contingency adds a new level of complexity unique to unmanned aircraft systems, which implies that some level of autonomous contingency operation will be required. In this work, we introduce a structured approach to support contingency reactions in unmanned aircraft systems. Our objective is to classify the contingency sources and, up to a certain point, abstract their impact on the unmanned aircraft systems operation. Depending on the level of severity, the contingency reaction may range from changing or canceling mission objectives to canceling the flight itself. In this way, the response to the contingency can be selected from a predefined catalog of reactions offered to the pilot or even executed autonomously, depending on the remaining flight capabilities of the unmanned aircraft systems.

AB Tractors are the workhorses of the modern farm. By automating these machines, we can increase the productivity, improve safety, and reduce costs for many agricultural operations. Many researchers have tested computer-controlled machines for farming, but few have investigated the larger issues such as how humans can supervise machines and work amongst them. In this paper, we present a system for tractor automation. A human programs a task by driving the relevant routes. The task is divided into subtasks and assigned to a fleet of tractors that drive portions of the routes. Each tractor uses on-board sensors to detect people, animals, and other vehicles in the path of the machine, stopping for such obstacles until it receives advice from a supervisor over a wireless link. A first version of the system was implemented on a single tractor. Several features of the system were validated, including accurate path tracking, the detection of obstacles based on both geometric and non-geometric properties, and self-monitoring to determine when human intervention is required. Additionally, the complete system was tested in a Florida orange grove, where it autonomously drove seven kilometers.

DE Lidar odometry; ICP; semantic segmentation
AB Lidar sensors play a pivotal role in a multitude of remote sensing domains, finding extensive applications in various sectors, including robotics, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), autonomous driving, and 3D reconstruction, among others. Their significance and versatility in these areas have made them indispensable tools for a wide range of applications. The accuracy of Lidar odometry (LO), which serves as the front end of SLAM, is crucial. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative closest point (ICP) technique that combines semantic features to improve LO precision. First, the semantic segmentation neural network is used to extract the semantic features from each frame of the point cloud. Then, the obtained semantic features assist in extracting the local geometric features of the point cloud. Also, the residual blocks of the ICP algorithm's least squares are combined with semantic confidence functions to better predict the exact pose. Compared to LOAM, there is an average improvement of 4 cm in accuracy per 100 m. Experimental results illustrate the superiority of the proposed method and indicate that the fusion of semantic features can robustly improve the precision of LO.

AB This paper concerns the multi-UAV task assignment problem, which is solved by a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm for adaptive region partitioning. Since the traditional multi-objective optimization algorithms tend to fall into local optimum solutions when dealing with optimization problems, this paper establishes an improved multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm based on the adaptive angle area division. This paper proposes a new multi-UAV task assignment model where the threat constraint is concerned. To solve this model, the algorithm first preprocesses solution spatial information, including normalization of solutions and area division of space. Further, global optimal particle selection strategy is improved based on angle of division. In order to improve the global searching ability, some infeasible solution is used. Finally in the implementation stage of the algorithm, we set multiple nodes for the trajectory of the UAVs to increase the stability of the algorithm. The simulation experiments results demonstrate that the improved algorithm can provide a flyable solution for the UAVs and achieve better convergence and diversity.

AB While the e-commerce logistics industry is developing rapidly, its sustainable development has received certain attention. The ultimate goal of sustainable development is to achieve common, coordinated, fair, efficient, and multi-dimensional development. To promote the sustainable development of logistics, the automation technology of warehousing is undoubtedly an excellent breakthrough, since the automation technology can not only make the warehousing system efficient and with a low-error rate, but also affect the energy consumption of the warehousing system. This paper studies the Shuttle-Based Storage and Retrieval System (SBS/RS) in automated warehousing. Moreover, the paper classifies the existing literature into three categories: Physical design (including depth, configuration, and number of tiers); control strategy (including scheduling rules, storage strategies, scheduling command, and interference); and performance evaluation (including throughput, time, and energy). These categories are all factors that warehouse designers must consider when designing a system. Finally, this paper proposes future research directions for SBS/RS: Adding speed metrics, limiting buffer size, targeting space constraints, applying four-way shuttles, and increasing the carrying capacity of a single machine.

AB UAVs have been widely used in many photography applications. Among photography tasks, covering an area to produce photogrammetry data is a prominent solution for commercial applications. The resources available to automate these processes, despite the many advances, still are somewhat scarce for practical deployment. In this research, the authors intend to bridge this gap by evaluating several simulated and real 3D models. The methods evaluated are also compared with current commercially available planners and the literature state of the art. The research uses seven heuristics methods to generate camera placement, another seven methods to generate offline planning, and seven methods to perform path planning. The tests include synthetic data for statistical significance, real 3D models, and simulations that allow a complete performance overview. Quantitative results will enable the user to visualize each method's performance, while qualitative results will help to understand the results visually. Results are compiled in a path planning library for further research and development. They show that some methods can be 15% more cost-effective while being able to be still computed in a reasonable amount of time.

AB In this work, a novel paradigm is proposed to build a hybrid RGB/FIR camera, which outputs pixel-wisely aligned and temporally synchronized RGB and FIR frames simultaneously. Compared with the existing schemes, we innovate in several ways to make it compact, practical, and extendable for real-world applications. First, we propose a new structure layout design of the hybrid camera, and we also design a removable adjuster to detach the hybrid camera from the base platform. For RGB and FIR image registration, we have achieved a pixel-wise spatial registration of the FIR and RGB frames by a two-step alignment, where we propose a ghost-effect removal scheme to remove the ghost effect from the rolling-shutter-based FIR camera. Finally, multiple hybrid cameras are extended to a hybrid camera array, through which we can obtain wide-view spatially aligned FIR, RGB and disparity images simultaneously. The experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of the hybrid camera and the effectiveness of the designed stereo wide-view hybrid camera system.

AB The paper presents a collision avoidance algorithm for ship open sea navigation, based on an ad hoc modified version of the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT*) algorithm. The proposed approach is designed to act as the high level layer of the navigation control structure for an autonomous ship. Collision and grounding still represent the primary source of sea accidents, thus an automatic system able to detect static and moving obstacles and plan an evasive route could significantly improve safety during navigation, especially in crowded areas. Focusing on the maritime field, a review of the scientific literature dealing with collision avoidance is presented, showing potential benefits and weaknesses of the different approaches. Among the several methods, details about the RRT and RRT* algorithms are given. The ship path planning problem is introduced and discussed, formulating suitable cost functions and taking into account both topological and kinematic constraints. The algorithm is able to manage multiple moving obstacles with variable speed and course. Eventually, a time-domain ship simulator is used to test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm over a number of realistic operation scenarios. The obtained results are presented and critically discussed.

AB This paper presents a multipurpose UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) for mountain rescue operations. The multi-rotors based flying platform and its embedded avionics are designed to meet environmental requirements for mountainous terrain such as low temperatures, high altitude and strong winds, assuring the capability of carrying different payloads (separately or together) such as: avalanche beacon (ARTVA) with automatic signal recognition and path following algorithms for the rapid location of snow-covered body; camera (visible and thermal) for search and rescue of missing persons on snow and in woods during the day or night; payload deployment to drop emergency kits or specific explosive cartridge for controlled avalanche detachment. The resulting small (less than 5 kg) UAV is capable of full autonomous flight (including take-off and landing) of a pre-programmed, or easily configurable, custom mission. Furthermore, the autopilot manages the sensors measurements (i.e. beacons or cameras) to update the flying mission automatically in flight. Specific functionalities such as terrain following were developed and implemented. Ground station programming of the UAV is not needed, except compulsory monitoring, as the rescue mission can be accomplished in a full automatic mode.

AB Ice shelves around Antarctica are vulnerable to an increase in ocean-driven melting, with the melt rate depending on ocean temperature and the strength of flow inside the ice-shelf cavities. We present measurements of velocity, temperature, salinity, turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate, and thermal variance dissipation rate beneath Pine Island Glacier ice shelf, West Antarctica. These measurements were obtained by CTD, ADCP, and turbulence sensors mounted on an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The highest turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate is found near the grounding line. The thermal variance dissipation rate increases closer to the ice-shelf base, with a maximum value found similar to 0.5 m away from the ice. The measurements of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate near the ice are used to estimate basal melting of the ice shelf. The dissipation-rate-based melt rate estimates is sensitive to the stability correction parameter in the linear approximation of universal function of the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory for stratified boundary layers. We argue that our estimates of basal melting from dissipation rates are within a range of previous estimates of basal melting.

AB The use of cameras as a sensor for odometry estimation is an active research topic that has seen significant growth in recent years. Most methods, however, are only suitable for standard cameras that rely on reasonable lighting. An alternative to overcome low-light conditions is the use of thermal or long-wave infrared imaging. Although visible spectrum and thermal imaging share many characteristics, it is not straightforward to apply standard visual odometry algorithms to thermal imaging data. In this paper, we propose a practical visual odometry system based on a monocular thermal camera. As monocular odometry suffers from an unknown scale factor, the system performs efficient ground plane detection for targeted feature extraction, such that the scale factor can be reliably estimated if the camera height and pitch are known. We also address the problem of periodic nonuniformity correction, which is a necessary characteristic of thermal cameras that freezes the output potentially for over a second and can severely affect motion estimation. In this sense, we automatically determine appropriate times to perform nonuniformity correction based on the current and predicted camera rotations. Experiments illustrate the applicability of the system and compare it with other state estimation approaches.

AB Reliable data delivery for underwater acoustic sensor networks is a major concern in applications such as surveillance, data collection, navigation, and ocean monitoring. Geocasting is a crucial communication primitive needed to support these applications, which consists in transmitting one or multiple consecutive data packets - all carrying an atomic message - to nodes located in a certain geographic region. In this article, two versions of a distributed, reliable, and efficient underwater geocasting solution (based on different degrees of neighbor information) are proposed for underwater networks whose acoustic modems use random-access Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols. By jointly considering the position uncertainty of nodes as well as the MAC and routing functionalities, packet transmissions are prioritized and scheduled so to maximize link reliability while limiting the end-to-end geocasting delay. Moreover, a simple yet effective timer-based mechanism is designed to limit the number of transmissions by selecting only a subset of neighbors for packet forwarding. Performance is evaluated and compared via thorough simulations against existing geocasting solutions tuned for the underwater environment that were originally designed for terrestrial wireless networks.

AB This paper investigates finite-time tracking control problem of multiple non-holonomic mobile robots via visual servoing. It is assumed that the pinhole camera is fixed to the ceiling, and camera parameters are unknown. The desired reference trajectory is represented by a virtual leader whose states are available to only a subset of the followers, and the followers have only interaction. First, the camera-objective visual kinematic model is introduced by utilising the pinhole camera model for each mobile robot. Second, a unified tracking error system between camera-objective visual servoing model and desired reference trajectory is introduced. Third, based on the neighbour rule and by using finite-time control method, continuous distributed cooperative finite-time tracking control laws are designed for each mobile robot with unknown camera parameters, where the communication topology among the multiple mobile robots is assumed to be a directed graph. Rigorous proof shows that the group of mobile robots converges to the desired reference trajectory in finite time. Simulation example illustrates the effectiveness of our method.

AB The recent developments in electronics have made available a variety of systems at very appealing quality, cost and size levels. These conditions are not left unexploited by modern agriculture that seeks to tackle the increased global food demand and the degradation of available resources. Indeed, the precision agriculture sector is flourishing assisted by outstanding innovations, like the UAVs, that can carry a plethora of sensors. It must be noted though that, despite the progress being achieved, several high-quality measurements still demand expensive, often pre-existing but heavy instruments, and meticulous time-consuming operations. The latter requirements are not always in-line with the flight duration and cargo weight limitations of a typical UAV. This gap is apparent when scientists have to apply precise thermal imagery methods to support actions like accurate plant inspection or early disease detection. In order to provide a satisfactory solution, an experimental electric robotic platform, mainly destined for spraying operations, was enhanced so as to improve its functions and to host a high-quality thermal/optical camera. This platform has been equipped with a set of complementary electronic systems so as to provide fluent and robust semi-autonomous remote monitoring operation. The overall layout is lightweight, eliminating soil compaction, reducing vibration and thermal footprint, guarantying almost noninvasive operation and image capturing at very low noise levels. The whole approach is targeting to combine innovative but easy-to-find assistive components of affordable cost in local markets, emphasizing the challenges towards a really functioning solution accompanied by detailed performance data. The overall study is targeting the rapidly growing robotic vehicles market. The proposed platform is following the modern sustainability objectives as it is fully electric and can be assisted by solar panels, for increased autonomy. Finally, insight is given for future improvements and exploitation.

AB Typically, lane departure warning systems rely on lane lines being present on the road. However, in many scenarios, e.g., secondary roads or some streets in cities, lane lines are either not present or not sufficiently well signaled. In this work, we present a vision-based method to locate a vehicle within the road when no lane lines are present using only RGB images as input. To this end, we propose to fuse together the outputs of a semantic segmentation and a monocular depth estimation architecture to reconstruct locally a semantic 3D point cloud of the viewed scene. We only retain points belonging to the road and, additionally, to any kind of fences or walls that might be present right at the sides of the road. We then compute the width of the road at a certain point on the planned trajectory and, additionally, what we denote as the fence-to-fence distance. Our system is suited to any kind of motoring scenario and is especially useful when lane lines are not present on the road or do not signal the path correctly. The additional fence-to-fence distance computation is complementary to the road's width estimation. We quantitatively test our method on a set of images featuring streets of the city of Munich that contain a road-fence structure, so as to compare our two proposed variants, namely the road's width and the fence-to-fence distance computation. In addition, we also validate our system qualitatively on the Stuttgart sequence of the publicly available Cityscapes dataset, where no fences or walls are present at the sides of the road, thus demonstrating that our system can be deployed in a standard city-like environment. For the benefit of the community, we make our software open source.

AB Monterey Bay, California experiences near-annual blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia that can affect marine animal health and the economy, including impacts to tourism and commercial/recreational fisheries. One species in particular, P. australis, has been implicated in the most toxic of events, however other species within the genus can contribute to widespread variability in community structure and associated toxicity across years. Current monitoring methods are limited in their spatial coverage as well as their ability to capture the full suite of species present, thereby hindering understanding of HAS events and limiting predictive accuracy. An integrated deployment of multiple in situ platforms, some with autonomous adaptive sampling capabilities, occurred during two divergent bloom years in the bay, and uncovered detailed aspects of population and toxicity dynamics. A bloom in 2013 was characterized by spatial differences in Pseudo-nitzschia populations, with the low-toxin producer P. fraudulenta dominating the inshore community and toxic P. australis dominating the offshore community. An exceptionally toxic bloom in 2015 developed as a diverse Pseudo-nitzschia community abruptly transitioned into a bloom of highly toxic P. australis within the time frame of a week. Increases in cell density and proliferation coincided with strong upwelling of nutrients. High toxicity was driven by silicate limitation of the dense bloom. This temporal shift in species composition mirrored the shift observed further north in the California Current System off Oregon and Washington. The broad scope of sampling and unique platform capabilities employed during these studies revealed important patterns in bloom formation and persistence for Pseudo-nitzschia. Results underscore the benefit of expanded biological observing capabilities and targeted sampling methods to capture more comprehensive spatial and temporal scales for studying and predicting future events.

AB Civil construction sites are considered as one of the riskiest environments where many potential hazards may occur. To protect construction workers and prevent accidents in such sites, this paper proposes a novel design for an autonomous system that monitors, localizes, and warns site laborers who avail within danger zones. The proposed system is user-friendly, and its architecture is based on Internet of Things (IoT). The heterogeneous components of this architecture are seamlessly integrated into a middleware backend online server. To accurately detect and identify construction workers, the proposed system employs three combined techniques. They are 1) the 868 MHz radio frequency, 2) directional antennas, and 3) the 40 kHz ultrasound waves. Vehicle's rear is secured by a sensing unit that ensures good coverage along with a wearable device for workers. The design of the wearable device includes a set of components which are a radio transceiver (transmitter/receiver), a wake-up sensor, an alarm actuator, and a GPRS module. The wearable device has a power saving scheme with a current consumption as low as 0.5 mu A at 3 V supply; thanks to our RF wake-up sensor. Via proximity, this wearable device becomes hybrid (active/passive) in which it remains in deep sleep mode until the presence of a radio frequency (RF) field. Consequently, the rechargeable battery's life gets increased by up to 2 days of autonomy before recharging. Furthermore, the paper presents an implementation of wireless nodes that are powered by light energy using photovoltaic cells. These nodes adopt energy management and storage schemes for continuous operation for indoor and outdoor environments.

AB This paper investigates the adaptive fixed-time formation control for multi-AUV systems (MASs) in the presence of model uncertainties, ocean current disturbances and unknown actuator faults. In order to improve the robustness of the system, an adaptive fixed-time integral sliding mode disturbance observer (AFISMDO) is designed to estimate the lumped disturbance composed of model uncertainties, ocean current disturbances and unknown actuator faults. Based on the designed observer, an adaptive fixed-time fault-tolerant controller (AFTFTC) is designed by combining nonlinear command filter and backstepping technique which can ensure that the trajectory tracking errors of the follower AUVs and the corresponding virtual leader AUVs converge to the origin within a fixed time, so as to achieve the purpose of formation. Compared with the traditional finite-time control, the convergence time for the closed-loop system is independent of the initial state. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed control algorithm has superior control performance.

AB Precisely estimating a vehicle's pose in a prior map is a fundamental capability for autonomous driving. This task, however, remains challenging in low-texture and semi-static environments where the number of available features is limited and their attached objects are faced with the risk of positional change over time. To cope with the adverse conditions, we propose an innovative visual SLAM method that can correct the position of biased objects in the prior map besides estimating the accurate camera pose. Our approach is based upon the structure of independent object management to complete localization and mapping. Each object in the current frame is represented by a group of organized raster points. Owing to the adaptive pixel-based object rasterization, these raster points are more dependable to use in the visual SLAM pipeline. Assisted by the factor graph optimization, each object can be separately supervised although with multi-constraints from surroundings, resulting in robust tracking and map correction. With the benefit of GPU acceleration in data association, the execution time is sharply reduced. The proposed algorithm is validated in computer graphic render datasets.

AB Multi-access Edge Computing relies on the concept of moving part of the cloud resources closer to the users to address limitations of the traditional cloud in order to reduce communication latency and increase security. This makes Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) suitable for time-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles where they can support connectivity with a safe and more efficient experience. Nevertheless, MECs are generally deployed on constrained devices with limited resources, which may affect the infrastructure reliability and thus its trustworthiness.In this paper, we focus on a trust mechanism based on the interactions between MECs to increase reliability in the context of a service migration scenario, where MEC nodes can decide based on a trust score to which node to migrate their services and user information. Our proposed algorithm leverages ideas of the EigenTrust and RLIoT reputation system and combined with a novel correlation concept and a dynamic distance algorithm. From our simulations, our model shows better results in different scenarios and communication ranges. This work provides the core component of a complete trust management system for MECs and could be applied in various use cases.

AB In this article, we propose a system that can fuse inertial measurement unit (IMU), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and intermittent global positioning system (GPS) measurements to achieve high precision localization and mapping in large-scale environment. The iterated error-state Kalman filter is used to fuse IMU and LiDAR measurements to estimate relative motion information quickly. Based on the factor graph, LiDAR, GPS measurements, and loop closure are transformed into constraints for joint optimization to construct global map. A real-time GPS outlier detection method based on the IMU preintegration theory and residual chi-square test is designed. In addition, the use of robust kernel is supported to implicitly reduce the impact of undetected GPS outliers on the system. A LiDAR-based loop-closure detector is designed, which can search for a pair of point clouds with similar geometric information. Importantly, the performance of the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art methods through a series of experiments. The experimental results show that the method is robust and accurate to complete the task of localization and mapping in large-scale environment.

AB The wave glider is an ocean-wave-propelled autonomous marine vehicle with unique dual-body architecture, which can converse the energy obtained from the ocean wave into the forward thrust. In this paper, the dynamic models of the submerged glider based on dynamic characteristics of tandem hydrofoils and the surface float were separately established. The pitching angles of the hydrofoils and the submerged glider and the angle of attack between hydrofoils and relative current were considered for dynamic models and hydrodynamic coefficients. The translational hydrodynamic coefficient term for high-angle-of-attack passive motion of the submerged glider was calculated from static test simulations by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Moreover, the rotational damping coefficients and added mass coefficients varying with the pitching angle of hydrofoils were analyzed by the simulation of the vertical planar motion mechanism (VPMM) tests. Furthermore, the numerical simulation of longitudinal motion with the computed hydrodynamic coefficients was performed, and the simulation results were compared with the sea trial data. The analysis was performed, and conclusions were drawn, which would provide a theoretical reference for the design of the wave glider.

ID SCAN CONTEXT
AB The 3D LiDAR place recognition aims to estimate a coarse localization in a previously seen environment based on a single scan from a rotating 3D LiDAR sensor. The existing solutions to this problem include hand-crafted point cloud descriptors (e.g., ScanContext, M2DP, LiDAR IRIS) and deep learning-based solutions (e.g., PointNetVLAD, PCAN, LPD-Net, DAGC, MinkLoc3D), which are often only evaluated on accumulated 2D scans from the Oxford RobotCar dataset. We introduce MinkLoc3D-SI, a sparse convolution-based solution that utilizes spherical coordinates of 3D points and processes the intensity of 3D LiDAR measurements, improving the performance when a single 3D LiDAR scan is used. Our method integrates the improvements typical for hand-crafted descriptors (like ScanContext) with the most efficient 3D sparse convolutions (MinkLoc3D). Our experiments show improved results on single scans from 3D LiDARs (USyd Campus dataset) and great generalization ability (KITTI dataset). Using intensity information on accumulated 2D scans (RobotCar Intensity dataset) improves the performance, even though spherical representation doesn't produce a noticeable improvement. As a result, MinkLoc3D-SI is suited for single scans obtained from a 3D LiDAR, making it applicable in autonomous vehicles.

AB By integrating a single monocentric lens with a hemispherical silicon nanorod photodiode array, a wide-field-of-view camera is created that offers low optical aberration, deep depth of field and simple visual accommodation.
   Conventional wide-field-of-view cameras consist of multi-lens optics and flat image sensor arrays, which makes them bulky and heavy. As a result, they are poorly suited to advanced mobile applications such as drones and autonomous vehicles. In nature, the eyes of aquatic animals consist of a single spherical lens and a highly sensitive hemispherical retina, an approach that could be beneficial in the development of synthetic wide-field-of-view imaging systems. Here, we report an aquatic-vision-inspired camera that consists of a single monocentric lens and a hemispherical silicon nanorod photodiode array. The imaging system features a wide field of view, miniaturized design, low optical aberration, deep depth of field and simple visual accommodation. Furthermore, under vignetting, the photodiode array enables high-quality panoramic imaging due to the enhanced photodetection properties of the silicon nanorod photodiodes.

AB Safe and efficient crowd navigation for mobile robot is a crucial yet challenging task. Previous work has shown the power of deep reinforcement learning frameworks to train efficient policies. However, their performance deteriorates when the crowd size grows. We suggest that this can be addressed by enabling the network to identify and pay attention to the humans in the crowd that are most critical to navigation. We propose a novel network utilizing a graph representation to learn the policy. We first train a graph convolutional network based on human gaze data that accurately predicts human attention to different agents in the crowd as they perform a navigation task based on a top down view of the environment. We incorporate the learned attention into a graph-based reinforcement learning architecture. The proposed attention mechanism enables the assignment of meaningful weightings to the neighbors of the robot, and has the additional benefit of interpretability. Experiments on real-world dense pedestrian datasets with various crowd sizes demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-art methods, increasing task completion rate by 18.4% and decreasing navigation time by 16.4%.

AB Lane-level localization is a fundamental task for autonomous driving. As front cameras are easily disturbed by dynamic objects in urban environments, this paper presents an accurate lane-level localization approach using the around view monitoring (AVM) system. The paper proposes to detect the road features (i.e., road boundaries and road markings) based on pixel-wise semantic segmentation of raw fisheye images. The method can detect various types of road features and exclude dynamic objects from the localization. To address the problem of AVM-based localization with road features of different characteristics, this paper proposes coarse-scale localization (CSL) and fine-scale localization (FSL) methods for high-accurate localization. The CSL method leverages the road boundaries to provide an initial position; the FSL method estimates a high-accuracy position by matching nearby road markings with the map. The experiments in urban environments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves centimeter-level localization accuracy with five centimeters in the lateral direction and seventeen centimeters in the longitudinal direction.

AB Energy harvesting from moving structures for autonomous electrically powered applications, i.e. unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially in the case quadrotors, has been a common subject of scientific investigations in last years. Most of them have looked into improving the endurance of electrically powered UAVs using technologies such as photovoltaic or vibration harvesting. UAV platforms have a limited amount of power for electrical suppling. In order to keep a constant time of flight duration, the UAV can be equipped with an additional battery, which increases the total mass and causes higher energy losses. Therefore, we address this problem in our paper by proposing a vibration-based energy harvesting system. It consists of piezoelectric harvesters integrated into a frame of BLDC rotors. In order to check efficiency of the energy harvesting system, the copter is equipped with MFC harvesters. Taking into account this solution, the distributed-parameters of the electromechanical system in the modal coordinates are estimated using numerical methods. The simulation results showedhow the duty cycle of the PWM signal applied to the BLDC rotor and resistive load connected to the system influence on voltage generating by the piezo harvester, while experimental test allow verify them.

AB In recent years, popularity of unmanned air vehicles enormously increased due to their autonomous moving capability and applications in various domains. This also results in some serious security threats, that needs proper investigation and timely detection of the amateur drones (ADr) to protect the security sensitive institutions. In this paper, we propose the novel machine learning (ML) framework for detection and classification of ADr sounds out of the various sounds like bird, airplanes, and thunderstorm in the noisy environment. To extract the necessary features from ADr sound, Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), and linear predictive cepstral coefficients (LPCC) feature extraction techniques are implemented. After feature extraction, support vector machines (SVM) with various kernels are adopted to accurately classify these sounds. The experimental results verify that SVM cubic kernel with MFCC outperform LPCC method by achieving around 96.7% accuracy for ADr detection. Moreover, the results verified that the proposed ML scheme has more than 17% detection accuracy, compared with correlation-based drone sound detection scheme that ignores ML prediction.

AB An acoustic Digital MONitor (DMON) has been integrated into a Seaglider autonomous underwater vehicle to serve as a general-use tool for passive acoustic sensing of marine mammal vocalizations. The system is being developed as a complement to conventional ship-based cetacean survey methods. The acoustic system includes three omnidirectional hydrophones, one located on centerline of the aft payload hatch and one on each wingtip. An on-board real-time detector has been implemented to record an audio sample if ambient noise has risen above a user-prescribed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold level. The data size and the number of detections are available in semi-real time, and the acoustic data are retrieved upon recovery of the instrument. Because the DMON system interfaces with the Seaglider firmware, the glider pilot has the capability to modify several operational parameters governing the collection of acoustic data while the glider is deployed to tailor the data recording to the desired mission objectives. This implementation is referred to as the Seaglider Customizable Sampling Configuration (SCSC) DMON and has recorded a wide variety of cetacean vocal activity offshore the Hawaiian Islands.

AB Input design has a dominant role in developing the dynamic model of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) through system identification. Optimal input design is the process of generating informative inputs that can be used to generate the good quality dynamic model of AUVs. In a problem with optimal input design, the desired input signal depends on the unknown system which is intended to be identified. In this paper, the input design approach which is robust to uncertainties in model parameters is used. The Bayesian robust design strategy is applied to design input signals for dynamic modeling of AUVs. The employed approach can design multiple inputs and apply constraints on an AUV system's inputs and outputs. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is employed to solve the constraint robust optimization problem. The presented algorithm is used for designing the input signals for an AUV, and the estimate obtained by robust input design is compared with that of the optimal input design. According to the results, proposed input design can satisfy both robustness of constraints and optimality. (C) 2017 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An efficient obstacle detection technique is required so that navigating robots can avoid obstacles and potential hazards. This task is usually simplified by relying on structural patterns. However, obstacle detection constitutes a challenging problem in unstructured unknown environments, where such patterns may not exist. Talukder et al. (2002, IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium, pp. 610-618.) successfully derived a method to deal with such environments. Nevertheless, the method has a high computational cost and researchers that employ it usually rely on approximations to achieve real-time. We hypothesize that by using a graphics processing unit (GPU), the computing time of the method can be significantly reduced. Throughout the implementation process, we developed a general framework for processing dynamically-sized sliding windows on a GPU. The framework can be applied to other problems that require similar computation. Experiments were performed with a stereo camera and an RGB-D sensor, where the GPU implementations were compared to multi-core and single-core CPU implementations. The results show a significant gain in the computational performance, i.e. in a particular instance, a GPU implementation is almost 90 times faster than a single-core one.

AB The systems based on image processing have numerous applications in the domain of motion control of robots and autonomous vehicles. The current paper is oriented to the solution of the problem that precedes the implementation of automatic avoidance of the on-road obstacles-how to detect them, to track in the sequence of images, and to recognize which of them are stationary, incoming, or outgoing from the camera. The overall algorithm of obstacle classification presented in this paper consists of three basic phases: (1) image segmentation in order to extract the pixels belonging to the image of a road and the objects over it; (2) extraction of characteristic points inside the area of the obstacle, their description and tracking in following frames; and (3) estimation of distances between the camera, the obstacles and their rates of change (relative velocities). The verifications of particular steps of the proposed algorithm are illustrated using real road-traffic images, while the overall algorithm is tested using both synthesized sequences of images and the ones acquired in real driving.

AB Obstacle avoidance and navigation is a demanding task for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) due to the complex nature of the underwater environment. However, an automatic detection and tracking system is the primary element for an AUV or an aqueous surveillance network. Tracking underwater objects in an active context, represents an ongoing challenge in the field of signal processing. In order to detect the target's presence under water, the echoes reflected by the target are analysed by the receiver. Track accuracy is one of the paramount performance measures of a tracking system. Towards this, various methods such as Kalman filter (KF), extended Kalman filter (EKF) and least squares (LS) have been explored. However, all these methods have their own drawbacks. In this study, a new approach called modified gain EKF has been implemented on the simulated data for tracking of underwater moving object using bearing and elevation measurements. AUV fitted with a single sonar is used for validating the proposed bearing and elevation only tracking (BEOT) algorithm. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated in Monte Carlo simulations and results are presented in stipulated geometries.

AB Hydrogen used as an energy carrier is a promising alternative to diesel for autonomous railway motive power, but, globally, few prototypes exist. In 2012, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers held the inaugural Railway Challenge, in which the participating teams had to develop, design and construct a locomotive to run on 10.25 inch (260.35 mm) gauge track while meeting certain set design criteria as well as competing in operational challenges. The University of Birmingham Railway Challenge Team's locomotive design is described in this paper. The vehicle is the UK's first hydrogen-powered locomotive and is called Hydrogen Pioneer. The drive-system consists of a hydrogen tank, a 1.1 kW proton-exchange-membrane fuel cell stack, a 4.3 kWh battery pack and two 2.2 kW permanent-magnet traction motors. The development of the locomotive, from the original concept to the final design, and the design validation are all presented in this paper. The locomotive completed successfully all challenges through which the proof of the concept of a hydrogen-hybrid locomotive was established.

ID OBJECT DETECTION; ENVIRONMENT
AB Maritime obstacle detection is critical for safe navigation of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). While the accuracy of image-based detection methods has advanced substantially, their computational and memory requirements prohibit deployment on embedded devices. In this paper, we analyze the current best-performing maritime obstacle detection network, WaSR. Based on the analysis, we then propose replacements for the most computationally intensive stages and propose its embedded-compute-ready variant, eWaSR. In particular, the new design follows the most recent advancements of transformer-based lightweight networks. eWaSR achieves comparable detection results to state-of-the-art WaSR with only a 0.52% F1 score performance drop and outperforms other state-of-the-art embedded-ready architectures by over 9.74% in F1 score. On a standard GPU, eWaSR runs 10x faster than the original WaSR (115 FPS vs. 11 FPS). Tests on a real embedded sensor OAK-D show that, while WaSR cannot run due to memory restrictions, eWaSR runs comfortably at 5.5 FPS. This makes eWaSR the first practical embedded-compute-ready maritime obstacle detection network. The source code and trained eWaSR models are publicly available.

AB Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become an enabling technology for building accurate image classifiers, and are increasingly being applied in many ICT systems such as autonomous vehicles. Unfortunately, classifiers can be deceived by images that are altered due to failures of the visual camera, preventing the proper execution of the classification process. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to build image classifiers that can guarantee accurate classification even in the presence of such camera failures. This study crafts classifiers that are robust to failures of the visual camera by augmenting the training set with artificially altered images that simulate the effects of such failures. Such a data augmentation approach improves classification accuracy with respect to the most common data augmentation approaches, even in the absence of camera failures. To provide experimental evidence for our claims, we exercise three DNN image classifiers on three image datasets, in which we inject the effects of many failures into the visual camera. Finally, we applied eXplainable AI to debate why classifiers trained with the data augmentation approach proposed in this study can tolerate failures of the visual camera.

AB This paper studies performance comparison of two shuttle-based storage and retrieval system (SBS/RS) configurations developed on flexible or non-flexible travel policies of shuttles in the system. In the non-flexible SBS/RS, a shuttle is dedicated to a tier so that it cannot travel out of its dedicated aisle and tier. A lifting mechanism is installed in each aisle to provide vertical travel for loads. In flexible SBS/RS, shuttles can travel between tiers by a separate lifting mechanism installed on the other edge point of each aisle. The advantage of that flexible design is that there might be decreased number of shuttles settling in the system compared to the non-flexible design. We simulate the two system configurations and conduct an experimental design for the comparison purpose. Based on the three-performance metrics: total investment cost, throughput rate and energy consumption per transaction, the results show that mainly the flexible system provides better results which might be considered as future system investment for SBS/RS.

ID AVOIDANCE
AB Radar detection and tracking of targets in the marine environment are common tasks performed to ensure the safe navigation of ships or monitor traffic in harbor areas. More recently, radar technology has been proposed to support the collision avoidance system of autonomous surface vehicles, which are characterized by severe constraints in terms of payload and space. The paper investigates the performance of a small and lightweight 24 GHz Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radar, originally developed for automotive applications, to localize marine targets at short range. A complete signal processing strategy is presented combining MIMO radar imaging, detection, and tracking algorithms. The validation of the proposed signal processing chain is firstly performed thanks to numerical tests based on synthetic data. After, results of experimental trials carried out in the marine environment are reported. These results demonstrate that the considered radar together with the adopted signal processing strategy allows the localization of static targets and the tracking of moving targets with satisfactory performance, thus encouraging its use in marine environments.

ID HASHING-BASED APPROACH; SERVICE RECOMMENDATION
AB At present, the number of vehicle owners is increasing, and the cars with autonomous driving functions have attracted more and more attention. The lane detection combined with cloud computing can effectively solve the drawbacks of traditional lane detection relying on feature extraction and high definition, but it also faces the problem of excessive calculation. At the same time, cloud data processing combined with edge computing can effectively reduce the computing load of the central nodes. The traditional lane detection method is improved, and the current popular convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to build a dual model based on instance segmentation. In the image acquisition and processing processes, the distributed computing architecture provided by edge-cloud computing is used to improve data processing efficiency. The lane fitting process generates a variable matrix to achieve effective detection in the scenario of slope change, which improves the real-time performance of lane detection. The method proposed in this paper has achieved good recognition results for lanes in different scenarios, and the lane recognition efficiency is much better than other lane recognition models.

AB Recent miniaturization in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) technology encourages the use of many small UAVs for search missions in unknown environments, provided that the autonomous and adaptive coordination logic can be effective. In this research field, biologically inspired metaheuristics have been proposed to mimics swarms, flocks, and other coordination schemas. The design and management of such systems is a research challenge when considering (i) combination and optimization of multiple metaheuristics and (ii) enhancements of biologically inspired metaheuristic through technological advances. In this paper the swarm coordination of UAVs employed in target search is based on flocking and stigmergy, to provide robust formation control and dynamic environmental information sharing, respectively. The design of both metaheuristics takes into account UAVs equipment, and the coordination logic is adapted to the mission by means of a differential evolutionary algorithm. This algorithm optimizes the aggregated structural parameters of all metaheuristics to allow the most efficient coordination with respect to the mission environment. Some possible enhancements of stigmergy are studied by simulating target search tasks on synthetic and real-world scenarios. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rapid intelligent detection of airports from remote sensing images is required to accomplish autonomous intelligent landing of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other tasks. To address the insufficiency of traditional models in detecting airports under complicated backgrounds from remote sensing images, we propose an end-to-end remote sensing airport hierarchical expression and detection model based on deep transferable convolutional neural networks. Based on transfer learning, we solve the fundamental problem of overfitting due to the inadequate number of labeled remote sensing images by transferring the network model from natural image source domain to remote sensing image target domain. In addition, we introduce a cascade region proposal network with soft-decision nonmaximal suppression to improve the network structure and the performance of our method under complex backgrounds. Moreover, we use skip-layer feature fusion and hard example mining methods to improve the object expression ability and the training efficiency. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the method established in this letter can quickly and effectively detect different types of airports over complex backgrounds and obtain better detection performance than the other detection methods.

AB Scanning our surroundings has become one of the key challenges in automation. Effective and efficient position, distance and velocity sensing is key to accurate decision making in automated applications from robotics to driverless cars. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has become a key tool in these 3D sensing applications, where the time-of-flight (TOF) of photons is used to recover distance information. These systems typically rely on scanning of a laser spot to recover position information. Here we demonstrate a hybrid LiDAR approach which combines a multi-view camera system for position and distance information, and a simple (scanless) LiDAR system for velocity tracking and depth accuracy. We show that we are able to combine data from the two component systems to provide a compound image of a scene with position, depth and velocity data at more than 1 frame per second with depth accuracy of 2.5 cm or better. This hybrid approach avoids the bulk and expense of scanning systems while adding velocity information. We hope that this approach will offer a simpler, more robust alternative to 3D scanning systems for autonomous vehicles.

DE Security; privacy; resource allocation; long term evolution (LTE);

AB The 3rd Generation Partnership Project, Long Term Evolution (LTE) has recently completed its specifications for connected vehicular (V2X) service. In the meantime, researchers in academia and industry are addressing its security issues involving applications, network, and medium access control (MAC) layer protocols. However, the security issue in regard to resource allocation has never been considered until now. Especially in LTE PC5 link, resource allocation with a regular pattern (semi-persistence) to deliver V2X periodic messages may leak the location privacy, even when the other protocol layers are tightly secured. In this proposed paper, we provide a secure resource allocation strategy where the vehicular users employ different resource allocation approaches to various types of message deliveries to preserve their privacy. Specifically, the emergency message delivery, being the most time critical and occurring in random time, is provisioned using PC5 autonomous resource allocation (ARA) to protect the privacy. To curtail the collision, we propose a novel ARA approach called random access with status feedback (RASFB) based on Rel. 12 mode 2. The performance analysis shows the higher performance of the proposed RASFB when compared with the Rel. 12 and Rel. 14 without sacrificing security.

AB Studies concerning the use of thermoelectric effect for the conversion of thermal energy into electricity have become increasingly numerous since applications of the thermoelectric phenomenon can be limitless. Thermoelectric Generators (TEG) have shown promising results in combustion vehicles, with an overall efficiency increment from 33% to 57%, in addition to an increase of 6% in the available power in an automobile. In the aerospace industry, thermoelectric devices have been employed due to the need of making the most of the available energy. Thermoelectric modules are also used in the harvest of waste heat in wood stoves, furnace walls, and industrial chimneys. In Bioengineering, there are applications for small-scale generation including the use of heat from the human body to feed microelectronic devices and autonomous sensors. Therefore, the article shows a review of the use of thermoelectricity for the energy harvesting, beginning with the main concepts and definitions on the subject, followed by the state of the art containing the main methods and advances in science and technology for the development and application of solid-state micro-generators to capture residual energies.

AB Nowadays, professional fleets and nonprofessional drivers pursue to reduce the consumption of fuel and to reduce their travel times. Nevertheless, this may be challenging in urban areas due to the density of traffic. Dense traffic increases travel times and, as a result, the consumption of fuel and the generation of pollution. Thus, it is very important to develop new systems and models that allow us to reduce the negative impacts caused by traffic jams. This paper presents a communication system based on the Wi-Fi Direct technology, in which a conventional smartphone is used to detect and prevent traffic jams in urban areas in real-time. We have developed an autonomous system with commonly available technologies. Our system uses a decision algorithm to determine when a traffic jam occurs (probable and sure), informing other vehicles about this situation. Drivers may act in accordance and change their initial route with the aim of avoiding traffic jams and, consequently, reducing travel times and fuel consumption. Through several field tests in which different conditions have been considered, the results show the feasibility of our system.

AB In the complex underwater environment, the performance of microelectro-mechanical system sensors is degraded sharply and the errors will become much larger. Especially when the magnetic sensor is disturbed by the external magnetic interference, the measurements become unobservable so that the navigation information is estimated erroneously. To solve this problem, the paper proposes a novel method fusing Quasi-Newton and cubature Kalman filter (QNCKF). This method takes full advantage of the computation efficiency of the Quasi-Newton and the estimation accuracy of CKF in the case of nonlinearity. The performance of QNCKF is verified theoretically and evaluated by experiments. The results indicate that when the magnetic sensor is interfered, QNCKF and CKF still can maintain high estimation accuracy, whereas the extended Kalman filter performs poorly. Moreover, QNCKF is superior to CKF in the aspect of computational efficiency. Therefore, QNCKF has the highest priority in terms of estimation accuracy and computational efficiency among the three methods and it is more suitable to be applied to the underwater gliders than the other two methods.

ID WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS
AB Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are widely-used. The nodes in traditional WSNs are usually fixed, which means that the nodes around the base stations will bear more communication load. This uneven load will cause quick exhaustion of network energy and the phenomenon of "Energy Hole". In recent years, researchers have been trying to solve this problem by introducing moving nodes that are considered as the sink nodes (Sink) to collect the data in WSNs. A moving node can be moving tramcars, moving cars on bridge or autonomous underwater vehicles, etc. However, in reality, the moving nodes have certain constrains on both space and capacity. In this paper, the network problems such as the node energy, the sink movement distance upper limit and the communication loss, are formally modeled as linear programming models. Thus, the optimal sink moving path can be determined by solving these models. Experiments show that the models can be applied to small and medium size WSNs with acceptable running time. However, the running time becomes extremely long when the network size is scaled up.

ID IMAGE MOMENTS; CONTROLLER; QUADROTOR; DESIGN
AB This paper presents a vision guidance approach using an image-based visual servo (IBVS) for an aerial manipulator combining a multirotor with a multidegree of freedom robotic arm. To take into account the dynamic characteristics of the combined manipulation platform, the kinematic and dynamic models of the combined system are derived. Based on the combined model, a passivity-based adaptive controller which can be applied on both position and velocity control is designed. The position control is utilized for waypoint tracking such as taking off and landing, and the velocity control is engaged when the platform is guided by visual information. In addition, a guidance law utilizing IBVS is employed with modifications. To secure the view of an object with an eye-in-hand camera, IBVS is utilized with images taken from a fisheye camera. Also, to compensate underactuation of the multirotor, an image adjustment method is developed. With the proposed control and guidance laws, autonomous flight experiments involving grabbing and transporting an object are carried out. Successful experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approaches can be applied in various types of manipulation missions.

AB This paper evaluates and tests the HUGIN 1000 HUS AUV as a carrier platform for the Laser Optical Plankton Counter (LOPC). The LOPC was mounted outside on top of the carrier platform, and the tests confirm that this concept did not create turbulence and zooplankton avoidance. A negligible velocity difference between the flow passing through the sampling tube and the AUV speed was detected. The abundance recorded by the LOPC onboard HUGIN 1000 HUS was within the same order of magnitude compared to the zooplankton abundance from traditional net-based measurements. The results showed zooplankton abundance in the range of 70 to 180 individuals m(-3), while other, traditional net-based measurements have indicated 27-332 individuals m(-3) from the same area and same depth layer. Note that these numbers are minimum and maximum values observed from a vast number of samples. The mean is approximately 200 individuals m(-3). The results provide new and unique high-resolution biological data of deep-water copepod communities. The application of AUVs in marine ecological research introduces advanced methodology with potential to address new scientific questions in deep water habitats.

AB This paper explores the fusion of inertial information with vision for 3D reconstruction. A method is proposed for vertical line segment detection and subsequent local geometric map building. Visual and inertial sensing are two sensory modalities that can be explored to give robust solutions on image segmentation and recovery of 3D structure from images, increasing the capabilities of autonomous vehicles and enlarging the application potential of vision systems. From the inertial sensors, a camera stereo rig, and a few system parameters we can recover the 3D parameters of the ground plane and vertical lines. The homography between stereo images of ground points can be found. By detecting the vertical line segments in each image, and using the homography of ground points for the foot of each segment, the lines can be matched and reconstructed in 3D. The mobile robot then maps the detected vertical line segments in a world map as it moves. To build this map an outlier removal method is implemented and a statistical approach used, so that a simplified metric map can be obtained for robot navigation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Technology is fundamental to understanding our ocean and has been used to conduct oceanographic research for over a century. We are in an age of fast innovation and technical advancements that are pushing the boundaries of marine research, exploration, data collection, and telecommunications at sea. Through this, scientists are gaining the ability to collect data at reduced costs, more efficiently, for longer durations, and on scales previously beyond human reach. As a consequence, our knowledge of the ocean is rapidly evolving and, along with that, our capacity to excite broader public interest and inform the better stewardship of our planet. This review provides examples of (1) successful technologies that have been used in oceanographic research, many aboard R/V Falkor; (2) prototypes that have the potential to be used more extensively; and (3) innovations in other fields that have not yet been adapted for use in the ocean. This is not an exhaustive review of existing marine technologies that fit these criteria, but collectively, they are increasing the pace of oceanographic discovery and research.

AB Maneuver decision-making is essential for autonomous air combat. However, previous methods usually make decisions to aim at the target instead of hitting the target and use discrete action spaces instead of continuous action spaces. While these simplifications make maneuver decision-making easier, they also make maneuver decision-making more unrealistic. Meanwhile, previous studies usually rely on handcrafted reward functions, which are troublesome to design. Therefore, to solve these problems, we propose an automatic curriculum reinforcement learning method that enables agents to maneuver effectively in air combat from scratch. On the basis of curriculum reinforcement learning, maneuver decision-making is divided into a series of sub-tasks from easy to difficult. Thus, agents can gradually learn how to complete a series of sub-tasks, from easy to difficult without handcrafted reward functions. The ablation studies show that automatic curriculum learning is essential for reinforcement learning; namely, agents cannot make effective decisions without curriculum learning. Simulations show that, after training, agents are able to make effective decisions given different states, including tracking, attacking, and escaping, which are both rational and interpretable.

AB Computing the pose from 3D data acquired in two different frames is of high importance for several robotic tasks like odometry, SLAM and place recognition. The pose is generally obtained by solving a least-squares problem given points-to-points, points-to-planes or points to lines correspondences. The non-linear least-squares problem can be solved by iterative optimization or, more efficiently, in closed-form by using solvers of polynomial systems. In this letter, a complete and accurate closed-form solution for a weighted least-squares problem is proposed. Adding weights for each correspondence allow to increase robustness to outliers. Contrary to existing methods, the proposed approach is complete since it is able to solve the problem in any non-degenerate case and it is accurate since it is guaranteed to find the global optimal estimate of the weighted least-squares problem. Simulations and experiments on real data demonstrate the superior accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm compared to previous approaches.

DE Localization; visual-inertial SLAM
ID KALMAN FILTER; ROBUST
AB Drift-free localization is essential for autonomous vehicles. In this letter, we address the problem by proposing a filter-based framework, which integrates the visual-inertial odometry and the measurements from the pre-built map. In this framework, the transformation between the odometry frame and the pre-built map frame is augmented into the system state vector and estimated on the fly. Besides, we maintain the map keyframe poses and employ the Schmidt extended Kalman filter to update the state partially so that the uncertainty of the map information can be consistently considered with low computational complexity. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that the ever-changing linearization points of the estimated augmented state make the original four-dimensional unobservable subspace vanish, leading to the inconsistent estimation in practice. To relieve this problem, we employ the first-estimate Jacobian (FEJ) technique to maintain the correct observability properties of the augmented system. Furthermore, we introduce an observability-constrained updating method to compensate for the significant accumulated error after the long-term absence of map-based measurements. Finally, by evaluating the system through both simulation and real-world experiments, we confirm that the system has good consistency and low computational complexity.

AB In this paper, the problem of computing the global time-optimal Dubins trajectory between two configurations (two points with prescribed heading angles) while avoiding a moving obstacle by a specified safe distance is discussed. The obstacle is allowed to move on any arbitrary trajectory as long as its trajectory satisfies some regularity constraints. By Pontryagin's maximum principle, the fundamental segments of the time-optimal trajectory are proposed. Along each segment, the control input is either constant or is expressed in state-feedback form. Thereafter, using the necessary conditions for state-inequality constraints, the underlying geometric and analytical properties that govern the concatenation of these fundamental segments are revealed. All these properties exhibit solely state-dependent relations. This has two-fold applications: (1) such relations are essential in ruling out spurious extremals obtained by numerical optimal control methods, and (2) they enable the formulation of a set of nonlinear equations whose solution gives rise to the exact time-optimal trajectory. Numerical examples are presented, validating and highlighting the application of these properties.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate, continuous and seamless state estimation is the fundamental module for intelligent navigation applications, such as self-driving cars and autonomous robots. However, it is often difficult for a standalone sensor to fulfill the demanding requirements of precise navigation in complex scenarios. To fill this gap, this letter proposes to exploit the complementariness of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS), inertial measurement unit (IMU) and vision via a tightly coupled integration method, aiming to achieve continuous and accurate navigation in urban environments. Specifically, the raw GNSS carrier phase and pseudorange measurements, IMU data, and visual features are directly fused at the observation level through a centralized Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to make full use of the multi-sensor information and reject potential outlier measurements. Furthermore, the widely used high-precision GNSS models including precise point positioning (PPP) and real-time kinematic (RTK) are unified in the proposed integrated system to increase usability and flexibility. We validate the performance of the proposed method on several challenging datasets collected in urban canyons and compare against the loosely coupled and state-of-the-art methods.

AB Connectivity is essential in wireless sensor and actor networks (WSANs) deployed for data collection and monitoring applications. WSANs serving in inhospitable environments are prone to damage, and sometimes, the concurrent multiple node failures in the same area may cause network partitioning. The autonomous network recovery in harsh environments is challenging because the nodes in different partitions cannot determine the scope of the damage. This paper proposes an approach called partition detection and recovery by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in damaged WSANs using N-angle clustering (N-anglePDRU), which consists of all the phases required to accumulate information about the network partitions and reconnect them successfully. The algorithm is evaluated for different randomly generated network topologies according to various state-of-the-art parameters such as detection and recovery time, messages transmitted, relay node count, and distance traveled by UAVs. The proposed approach is also compared with the existing algorithms, and the obtained results demonstrate that N-anglePDRU recovers the partitioned network in less recovery time with minimum relay nodes and distance traveled.

AB Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (v-SLAM) and navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are receiving increasing attention in both research and education. However, extensive physical testing can be expensive and time-consuming due to safety precautions, battery constraints, and the complexity of hardware setups. For the efficient development of navigation algorithms and autonomous systems, as well as for education purposes, the ROS-Gazebo-PX4 simulator was customized in-depth, integrated into our previous released research works, and provided as an end-to-end simulation (E2ES) solution for UAV, v-SLAM, and navigation applications. Unlike most other similar works, which can only stimulate certain parts of the navigation algorithms, the E2ES platform simulates all of the localization, mapping, and path-planning kits in one simulator. The navigation stack performs well in the E2ES test bench with the absolute pose errors of 0.3 m (translation) and 0.9 degree (rotation), respectively, for an 83 m length trajectory. Moreover, the E2ES provides an out-of-box, click-and-fly autonomy in UAV navigation. The project source code is opened for the benefit of the research community.

AB This paper focuses on the development of new approaches to observe transient phenomena in critical marine environments using autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs) for the acquisition of physical and biogeochemical parameters of water and seabed characterization. The connection with metrological principles, together with the adoption of observing methodologies adjustable according to the specific marine environment being studied, allows researchers to obtain results that are reliable, reproducible, and comparable with those obtained through the classic monitoring methodologies. Tests were executed in dramatically dynamic, sensitive, and fragile areas, where the study and application of new methodologies is required to observe phenomena strongly localized in space and requiring very high resolutions, in time. Moreover, the harsh environmental conditions may present risks not only for the quality and quantity of the acquired data but also for the instrumentation and the operators. This is the case, for instance, in polar marine environments in proximity of tidal glaciers and in the Mediterranean Sea in areas characterized by seabed degassing activities, where AMV-supported monitoring procedures can allow for the safe observation of not repeatable and not completely predictable events.

AB In this paper, a single parameter Guardian Map-based simple adaptive guidance and control architecture for spacecraft formation flying is developed. When compared with traditional vehicles, the dynamics of spacecraft features larger non-linearities, tighter coupling and higher uncertainty as the eccentricity of an orbit increases. In addition, most formation flying applications involve following bounded relative trajectories that are only applicable to circular orbits and hence becomes an unnatural trajectory when used on eccentric orbits, resulting in unnecessary fuel consumption. Making use of a combination of nonlinear Simple Adaptive Control and Guardian Map theories, a novel autonomous adaptive guidance and control system is developed such that the desired closed-loop stability of the system and asymptotic convergence is guaranteed throughout the orbit while tracking fuel-efficient natural trajectories that are applicable to eccentric orbits. Simulation results show various new types and sizes of bounded natural relative orbits to illustrate the increased performance and robustness of the proposed adaptive controller compared to a conventional non-adaptive linear quadratic regulator found in literature.

AB The emergence of ride-hailing services offered by the Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) globally are substantially affecting how we travel by car, and as such, use parking facilities. Airport parking, which is a substantial source of revenue for the airports, is no different and anecdotal evidence suggest a reduction in parking revenue in airports in recent years as a result of the popularity of ride-hailing services. This research investigates the effects of the entry of ride-hailing services on airport parking patronage using three large airports (John F Kennedy International, Newark Liberty International and LaGuardia) in the US as a case study. Intervention analysis technique was used on time-series monthly parking data at these airports, controlling for passenger numbers. Results indicate there was a statistically significant reduction in the numbers of cars parked at all three airports since the introduction of ride-hailing services, confirming the anecdotal evidence. Findings have implications not only for airport business and revenue models, but also for wider effects of ride-hailing and automation.

AB This paper presents a method to determine the performance of shuttle-based storage and retrieval systems (SBS/RS) with tier captive single-aisle shuttles and multiple-deep storage. The basis of this calculation method is a continuous-time open queueing system with limited capacity. The cycle times of lifts and shuttles, determined by a spatial value approach, can be directly used in the presented method with their time distributions. To take the multiple storage into account, a probability-based approach is applied. The invented approach is validated by a comparison with a discrete event simulation. A European material handling provider had given the data used in this comparison. Finally, an example is presented to outline how this calculation model can be used for designing SBS/RS which fulfil the predefined requirements. The result of this example is that with an increase of the storage depth to a certain value, the throughput increases and the cost decreases up to the same storage depth.

AB The crewed exploration of Moon and Mars requires the construction and maintenance of infrastructure on the alien surfaces before a crew arrives. Robotic coworkers are envisioned to take over the physical labor required to set-up crewhabitats, energy supplies, and return vehicles in the hazardous environment. Deploying these robots in such a remote location poses a challenge that requires autonomous robot capabilities in combination with effective Human Robot Interfaces (HRIs), which comply with the harsh conditions of deep space operations. An astronaut-robot teleoperation concept targeting these topics has been evaluated in DLR and ESA's METERON SUPVIS Justin experiment where astronauts on-board the International Space Station (ISS) commanded DLR's humanoid robotRollin' Justin in a simulated Martian environment on Earth. This work extends on our previously presented approach to supervised autonomy. It examines the results of the two follow-up experiment sessions which investigated maintenance and assembly tasks in real-world scenarios. We discuss the use of our system in real space-to-ground deployment and analyze key performance metrics of the HRI and the feedback given by the astronauts.

AB In this work, a high-specific-energy magnesium/water battery (Mg/H2O battery) combining Mg oxidation with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is developed for full-depth ocean application. With the optimized platinum loading associated with moderate Ni(OH)(2) on nickel foam, the performance can be increased obviously. Coupled with AZ91 Mg alloy anode, the specific energy of Mg/H2O battery reaches a dramatic value of 1003 W h kg(-1). Moreover, ultrahigh pressure of 1100 bar in the deep-sea simulated condition brings negligible effects on the performance of battery and electrodes. The influence of low temperature can be reduced to an acceptable level under the application at low discharge current density. Stable discharge of the battery for 100 days is also obtained. This work provides a new idea to supply power source with high specific energy, excellent environment adaptability, good safety and low cost for underwater application.

TI DESIGN OF ADAPTIVE FUZZY FRACTIONAL ORDER PID CONTROLLER FOR AUTONOMOUS
   UNDERWATER VEHICLE (AUV) IN HEADING AND DEPTH ATTITUDES
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MARITIME ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper deals with the design of new self-tuning Fuzzy Fractional Order PID (AFFOPID) controller based on nonlinear MIMO structure for an AUV in order to enhance the performance in both transient state and steady state of traditional ND controller. It is particularly advantageous when the effects of highly nonlinear processes, like high maneuver, parameters variation, have to be controlled in presence of sensor noises and wave disturbances. Aspects of AUV controlling are crucial because of Complexity and highly coupled dynamics, time variety and difficulty in hydrodynamic modeling. In this try, the comprehensive nonlinear model of AUV is derived through kinematics and dynamic equations. The scaling factor of the proposed AFFOPlD Controller is adjusted online at different underwater conditions. Combination of adaptive fuzzy methods and PI lambda D-mu controllers can enhance solving the uncertainty challenge in the HD parameters and AUV parameter uncertainty. The simulation results show that developed control system is stable, competent and efficient enough to control the AUV in path following with stabilized and controlled speed. Obtained results demonstrate that the proposed controller has good performance and significant robust stability in comparation to traditional tuned PID controllers.

ID REDUNDANCY RESOLUTION; DESIGN
AB This paper presents the control framework that has been proposed and successfully employed within the TRIDENT EU FP7 project, the aim of which is to develop a multipurpose Intervention Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (I-AUV) exhibiting smart manipulation capabilities, for interventions within unstructured underwater environments. In particular, the work focuses on the exploitation of the highly redundant system for achieving a dexterous object grasping, while also satisfying a set of conditions of scalar inequality type to be achieved ultimately. These represent safety and/or operational-enabling conditions for the overall system itself, such as, for instance, respecting joint limits and keeping the object grossly centered in the camera system. Thus the design of a control architecture exhibiting such a property first required an extension of the classical task priority framework, to be performed in such a way as to also account, in a uniform manner, for inequality conditions to be achieved ultimately. Then, following a description on how such an extension has been made, both simulations and experimental trials are successively presented to show how the developed TRIDENT I-AUV system is able to properly exploit all the redundant degrees of freedom for achieving all the established objectives.

AB Unmanned aircraft systems have the potential to perform many of the dangerous missions currently flown by manned aircraft, yet the complexity of some tasks, such as air combat, have precluded unmanned aircraft systems from successfully carrying out these missions autonomously. This paper presents a formulation of a level-flight fixed-velocity one-on-one air-combat maneuvering problem and an approximate dynamic programming approach for computing an efficient approximation of the optimal policy. In the version of the problem formulation considered, the aircraft learning the optimal policy is given a slight performance advantage. This approximate dynamic programming approach provides a fast response to a rapidly changing tactical situation, long planning horizons, and good performance, without explicit coding of air-combat tactics. The method's success is due to extensive feature development, reward shaping, and trajectory sampling. An accompanying fast and effective rollout-based policy extraction method is used to accomplish online implementation. Simulation results are provided that demonstrate the robustness of the method against an opponent, beginning from both offensive and defensive situations. Flight results are also presented using unmanned aircraft systems flown at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's real-time indoor autonomous vehicle test environment.

AB CityMobil is an integrated project in the sixth Framework Programme of the European Union. The objective of the project is to achieve a more effective organization of urban transport, resulting in a more rational use of motorized traffic with less congestion and pollution, safer driving, a higher quality of living, and enhanced integration with spatial development. Subproject 1 of CityMobil focuses on demonstration activities with the objective of demonstrating the feasibility of innovative and advanced urban transport solutions and to evaluate the systems according to their impact. Three large-scale demonstrations were carried out. At Heathrow Airport in London, a personal rapid transit system connects the car park to the new terminal building. In Rome, cyberears collect visitors from the car park and bring them to the entrance of the city's new exhibition buildings. In Castellon, Spain, an autonomous guided bus links the university with the city center and the seaside. Other activities (so-called small demonstrations and showcases) are carried out in the framework of the CityMobil project. These additional activities are intended to raise awareness in European cities of innovative forms of urban transportation based on cybercars and advanced city vehicles.

AB Multiple mobile robots in formation are often required to dock to each other to overcome the limitations, such as battery failure, transportation capacity, and maneuverability on rough terrains; however, it is challenging to design a single controller that navigates the robots to dock to each other, maintains the other robots in formation, and is applicable to both docked and nondocked robots, while it is also robust to uncertainties and disturbances. This article proposes a novel robust subsumption architecture for nonholonomic mobile robots in formation with docking capability. In addition to docking, the robots, i.e., all the nondocked robots and the front-docked robots, maintain a formation that can also be switched automatically to other configurations when necessary and avoid collisions with other robots and dynamic obstacles. The proposed subsumption control architecture takes into account each follower's desired goal as well as its docking condition to synthesize a control law as a velocity control signal that is then used to determine the robust input torque for each follower using the robots' dynamics. The Lyapunov stability of the controller is also proved. We also develop strategies for efficient centralized motion planning of the followers to achieve various goals, e.g., formation keeping/switching, docking, and collision avoidance. The effectiveness of our proposed methodology was verified in simulations as well as implementations on a virtual robot environment. Note to Practitioners-Multiple mobile robots, especially when operating as a formation, are able to perform tasks that are beyond the capabilities of individual robots. Existing formation control approaches neglect some realistic limitations of mobile robots, such as battery failure, limited transportation capacity, and maneuverability, to name a few. This article was motivated by these realistic limitations of mobile robots when operating in formation, and it suggests a new approach for navigation of such robots by docking some (or all) of these robots to each other and pursue a variety of goals. The goal includes autonomous docking, formation keeping/switching, and collision avoidance in dynamic environments. We include robot dynamics and system uncertainties in our algorithm and provide a robust control methodology. Therefore, the developed methodologies in this article can be adopted in real applications that require robots to be supplied with sufficient battery or having a large payload capacity, e.g., agricultural robotics.

AB Distributed learning is an important task in emerging applications such as localization and navigation, Internet-of-Things, and autonomous vehicles. This paper establishes a theoretical framework for learning states that evolve in real time over networks. Specifically, each agent node in the network aims to infer a time-varying state in a decentralized manner by using the node's local observations and the messages received from other nodes within its communication range. As a result, the inference accuracy of a node is significantly affected by the quality of its received messages. This calls for carefully designed strategies for generating messages that are able to provide sufficient information for the receiver and are robust to channel impairments. This paper presents communication-efficient encoding strategies for generating transmitted messages and derives a sufficient condition for the boundedness of the distributed inference error of all the agent nodes over time. The findings of this paper provide guidelines for the design of communication-efficient distributed learning in complex networked systems.

AB Spacecraft orbit evasion is an effective method to ensure space safety. In the spacecraft's orbital plane, the space non-cooperate target with autonomous approaching to the spacecraft may have a dangerous rendezvous. To deal with this problem, an optimal maneuvering strategy based on the relative navigation observability degree is proposed with angles-only measurements. A maneuver evasion relative navigation model in the spacecraft's orbital plane is constructed and the observability measurement criteria with process noise and measurement noise are defined based on the posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound. Further, the optimal maneuver evasion strategy in spacecraft's orbital plane based on the observability is proposed. The strategy provides a new idea for spacecraft to evade safety threats autonomously. Compared with the spacecraft evasion problem based on the absolute navigation, more accurate evasion results can be obtained. The simulation indicates that this optimal strategy can weaken the system's observability and reduce the state estimation accuracy of the non-cooperative target, making it impossible for the non-cooperative target to accurately approach the spacecraft.

TI Roadside HD Map Object Reconstruction Using Monocular Camera

AB The traditional HD map production based on mapping vehicles equipped with expensive sensors (e.g. LiDAR) struggles to keep the frequently changing HD maps up-to-date, thus calling for great research efforts in the HD map reconstruction using low-cost vision sensors. However, most existing works in this area limit their focus on reconstructing the landmarks on the road surface. This letter widens this limited scope by focusing on the roadside object reconstruction with a monocular camera. We propose a novel object-level reconstruction framework that boasts two advantageous features: 1) a novel 3D model estimation method to directly reconstruct the specific roadside objects in a vectorized format using their prior geometric knowledge, and 2) a novel data association method to solve the complex tracking problem of roadside objects that often yield thin and coherent observations. The proposed framework is evaluated on both typical highway and urban scenarios in public KAIST Urban dataset. The results demonstrate that our algorithm can reconstruct the roadside objects with high accuracy and recall, and outperforms classic Structure from Motion (SfM) and deep-learning-based methods by a large margin.

ID INVERSE DESIGN; RESOLUTION
AB Miniaturized image classifiers are potential for revolutionizing their applications in optical communication, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare. With subwavelength structure enabled directional diffraction and dispersion engineering, the light propagation through multi-layer metasurfaces achieves wavelength-selective image recognitions on a silicon photonic platform at telecommunication wavelength. The metasystems implement high-throughput vector-by-matrix multiplications, enabled by near 10(3) nanoscale phase shifters as weight elements within 0.135 mm(2) footprints. The diffraction manifested computing capability incorporates the fabrication and measurement related phase fluctuations, and thus the pre-trained metasystem can handle uncertainties in inputs without post-tuning. Here we demonstrate three functional metasystems: a 15-pixel spatial pattern classifier that reaches near 90% accuracy with femtosecond inputs, a multi-channel wavelength demultiplexer, and a hyperspectral image classifier. The diffractive metasystem provides an alternative machine learning architecture for photonic integrated circuits, with densely integrated phase shifters, spatially multiplexed throughput, and data processing capabilities.
   Metasystem architectures are attractive alternatives to waveguide-based integrated photonic processors due to the subwavelength structures. Here, the authors report a 1D passive silicon photonic metasystem with near 90% spatial pattern classification accuracy at telecommunication wavelength.

AB Detecting objects in aerial images is a challenging task due to the large-scale variations and arbitrary orientations with tiny instances. A new multi-scale transformer-based aerial objects detector called MStrans is proposed in this paper to deal with the challenges in aerial detection. To detect remote instances, MStrans adopts a multi-scale patch embedding transformer (MViT) to extract the global features of the image effectively. Furthermore, to capture the different discriminant features for classification and regression branch tasks, the partial interactive fusion module (PIFM) is designed to enhance the semantic expression of the key features of classification and regression tasks by using the strategy of interactive modeling of adjacent layer features. In addition, considering that the transformer may worsen the local feature details while capturing long-distance feature dependencies, this paper designs a global to local interactive fusion module (GLIFM). It uses the advantage of convolution to extract local features to enrich the detailed information in the transformer. Experiments were carried out on DOTA and DIOR datasets, and the MStrans achieves superior detection performances compared with other approaches.

AB A novel deep multi-agent reinforcement learning framework is proposed to identify and resolve conflicts among a variable number of aircraft in a high-density, stochastic, and dynamic en route sector. The concept of using distributed vehicle autonomy to ensure separation is proposed, instead of a centralized sector air traffic controller. Our proposed framework uses proximal policy optimization that is customized to incorporate an attention network. This allows the agents to have access to variable aircraft information in the sector in a scalable, efficient approach to achieve high traffic throughput under uncertainty. Agents are trained using a centralized learning, decentralized execution scheme where one neural network is learned and shared by all agents. The proposed framework is validated on three case studies in the BlueSky air traffic simulator. Several baselines are introduced, and the numerical results show that the proposed framework significantly reduces offline training time, increases safe separation performance, and results in a more efficient policy.

AB Deep learning has the potential to dramatically impact navigation and tracking state estimation problems critical to autonomous vehicles and robotics. Measurement uncertainties in state estimation systems based on Kalman and other Bayes filters are typically assumed to be a fixed covariance matrix. This assumption is risky, particularly for ``black box'' deep learning models, in which uncertainty can vary dramatically and unexpectedly. Accurate quantification of multivariate uncertainty will allow for the full potential of deep learning to be used more safely and reliably in these applications. We show how to model multivariate uncertainty for regression problems with neural networks, incorporating both aleatoric and epistemic sources of heteroscedastic uncertainty. We train a deep uncertainty covariance matrix model in two ways: directly using a multivariate Gaussian density loss function and indirectly using end-to-end training through a Kalman filter. We experimentally show in a visual tracking problem the large impact that accurate multivariate uncertainty quantification can have on the Kalman filter performance for both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluation data. We additionally show, in a challenging visual odometry problem, how end-to-end filter training can allow uncertainty predictions to compensate for filter weaknesses.

AB Watering ornamental plants is considered to be a time-consuming task with the increasing garden size. Employing robots to conduct the watering task is a feasible way to improve the watering efficiency. However, general path planning models for watering robots are faced with various difficulties, such as the curse of dimensionality caused by the excessively oversized irrigation area and insufficient irrigation due to weather conditions. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes two novel strategies for watering robot optimal path modeling. Firstly, for tackling the curse of dimensionality, a sliding window strategy is proposed. To be specific, the whole watering area is partitioned into many subareas using the sliding window, and each subarea is watered independently. Secondly, to overcome the problem that the soil moisture still can not reach the expectation due to various weather conditions, this paper proposes a placeholder strategy, which enables the watering robot to dynamically adjust the watering path. To test these strategies, a novel genetic algorithm with neighbor exchanging strategy is proposed. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of watering robot path planning models based on the proposed strategies.

ID ROBOT NAVIGATION; SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION
AB The navigation of mobile robots is an important issue in many areas such as industry, autonomous vehicles, and defense. Today, even the most known navigation systems, such as GPS, face natural and artificial problems in various operating environments. Solutions such as simultaneous localization and mapping, visual teach and repeat, and topological localization are suggested as a solution to these situations. In this study, a method is proposed for navigation to keep the bookmarks in the memory of living things and to reach the target using the key points. In this study, it was aimed to make use of the memories of a previously travelled path and then to follow the same path. In the presented method, 2D maps were collected with LIDAR while navigating the target path. Robot control was performed by using the previously prepared 2D map memory for matching and steering angle calculations. It was realized with the simulation that robots could follow the previously travelled path using this method. As a result, with the proposed method, mobile robots can reach the target with a low error rate even in multi-bend systems without error accumulation.

AB Compared with the state-of-the-art architectures, using the 3D point cloud as the input of the 2D convolutional neural network without preprocessing will restrict the feature expression of the network. To address this issue, we propose a high-precision classification network using bearing angle (BA) images, depth images, and RGB images. Due to the development of unmanned vehicles, determining how to recognize objects from the information collected by sensors is important. Our approach takes data from LiDAR and a camera and projects a 3D point cloud into 2D BA images and depth images. The RGB image captured by the camera is used to select the region of interest (ROI) corresponding to the point cloud. However, only adding input information is not enough to improve the classification ability of general convolutional neural networks. In our approach, we use a Dense-Residual Fusion Network (DRF-Net), which consists of Dense-Residual Blocks (DRBs). The Dense-Residual Fusion Network can achieve 97.92% accuracy with three input formats on a KITTI raw dataset.

AB Remote marine sensing systems, such as autonomous underwater vehicles or telemetry tags, can be limited in data collection and deployment duration due to the finite energy of the onboard battery. With these technologies migrating vast distances over long-term deployments, maintaining high data resolution is difficult and often yields nonideal data sets. Furthermore, electronics systems used in telemetry tags are often potted in epoxy, which makes replacing or recharging the battery impractical. The implementation of solar energy harvesting on these technologies could increase the fidelity of collected data and/ or tag longevity. This paper presents an assessmentmodel that estimates the energy output of a stationary or migrating solar cell above or below the ocean's surface. The theory and assumptions behind the model are explained, including a review of established concepts for the purpose of consolidation and variable consistency. The model is then compared to benchmark data for verification. Finally, a preliminary analysis is conducted on the previously collected time, depth, and global location data froma northern elephant seal deployment to demonstrate the resulting model outputs and how they can be used for analysis in future works.

AB Recognizing 3-D objects has a wide range of application areas from autonomous robots to self-driving vehicles. The popularity of low-cost RGB-D sensors has enabled a rapid progress in 3-D object recognition in the recent years. Most of the existing studies use depth data as an additional channel to the RGB channels. Instead of this approach, we propose two volumetric representations to reveal rich 3-D structural information hidden in depth images. We present a 3-D convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object recognition approach, which utilizes these volumetric representations and single and multi-rotational depth images. The 3-D CNN architecture trained to recognize single depth images produces competitive results with the state-of-the-art methods on two publicly available datasets. However, recognition accuracy increases further when the multiple rotations of objects are brought together. Our multirotational 3-DCNNcombines information from multiple views of objects to provide rotational invariance and improves the accuracy significantly comparing with the single-rotational approach. The results show that utilizing multiple views of objects can be highly informative for the 3-D CNN-based object recognition.

AB We present an evaluation of standard image features in the context of long-term visual teach-and-repeat navigation of mobile robots, where the environment exhibits significant changes in appearance caused by seasonal weather variations and daily illumination changes. We argue that for long-term autonomous navigation, the viewpoint-, scale- and rotation- invariance of the standard feature extractors is less important than their robustness to the mid- and long-term environment appearance changes. Therefore, we focus our evaluation on the robustness of image registration to variable lighting and naturally-occurring seasonal changes. We combine detection and description components of different image extractors and evaluate their performance on five datasets collected by mobile vehicles in three different outdoor environments over the course of one year. Moreover, we propose a trainable feature descriptor based on a combination of evolutionary algorithms and Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features, which we call GRIEF (Generated BRIEF). In terms of robustness to seasonal changes, the most promising results were achieved by the SpG/CNN and the STAR/GRIEF feature, which was slightly less robust, but faster to calculate.

AB The structure and intensity of the intermediate wake generated by a submerged propagating body in a stratified fluid was studied using a combination of (i) numerical simulations, (ii) field measurements, and (iii) laboratory experiments. The numerical component offered guidance for the field work performed in Monterey Bay (CA, USA) in the summer of 2015. The field work focused on subsurface thermal signatures of a submerged propagating object. Vertical temperature profiles suggested that long-term changes in thermal stratification can occur after the passage of a towed body. Horizontal temperature variability, measured by an autonomous underwater vehicle facilitated the identification of the wake using perturbation temperature variance as the key diagnostic variable. Analogous thermal signatures of stratified wakes were found in ocean observations and in modelling results. The influence of the tow ship on the wake was shown to be minimal. Laboratory experiments focused on the surface expression of stratified wakes were used to complement numerical simulations and field measurements. All three components of this project indicate that detection of the wake of a submerged object based on its thermal signatures is a viable and effective approach.

AB We present a real-time algorithm which can recover the 3D trajectory of a monocular camera, moving rapidly through a previously unknown scene. Our system, which we dub MonoSLAM, is the first successful application of the SLAM methodology from mobile robotics to the "pure vision" domain of a single uncontrolled camera, achieving real time but drift-free performance inaccessible to Structure from Motion approaches. The core of the approach is the online creation of a sparse but persistent map of natural landmarks within a probabilistic framework. Our key novel contributions include an active approach to mapping and measurement, the use of a general motion model for smooth camera movement, and solutions for monocular feature initialization and feature orientation estimation. Together, these add up to an extremely efficient and robust algorithm which runs at 30 Hz with standard PC and camera hardware. This work extends the range of robotic systems in which SLAM can be usefully applied, but also opens up new areas. We present applications of MonoSLAM to real-time 3D localization and mapping for a high-performance full-size humanoid robot and live augmented reality with a hand-held camera.

AB The present review describes progress in addressing and solving several fundamental and applied problems involving optical oceanography. These problems include: primary productivity, ecosystem dynamics, biogeochemical cycling, upper ocean heating, and the impacts of anthropogenic disturbances on ocean dynamics. Technological advances in optical sensors and ocean observing platforms are being used to increase the variety and quantity of optical observations and to greatly expand their sampling capabilities in time and space. Remote sensing of ocean color from aircraft- and satellite- borne instruments is vital to obtain regional- and global- scale optical data synoptically. In situ observations provide complementary subsurface data sets with high temporal and spatial resolution. In situ observations are also essential for calibration and validation of remotely sensed data as well as for algorithm development and data assimilation models. Important challenges remain to synthesize regional and global optical data sets obtained from optical sensors and oceanographic platforms and to utilize these data sets in predictive models of oceanic optical, physical, and biogeochemical dynamics.

AB The task of object identification is fundamental to the operations of an autonomous vehicle. It can be accomplished by using techniques based on a Multisensor Fusion framework, which allows the integration of data coming from different sensors. In this paper, an approach to the synergic interpretation of data provided by thermal and visual sensors is proposed. Such integration is justified by the necessity for solving the ambiguities that may arise from separate data interpretations.
   The architecture of a distributed Knowledge-Based system is described. It per forms an Intelligent Data Fusion process by integrating, in an opportunistic way, data acquired with a thermal and a video (b/w) camera. Data integration is performed at various architecture levels in order to increase the robustness of the whole recognition process. A priori models allow the system to obtain interesting data from both sensors; to transform such data into intermediate symbolic objects; and, finally, to recognize environmental situations on which to perform further processing. Some results are reported for different environmental conditions (i.e. a road scene by day and by night, with and without the presence of obstacles).

AB Internet-of-Everything (IoE) has gradually been recognized as an integral part of future wireless networks. In IoE, there can be an ultra-massive number of smart devices of various types to be served, imposing multi-dimensional requirements on wireless communication, sensing, and security. In this article, we provide a tutorial overview of the promising intelligent reflection communication (IRC) technologies, including reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and ambient backscatter communication (AmBC), to support the requirements of IoE applications beyond the fifth-generation (5G) wireless communication network. Specifically, we elaborate on the benefits of IRC-assisted IoE in the context of the space-air-ground integrated communications and green communications, which are regarded as key features of supporting future IoE application from society and industries. Furthermore, we envision that the IRC-assisted communication and sensing can mutually benefit each other and articulate multiple ways of enhancing the security in IoE by the IRC. Numerical results help illustrate the importance of the IRC in unfavorable secrecy environments. Finally, open research issues and challenges about the IRC-assisted IoE are presented.

AB In autonomous vehicles, accurate extrinsic calibration for LiDAR and camera is an essential prerequisite for multi-sensor information fusion. Automatic and targetless extrinsic calibration has become the mainstream of academic research in recent years. However, existing automatic calibration methods that rely on edge or semantic features are unrobust, or require specific scene settings. In this paper, instance segmentation is used for automatic extrinsic calibration of the LiDAR and camera for the first time. Key targets from the segmented instances are extracted and correlated. Regarding the extrinsic calibration as an optimization problem, a novel cost function based on the matching degree of the appearance and centroids from the key targets of the point cloud and image pairs is formulated. Subsequently, differential evolution is used to minimize the cost function to obtain the optimal extrinsic parameters. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method. The MAE of rotation and translation is less than 0.3(?) and 0.05 m respectively, which outperforms semantic-based and edge-based approaches in terms of accuracy.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL
AB Approaches to keeping a dynamical system within state constraints typically rely on a model-based safety condition to limit the control signals. In the face of significant modeling uncertainty, the system can suffer from important performance penalties due to the safety condition becoming overly conservative. Machine learning can be employed to reduce the uncertainty around the system dynamics, and allow for higher performance. In this article, we propose the safe uncertainty-learning principle, and argue that the learning must be properly structured to preserve safety guarantees. For instance, robust safety conditions are necessary, and they must be initialized with conservative uncertainty bounds prior to learning. Also, the uncertainty bounds should only be tightened if the collected data sufficiently captures the future system behavior. To support the principle, two example problems are solved with control barrier functions: a lane-change controller for an autonomous vehicle, and an adaptive cruise controller. This work offers a way to evaluate whether machine learning preserves safety guarantees during the control of uncertain dynamical systems. It also highlights challenging aspects of learning for control.

AB We present an underwater localization system for medium-sized Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) that leverages a broadband wireless acoustic communication system for GPS-denied underwater localization. Many current acoustic localization systems assume a single line-of-sight path and use either narrow-band signals or short-duration pings for the convenience of mitigating motion-induced Doppler at the expense of the time-of-arrival (TOA) accuracy and operational flexibility. We propose a novel acoustic localization system that utilizes the aggressive signal processing embedded in underwater acoustic communication systems to resolve multi-path and Doppler distortion and finely estimate timing information using broadband communication signals. Timing and Doppler information extracted from this process is then used to estimate biases and drift from an inertial navigation system (INS) using a Bayesian framework. To demonstrate the feasibility of the system model, co-simulations are created from the MACE10 experimental data. Our results show dramatic improvement in localization accuracy, with an error of less than 120 m achieved over the 3 similar to 7 km distance range from the MACE 10 experiment between an AUV and a remote beacon with an acoustic communication transmission interval of 30 seconds.

AB A novel collision avoidance (CA) algorithm was proposed based on the modified artificial potential field (APF) method, to construct a practical ship automatic CA system. Considering the constraints of both the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS) and the motion characteristics of the ship, the multi-ship CA algorithm was realized by modifying the repulsive force model in the APF method. Furthermore, the distance from the closest point of approach-time to the closest point of approach (DCPA-TCPA) criterion was selected as the unique adjustable parameter from the perspective of navigation practice. Collaborative CA experiments were designed and conducted to validate the proposed algorithm. The results of the experiments revealed that the actual DCPA and TCPA agree well with the parameter setup that keeps the ship at a safe distance from other ships in complex encountering situations. Consequently, the algorithm proposed in this study can achieve efficient automatic CA with minimal parameter settings. Moreover, the navigators can easily accept and comprehend the adjustable parameters, enabling the algorithm to satisfy the demand of the engineering applications.

AB Environmental perception of urban roads is a critical research goal in intelligent transportation technology and autonomous vehicles, and pedestrian location is key to many relevant algorithms. Because anchor-free detectors are faster and region-based convolutional neural networks have a higher accuracy in object detection and classification, we propose an integrated convolutional networking architecture combining an anchor-free detector with a region-based convolutional neural network in the environmental perception task. The proposed network achieves higher precision and increases inference speed by up to 30%. To acquire more accurate region boundaries than a coarse bounding box method, a semantic segmentation sub-network is adopted to predict an instance segmentation mask for each object, and more accurate segmentation results are obtained by using the Dice loss. Moreover, we present an assignment strategy using a modified feature pyramid structure and show that it improves mean average precision of pedestrian detection by 2% on average. Finally, we verify that the pretrained neural network is beneficial for small datasets. Overall, the results show that our model achieves higher precision than the approaches used for comparison.
