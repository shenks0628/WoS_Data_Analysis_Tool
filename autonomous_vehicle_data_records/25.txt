AB In order to improve the positioning accuracy of two leader autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in underwater cooperative navigation formation, a decentralized cooperative localization algorithm based on adaptive cubature Kalman filter (ACKF-DCL) for strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS)/Doppler velocity log (DVL) integrated navigation system is proposed. First, the kinematic equations of the SINS are used to establish the direct filtering approach model for integrated navigation. Second, the Sage-Husa adaptive filtering algorithm and the sequential Kalman filtering (SKF) method are introduced into the nonlinear cubature Kalman filter (CKF) to adjust adaptively the measurement noise and maintain the positivity of the covariance matrix. Finally, the cross-correlation covariance between two AUVs is derived according to the characteristics of a decentralized data structure, so as to track the inter-AUV dependencies. And the acoustic ranging measurement is introduced to achieve relative measurement update. The lake trial demonstrates the proposed algorithm's effectiveness and superiority, and the results show that the algorithm can effectively track the measurement noise covariance matrix and improve the positioning accuracy of both AUVs by position correction.

AB Modern cars are equipped with camera monitor systems (CMSs), such as a backup camera or side-mirror replacement. These systems are expected to perform optimally and achieve high safety levels (ASIL). Currently, only digital data are supervised in CMSs and safety mechanisms for such systems are individually derived on a case-by-case basis which is not effective. This study proposes generic optical supervision for displays of automotive CMS. This paper introduces "light-to-light" (camera to display output) protection for both in-car CMS and remote operator monitors used in autonomous car fleet operation centers. The first method is based on photodiodes attached to the display to optically supervise, for instance, the speedometer of vehicles. By combining intensities of photodiodes with calibration data, we can compare the measured speed with the value from CAN (Controller Area Network) data. The second method that entails capturing the display content using a camera enables top safety levels for both in-car displays and remote operator monitors. This safeguarding was successfully verified by conventional image processing and artificial intelligence (AI)-based analysis methods. Our results demonstrate that AI methods allow a substantial reduction in the wireless transmission bandwidth from a car to a remote operator compared with conventional image processing.

AB Based on the seafloor reflection coefficient obtained from autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) sub-bottom profile survey data of the northern slope of the South China Sea, combined with the sample test data of seafloor surface sediments, we use the Biot-Stoll model to establish the equations relating the seafloor reflection coefficient to the porosity, density, and mean grain size of the sediments at the dominant frequency of 5 kHz (the dominant frequency of the AUV sub-bottom profiler). The physical property parameters such as the porosity, density, and mean grain size of seafloor surface sediments are further inverted. Comparison of inversion results with measured results shows that the overall deviation ratios of the inverted mean grain size, porosity, and density of the surface sediments are in the ranges of -13.56 to 14.44%, -6.15 to 8.06%, and -10.85 to 0.46%, respectively. Among them, the mean grain size directly reflects the size of seafloor sediment particles, and the particles are finer in deeper water. Overall, the inversion results are basically consistent with the measured values and thus can well reflect the variation characteristics of the physical properties of seafloor surface sediments.

AB The autonomous underwater vehicle(AUV)-aided localization techniques for underwater acoustic devices show promising applications in many scenarios, and most researches in this area are based on the time of arrival (ToA) or the time difference of arrival (TDoA) measurements. However, these measurements are not readily available. To develop a more universally applicable scheme, we investigate the possibility of employing the Doppler shift measurements for underwater localization of acoustic devices in this paper. To be specific, we employ a low-complexity algorithm for Doppler estimation, and prove that the estimation error can be well approximated by zero-mean Gaussian distribution. Based on the Doppler estimates, we can obtain a series of nonlinear equations. To solve them, we propose a two-phase linear algorithm to obtain high-accuracy position information of the target devices. Compared with the conventional iterative algorithms, the proposed one does not require initial estimate. Both the closed-form localization error and the Cram & x00E9;r-Rao lower bound are presented. They prove to be consistent for reasonably small Doppler estimation error. Besides, we conduct simulations to verify the theoretical analysis. Moreover, the complexity of the proposed algorithm only grows linearly with the number of Doppler shift measurements.

AB Group activity recognition has received a great deal of interest because of its broader applications in sports analysis, autonomous vehicles, CCTV surveillance systems and video summarization systems. Most existing methods typically use appearance features and they seldom consider underlying interaction information. In this work, a technology of novel group activity recognition is proposed based on multi-modal relation representation with temporal-spatial attention. First, we introduce an object relation module, which processes all objects in a scene simultaneously through an interaction between their appearance feature and geometry, thus allowing the modeling of their relations. Second, to extract effective motion features, an optical flow network is fine-tuned by using the action loss as the supervised signal. Then, we propose two types of inference models, opt-GRU and relation-GRU, which are used to encode the object relationship and motion representation effectively, and form the discriminative frame-level feature representation. Finally, an attention-based temporal aggregation layer is proposed to integrate frame-level features with different weights and form effective video-level representations. We have performed extensive experiments on two popular datasets, and both have achieved state-of-the-art performance. The datasets are the Volleyball dataset and the Collective Activity dataset, respectively.

AB Swarm intelligence (SI) is concerned with the collective behaviour that emerges from decentralised self-organising systems, whilst swarm robotics (SR) is an approach to the self-coordination of large numbers of simple robots which emerged as the application of SI to multi-robot systems. Given the increasing severity and frequency of occurrence of wildfires and the hazardous nature of fighting their propagation, the use of disposable inexpensive robots in place of humans is of special interest. This paper demonstrates the feasibility and potential of employing SR to fight fires autonomously, with a focus on the self-coordination mechanisms for the desired firefighting behaviour to emerge. Thus, an efficient physics-based model of fire propagation and a self-organisation algorithm for swarms of firefighting drones are developed and coupled, with the collaborative behaviour based on a particle swarm algorithm adapted to individuals operating within physical dynamic environments of high severity and frequency of change. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed self-organising system is effective, scalable and fault-tolerant, comprising a promising approach to dealing with the suppression of wildfires - one of the world's most pressing challenges of our time.

AB In this paper, we consider a robotic automated storage and retrieval system (AS/RS) where a Cartesian robot picks and palletises items onto a mixed pallet for any order. This robotic AS/RS not only retrieves orders in an optimal sequence, but also creates an optimal store ready pallet of any order. Adapting the Travelling Salesman Problem to warehousing, the decision to be made includes finding the optimal sequence of orders, and optimal sequence of items inside each order, that jointly minimise total travel times. In the first phase, as a control problem, we develop an avoidance strategy for the robot (or automatic stacker crane) movement sequence. This approach detects the collision occurrence causing unsafe handling of hazardous items and prevents the occurrence of it by a collision-free robot movement sequence. Due to the complexity of the problem, the second phase is attacked by a Cross-Entropy (CE) method. To evaluate the performance of the CE method, a computational analysis is performed over various test problems. The results obtained from the CE method are compared to those of the optimal solutions obtained using CPLEX. The results indicate high performance of the solution procedure to solve the sequencing problem of robotic AS/RSs.

AB Shield synthesis is an approach to enforce safety properties at runtime. A shield monitors the system and corrects any erroneous output values instantaneously. The shield deviates from the given outputs as little as it can and recovers to hand back control to the system as soon as possible. In the first part of this paper, we consider shield synthesis for reactive hardware systems. First, we define a general framework for solving the shield synthesis problem. Second, we discuss two concrete shield synthesis methods that automatically construct shields from a set of safety properties: (1) k-stabilizing shields, which guarantee recovery in a finite time. (2) Admissible shields, which attempt to work with the system to recover as soon as possible. Next, we discuss an extension of k-stabilizing and admissible shields, where erroneous output values of the reactive system are corrected while liveness properties of the system are preserved. Finally, we give experimental results for both synthesis methods. In the second part of the paper, we consider shielding a human operator instead of shielding a reactive system: the outputs to be corrected are not initiated by a system but by a human operator who works with an autonomous system. The challenge here lies in giving simple and intuitive explanations to the human for any interferences of the shield. We present results involving mission planning for unmanned aerial vehicles.

AB The prototypes of unmanned merchant vessels are expected to come into service within the coming years. The main line of argument supporting their introduction pertains to the increase in navigational safety, which is expected to be achieved by reducing the frequency of human-related accidents on board ships, by removing the crews. On the other hand, the response of unmanned ship to potential accidents is still uncertain. With enthusiasm on one side and apprehension on the other, the literature lacks an objective study on the effect of unmanned ships on safety of maritime transportation.
   This paper constitutes an attempt to bridge the aforementioned gap by applying a framework based on what if analysis to a hundred maritime accident reports. The aim of the analysis is to assess whether the accident would have happened if the ship had been unmanned, and once the accident had happened - would its consequences have been different.
   The results obtained reveal that the occurrence of navigational accidents (e.g. collision, grounding) can be expected to decrease with the development of unmanned ship. However the extent of consequences resulting particularly from non-navigational accidents (e.g. fire, ship loss due to structural failure) can be expected to be much larger for the unmanned ships when compared to the conventional ones.

AB The role of sensors such as cameras or LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is crucial for the environmental awareness of self-driving cars. However, the data collected from these sensors are subject to distortions in extreme weather conditions such as fog, rain, and snow. This issue could lead to many safety problems while operating a self-driving vehicle. The purpose of this study is to analyze the effects of fog on the detection of objects in driving scenes and then to propose methods for improvement. Collecting and processing data in adverse weather conditions is often more difficult than data in good weather conditions. Hence, a synthetic dataset that can simulate bad weather conditions is a good choice to validate a method, as it is simpler and more economical, before working with a real dataset. In this paper, we apply fog synthesis on the public KITTI dataset to generate the Multifog KITTI dataset for both images and point clouds. In terms of processing tasks, we test our previous 3D object detector based on LiDAR and camera, named the Spare LiDAR Stereo Fusion Network (SLS-Fusion), to see how it is affected by foggy weather conditions. We propose to train using both the original dataset and the augmented dataset to improve performance in foggy weather conditions while keeping good performance under normal conditions. We conducted experiments on the KITTI and the proposed Multifog KITTI datasets which show that, before any improvement, performance is reduced by 42.67% in 3D object detection for Moderate objects in foggy weather conditions. By using a specific strategy of training, the results significantly improved by 26.72% and keep performing quite well on the original dataset with a drop only of 8.23%. In summary, fog often causes the failure of 3D detection on driving scenes. By additional training with the augmented dataset, we significantly improve the performance of the proposed 3D object detection algorithm for self-driving cars in foggy weather conditions.</p>

AB Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have found increasing utility in designing safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) such as implantable medical devices, autonomous vehicles, and space robotics due to their capability to operate on information represented in temporal coding and exhibit various behavioural modalities. Thus, there has been recent interest in formally verifying their timing behaviours and providing soundness guarantees of their diverse characteristics. However, beyond the simplistic Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) model, which only mimics 3 spiking behaviours, there is a lack of unifying methodology in literature to verify complex dynamics of biological neurons exhibiting 20 spiking behaviours as demonstrated by the pioneering work of Izhikevich. There is also a complete lack of formulation for the verification of SNN-based systems. This paper bridges these gaps by proposing a model-based approach for designing SNN-based controllers in CPS. We propose sound structural transformations translating any spiking neuron into networks of Timed Automata (TA), model the complex Izhikevich neural model and formally verify all 20 timing behaviours it exhibits for the first time. We then present two case studies that were modelled as SNNs using our approach: the PID controller, and the Car-Following controller, and subsequently attempt static model checking and statistical verification of their generated TA models for safety guarantees.

AB This paper proposes a statistical-based channel modelling approach for a drone assisted multi-user coded cooperation (DA-MUCC) for evaluating the performance metrics of a next-generation wireless communication system. The proposed approach may find its applications in smart cities, disaster management and agriculture for building reliable communication links among ground users (GUs)/user equipments (UEs) over the scenarios where an infrastructure-based network (like a Base Station (BS)) is difficult to establish or disrupted. In such scenarios, an air-to-ground (A2G) channel is modelled based on the probabilistic approach of line-of-sight (LoS) and statistical independence of the links. The network performance of the proposed system model is evaluated by closed-form average outage probability and average rate over the Rayleigh and Rician fading channel models. The analytical performance is corroborated by Monte-Carlo simulations and also compared with the existing state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, we derive the probability density function (PDF) for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of relay link which is useful under the scenarios where the direct links among GUs are in the deep fade.

AB Motion primitives allow for application of discrete search algorithms to rapidly produce trajectories in complex continuous space. The maneuver automaton (MA) provides an elegant formulation for creating a primitive library based on trims and maneuvers. However, performance is fundamentally limited by the contents of the primitive library. If the library is too sparse, performance can be poor in terms of path cost, whereas a library that is too large can increase run time. This work outlines new methods for using genetic algorithms to prune a primitive library. The proposed methods balance the path cost and planning time while maintaining the reachability of the MA. The genetic algorithm in this paper evaluates and mutates populations of motion primitive libraries to optimize both objectives. We illustrate the performance of these methods with a simulated study using a nonlinear medium-fidelity F-16 model. We optimize a library with the presented algorithm for obstacle-free navigation and a nap-of-the-Earth navigation task. In the obstacle-free navigation task, we show a tradeoff of a 10.16% higher planning cost for a 96.63% improvement in run time. In the nap-of-the-Earth task, we show a tradeoff of a 9.712% higher planning cost for a 92.06% improvement in run time.

AB With the expansion and deepening of ocean research, cooperative localization technology of multi-AUVs is being explored more and more. However, the underwater cooperative localization based on Angle of Arrival (AOA) as well as cooperative localization formation are still relatively less explored research areas. Moreover, the coop-erative localization formation has significant impact on the localization accuracy of cooperative localization system. In this paper, firstly, a novel optimization model of multi-target AUVs for 3D cooperative localization formation based on AOA measurement is formulated. Secondly, AOA-based evaluation functions of single and multiple targets are derived for underwater 3D cooperative localization system using the D-optimality criterion. Finally, considering the practical constraints of the underwater environment and the computational complexity of the multi-target system, a Sparrow Search Algorithm based on Simulated Annealing (SA-SSA) is proposed to obtain the optimal formation of the cooperative localization system. The algorithm ensured that the global optimal solution for the cooperative localization system is independent of the initial positions of the leader AUVs. Various simulation examples verify the effectiveness of the results and algorithms. Comparison of proposed al-gorithm with the traditional iterative algorithm proves that the positioning accuracy and system stability are effectively improved under proposed SA-SSA algorithm.

ID MULTITARGET TRACKING
AB A robust MOT (multi-object tracking) is very crucial for computer vision applications such as crowd density estimation and autonomous vehicles. Most of the existing mot approaches perform object tracking in a two task manner such as motion estimation and Re-identification but these approaches pose some drawbacks like the model is not end-to-end trained, the Re-Id required lots of identity switches thus incurred computational overhead and the performance further degrades in complex crowd scenarios. To overcome such drawbacks we are motivated to design an end-to-end trained DNN for MOT. The proposed model utilizes a matching technique that utilizes the relative scale between the boundary boxes and relative position calculates the relative distance between the objects for MOT. To solve the problems, we proposed a matching technique that poses two subtasks to efficiently scale up a single shot DNN tracking approach for an indefinite number of objects in the video frames. The proposed method uses a relative scale and relative position to matching between the detected and targeted objects. The achieved state-of-the-art results of the tasks allow to obtain high accuracy of tracking with detection and surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods by a huge margin on various public datasets.

AB Inevitably, the rapid growth of the electronics industry and the wide availability of tailored programming tools and support are accelerating the digital transformation of the agricultural sector. The latter transformation seems to foster the hopes for tackling the depletion and degradation of natural resources and increasing productivity in order to cover the needs of Earth's continuously growing population. Consequently, people getting involved with modern agriculture, from farmers to students, should become familiar with and be able to use and improve the innovative systems making the scene. At this point, the contribution of the STEM educational practices in demystifying new areas, especially in primary and secondary education, is remarkable and thus welcome, but things become quite uncertain when trying to discover efficient practices for higher education, and students of agricultural engineering are not an exception. Indeed, university students are not all newcomers to STEM and ask for real-world experiences that better prepare them for their professional careers. Trying to bridge the gap, this work highlights good practices during the various implementation stages of electric robotic ground vehicles that can serve realistic agricultural tasks. Several innovative parts, such as credit card-sized systems, AI-capable modules, smartphones, GPS, solar panels, and network transceivers are properly combined with electromechanical components and recycled materials to deliver technically and educationally meaningful results.

AB Searching within an unknown environment quickly by utilising a small number of high-capacity robots or a large number of low-cost robots poses an endless question with a non-trivial answer. If the robot's operating environment is underwater, the problem becomes even more complicated due to its three-dimensional nature and the communication restrictions. In this paper, we propose an algorithm appropriate for target searching in unknown underwater environments. The proposed method considers a homogeneous decentralised multi-robot coordination scheme applied from a single-robot configuration to a large swarm. In this model, simple agents (SA) form smart swarms (SS), despite SA do not need to have a strong ability to transmit search and location information, and the SS can efficiently perform search tasks in unknown environments. Specifically, when a swarm performs a search task, agents only search according to the simple strategy and share mapping information within their communication range, enhancing search efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and that search time reduces proportionally by increasing the number of robots comprising the swarm, while the repetition search rate does not increase with the expansion of the swarm size. We believe that our SS architecture provides insights into the future application of swarm intelligence.

AB In this paper, we investigate how data about public preferences may be used to inform policy around the use of controversial novel technologies, using public preferences about autonomous vehicles (AVs) as a case study. We first summarize the recent 'Moral Machine' study, which generated preference data from millions of people regarding how they think AVs should respond to emergency situations. We argue that while such preferences cannot be used to directly inform policy, they should not be disregarded. We defend an approach that we call 'Collective Reflective Equilibrium in Practice' (CREP). In CREP, data on public attitudes function as an input into a deliberative process that looks for coherence between attitudes, behaviours and competing ethical principles. We argue that in cases of reasonable moral disagreement, data on public attitudes should play a much greater role in shaping policies than in areas of ethical consensus. We apply CREP to some of the global preferences about AVs uncovered by the Moral Machines study. We intend this discussion both as a substantive contribution to the debate about the programming of ethical AVs, and as an illustration of how CREP works. We argue that CREP provides a principled way of using some public preferences as an input for policy, while justifiably disregarding others.

AB Given their outstanding performance, the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) models have been deployed in many real-world applications. However, recent studies have demonstrated that they are vulnerable to small carefully crafted perturbations, <italic>i.e.</italic>, adversarial examples, which considerably decrease their performance and can lead to devastating consequences, especially for safety-critical applications, such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare and face recognition. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to offer defense solutions that increase the robustness of DNNs against adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel defense solution based on a Deep Denoising Sparse Autoencoder (DDSA). The proposed method is performed as a pre-processing step, where the adversarial noise of the input samples is removed before feeding the classifier. The pre-processing defense block can be associated with any classifier, without any change to their architecture or training procedure. In addition, the proposed method is a universal defense, since it does not require any knowledge about the attack, making it usable against any type of attack. The experimental results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets have shown that the proposed DDSA defense provides a high robustness against a set of prominent attacks under white-, gray- and black-box settings, and outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods.

TI Near-seafloor magnetic signatures unveil serpentinization dynamics at

SO GEOLOGY

DT Article
ID MID-ATLANTIC RIDGE; FIELD; REVEAL
AB A near-seafloor magnetic and bathymetric survey conducted by the autonomous underwater vehicle AutoSub 6000 over intermediate-temperature, ultramafic-hosted Von Damm Vent Field (Mid-Cayman spreading center, Caribbean Sea) revealed a moderate positive magnetic anomaly, in accordance with the magnetic response of other known ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal vent fields. However, compared with low-temperature ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal activity, the magnetic signature of this intermediate-temperature site indicates a slightly stronger magnetization contrast between the hydrothermal system and its host, but it remains considerably weaker than at high-temperature ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal vent fields. This observation highlights the nonlinear increase of magnetization production with temperature, as iron partitions into weakly magnetic brucite under 200 degrees C, but magnetite dominates above this temperature, leading to a sudden increase in the magnetic signature of a site. Our study is consistent with recent laboratory experiments and unveils the dynamics of the serpentinization reaction, enabling fine tuning of the magnetic technique for remotely locating hydrothermal systems. In addition to refining our understanding of the magnetic behavior of hydrothermal vent fields, these new results also reveal the orientation of the fluid pathway feeding the hydrothermal site and indicate the nonvertical structure of the complex network of fissures within the host rock and its associated tectonic feature-an oceanic core complex.

AB In this paper, we present a novel cooperative navigation control for human-robot teams. Assuming that a humanwants to reach a final location in a large environment with the help of a mobile robot, the robot must steer the human from the initial to the target position. The challenges posed by cooperative human-robot navigation are typically addressed by using haptic feedback via physical interaction. In contrast with that, in this paper, we describe a different approach, in which the human-robot interaction is achieved via wearable vibrotactile armbands. In the proposed work, the subject is free to decide her/his own pace. A warning vibrational signal is generated by the haptic armbands when a large deviation with respect to the desired pose is detected by the robot. The proposed method has been evaluated in a large indoor environment, where 15 blindfolded human subjects were asked to follow the haptic cues provided by the robot. The participants had to reach a target area, while avoiding static and dynamic obstacles. Experimental results revealed that the blindfolded subjects were able to avoid the obstacles and safely reach the target in all of the performed trials. A comparison is provided between the results obtained with blindfolded users and experiments performed with sighted people.

AB Fine scale mapping of the structure and composition of a tidal ebb plume from a highly modified coastal lagoon (Elkhorn Slough, California, USA) was conducted by combining in situ, observational data sets from surface underway mapping, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) profiles, drifter tracking and the analysis of plume structure indices. The results reveal a 6-m-deep, jet-like, sediment laden plume extending one km offshore at low tide, which becomes entrained in the prevailing nearshore circulation. The plume that exits the slough is significantly different from the water that enters the slough. The rapidly evolving discharge plume is associated with elevated and highly correlated (r = 0.93) concentrations of dissolved organic matter and nitrate. While dissolved constituents remain in the shallow plume and are transported northward with the prevailing current, sediment may settle quickly through the water column and can be transported southwestward with the littoral currents. This study illustrates the applications of AUVs, when coupled with additional datasets, for generating higher resolution observational snapshots of dynamic and ephemeral tidal plumes. The results provide unique perspective on small-scale dynamics of an estuarine plume and its influence on coastal ecology. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a novel approach for the classification of planar surfaces in an unorganized point clouds. A feature-based planner surface detection method is proposed which classifies a point cloud data into planar and non-planar points by learning a classification model from an example set of planes. The algorithm performs segmentation of the scene by applying a graph partitioning approach with improved representation of association among graph nodes. The planarity estimation of the points in a scene segment is then achieved by classifying input points as planar points which satisfy planarity constraint imposed by the learned model. The resultant planes have potential application in solving simultaneous localization and mapping problem for navigation of an unmanned-air vehicle. The proposed method is validated on real and synthetic scenes. The real data consist of five datasets recorded by capturing three-dimensional(3D) point clouds when a RGBD camera is moved in five different indoor scenes. A set of synthetic 3D scenes are constructed containing planar and non-planar structures. The synthetic data are contaminated with Gaussian and random structure noise. The results of the empirical evaluation on both the real and the simulated data suggest that the method provides a generalized solution for plane detection even in the presence of the noise and non-planar objects in the scene. Furthermore, a comparative study has been performed between multiple plane extraction methods.

AB The extraction of accurate self-motion information from the visual world is a difficult problem that has been solved very efficiently by biological organisms utilizing non-linear processing. Previous bio-inspired models for motion detection based on a correlation mechanism have been dogged by issues that arise from their sensitivity to undesired properties of the image, such as contrast, which vary widely between images. Here we present a model with multiple levels of non-linear dynamic adaptive components based directly on the known or suspected responses of neurons within the visual motion pathway of the fly brain. By testing the model under realistic high-dynamic range conditions we show that the addition of these elements makes the motion detection model robust across a large variety of images, velocities and accelerations. Furthermore the performance of the entire system is more than the incremental improvements offered by the individual components, indicating beneficial non-linear interactions between processing stages. The algorithms underlying the model can be implemented in either digital or analog hardware, including neuromorphic analog VLSI, but defy an analytical solution due to their dynamic non-linear operation. The successful application of this algorithm has applications in the development of miniature autonomous systems in defense and civilian roles, including robotics, miniature unmanned aerial vehicles and collision avoidance sensors.

AB Exchanging status information between closely located mobile agents is an underlying process in numerous future Cyber Physical System (CPS). Real-time updates including positions of neighboring nodes is performed when, for example, autonomous vehicles execute a cooperative maneuver, industrial robots collaborate with each other on a task, or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) execute a mission in a swarm. For the design of networked automatic control strategies in these scenarios, it is essential to understand the performance of such Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications from the information freshness perspective. To this end, we introduce a mathematical framework which allows characterizing the Age of Information (AoI) in networks governed by the Carrier-Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) protocol. Differently from existing work, we take into account the fact that update packets sent by mobile nodes are not necessarily periodic, since packet triggering is often coupled with agents' mobility. Our approach is based on the assumption that diverse mobility-triggered message generation patterns can be modeled by a wide class of update traffic arrival processes. We apply Discrete Markovian Arrival Process (DMAP), which is a versatile arrival model able to fit arrival patterns that are modulated by a finite state machine, including bursty traffic. We develop an accurate and efficient analytical model of nodes exchanging one-hop broadcast update messages with bursty arrivals to evaluate the moments as well as entire probability distribution of several performance metrics, including AoI. An asymptotic analysis for large networks suggests a simple way to control the update message rate to minimize the AoI. We show that the optimal update rate that minimizes the mean AoI coincides with the optimum of the wireless channel utilization. Numerical examples point out that the asymptotic theory provides accurate predictions also for small values of the number of nodes.

AB Space research is of great significance to increasingly decentralized and distributed space systems, and path planning in space systems has become a research hotspot for maintaining their safety, security, and reliability. To explore the passable path connecting the starting point and the target point, and optimize a smooth trajectory that can be tracked by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in 3-D space, a skeleton-extraction- and greedy-algorithm-based path planning has been proposed to guide the flight of UAVs. First, the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) has been introduced for path search. To speed up the path search process, the spatial skeleton extraction method has been introduced to calculate the skeleton of free space The greedy algorithm has been utilized to increase the RRT expansion and reduce unnecessary bends in the path. The skeleton extraction and greedy-algorithm-based Lazy RRT and RRT-Connect have been proposed to build compared experiments. Second, the minimum snap has been applied to generate a smooth flight trajectory, and the flight time is allocated according to the distance between the waypoints. Third, the UAV Simulink model has been established, and the spatial position of the optimized trajectory is tracked. The experimental results prove that the skeleton extraction can significantly speed up the search process, and greedy algorithm can shorten the path length effectively. The minimum snap combined with the time allocation strategy can produce a smooth and feasible path. The UAV Simulink model also proves that the classic proportion-differentiation controller can accurately track the generated trajectory. The greedy algorithm and skeleton extraction reduce the average path length of RRT by 9.780 and 8.251%, respectively. The greedy algorithm and skeleton extraction reduce the average path length of RRT, Lazy RRT, and RRT-Connect by about 10-13%. The greedy algorithm and skeleton extraction reduce the time consumption of RRT by 62.781 and 36.276%, respectively.

AB This paper proposes a multiple-lens receiver scheme to increase the misalignment tolerance of an underwater optical wireless communications link between an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and a sensor plane. An accurate model of photon propagation based on the Monte Carlo simulation is presented which accounts for the lens(es) photon refraction at the sensor interface and angular misalignment between the emitter and receiver. The results show that the ideal divergence of the beam of the emitter is around 15 degrees for a 1 m transmission length, increasing to 22 degrees for a shorter distance of 0.5 m but being independent of the water turbidity. In addition, it is concluded that a seven-lense scheme is approximately three times more tolerant to offset than a single lens. A random forest machine learning algorithm is also assessed for its suitability to estimate the offset and angle of the AUV in relation to the fixed sensor, based on the power distribution of each lens, in real time. The algorithm is able to estimate the offset and angular misalignment with a mean square error of 5 mm (6 mm) and 0.157 rad (0.174 rad) for a distance between the transmitter and receiver of 1 m and 0.5 m, respectively.

AB To improve the anti-disturbance stability of the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) under bounded disturbances in amplitude, we develop a robust controller based on the estimated signals generated by the filter. The AUV studied has the characteristics of time-varying delay, under-actuated, and switched linear parameter varying (LPV) dynamics. Both the filter and the control strategies, we proposed are based on the robust L(1 )performance criterion, which is suitable for the amplitude bounded disturbances in the ocean environment. In the filter and controller design, the corresponding Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is established to verify the stability of the systems. As there exist couplings between the designed functional and the system parameter matrices, slack matrices are constructed for decouplings after validating the stability of the under actuated AUV filtering error system and closed-loop control system. The filter and the controller are obtained in the form of parameter linear matrix inequalities (PLMIs), whose solution is infinite-dimensional matrix inequalities. The approximate basis function and gridding technique are applied to transform the filter and the controller into that of finite dimensional LMIs. The simulation has verified the effectiveness of the robust L(1 )filter and anti-disturbance depth robust L-1 controller.

AB Improving safety is of general interest in aviation. Flight transponders used in collision avoidance systems advise pilots with information of potential collisions and avoidance resolutions. Some transponders are capable of transmitting the instantaneous position of the vehicle which might be turned off. To prevent autonomous flights from collisions, the transponder signals shall be used to estimate the direction-of-arrival (DoA). Recently, multimode antennas have been investigated for communication and localization purposes. Multimode antennas provide several orthogonal ports on a single radiator surface. This leads to a reduction of space and weight, which is of interest in airborne applications. To perform DoA estimation as well as communication, a suitable channel model is required. In this contribution, a channel model fulfilling the requirements for both multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication and DoA estimation is proposed. This channel model relies on the manifold matrix representation of the UAV under consideration. The derived description of a manifold matrix for the UAV use-case is used for an optimization to achieve a close to omnidirectional radiation pattern. Therefore, different optimization functions are derived and their performance is compared. The results of the optimization using the calculated manifold matrix are verified by measurements taken in an antenna measurement chamber.

AB Apart from constituting a topic of high relevance for transport planners and policymakers, support technologies for traffic have the potential to bring significant benefits to mobility. In addition, there are groups of "high potential" users, such as young adults, who constitute an essential part of the current market. Notwithstanding, and especially in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), their knowledge and acceptance remain understudied. This study aimed to assess the appraisal of intelligent transport systems (ITS) and other technological developments applicable to mobility among Dominican young adults. Methods: In this study, we used the data gathered from 1414 Dominicans aged between 18 and 40, responding to the National Survey on Mobility in 2018 and 2019. Results: Overall, and although there is a relatively high acceptance, attributed value, and attitudinal predisposition towards both intelligent transportation systems and various support technologies applicable to mobility, the actual usage rates remain considerably low, and this is probably exacerbated by the low and middle-income status of the country. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest the need to strengthen information and communication flows over emerging mobility-related technologies and develop further awareness of the potential benefits of technological developments for everyday transport dynamics.

AB Traffic sign detection (TSD) is a key issue for smart vehicles. Traffic sign recognition (TSR) contributes beneficial information, including directions and alerts for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (CITS). Traffic signs are tough to detect in practical autonomous driving scenes using an extremely accurate real-time approach. Object detection methods such as Yolo V4 and Yolo V4-tiny consolidated with Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) are analyzed in this paper. This work evaluates the importance of the SPP principle in boosting the performance of Yolo V4 and Yolo V4-tiny backbone networks in extracting features and learning object features more effectively. Both models are measured and compared with crucial measurement parameters, including mean average precision (mAP), working area size, detection time, and billion floating-point number (BFLOPS). Experiments show that Yolo V4_1 (with SPP) outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes, achieving 99.4% accuracy in our experiments, along with the best total BFLOPS (127.26) and mAP (99.32%). In contrast with earlier studies, the Yolo V3 SPP training process only receives 98.99% accuracy for mAP with IoU 90.09. The training mAP rises by 0.44% with Yolo V4_1 (mAP 99.32%) in our experiment. Further, SPP can enhance the achievement of all models in the experiment.

DT Article
DE Deep learning for visual perception; data sets for robot learning
AB Autonomous vehicles operate in highly dynamic environments necessitating an accurate assessment of which aspects of a scene are moving and where they are moving to. A popular approach to 3D motion estimation, termed scene flow, is to employ 3D point cloud data from consecutive LiDAR scans, although such approaches have been limited by the small size of real-world, annotated LiDAR data. In this work, we introduce a new largescale dataset for scene flow estimation derived from corresponding tracked 3D objects, which is similar to 1, 000x larger than previous real-world datasets in terms of the number of annotated frames. We demonstrate how previous works were bounded by the amount of real LiDAR data available, suggesting that larger datasets are required to achieve state-of-the-art predictive performance. Furthermore, we show how previous heuristics such as down-sampling heavily degrade performance, motivating a new class of models that are tractable on the full point cloud. To address this issue, we introduce the FastFlow3D architecture which provides real time inference on the full point cloud. Additionally, we design human-interpretablemetrics that better capture realworld aspects by accounting for ego-motion and providing breakdowns per object type. We hope that this dataset may provide new opportunities for developing real world scene flow systems.

AB Rapid technological advances in artificial intelligence are creating opportunities for real-time algorithmic modulations of a person's facial and vocal expressions, or 'deep-fakes'. These developments raise unprecedented societal and ethical questions which, despite much recent public awareness, are still poorly understood from the point of view of moral psychology. We report here on an experimental ethics study conducted on a sample of N = 303 participants (predominantly young, western and educated), who evaluated the acceptability of vignettes describing potential applications of expressive voice transformation technology. We found that vocal deep-fakes were generally well accepted in the population, notably in a therapeutic context and for emotions judged otherwise difficult to control, and surprisingly, even if the user lies to their interlocutors about using them. Unlike other emerging technologies like autonomous vehicles, there was no evidence of social dilemma in which one would, for example, accept for others what they resent for themselves. The only real obstacle to the massive deployment of vocal deep-fakes appears to be situations where they are applied to a speaker without their knowing, but even the acceptability of such situations was modulated by individual differences in moral values and attitude towards science fiction. This article is part of the theme issue 'Voice modulation: from origin and mechanism to social impact (Part II)'.

AB When it comes to complex machine learning models, commonly referred to as black boxes, understanding the underlying decision making process is crucial for domains such as healthcare and financial services, as well as when they are used in connection with safety critical systems such as autonomous vehicles. As a result, interest in explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) tools and techniques has increased in recent years. However, the user experience (UX) effectiveness of existing xAI frameworks, especially concerning algorithms that work with data as opposed to images, is still an open research question. In order to address this gap, we examine the UX effectiveness of the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) xAI framework, one of the most popular model agnostic frameworks found in the literature, with a specific focus on its performance in terms of making tabular models more interpretable. In particular, we apply several state of the art machine learning algorithms on a tabular dataset, and demonstrate how LIME can be used to supplement conventional performance assessment methods. Based on this experience, we evaluate the understandability of the output produced by LIME both via a usability study, involving participants who are not familiar with LIME, and its overall usability via a custom made assessment framework, called Model Usability Evaluation (MUsE), which is derived from the International Organisation for Standardisation 9241-11:2018 standard.

AB With the advancement of self-driving technology, the commercialization of robot taxi (Robo-taxi) services is expected. However, there is some skepticism as to whether such taxi services will be successfully accepted by real customers because of perceived safety-related concerns; therefore, studies focused on user experience have become more crucial. Although many studies statistically analyze user experience data obtained by surveying individuals' perceptions of Robo-taxis or indirectly through simulators, there is a lack of research that statistically analyzes data obtained directly from actual Robo-taxi service experiences. Accordingly, based on the user experience data obtained by implementing a Robo-taxi service in the downtown of Seoul and Daejeon in South Korea, this study quantitatively analyzes the effect of user experience on user acceptance through structural equation modeling and path analysis. Balanced and highly valid insights were also obtained by re-analyzing meaningful relationships obtained through statistical models based on the results of in-depth interviews. The results revealed that the experience of the traveling stage had the greatest effect on user acceptance, and the cutting-edge nature of the service and apprehension of technology were emotions that had a significant effect on user acceptance. Based on these findings, guidelines are suggested for the design and marketing of future Robo-taxi services.

AB The ability to detect and monitor any escape of carbon dioxide (CO2) from sub-seafloor CO2 storage reservoirs is essential for public acceptance of carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a climate change mitigation strategy. Here, we use repeated high-resolution seismic reflection surveys acquired using a chirp profiler mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), to image CO2 gas released into shallow sub-surface sediments above a potential CCS storage site at 120 m water depth in the North Sea. Observations of temporal changes in seismic reflectivity, attenuation, unit thickness and the bulk permeability of sediment were used to develop a four-stage model of the evolution of gas migration in shallow marine sediments: Proto-migration, Immature Migration, Mature Migration, and Pathway Closure. Bubble flow was initially enabled through the propagation of stable fractures but, over time, transitioned to dynamic fractures with an associated step change in permeability. Once the gas injection rate exceeded the rate at which gas could escape the coarser sediments overlying the injection point, gas began to pool along a grain size boundary. This enhanced understanding of the migration of free gas in near-surface sediments will help improve methods of detection and quantification of gas in subsurface marine sediments.

AB "Smart cities" is a hot topic in debates about urban policy and practice across the globe. There is, however, limited knowledge and understanding about trending smart city concepts and technologies; relationships between popular smart city concepts and technologies; policies that influence the perception and utilization of smart city concepts and technologies. The aim of this study is to evaluate how smart city concepts and technologies are perceived and utilized in cities. The methodology involves a social media analysis approach-i.e., systematic geo-Twitter analysis-that contains descriptive, content, policy, and spatial analyses. For the empirical investigation, the Australian context is selected as the testbed. The results reveal that: (a) innovation, sustainability, and governance are the most popular smart city concepts; (b) internet-of-things, artificial intelligence, and autonomous vehicle technology are the most popular technologies; (c) a balanced view exists on the importance of both smart city concepts and technologies; (d) Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane are the leading Australian smart cities; (e) systematic geo-Twitter analysis is a useful methodological approach for investigating perceptions and utilization of smart city concepts and technologies. The findings provide a clear snapshot of community perceptions on smart city concepts and technologies, and can inform smart city policymaking.

AB In this article, a switched reluctance motor (SRM) powered by autonomous stacked proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)'s stack with the purpose of optimizing their operating performances is addressed. Three key performance indices are examined that include: (1) torque per ampere ratio, (2) torque smoothness factor and (3) average starting torque. The later mentioned adapted indices characterize the objective functions that can be optimized individually and concurrently using a novel application of multi-objective dragonfly approach (MODA). The MODA is applied to generate the optimal turn (on/off) angles of H-bridge converter and the gains of a proportional-integral speed controller. A Pareto front optimal solutions are made, and the final best compromise solution is carefully chosen. The terminal voltage of the PEMFC is fine controlled by a boost converter, to overcome the noticeable decline of its voltage profile with the increase in loading current. The system under study is demonstrated at various loading conditions with necessary comparisons to other recent competing methods complete with subsequent discussions. The cropped numerical results indicate that PEMFC energy saving, reduction in SRM torque ripples and PEMFC current ripples can be enhanced. In addition, higher average starting torque of the SRM is realized.

AB A sustainable power supply for a wide range of applications, such as powering sensors for structural health monitoring and wireless sensoring nodes for data transmission and communication used in unmanned air vehicles, automobiles, renewable energy sectors, and smart city technologies, is targeted. This paper presents an experimental and numerical study that describes an innovative technique to harvest energy resulted from environmental vibrations. A piezoelectric energy harvester was integrated onto a carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminate structure using the co-curing method. The integrated composite with the energy harvester was lightweight, flexible and provided robust and reliable energy outcomes, which can be used to power different low-powered wireless sensing nodes. A normalised power density of 97 mu W cm(-3)m(-2)s(4) was obtained from resonance frequency of 46 Hz sinusoidal waves at amplitude of 0.2 g; while the representative environmental vibration waves in various applications (aerospace, automotive, machine and bridge infrastructure) were experimentally and numerically investigated to find out the energy that can be harvested by such a multifunctional composite structure. The results showed the energy harvested at different vibration input from various industrial sectors could be sufficient to power an autonomous structural health monitoring system and wireless communications by the designed composite structure.

AB The purpose of this study is to propose a cellular automata (CA) traffic flow model with high accuracy for lane change decision and name it LCCAM. A driving simulator experiment was conducted to find factors affecting lane changing decisions. A back-propagate (BP) neural network was used to obtain the lane changing rules for the microscopic lane changing decision model (LCDM), and the collected accurate vehicular trajectory data were used to train the BP neural networks for the prediction of lane changes. After comparing different input variable combinations, the most accurate input setting was determined, including the locations and velocities of neighboring vehicles, inner/outer lane indicator, and the speed limits of the corresponding lane. Then, the determined BP neural network was adopted in the LCCAM as the LCDM. Simulation results showed that the LCCAM can capture important characteristics such as the mean velocities and the number of lane changes well, by comparing with observed traffic flow. Meanwhile, the LCCAM illustrates a better performance in replicating the number of lane changes than the other reference CA models. The research results show that the LCCAM proposed in this study will have potential and value for autonomous driving and active safety analysis in the future.

AB Traffic congestion continues to be the bane of many metropolitan areas and has exercised the minds of experts for at least the last 60 years. With the advent of smart (intelligent) mobility, aligned with digital disruption and future connected and collaborative transport including extensions to autonomous vehicles, the question of whether we have a new window of opportunity to tame congestion is now high on the list of possibilities. It is however very unclear what the future will look like in respect of congestion on the roads, especially if we rely on 'smart' technology and continue to reject reform of road user charging and new opportunities to fund the sharing model. This paper looks at a number of themes as a way of highlighting possibilities and challenges and promotes a position that congestion may not be reduced, especially without a significant switch to the sharing economy and relinquishing of private car ownership; the urgent need for government to define the institutional setting within which smart mobility can deliver reductions in congestion; and the crucial role that road pricing reform must play to ensure that those who benefit (suppliers and travellers) contribute to pay for the infrastructure (in particular) that they gain benefit from.

DT Article
AB In this work a design for self-tuning non-linear Fuzzy Proportional Integral Derivative (FPID) controller is presented to control position and speed of Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) fully-actuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) to follow desired trajectories. Non-linearity that results from the hydrodynamics and the coupled AUV dynamics makes the design of a stable controller a very difficult task. In this study, the control scheme in a simulation environment is validated using dynamic and kinematic equations for the AUV model and hydrodynamic damping equations. An AUV configuration with eight thrusters and an inverse kinematic model from a previous work is utilized in the simulation. In the proposed controller, Mamdani fuzzy rules are used to tune the parameters of the PID. Nonlinear fuzzy Gaussian membership functions are selected to give better performance and response in the non-linear system. A control architecture with two feedback loops is designed such that the inner loop is for velocity control and outer loop is for position control. Several test scenarios are executed to validate the controller performance including different complex trajectories with and without injection of ocean current disturbances. A comparison between the proposed FPID controller and the conventional PID controller is studied and shows that the FPID controller has a faster response to the reference signal and more stable behavior in a disturbed non-linear environment.

AB This paper presents a multi-objective optimisation solution procedure for the design of the Shuttle-Based Storage and Retrieval System (SBS/RS). An efficient SBS/RS design should take into account multi-objectives for optimization. In this study, we considered three objective functions in the design concept which are the minimization of average cycle time of transactions (average throughput time), amount of energy (electricity) consumption and total investment cost. By also considering the amount of energy consumption as an objective function for minimization, we aimed to contribute to an environmentally friendly design concept. During the optimization procedure, we considered seven design variables as number of aisles, number of tiers, number of columns, velocities of shuttle carriers, acceleration/deceleration of shuttle carriers, velocity of the elevators lifting tables and acceleration/deceleration of the elevators lifting tables. Due to the non-linear property of the objective function, we utilized the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II) genetic algorithm for facilitating the solution. Lastly, we searched Pareto optimal solutions to find out the optimum results. We believe that this study provides a useful and a flexible tool for warehouse planners and designers, while choosing a particular type of SBS/RS at the early stage of the warehouse design.

ID ENERGY MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM; ARCHITECTURE; CONSUMPTION
AB In future power systems, in the smart grid and microgrids operation paradigms, consumers can be seen as an energy resource with decentralized and autonomous decisions in the energy management. It is expected that each consumer will manage not only the loads, but also small generation units, heating systems, storage systems, and electric vehicles. Each consumer can participate in different demand response events promoted by system operators or aggregation entities. This paper proposes an innovative method to manage the appliances on a house during a demand response event. The main contribution of this work is to include time constraints in resources management, and the context evaluation in order to ensure the required comfort levels. The dynamic resources management methodology allows a better resources' management in a demand response event, mainly the ones of long duration, by changing the priorities of loads during the event. A case study with two scenarios is presented considering a demand response with 30 min duration, and another with 240 min (4 h). In both simulations, the demand response event proposes the power consumption reduction during the event. A total of 18 loads are used, including real and virtual ones, controlled by the presented house management system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Detection and tracking of enemy emitters such as radar-carrying platforms is a task of considerable military significance. In the work presented here, the problem of adaptively controlling the trajectories of an autonomous team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) performing this task, in order to minimize emitter localization error, while simultaneously avoiding no-fly zones, is considered and a solution developed. Because of the computational complexity of the problem when long-term goals are considered, an optimal solution cannot be found in practice by any physically implementable method. Hence, in this paper an approach is developed that enables implementation of a computationally feasible, suboptimal solution that takes into account both short-term and long-term goals. To this end, the problem is addressed by developing a new hierarchical model predictive control (MPC) algorithm. To evaluate the effectiveness of the approach, first a controller is developed using an idealized UAV model and simulations are performed. Its performance is compared with a commonly used "myopic" control approach and found to give important improvements. Subsequently an improved planner is incorporated and tested, and then a version of the controller using a fixed-wing aircraft model for the UAVs is implemented. This version is also tested by simulation and found to perform successfully. Finally, a brief discussion on system stability is provided as part of the evaluation.

AB In order to perform underwater surveillance, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) require flexible, light-weight, reliable and robust sensing systems that are capable of flow sensing and detecting underwater objects. Underwater animals like fish perform a similar task using an efficient and ubiquitous sensory system called a lateral-line constituting of an array of pressure-gradient sensors. We demonstrate here the development of arrays of polymer microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) pressure sensors which are flexible and can be readily mounted on curved surfaces of AUV bodies. An array of ten sensors with a footprint of 60 (L) mm x 25 (W) mm x 0.4 (H) mm is fabricated using liquid crystal polymer (LCP) as the sensing membrane material. The flow sensing and object detection capabilities of the array are illustrated with proof-of-concept experiments conducted in a water tunnel. The sensors demonstrate a pressure sensitivity of 14: 3 mu V Pa-1. A high resolution of 25 mm s(-1) is achieved in water flow sensing. The sensors can passively sense underwater objects by transducing the pressure variations generated underwater by the movement of objects. The experimental results demonstrate the array's ability to detect the velocity of underwater objects towed past by with high accuracy, and an average error of only 2.5%.

AB We present Lie group integrators for nonlinear stochastic differential equations with noncommutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smooth finite-dimensional manifold. Given a Lie group action that generates transport along the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie group via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding Lie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the stochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations, and then push back to the Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring that our approximation lies in the manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their deterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration schemes based on Castell-Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying ordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a truncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group integrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary differential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell-Gaines methods are uniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes. Lastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid body such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by two independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.

AB Femoral head necrosis (FHN), one of the most popular joint diseases in the musculoskeletal system, is usually attributed to local ischemia of the femoral head. Thus, regenerating the vascularization capacity and restoring the local perfusion of the femoral head becomes an efficient therapeutic approach for FHN. We investigated the function of autologous lipoaspirate cells (LPCs) in regenerating circulation in FHN animal models and human subjects in this study. We also explored the mechanisms of why LPCs show a superior effect than that of the bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) in vascularization. Thirty-four FHN patients were recruited for the randomized clinical trial. Harris Hip Score (HHS) and digital subtraction arteriography (DSA) and interventional technique were used to compare the efficacy of LPCs treatment and vehicle therapy in improving femoral head circulation and hip joint function. Cellular mechanism that underlies the beneficial effect of LPCs in restoring blood supply and rescuing bone architecture was further explored using canine and mouse FHN animal models. We found that LPCs perfusion through the medial circumflex artery will promote the femoral head vascularization and bone structure significantly in both FHN patients and animal models. The HHS in LPCs treated patients was significantly improved relative to vehicle group. The levels of angiogenesis factor secreted by LPCs such as VEGF, FGF2, VEC, TGF-beta, were significantly higher than that of BMSCs. As the result, LPCs showed a better effect in promoting the tube structure formation of human vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) than that of BMSCs. Moreover, LPCs contains a unique CD44(+)CD34(+)CD31(-) population. The CD44(+)CD34(+)CD31(-) LPCs showed significantly higher angiogenesis potential as compared to that of BMSCs. Taken together, our results show that LPCs possess a superior vascularization capacity in both autonomous and paracrine manner, indicating that autologous LPCs perfusion via the medial circumflex artery is an effective therapy for FHN.

AB We present an approach for automatically detecting the positions of tree trunks, for determining their corresponding diameter at breast height (DBH), and for assessing the shape of tree trunks from 3D point clouds derived from unmanned aerial vehicle borne laser scanning (ULS). The experiments are carried out with point clouds from both a RIEGL miniVUX-1DL and from a RIEGL VUX-1UAV. The results reveal that the autonomous stem detection recognizes 91.0% and 77.6% of the stems, respectively, and that the DBH can be modeled with biases of 2.86 cm and 0.95 cm for 80.6% and 61.2% of the trees, when compared to field measurements. We further demonstrate that, compared to terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data, the stem diameters along the tree can be estimated with biases below 3.4 cm and 1.4 cm for the two systems, respectively, up to a tree height of 12 m for stems with a DBH above 20 cm. Our experiments further reveal the accuracy of diameter estimations to be mainly dominated by the tree's diameter with better accuracies for larger stems, while the completeness, with which a stem is covered by points, has lithe influence, as long as half of the stem circumference is captured. The absolute point count on the stem does not impact the estimation accuracy of all stem parameters, but is critical to the completeness with which a scene can be reconstructed. Conversely, we demonstrate the precision of the laser scanner to be a key factor for the accuracy of the stem diameter estimations, as in our experiments, we found the accuracies of the estimations from the VUX-1UAV to be higher than the ones from the miniVUX-1DL. The findings of our study assist to evaluate the potential of ULS for forest monitoring and management and allow for conclusions regarding the required point cloud qualifies and, thus, the mission planning of ULS acquisitions, in order to deliver data products, which fulfill the requirements for an operational application in forest inventories.

ID PATH; ALGORITHM
AB This paper proposes a reactive motion-planning approach for persistent surveillance of risk-sensitive areas by a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The planner, termed PARCov (Planner for Autonomous Risk-sensitive Coverage), seeks to: i) maximize the area covered by sensors mounted on each UAV; ii) provide persistent surveillance; iii) maintain high sensor data quality; and iv) reduce detection risk. To achieve the stated objectives, PARCov combines into a cost function the detection risk with an uncertainty measure designed to keep track of the regions that have been surveyed and the times they were last surveyed. PARCov reduces the uncertainty and detection risk by moving each quadcopter toward a low-cost region in its vicinity. By reducing the uncertainty, PARCov is able to increase the coverage and provide persistent surveillance. Moreover, a nonlinear optimization formulation is used to determine the optimal altitude for flying each quadcopter in order to maximize the sensor data quality while minimizing risk.
   The efficiency and scalability of PARCov is demonstrated in simulation using different risk models and an increasing number of UAVs to conduct risk-sensitive surveillance. Evidence of successful physical deployment is provided by experiments with AscTec Pelican quadcopters.
   Note to Practitioners-This paper was motivated by the viability of UAVs to enhance automation in environmental monitoring, search-and-rescue missions, package delivery, and many other applications. As UAVs become an economically feasible option for deployment, it becomes important to enhance their autonomy so as to increase productivity. In this paper, we develop an approach that uses simple interactions among UAVs to promote maximizing the area coverage while maintaining high sensor data quality and reducing the detection risk. The approach provides scalability, making it easy for UAVs to leave and join the mission as needed. Experimental results in simulation and with real quadcopters provide promising results. In future research, we would like to test and enhance the approach so that it can be used in various applications extending beyond laboratory testings.

AB Road markings are reflective features on roads that provide important information for safe and smooth driving. With the rise of autonomous vehicles (AV), it is necessary to represent them digitally, such as in high-definition (HD) maps generated by mobile mapping systems (MMSs). Unfortunately, MMSs are expensive, paving the way for the use of low-cost alternatives such as low-cost light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors. However, low-cost LiDAR sensors produce sparser point clouds than their survey-grade counterparts. This significantly reduces the capabilities of existing deep learning techniques in automatically extracting road markings, such as using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify point cloud-derived imagery. A solution would be to provide a more suitable loss function to guide the CNN model during training to improve predictions. In this work, we propose a modified loss function-focal combo loss-that enhances the capability of a CNN to extract road markings from sparse point cloud-derived images in terms of accuracy, reliability, and versatility. Our results show that focal combo loss outperforms existing loss functions and CNN methods in road marking extractions in all three aspects, achieving the highest mean F1-score and the lowest uncertainty for the two distinct CNN models tested.

AB With the aim of improving the rapidity and accuracy of quadrotor UAV positional trajectory tracking, this paper proposes a fuzzy automatic disturbance rejection control of quadrotor UAV based on improved whale optimization algorithm (IWOA-Fuzzy-ADRC). (1) To address the problems of low accuracy and slow convergence of the traditional whale algorithm, a combination of logistic chaos mapping and skew tent mapping is applied to improve the diversity of the initial population. (2) The global search capability is strengthened to avoid falling into local optimum through introducing the cross operator and Gaussian variational operators. (3) The IWOA is employed to iteratively optimize the adjustment coefficients of the fuzzy active disturbance rejection controller, the calculus gain of the nonlinear state error feedback control (NLSEF), and the error correction coefficients of the expansive state observer (ESO). The simulation results demonstrate that compared with the traditional ADRC controller and PID controller, the proposed IWOA-Fuzzy-ADRC controller can effectively improve the control performance of the system, accurately track the desired flight trajectory, accelerate the dynamic response of the control system, reduce the steady-state error, and enhance the anti-interference capability.

AB Metropolitan optical networks are undergoing significant transformations to continue being able to provide services that meet the requirements of the applications of the future. The current deployment of the 5G networks and the envisioned 6G cyber-physical systems would expand the possibilities for offering IoT applications, autonomous vehicles, and smart city services while imposing strong pressure on the physical infrastructure. In order to guarantee the strictest quality of service and quality of experience requirements for users, new architectures have been proposed in the literature for metropolitan optical networks, with a growing interest in the last five years. However, due to the proliferation of a dozen new architectures in the last years, many questions need to be investigated regarding the planning, implementation, and management of these architectures, before they could be considered for practical application. This work presents a comprehensive survey of the new proposed single-layer (purely optical) architectures for metropolitan optical networks. First, we discuss the structural organization of the new metro ecosystems. Second, the already established and novel architectures are presented, highlighting their characteristics and application. Third, we carry out a comparative analysis of these architectures to identify future technological trends. Finally, we have drawn outstanding research questions to help direct future research in the field.

AB Transfer learning aims to extract knowledge from one or more source tasks and apply the knowledge to a different task for more accurate predictions. The main purposes of this study are to investigate different knowledge transfer techniques, apply them to accurately predict the lateral strength of reinforced concrete columns with only a small amount of training data, and compare the transferability of each method. According to the various source and target domains, three different experiments are designed to directly compare the performance across section type, shear reinforcement area, and concrete compressive strength. In all cases in this study, knowledge transfer techniques show better prediction performance than the models trained without any knowledge transfer techniques. Therefore, we can conclude that transferring pre-trained knowledge from the source domain enables a model to better explain the response variable in the target domain. The performance improvement is particularly emphasized when the available data for the target domain is small. Thus, transfer learning can be one way to address the data scarcity problem in structural engineering. Furthermore, transferring the pre-trained knowledge is more associated with the underlying physical relationship between the source and the target domains and less associated with the discrepancy between the source and the target domain distributions.

AB Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) navigating outdoors rely heavily on GPS for localisation and autonomous flight or applications for aerial photography re-cording with a GPS coordinate. However, GPS may fail or become unreliable, thus compromising the flight mission. Motivated by this scenario, in this work, we present a study on the use of popular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to address the problem of geo-localisation from a single aerial image. We compare CNN-based architectures from the state-of-the-art, and introduce a compact architecture to speed up the inference process without affecting the estimation error. For our experiments, aerial images were recorded with a monocular camera onboard a UAV, flying outdoors with a height between 20 to 25 metres. On average, our compact network achieves a minimum estimation error of 2.8 metres and a maximum of 6.1 metres, which is comparable to the performance of other networks in the state-of-the-art. However, our network achieves on average an operation frequency of 103 fps versus 69 fps achieved by the fastest network in the comparison analysis. These results are promising since such speed would enable fast geo-localisation with cameras capturing images at those frame rates, which are useful for obtaining neater images than with conventional cameras working at 30 fps.

DE Fisheye image rectification; dilated convolution; self-attention; deep
   learning
AB Fisheye images are attracting attention in computer vision such as autonomous vehicles and virtual reality because of the wide field of view (WFoV). However, fisheye images have geometric distortions caused by the refractive index of the lens. Conventional fisheye rectification methods require multiple images to calculate distortion coefficients and lens intrinsic parameters. This means that if the fisheye lens is changed, the same operation will have to be repeated. On the other hand, by using deep learning, images with different distortion coefficients can be rectified. Also, with end-to-end learning, no feature engineering is required. To improve the performance of fisheye image rectification, we propose global convolutional neural networks with self-attention to rectify the fisheye images. The proposed method employs dilated convolutional neural networks (D-CNNs) to enlarge receptive fields, and self-attention to extract the most important features of input images. In this way, the proposed method can extract global features from input images. To better train and evaluate the proposed method, we generate fisheye images from the Place2 dataset with Cartesian and polar coordinates, and label them with original images (ground-truth). we also schedule the learning rate with cosine annealing and use an integrated loss function. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an excellent performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

AB This paper is concerned with a multi-underactuated AUV three-dimensional (3-D) formation control method with a multi-time-scale structure in the presence of uncertain nonlinearities and environmental disturbances. First, a double-layer independent position-velocity fixed topology is adopted to overcome the drawback of narrow bandwidth of underwater communication. Then, an extended high-gain observer (EHGO) is utilized to provide compensation to uncertain nonlinearities and environmental disturbances. Moreover, the consensus theory is incorporated with an integral sliding mode controller to guarantee that the multi-underactuated AUV system can track the desired trajectory while maintaining the predefined formation. In addition, based on the analysis for the whole formation control system, the extended high-gain observer is on the ultra-fast time scale, the integral sliding mode controller is on the fast time scale, and the system state converges to the desired state on the slow time scale. Such multi-time scale structure allows independent analysis of the dynamics in each time scale, and the singular perturbation method is effectively utilized to establish the exponential stability of the equilibrium. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate the control performance.

AB Maintaining the massive forests of the forestry industry requires physical samples from the tree canopy to enable breeding, genetics research and monitoring of diseases. An autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) canopy sampling solution requires locating and tracking a highly unstructured, moving object against a dynamic, cluttered background. The developed algorithm utilises stereo vision techniques to reconstruct a 3D point cloud of the target branch and subsequently estimate the intercept point location. The optimal parameters are selected by quantifying the accuracy against ground truth obtained from motion capture. Since wind will likely affect the tree canopy during sampling, the branch will exhibit some sway motion which can be modelled as simple harmonic motion. Hence, a linear Kalman filter is formulated to estimate the sway parameters. With the branch 1 m from the camera, the average error is 41 mm for sway amplitudes between 50 mm and 250 mm with a plain background. When tested with a cluttered background, the reduced contrast results in higher standard deviations. Overall, the developed Kalman filter significantly reduces the intercept point error standard deviation, averaging 17% and 33% reductions for plain and cluttered backgrounds respectively. Subsequent outdoor testing verified the capability of the developed algorithm to estimate the branch trajectory to well within the maximum gripper opening of 115 mm.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Environmental perception plays an essential role in autonomous driving tasks and demands robustness in cluttered dynamic environments such as complex urban scenarios. In this paper, a robust Multiple Object Detection and Tracking (MODT) algorithm for a non-stationary base is presented, using multiple 3D LiDARs for perception. The merged LiDAR data is treated with an efficient MODT framework, considering the limitations of the vehicle-embedded computing environment. The ground classification is obtained through a grid-based method while considering a non-planar ground. Furthermore, unlike prior works, 3D grid-based clustering technique is developed to detect objects under elevated structures. The centroid measurements obtained from the object detection are tracked using Interactive Multiple Model-Unscented Kalman Filter-Joint Probabilistic Data Association Filter (IMM-UKF-JPDAF). IMM captures different motion patterns, UKF handles the nonlinearities of motion models, and JPDAF associates the measurements in the presence of clutter. The proposed algorithm is implemented on two slightly dissimilar platforms, giving real-time performance on embedded computers. The performance evaluation metrics by MOT16 and ground truths provided by KITTI Datasets are used for evaluations and comparison with the state-of-the-art. The experimentation on platforms and comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques suggest that the proposed framework is a feasible solution for MODT tasks.

AB Crash sensing and its assessment play a pivotal role in autonomous vehicles for preventing fatal casualties. Existing crash sensors are severely bottlenecked by sluggish response time, rigid mechanical components, and space constraints. Miniaturized sensors embedded with custom-tailored nanomaterials upholds potential to overcome these limitations. In this article, piezoelectric Zinc-Oxide thin film as a crash sensing layer is integrated onto a flexible metal-alloy cantilever. Material characterization studies are conducted to confirm piezoelectric property of sputtered ZnO film. The piezoelectric d(31) coefficient value of ZnO film was 7.2 pm V-1. The ZnO sensing element is firmly mounted on a scaled car model and used in a crash sensing experimental set-up. A comprehensive theoretical analysis for two different real scenarios (nearly elastic and nearly inelastic collision) of crash events followed by experimental study is discussed. The crash sensor's output exhibits a linear relationship with magnitude of impact forces experienced at crash events. The response time of ZnO crash sensor is 18.2 ms, and it exhibits a sensitivity of 28.7 mV N-1. The developed crash sensor has potential to replace bulk material sensors owing to its faster response time, high sensitivity, and compactness as the demand for crash sensors in next-generation automobile industries is progressively growing.

AB A METals In Situ analyzer (METIS) has been used to determine dissolved manganese (II) concentrations in the subhalocline waters of the Gotland Deep (central Baltic Sea). High-resolution in situ measurements of total dissolved Mn were obtained in near real-time by spectrophotometry using 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphthol (PAN). PAN is a complexing agent of dissolved Mn and forms a wine-red complex with a maximum absorbance at a wavelength of 562 nm. Results are presented together with ancillary temperature, salinity, and dissolved O-2 data. Lab calibration of the analyzer was performed in a pressure testing tank. A detection limit of 77 nM was obtained. For validation purposes, discrete water samples were taken by using a pump-CTD system. Dissolved Mn in these samples was determined by an independent laboratory based method (inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry, ICP-OES). Mn measurements from both METIS and ICP-OES analysis were in good agreement. The results showed that the in situ analysis of dissolved Mn is a powerful technique reducing dependencies on heavy and expensive equipment (pump-CTD system, ICP-OES) and is also cost and time effective.

AB Robust environmental perception is a crucial parameter for the development of autonomous ground vehicle applications, especially in the field of agricultural robotics which is one of the priorities for the Horizon 2020 robotics funding (EU funding program for research and innovation). Because of uncontrolled and changing environmental conditions in outdoor and natural environments, data from optical sensors classically used in mobile robotics can be compromised and unusable. In such situations, millimeter-wave radar can provide an alternative and complementary solution for perception tasks. The aim of this paper is to present the PELICAN radar, a millimeter-wave radar specifically designed for mobile robotics applications, including obstacle detection, mapping and situational awareness in general. In this first of a two-part paper, the choice of a frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar is explained and the theoretical elements of this solution are detailed.

AB In this paper, we propose an accurate and real-time positioning method for robotic cars in urban environments. The proposed method uses a robust lane marking detection algorithm, as well as an efficient shape registration algorithm between the detected lane markings and a GPS-based road shape prior, to improve the robustness and accuracy of the global localization of a robotic car. We show that, by formulating the positioning problem in a relative sense, we can estimate the global localization of a car in real time and bound its absolute error in the centimeter level by a cross-validation scheme. The cross-validation scheme integrates the vision-based lane marking detection with the shape registration, and it improves the accuracy and robustness of the overall localization system. The GPS localization can be refined by using lane marking detection when the GPS suffers from frequent satellite signal masking or blockage, whereas lane marking detection is validated and completed by theGPS-based road shape prior when it does not work well in adverse weather conditions or with poor lane signatures. We extensively evaluate the proposedmethod with a single forward-looking camera mounted on an autonomous vehicle that travels at 60 km/h through several urban street scenes.

AB This paper is the extension of work presented at the IARP Conference "Bio inspired robotics" held in Frascati (Italy), 14 May 2014.
   The subject is the localization problem of an underwater swarm of autonomous underwater robots (AUV), in the frame of the HARNESS project; by localization, we mean the relative swarm configuration, i.e., the geometrical shape of the group. The result is achieved by using the signals that the robots exchange. The swarm is organized by rules and conceived to perform tasks, ranging from environmental monitoring to terrorism-attack surveillance.
   Two methods of determining the shape of the swarm, both based on trilateration calculation, are proposed. The first method focuses on the robot's speed. In this case, we use our knowledge of the speeds and distances between the machines, while the second method considers only distances and the orientation angles of the robots. Unlike a trilateration problem, we do not know the position of the beacons and this renders the problem a difficult one. Moreover, we have very few data. More than one step of motion is needed to resolve the multiple solutions found, owing to the symmetries of the system and optimization process of one or more objective functions leading to the final configuration. We subsequently checked our algorithm using a simulator taking into account random errors affecting the measurements.

AB The main objective of an Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle (UAV) is to provide an operator with services from its payload. Currently, to get these UAV services, one extra human operator is required to navigate the UAV. Many techniques have been investigated to increase UAV navigation autonomy at the Path Planning level. The most challenging aspect of this task is the re-planning requirement, which comes from the fact that UAVs are called upon to fly in unknown environments. One technique that out performs the others in path planning is the Genetic Algorithm (GA) method because of its capacity to explore the solution space while preserving the best solutions already found. However, because the GA tends to be slow due to its iterative process that involves many candidate solutions, the approach has not been actively pursued for real time systems. This paper presents the research that we have done to improve the GA computation time in order to obtain a path planning generator that can recompile a path in real-time, as unforeseen events are met by the UAV. The paper details how we achieved parallelism with a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation of the GA. Our FPGA implementation not only results in an excellent autonomous path planner, but it also provides the design foundations of a hardware chip that could be added to an UAV platform.

AB The scavenging fauna of the Patagonian slope (900-1750 m), east of the Falkland Islands was investigated using the Aberdeen University Deep Ocean Submersible (AUDOS), an autonomous baited camera vehicle designed to photograph scavenging fish and invertebrates. The AUDOS was deployed on ten occasions in Falkland waters. Nine experiments were of 10-14 h duration and baited with 800 g of squid and one experiment: lasted six days, baited with a 10 kg toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides). Analysis of photographs revealed considerable patchiness in the composition of the scavenging fauna. Hagfish (Myxine cf fernholmi) dominated three of the shallower experiments including the 6-d experiment, arriving quickly from down-current, holding station at the bait and consuming the soft tissues first, with consumption rates of up to 200 g h(-1). In the other experiments, stone crabs (Lithodidae), the blue-hake (Antimora rostrata) and amphipods were the primary consumers, but the rate of bait consumption was lower. Patagonian toothfish (D. eleginoides) were attracted to the bait at each experiment, but did not attempt to consume the bait. The patchiness in the fauna may be a result of depth, substratum and topography, but in general the rapid response of the scavenging fauna indicates that carrion is rapidly dispersed, with little impact on the local sediment community.

AB Intelligent driving vehicles require more accurate and stable braking control. Electrohydraulic braking (EHB) systems can better adapt to the development of autonomous driving technology. The gear transmission system plays a crucial role in EHB deceleration and torque increase mechanisms. However, its dead-zone nonlinearity poses challenges for EHB control. To address the position-control problem in the EHB gear transmission system, we propose a finite-time adaptive control method for the symmetrical dead zone. This approach combines adaptive control theory with finite-time control theory and designs parameter-updating laws for the unknown parameters in the system. Boundary estimates are introduced into the parameter-update laws and control laws to compensate for unknown disturbances. By adjusting the relevant parameters, the convergence rate can be improved, ensuring that errors converge within a specified range within a limited time. After modifying the parameter-updating laws and control laws, all closed-loop signals remain bounded. Finally, we validate the proposed control strategy through simulation and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing. The results demonstrate that the control strategy developed in this study achieves high tracking accuracy and stability even in the presence of dead zones, unknown parameters, and unknown interferences in the EHB gear-drive servo system.

AB This study investigates the use of generative adversarial network (GAN)-based data augmentation to enhance data discretization for smoother drone input. The goal is to improve unmanned aerial vehicles' (UAVs) performance and maneuverability by incorporating synthetic inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. The GAN model is employed to generate synthetic IMU data that closely resemble real-world IMU measurements. The methodology involves training the GAN model using a dataset of real IMU data and then using the trained model to generate synthetic IMU data. The generated synthetic data are then combined with the real data for data discretization. The resulting improved data discretization is evaluated using statistical metrics and a similarity evaluation. The improved data discretization demonstrates enhanced drone performance in terms of flight stability, control accuracy, and smoothness of movements when compared to standard data discretization methods. These results highlight the potential of GAN-based data augmentation for enhancing data discretization and improving drone performance. The proposition of improved data discretization offers a tangible benefit for the successful integration of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) systems. Enhancing the accuracy and reliability of data acquisition and processing in UAS makes UAS operations safer and more reliable. This improvement is crucial for achieving the goal of automated and autonomous operations in diverse settlement environments, encompassing multiple mobility modes such as ground and air transportation.

AB This paper studies data collection schedule for energy harvesting wireless sensor networks (EHWSNs) using an autonomous vehicle called mobile sink (MS). The MS collects data while moving on a path from the nearby sensors called sub-sinks. The remaining sensors forward their data to the MS through the sub-sinks. However, the data collection throughput using the MS based data collection is relatively low. Efficient distribution of data among the sub-sinks and efficient data collection schedule are leveraged to improve the data collection throughput. A novel two-phase data distribution algorithm using a minimum cost network flow technique is proposed for efficient distribution of data. It helps to minimize idle time of the MS during data collection as well as improves the data accumulation at the sub-sinks. A novel adaptive data collection schedule is proposed for collecting the data from the sub-sinks. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with two existing solutions. It reveals that the two-phase data distribution algorithm together with the data collection schedule improves the data collection throughput by 20-25%. Moreover, it also significantly improves total data collection and preserves the energy efficiency and energy neutrality of the energy harvesting rechargeable sensors.

AB Aiming at the problem that unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) is difficult to quickly and accurately perceive situation information and make maneuvering decision autonomously in modern air combat, which is easily affected by complex factors, a maneuvering decision algorithm of UCAV combined with deep reinforcement learning and game theory is proposed in this paper. Firstly, through the UCAV dynamics model and maneuver library, a reasonable air combat situation assessment model and advantage reward function are established, and the sample data of situation assessment indicators are constructed using the structure entropy weight method. Secondly, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to process the high-dimensional continuous situation features of UCAV in air combat, eliminate the correlation and redundancy between situation features, and train the neural network to approximate the action-value function. Then, the double deep Q network (DDQN) algorithm in reinforcement learning (RL) is introduced to train the agent by the interaction with the environment and combined with Minimax algorithm in stochastic game theory to solve the optimal value function in each specific state, and the optimal maneuver decision of UCAV is obtained. Air combat simulation results show that UCAV can choose maneuvers autonomously under different situations and occupy a dominant position quickly by this method, which greatly improves the combat effectiveness of UCAV.

AB The fast development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven an increasing consumer demand for self-powered gas sensors for real-time data collection and autonomous responses in industries such as environmental monitoring, workplace safety, smart cities, and personal healthcare. Despite intensive research and rapid progress in the field, most reported self-powered devices, specifically NO2 sensors for air pollution monitoring, have limited sensitivity, selectivity, and scalability. Here, a novel photovoltaic self-powered NO2 sensor is demonstrated based on axial p-i-n homojunction InP nanowire (NW) arrays, that overcome these limitations. The optimized innovative InP NW array device is designed by numerical simulation for insights into sensing mechanisms and performance enhancement. Without a power source, this InP NW sensor achieves an 84% sensing response to 1 ppm NO2 and records a limit of detection down to the sub-ppb level, with little dependence on the incident light intensity, even under <5% of 1 sun illumination. Based on this great environmental fidelity, the sensor is integrated into a commercial microchip interface to evaluate its performance in the context of dynamic environmental monitoring of motor vehicle exhaust. The results show that compound semiconductor nanowires can form promising self-powered sensing platforms suitable for future mega-scale IoT systems.

AB Image feature matching is essential in many computer vision applications, and the foundation of matching is feature detection, which is a crucial feature quantification process. This manuscript focused on detecting more features from underwater acoustic imageries for further ocean engineering applications of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Currently, the mainstream feature detection operators are developed for optical images, and there is not yet a feature detector oriented to underwater acoustic imagery. To better analyze the suitability of existing feature detectors for acoustic imagery and develop an operator that can robustly detect feature points in underwater imageries in the future, this manuscript compared the performance of well-established handcrafted feature detectors and that of the increasingly popular deep-learning-based detectors to fill the gap in the literature. The datasets tested are from the most commonly used side-scan sonars (SSSs) and forward-looking sonars (FLSs). Additionally, the detection idea of these detectors on the acoustic imagery phase congruency (PC) layer was innovatively proposed with the aim of finding a solution that balances detection accuracy and speed. The experimental results show that the ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) and BRISK (Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Keypoints) detectors achieve the best overall performance, the FAST detector is the fastest, and the PC and Sobel layers are the most favorable for implementing feature detection.

AB Wave Glider is an unmanned autonomous vehicle fully powered by renewable energy, which converts wave energy into thrust and converts solar energy into power for electronic devices. It is extensively applied in large-scale, long-term ocean observation. However, photovoltaic power generation capacity of Wave Glider is relatively weak (continuous power available to payloads: 10 Watts), which limits the sensing and communication ability of Wave Glider. This paper presents a Wave Glider with a WEC called WEC-Glider scheme, i.e., the fluctuating tension of umbilical drives the slider to do a reciprocating movement, and then the slider drives the ball screw to spin the generator. The WEC-Glider is capable of converting wave energy into electricity as well as propulsion. Based on Fossen's equation, the 6-DOF dynamic models are established. A numerical model is established via Matlab/Simulink, to simulate the dynamic response with different parameters. The numerical results show that the proposed WECGlider can achieve 34 Watts power generation under the given regular waves. In the future, the WECglider could be used in the oceanographic observation to cope with insufficient photovoltaic power generation of the traditional Wave Glider, especially on continuous cloudy days or in high latitude region.

AB In the face of deeply exploring and exploiting marine resources, the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) networks have drawn great attention considering its widely distributed low-cost and easy-deployment smart sensing nodes. However, given the hostile underwater environment, it is critical to conceive energy-efficient information collection because of limited underwater energy supply and inefficient artificial recharge methods. Characterized by high flexibility and maneuverability, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are regarded as a promising solution for information collection in the IoUT relying upon delicate AUVs' trajectory and information collection strategy design with the spirit of balancing their energy consumption and information processing capability. In this article, we propose a heterogeneous AUV-aided information collection system with the aim of maximizing the energy efficiency of IoUT nodes taking into account AUV trajectory, resource allocation, and the Age of Information (AoI). Moreover, based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO), we obtain the trajectory of AUVs with low time complexity. Additionally, a two-stage joint optimization algorithm based on the Lyapunov optimization is constructed to strike a tradeoff between energy efficiency and system queue backlog iteratively. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed strategy.

AB Management and control of transportation systems benefit from simulation modeling. The design of the corresponding models is difficult because of their complexity. Multi-agent systems cope with this problem by a divide-and-conquer approach. However, agent model design is still quite a challenge. In this paper, we propose a layered architecture for agents where each component is a kind of a stack-based state machine of our own. This model complements extended finite-state machines with some basic state stack operations that enable not only dealing with hierarchy but also with planning, which is a key element for belief-desire-intention (BDI) agents. Special care was taken to make the representation of these extended finite-state stack machines ((EFSM)-M-2) simple so that their programming is straightforward. Through an educational example we show how such class of models are, and the potentiality of the solution. The taxi fleet simulation model is a metaphor for transportation systems in structured environments like factories or warehouses but can also be used as a vehicle traffic simulator. As for the latter case, we illustrate how it can be used to determine the efficiency and the quality of service of a taxi fleet in an urban area.

AB The biomimicry of fish fins has been suggested as an efficient and low-noise approach to propulsion for remotely operated and autonomous underwater vehicles. Propulsion of this type is achieved through the use of fin-like propulsors that undergo oscillatory motions. Two computational approaches of differing fidelity and computational space/time requirements have been used to calculate thrust and efficiency of oscillating marine propulsors in order to determine the region where each method is most appropriate for design applications. The higher fidelity and computational cost method is an unsteady Navier-Stokes approach. The lower fidelity and computational cost method is a lifting-surface potential flow method supplemented with strip theory to account for viscous effects. In comparison with two-dimensional experimental results, both methods were able to accurately capture magnitudes and trends in light to moderate thrust conditions (C-T < 0.7) assuming no dynamic stall occurs. Under these operating conditions, computational savings for three-dimensional analysis on the order of 5,000 processor-hours are achieved by using the lower fidelity method, making it the more appropriate choice for design applications. At high thrust conditions (C-T > 0.7) and in conditions where dynamic stall effects are prevalent (alpha(max) > 20 degrees, low Strouhal numbers), the higher fidelity method is required to achieve sufficient predictive accuracy.

AB This paper addressed the formation control problem of surface unmanned vessels with model uncertainty, parameter perturbation, and unknown environmental disturbances. A formation control method based on the control force saturation constraint and the extended state observer (ESO) was proposed. Compared with the control methods which only consider the disturbances from external environment, the method proposed in this paper took model uncertainties, parameter perturbation, and external environment disturbances as the compound disturbances, and the ESO was used to estimate and compensate for the disturbances, which improved the anti-disturbance performance of the controller. The formation controller was designed with the virtual leader strategy, and backstepping technique was designed with saturation constraint (SC) function to avoid the lack of force of the actuator. The stability of the closed-loop system was analyzed with the Lyapunov method, and it was proved that the whole system is uniformly and ultimately bounded. The tracking error can converge to arbitrarily small by choosing reasonable controller parameters. The comparison and analysis of simulation experiments showed that the controller designed in this paper had strong anti-disturbance and anti-saturation performance to the compound disturbances of vessels and can effectively complete the formation control.

AB Underwater cables or pipelines are commonly utilized elements in ocean research, marine engineering, power transmission, and communication-based activities. Their performance necessitates regularly conducted inspection for maintenance purposes. A vision system is commonly used by autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to track and search for underwater cable. Its traditional methods are characteristically applicable in AUVs, wherein they are equipped with handcrafted features and shallow trainable architectures. However, such methods are subpar or even incapable of tracking underwater cable in fast-changing and complex underwater conditions. In contrast to this, the deep learning method is linked with the capacity to learn semantic, high-level, and deeper features, thus rendering it recommended for performing underwater cable tracking. In this study, several deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models were proposed to classify underwater cable images obtained from a set of underwater images, whereby transfer learning and data augmentation were applied to enhance the classification accuracy. Following a comparison and discussion regarding the performance of these models, MobileNetV2 outperformed among other models and yielded lower computational time and the highest accuracy for classifying underwater cable images at 93.5%. Hence, the main contribution of this study is geared toward developing a deep learning method for underwater cable image classification.

AB Recently, millimeter-wave (mmWave) 5G localization has been shown to be to provide centimeter-level accuracy, lending itself to many location-aware applications, e.g., connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). One assumption usually made in the investigation of localization methods is that the user equipment (UE), i.e., a CAV, and the base station (BS) are time synchronized. In this paper, we remove this assumption and investigate two two-way localization protocols: (i) a round-trip localization protocol (RLP), whereby the BS and UE exchange signals in two rounds of transmission and then localization is achieved using the signal received in the second round; (ii) a collaborative localization protocol (CLP), whereby localization is achieved using the signals received in the two rounds. We derive the position and orientation error bounds applying beamforming at both ends and compare them to the traditional one-way localization. Our results show that mmWave localization is mainly limited by the angular rather than the temporal estimation and that CLP significantly outperforms RLP. Our simulations also show that it is more beneficial to have more antennas at the BS than at the UE.

AB In this paper, an intelligent adaptive algorithm based on the integrated Inertial Navigation System (INS) is presented for estimating the velocity of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The most common algorithm for incorporating the navigation data is Kalman Filter (KF). In the conventional KF algorithm, the covariance matrix of measurement noise is considered as a constant through running time. The noise covariance in the Adaptive Kalman Filter (AKF), is estimated through processing the innovation sequence inside a window of constant length. In actual conditions, the correct window length to achieve the best estimation, depends on the operational conditions. In this paper, proper window length in the adaptive algorithm is estimated by processing the probability density function of the innovation sequence at each time step; so the window length in the proposed algorithm is variable due to condition changes. The proposed integrated navigation system consists of a three-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a three-axis Doppler Velocity Log (DVL). The performance of the proposed system is evaluated through four sea tests using an AUV. Experimental results show that the proposed system has superior performance than the conventional KF algorithm and is similar to the optimum AKF (AKF with the best window length).

ID PROTOCOL
AB There are two different types of primary users (natural acoustic and artificial acoustic), and there is a long propagation delay for acoustic links in underwater cognitive acoustic networks (UCANs). Thus, the selection of a stable route is one of the key design factors for improving overall network stability, thereby reducing end-to-end delay. Software-defined networking (SDN) is a novel approach that improves network intelligence. To this end, we propose a novel SDN-based routing protocol for UCANs in order to find a stable route between source and destination. A main controller is placed in a surface buoy that is responsible for the global view of the network, whereas local controllers are placed in different autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that are responsible for a localized view of the network. The AUVs have fixed trajectories, and sensor nodes within transmission range of the AUVs serve as gateways to relay the gathered information to the controllers. This is an SDN-based underwater communications scheme whereby two nodes can only communicate when they have a consensus about a common idle channel. To evaluate our proposed scheme, we perform extensive simulations and improve network performance in terms of end-to-end delay, delivery ratio, and overhead.

AB In the burgeoning field of e-mental health interventions, avatars are increasingly being utilized to facilitate online communication between clients and therapists, and among peers. Avatars are digital self-representations, which enable individuals to interact with each other in computer-based virtual environments. In this narrative review, we examine the psychotherapeutic applications of avatars that have been investigated and trialed to date. Five key applications were identified (1) in the formation of online peer support communities; (2) replicating traditional modes of psychotherapy by using avatars as a vehicle to communicate within a wholly virtual environment; (3) using avatar technology to facilitate or augment face-to-face treatment; (4) as part of serious games; and (5) communication with an autonomous virtual therapist. Across these applications, avatars appeared to serve several functions conducive to treatment engagement by (1) facilitating the development of a virtual therapeutic alliance; (2) reducing communication barriers; (3) promoting treatment-seeking through anonymity; (4) promoting expression and exploration of client identity; and (5) enabling therapists to control and manipulate treatment stimuli. Further research into the feasibility and ethical implementation of avatar-based psychotherapies is required.

AB Military systems are the motivational driver for much of the technology development conducted at applied research laboratories around the world. AS the needs of the world's militaries change, so does the focus of this research and development. in this paper, we discuss how the fundamental characteristics of military operations in urban terrain (MOUT) impose requirements and constraints on sensing and reconnaissance. We highlight the importance of a new class of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for network-centric military urban operations. We review some of the UAVs that have been developed in recent years, and that are under development, with particular attention to their endurance, portability, performance, payload, and communication capabilities. Selected university testbeds are also briefly noted. over the last few years there has been considerable research focused on how these small UAVs, both individually and collectively, can operate autonomously in urban environments and help capture and communicate needed information. we discuss some of this research; specific topics covered include guidance and control for autonomous operation, multi-UAV coordination and route optimization, and ad-hoc networking with UAV nodes. A new concept of operations is described that relies on coordination and control of a heterogeneous suite of small UAVS for surveillance and reconnaissance operations in urban terrain.

AB [1] We characterize hydrothermal plumes and hydrography within the axial valley of the Endeavour segment ( Juan de Fuca ridge, northeast Pacific) using data from an autonomous underwater vehicle, a lowered CTD, and two current meter moorings. Our survey of the Main Endeavour hydrothermal vent field (MEF) shows hydrographic variability on scales as short as similar to 20 m and similar to 10 min. Within the similar to 100 m deep axial valley, the mean flow is 1 - 5 cm/s to the north, and tidal oscillations have similar to 5 cm/s amplitude. Combining the mean flow with an estimate of the difference in average temperature observed north and south of MEF, we find that the net along-axis horizontal heat flux has a mean magnitude of similar to 8 - 42 MW. An advection/diffusion model forced by local current records explains the observed temporal hydrographic variability and shows that mean horizontal flux variance is correspondingly high ( standard deviation similar to 63 MW). A steady state MEF heat budget, constrained by the observed horizontal flux and measurements of vertical fluxes from other studies, has two implications: the MEF heat flux is partitioned about equally between diffuse and focused vents, and about 85% of the flux from diffuse plumes is entrained by focused plumes.

AB This paper studies a novel robotic warehousing system called the overhead robotic compact storage and retrieval system, which can free up the floor space occupation at a low cost. Bins, as basic storage containers, are stacked on top of each other to form a bin stack. Along overhead tracks, bin-picking robots transport bins between storage/retrieval positions and workstations with the aid of track-changing robots. Little research has been done to study operational policies and performance analysis for this new robotic compact warehousing system. We propose a nested queuing network model that considers two transportation resources and performs reinforcement learning using real data to improve the reshuffling efficiency. We find that reinforcement learning based reshuffling policy greatly reduces the reshuffling distance and saves computation time compared to existing policies. We find that the storage policy of stacks affects the optimal width/length ratio regardless of the system height. Interestingly, we obtain the number of robots that can stabilise the system to avoid an explosion of the order queue; two more robots than that number will produce relatively low throughput times. Compared to an AutoStore system, using our system reduces cost by 30% with a slight increase in throughput time.

AB Underwater computer vision has attracted increasing attention in the research community due to the recent advances in underwater platforms such as of rovers, gliders, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and the like, that now make possible the acquisition of vast amounts of imagery and video for applications such as biodiversity assessment, environmental monitoring, and search and rescue. Despite growing interest, underwater computer vision is still a relatively under-researched area, where the attention in the literature has been paid to the use of computer vision techniques for image restoration and reconstruction, where image formation models and image processing methods are used to recover colour corrected or enhanced images. This is due to the notion that these methods can be used to achieve photometric invariants to perform higher-level vision tasks such as shape recovery and recognition under the challenging and widely varying imaging conditions that apply to underwater scenes. In this paper, we review underwater computer vision techniques for image reconstruction, restoration, recognition, depth, and shape recovery. Further, we review current applications such as biodiversity assessment, management and protection, infrastructure inspection and AUVs navigation, amongst others.

AB This paper considers the autonomous detecting and tracking task of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the maritime environment. Due to the high computational complexity of the image-processing task, the strict latency requirement of the tracking task, and the shortage of batteries and computational capability of UAVs, the UAVs can offload the computing-intensive task to the edge computing server (ECS) to reduce the task latency and energy consumption. Even though, the large latency and energy consumption brought by some high-definition image-processing task still make some visual tracking difficult to perform. We first investigate the impact of video frame resolution on computing task size and detection accuracy, and further on task latency and energy consumption. In addition, we optimize the transmission power, the local CPU frequency, the offloading rate of UAVs, and the bandwidth allocation between UAVs. We model the UAVs tracking system as an energy consumption optimization problem with the constraint of task latency. Although the proposed optimization problem is complex, we transform the optimization problem into several subproblems with decoupling and rigorous mathematical proof. By combining the convex optimization with the genetic algorithm, an offloading algorithm with low complexity and good performance is obtained, which is verified by comparing with some benchmark offloading strategies in the numerical results.

ID ROBOT NAVIGATION
AB We focus on robot navigation in crowded environments. The challenge of predicting the motion of a crowd around a robot makes it hard to ensure human safety and comfort. Recent approaches often employ end-to-end techniques for robot control or deep architectures for high-fidelity human motion prediction. While these methods achieve important performance benchmarks in simulated domains, dataset limitations and high sample complexity tend to prevent them from transferring to real-world environments. Our key insight is that a low-dimensional representation that captures critical features of crowd-robot dynamics could be sufficient to enable a robot to wind through a crowd smoothly. To this end, we mathematically formalize the act of passing between two agents as a rotation, using a notion of topological invariance. Based on this formalism, we design a cost functional that favors robot trajectories contributing higher passing progress and penalizes switching between different sides of a human. We incorporate this functional into a model predictive controller that employs a simple constant-velocity model of human motion prediction. This results in robot motion that accomplishes statistically significantly higher clearances from the crowd compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining competitive levels of efficiency, across extensive simulations and challenging real-world experiments on a self-balancing robot.

AB Relative positioning is one of the important techniques in collabo-rative robotics, autonomous vehicles, and virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) applications. Recently, ultra-wideband (UWB) has been utilized to calculate relative position as it does not require a line of sight compared to a camera to calculate the range between two objects with centimeter-level accuracy. However, the single UWB range measurement cannot provide the relative position and attitude of any device in three dimensions (3D) because of lacking bearing information. In this paper, we have proposed a UWB-IMU fusion-based relative position system to provide accurate relative position and attitude between wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices in 3D. We introduce a distributed Euler angle antenna orientation which can be equipped with the mobile structure to enable relative positioning. Moving average and min-max removing preprocessing filters are introduced to reduce the standard deviation. The standard multilateration method is modified to calculate the relative position between mobile structures. We combine UWB and IMU measurements in a probabilistic framework that enables users to calculate the relative position between two nodes with less error. We have carried out different experiments to illustrate the advantages of fusing IMU and UWB ranges for relative positioning systems. We have achieved a mean accuracy of 0.31 m for 3D relative positioning in indoor line of sight conditions.

AB This paper implies a prototype for a broad-band log periodic dipole antenna (LPDA) with dimensions of 20 x 40 x 0.508 mm(3) equipped with directors. The LPDA is based on Roger's RT5880 with epsilon r = 2.2. The 4-arms with alternative stubs constitute the LPDA, which is evenly spaced on both lines. At the substrate's back, the 50 omega main feeder line is placed on partial ground. The directors are also incorporated and studied in a regular matrix at a predetermined distance to improve gain, further reduce side lobes, and widen the frequency band. The performance of the antenna covers a wide spectrum of millimeter waves ranging from 26 up to 44 GHz. The realized gain for the antenna is 8.97, 11.96, 13.96, and 14.29 dB at 28 GHz, 35 GHz, 38 GHz, and 43 GHz, respectively. The total gain is 14.29 dB as a peak gain. The antenna was designed and tested for 5G communication applications in autonomous vehicles, and the design cost for the antenna is low in comparison to dielectric lenses. The model exhibits symmetrical radiation patterns for the antenna range. The results of the simulations and the testing of the implemented antenna elements coincide quite well. The proposed design outperforms earlier work in this field.

AB Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) micro-mirrors have shown great potential in consumer applications, such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) devices and portable laser projectors. The LiDAR based on electromagnetic MEMS micro-mirror is usually exposed to vibration loads for autonomous vehicles, which results in the necessity for the destructive reliability assessment of micromirrors under vibration environment, but such studies are rarely reported. This paper explores the destructive reliability of electromagnetic MEMS micromirror under vibration environment according to the JESD22-B103B standard. The reliability evaluation is conducted by experimental tests, finite element stress analysis and theoretical dynamic response analysis. Micromirrors are tested under sweep excitation, and they are failed with the vibration level of around 33 g. The failure and stress analysis demonstrate that the crack fracture is located at the root of the slow axis. The nonlinear relationship between the peak displacement of the balance frame and acceleration levels is investigated through theoretical analysis. The nonlinearity of stiffness hardening is induced by the axial tensile strain of the beam, which contributes to the displacement-reduction of the gimbal. This work provides some valuable suggestions for the optimization design of MEMS micromirrors to improve the acceleration tolerance level in vibration environment.

AB Digital servitization (DS) enabled by the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is essential for securing long-term competitiveness in manufacturing. The literature identifies the need for developing data models for multichannel communications across IIoT devices that fulfil the DS vision. This is crucial for avoiding isolated systems based on proprietary solutions and for promoting data sharing and interoperability across existing and future DS applications. Accordingly, this study proposes a data model for multichannel communication that facilitates IIoT-enabled DS for smart production logistics (SPL). We present three findings from a case study focussing on material handling in a manufacturing company. First, this study provides a model with four modelling profiles, including IIoT devices, databases, and services for multichannel communication. Second, it shows how the proposed modelling profiles transfer information across monitoring, control, optimisation, and autonomous decision services. Third, it presents the operational benefits of applying the proposed data models, including improvements in the delivery, makespan, and energy of material handling. These findings are essential for capturing, processing, and transferring information across products, services, and software databases in IIoT-enabled DS for SPL. They are relevant for manufacturing managers and academics and improve our understanding of IIoT-enabled DS's deployment for SPL in manufacturing.

AB Traffic sign detection (TRD) is an essential component of advanced driver-assistance systems and an important part of autonomous vehicles, where the goal is to localize image regions that contain traffic signs. Over the last decade, the amount of research on traffic sign detection and recognition has significantly increased. Although TRD is a built-in feature in modern cars and several methods have been proposed, it is a challenging problem due to the high computational demand, the large number of traffic signs, complex traffic scenes, and occlusions. In addition, it is not clear how can we perform real-time traffic sign detection in embedded systems. In this paper, we focus on image enhancement, which is the first step of many object detection methods. We propose an improved probability-model-based image enhancement method for traffic sign detection. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method, we compared it with other widely used image enhancement approaches in traffic sign detection. The experimental results show that our method increases the performance of object detection. In combination with the Selective Search object proposal algorithm, the average detection accuracies were 98.64% and 99.1% on the GTSDB and Swedish Traffic Signs datasets. In addition, its relatively low computational cost allows for its usage in embedded systems.

AB With the ability of providing direct and accurate enough range measurements, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is playing an essential role in localization and detection for autonomous vehicles. Since single LiDAR suffers from hardware failure and performance degradation intermittently, we present a multi-LiDAR integration scheme in this article. Our framework tightly couples multiple non-repetitive scanning LiDARs with inertial, wheel encoder, and real-time kinematic (RTK) into pose estimation and simultaneous global map generation. Primarily, we formulate a precise synchronization strategy to integrate isolated sensors, and the extracted feature points from separate LiDARs are merged into a single sweep. The fused scans are introduced to compute the scan-matching correspondences, which can be further refined by additional RTK measurements. Based thereupon, we construct a factor graph along with the inertial preintegration result, estimated ground constraints, and RTK data. For the purpose of maintaining a restricted number of poses for estimation, we deploy a keyframe based sliding-window optimization strategy in our system. The real-time performance is guaranteed with multi-threaded computation, and extensive experiments are conducted in challenging scenarios. Experimental results show that the utilization of multiple LiDARs boosts the system performance in both robustness and accuracy.

AB This paper presents a unified optimization-based path planning approach to efficiently compute locally optimal solutions to optimal path planning problems in unstructured environments. The approach is motivated by showing that a lattice-based planner can be cast and analyzed as a bilevel optimization problem. This insight is used to integrate a lattice-based planner and an optimal control-based method in a novel way. The lattice-based planner is applied to the problem in a first step using a discretized search space. In a second step, an optimal control-based method is applied using the lattice-based solution as an initial iterate. In contrast to prior work, the system dynamics and objective function used in the first step are chosen to coincide with those used in the second step. As an important consequence, the lattice planner provides a solution which is highly suitable as a warm-start to the optimal control step. This proposed combination makes, in a structured way, benefit of sampling-based methods ability to solve combinatorial parts of the problem and optimal control-based methods ability to obtain locally optimal solutions. Compared to previous work, the proposed approach is shown in simulations to provide significant improvements in terms of computation time, numerical reliability and objective function value.

AB Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) brings the benefits of cloud computing, such as computation, networking, and storage resources, close to end users, thus reducing end-to-end latency and enabling various novel use cases, such as vehicle platooning, autonomous driving, and the tactile internet. However, frequent user mobility makes it challenging for the MEC to guarantee the close proximity to the users. To tackle this challenge, the underlying network has to be capable of seamlessly migrating applications between multiple MEC sites. This application migration requires the quick and flexible migration of the application states without service interruption, while minimizing the state transfer cost. In this article, we first study the state transfer optimization problem in the MEC. To solve this problem, we propose a metaheuristic algorithm based on Tabu search. We then propose Flexible and Low-Latency State Transfer in Mobile Edge Computing (FAST), the first programmable state forwarding framework. FAST flexibly and directly forwards states between source instance and destination instance based on Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Both simulation results and practical testbed results demonstrate the favorable performance of the proposed Tabu search algorithm and the FAST framework compared to the state-of-the-art schemes.

AB Extraction of raw materials, especially in extremely harsh underground mine conditions, is irrevocably associated with high risk and probability of accidents. Natural hazards, the use of heavy-duty machines, and other technologies, even if all perfectly organized, may result in an accident. In such critical situations, rescue actions may require advanced technologies as autonomous mobile robot, various sensory system including gas detector, infrared thermography, image acquisition, advanced analytics, etc. In the paper, we describe several scenarios related to rescue action in underground mines with the assumption that searching for sufferers should be done considering potential hazards such as seismic, gas, high temperature, etc. Thus, possibilities of rescue team activities in such areas may be highly risky. This work reports the results of testing of a UGV robotic system in an underground mine developed in the frame of the AMICOS project. The system consists of UGV with a sensory system and image processing module that are based on an adaptation of You Only Look Once (YOLO) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithms. The experiment was very successful; human detection efficiency was very promising. Future work will be related to test the AMICOS technology in deep copper ore mines.

AB Deep learning is revolutionizing many aspects of our society, addressing a wide variety of decision-making tasks, from image classification to autonomous vehicle control. Matrix multiplication is an essential and computationally intensive step of deep-learning calculations. The computational complexity of deep neural networks requires dedicated hardware accelerators for additional processing throughput and improved energy efficiency in order to enable scaling to larger networks in the upcoming applications. Silicon photonics is a promising platform for hardware acceleration due to recent advances in CMOS-compatible manufacturing capabilities, which enable efficient exploitation of the inherent parallelism of optics. This article provides a detailed description of recent implementations in the relatively new and promising platform of silicon photonics for deep learning. Opportunities for multiwavelength microring silicon photonic architectures codesigned with field-programmable gate array (FPGA) for pre- and postprocessing are presented. The detailed analysis of a silicon photonic integrated circuit shows that a codesigned implementation based on the decomposition of large matrix-vector multiplication into smaller instances and the use of nonnegative weights could significantly simplify the photonic implementation of the matrix multiplier and allow increased scalability. We conclude this article by presenting an overview and a detailed analysis of design parameters. Insights for ways forward are explored.

AB As the smartphone market becomes saturated, an innovative device equipped with new features is expected to appear soon in mobile communications. In particular, various possibilities were raised regarding the alternative technologies that can develop post-smartphones, which are differentiated from the current smartphones, as Korea commercialized the 5G infrastructure for the first time in the world. Under these circumstances, the Korean government announced the "5G+ Strategy for Realizing Innovative Growth" in April 2019, vowing to build an innovative industrial ecosystem quickly while creating various convergence services based on the 5G infrastructure. As described above, the policy importance of the alternative technologies that will develop post-smartphones is increasing, but the theoretical study on the technology evolution of post-smartphones has not been systematically conducted until now. This study reviewed the alternative technologies that can develop post-smartphones through documentary research, and data mining analysis was performed on the research result using actual data. The policy priority was also set quantitatively for the alternative technologies of post-smartphones in order to determine the alternative post-smartphone technology that the government should focus on given the constraint of limited resources. As a results, autonomous vehicle(43.68%) was found to be most important, followed by artificial intelligence(17.4%) and Internet of Things(13.1%), among alternative technologies that could develop into the post-smartphone.

AB Collision detection and avoidance are vital sub-tasks in any autonomous robotic task. This work presents a technique that guarantees collision avoidance in an environment containing multiple agents. These agents can be of different types such as static, dynamic obstacles and other robots. The technique supports parallel implementation and is appropriate for real-time applications. In this work, the theory of interval arithmetic is used to represent the pose of agents as intervals in a fixed time period. Geometrically, the intervals correspond to finite-length arcs and line-segments. Theoretical results on the inclusion of one interval, in another interval, in terms of sub-intervals are derived. Breaking down the problem in sub-intervals supports parallelism in performing multiple interval inclusion tests and in handling multiple agents. The proposed interval-arithmetic based framework leads directly to a hardware-efficient collision detection scheme. In particular, the proposed strategy admits a solution even for a dynamic environment using just shift and add capability, an important aspect for embedded implementation. The solution of interval inclusion is also used to find a set of solutions for guaranteed collision avoidance with multiple agents with known or unknown trajectories. Simulation results in MATLAB and experiments with an FPGA-driven differential drive mobile robot demonstrate the versatility of the proposed approach.

AB At present, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) cannot perceive local environments in complex marine environments, where fish can obtain hydrodynamic information about the surrounding environment through a lateral line. Inspired by this biological function, an artificial lateral line system (ALLS) was built on a moving bionic carrier using the pressure sensor in this paper. When the carrier operated with different speeds in the flow field, the pressure distribution characteristics surrounding the carrier were analyzed by numerical simulation, where the effect of the flow angle between the fluid velocity direction and the carrier navigation direction was considered. The flume experiment was carried out in accordance with the simulation conditions, and the analysis results of the experiment were consistent with those in the simulation. The relationship between pressure and fluid velocity was established by a fitting method. Subsequently, the pressure difference method was investigated to establish a relationship model between the pressure difference on both sides of the carrier and the flow angle. Finally, a back propagation neural network model was used to predict the fluid velocity, flow angle, and carrier speed successfully in the unknown fluid environment. The local fluid environment perception by moving carrier carrying ALLS was studied which may promote the engineering application of the artificial lateral line in the local perception, positioning, and navigation on AUVs.

AB The shipborne manipulator plays an important role in autonomous collaboration between marine vehicles. In real applications, a conventional proportional-derivative (PD) controller is not suitable for the shipborne manipulator to conduct safe and accurate operations under ocean conditions, due to its bad tracing performance. This paper presents a real-time and adaptive control approach for the shipborne manipulator to achieve position control. This novel control approach consists of a conventional PD controller and fuzzy neural network (FNN), which work in parallel to realize PD+FNN control. Qualitative and quantitative tests of simulations and real experiments show that the proposed PD+FNN controller achieves better performance in comparison with the conventional PD controller, in the presence of uncertainty and disturbance. The presented PD+FNN eliminates the requirements for precise tuning of the conventional PD controller under different ocean conditions, as well as an accurate dynamics model of the shipborne manipulator. In addition, it effectively implements a sliding mode control (SMC) theory-based learning algorithm, for fast and robust control, which does not require matrix inversions or partial derivatives. Furthermore, simulation and experimental results show that the angle compensation deviation of the shipborne manipulator can be improved in the range of +/- 1 degrees.

DE Detection and recognition of road markings; arrows and bike markings;
   vanishing point; deep CNN; NVIDIA Jetson TX2 embedded system
AB The accurate detection and classification of road markings is required for autonomous vehicles. There have been several previous studies on the detection of road lane markings, but the detection and classification of arrows and bike markings has not received much attention. There exists previous research on the detection and classification of arrows and bike markings, but they comprise a performance limitation owing to the use of the entire input image. Therefore, our approach is focused on enhancing the performance of the detection and classification of arrows and bike markings based on the adaptive region of interest (ROI) and deep convolutional neural network (CNN). In the first stage, a vanishing point is detected in order to create the ROI image. The ROI image that covers the majority of the road region is then used as the input to train the CNN-based detector and classifier in the second stage. The proposed approach is evaluated using three open datasets, namely, the Cambridge dataset, Daimler dataset, and Malaga urban dataset on a desktop computer and NVIDIA Jetson TX2 embedded system. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in recognition performance even with small road markings at a large distance.

ID INFORMATION
AB Most applications of underwater cyber-physical system (UCPS) demand reliable data collection in an efficient and timely manner. However, the energy-constrained characteristic on acoustic communication makes it challenging to collect data. In this paper, we study the energy-efficient data collection for UCPS over autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) assisted underwater acoustic sensor network. The sensor nodes perceive local physical parameters, whose lifetime is strictly restricted by local power. The AUV that has relatively sufficient energy is adopted to retrieve data from sensor nodes. To balance energy consumption and prolong underwater network lifetime, the energy optimization problem is formulated as minimizing the sum of edge lengths of a particular graph. Then, a min-weighted rigid graph based topology optimization scheme is developed for sensor deployment. With the optimized network topology, a local routing decision algorithm is developed for each sensor node to relay the collected data to the data collectors (sinks). A dynamic value-based path planning strategy is also designed for the AUV to dynamically visit data collectors to maximize the value of information (VoI) within a given time. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the network lifetime with the topology optimization scheme can be prolonged, and the dynamic value-based path planning strategy can improve the VoI on AUV.

AB Various recent events in the Mediterranean sea have shown the enormous importance of maritime search-and-rescue missions. By reducing the time to find floating victims, the number of casualties can be reduced. A major improvement can be achieved by employing unmanned aerial systems for autonomous search missions. In this context, the need for efficient search trajectory planning methods arises. Existing approaches either consider K-step-lookahead optimization without accounting for kinematics of fixed wing platforms or propose a suboptimal myopic method. A few approaches consider both aspects, however only applicable to stationary target search. The contribution of this article consists of a novel method for Markovian target search-trajectory optimization. This is a unified method for fixed-wing and rotary wing platforms, taking kinematical constraints into account. It can be classified as K-step-lookahead planning method, which allows for anticipation to the estimated future position and motion of the target. The method consists of a mixed integer linear program that optimizes the cumulative probability of detection. We show the applicability and effectiveness in computational experiments for three types of moving targets: diffusing, conditionally deterministic, and Markovian. This approach is the first K-step-lookahead method for Markovian target search under kinematical constraints. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present a parallelized navigation architecture that is capable of running in real-time and incorporating long-term loop closure constraints while producing the optimal Bayesian solution. This architecture splits the inference problem into a low-latency update that incorporates new measurements using just the most recent states (filter), and a high-latency update that is capable of closing long loops and smooths using all past states (smoother). This architecture employs the probabilistic graphical models of factor graphs, which allows the low-latency inference and high-latency inference to be viewed as sub-operations of a single optimization performed within a single graphical model. A specific factorization of the full joint density is employed that allows the different inference operations to be performed asynchronously while still recovering the optimal solution produced by a full batch optimization. Due to the real-time, asynchronous nature of this algorithm, updates to the state estimates from the high-latency smoother will naturally be delayed until the smoother calculations have completed. This architecture has been tested within a simulated aerial environment and on real data collected from an autonomous ground vehicle. In all cases, the concurrent architecture is shown to recover the full batch solution, even while updated state estimates are produced in real-time.

AB Linear, hummocky pillow mound volcanism dominates at slow and intermediate spreading rate mid-ocean ridges. Volcanic hummocks are thought to be formed by low effusion rates or as a result of flow focussing during effusive fissure style eruptions in which the initial dike intercepts the seafloor and erupts along its entire length. In this study, high-resolution autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) bathymetry is used to accurately map the extents of four historical fissure eruptions of the Juan de Fuca and Gorda ridges: on the North Gorda, North Cleft, and CoAxial ridge segments. The four mapped eruptions take the form of pillow mounds, which are similar in both lithology and dimension to hummocks on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Pillow mounds may be isolated, or coalesce to form composite mounds, aligned as ridges or as clustered groups. In three of the four mapped sites, the eruptions were discontinuous along their lengths, with pillow mounds and composite mounds commonly separated by areas of older seafloor. This style of discontinuous eruption is inconsistent with typical en echelon fissure eruptions and is probably due to a mildly overpressured, fingering dike intersecting the seafloor along parts of its length.

AB A collision-avoidance (CA) algorithm is developed and implemented that is applicable to many different unmanned aerial systems (UAS), ranging from a single platform with the ability to perform all collision-avoidance functions independently to multiple vehicles performing functions as a cooperative group with collision-avoidance commands computed at a ground station. The algorithm leverages advances in several theoretical fields, including robotics, homing guidance, and airspace management, and considers several approaches to conflict detection and resolution, including the collision cone approach. The collision-avoidance system is exercised and tested by using operational hardware and platforms. Novel developments by using an aggregated collision cone approach allow each unmanned aircraft to detect and avoid collisions with two or more other aircraft simultaneously. The collision-avoidance system is implemented by using a miniature unmanned aircraft with an onboard autopilot. Various simulation and flight test cases are used to demonstrate the algorithm's robustness to different collision encounters at various engagement angles. The flight test results are compared with ideal, software-in-the-loop, and hardware-in-the-loop tests.

AB Thousands of tonnes of litter enter the ocean every day, posing a significant threat to marine life and ecosystems. While floating and beach litter are often in the spotlight, about 70% of marine litter eventually sinks to the seafloor, making underwater litter the largest accumulation of marine litter that often goes undetected. Plastic debris makes up the majority of ocean litter and is a known source of microplastics in the ocean. This paper focuses on the detection of ocean plastic using neural network models. Two neural network models will be trained, i.e., YOLACT and the Mask R-CNN, for the instance segmentation of underwater litter in images. The models are trained on the TrashCAN dataset, using pre-trained model weights trained using COCO. The trained neural network could achieve a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.377 and 0.365 for the Mask R-CNN and YOLACT, respectively. The lightweight nature of YOLACT allows it to detect images at up to six times the speed of the Mask R-CNN, while only making a comparatively smaller trade-off in terms of performance. This allows for two separate applications: YOLACT for the collection of litter using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and the Mask R-CNN for surveying litter distribution.

AB This paper considers the situation where a small satellite shall autonomously rendezvous with a tumbling object in a circular low Earth orbit (LEO) and derives a path-based model predictive controller that uses the docking point state and position of the chaser to guide it to a safe docking autonomously. The strategy embeds collision avoidance elements and reduces the computational effort for calculating the pulses to be provided by the thrusters through opportune algebraic manipulations, a Runge-Kutta 4 propagation method using linearized state transition matrices, and implicit embedding of dynamically equivalent thrust models, leading to constant state propagation matrices. Furthermore, the inputs design optimization problem and the embedded collision avoidance scheme are modeled and explicitly crafted as convex problems, contributing positively to low computational requirements. The docking and collision avoidance capabilities of the proposed scheme are extensively tested in an environment that accounts for all the perturbations relevant to LEO frameworks, for realistic thrust schemes, and for uncertainties in the measurement. Numerical results assess which tumbling objects can be docked or not by means of the proposed schemes as a function of the tumbling rates versus the thrust capabilities and hardware uncertainty of the docker.

AB Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning system that allows a network of devices to train a model without centralized data. This characteristic makes FL an ideal choice for machine learning using user data while maintaining privacy. Many applications, such as autonomous vehicles that adapt to pedestrian behavior and smart healthcare devices, require machine learning to be performed in edge computing environments. However, the performance of FL in edge computing environments has received limited research attention, and previous studies have not comprehensively evaluated heterogeneity aspects, such as system heterogeneity, statistical heterogeneity, and communication bandwidth. This study aims to fill this research gap by conducting experimental evaluations and detailed analyses of FL in edge computing environments. Specifically, we set up an experimental testbed based on the FL framework on the KubeEdge platform and evaluate the diverse effects of heterogeneity aspects on the model convergence time such as homogeneous versus heterogeneous hardware resources, balanced versus imbalanced data distributions, duplicate versus nonduplicate datasets, client participation ratio at each round, the client selection algorithm, and the communication bandwidth. Overall, this study contributes to the advancement of the field of FL by expanding the understanding of its performance in edge computing environments and providing guidelines for efficient and effective FL systems in heterogeneous environments, which can ultimately benefit various industries and domains.

AB The advancing applications based on machine learning and deep learning in communication networks have been exponentially increasing in the system architectures of enabled software-defined networking, network functions virtualization, and other wired/wireless networks. With data exposure capabilities of graph-structured network topologies and underlying data plane information, the state-of-the-art deep learning approach, graph neural networks (GNN), has been applied to understand multi-scale deep correlations, offer generalization capability, improve the accuracy metrics of prediction modelling, and empower state representation for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents in future intelligent network management and orchestration. This paper contributes a taxonomy of recent studies using GNN-based approaches to optimize the control policies, including offloading strategies, routing optimization, virtual network function orchestration, and resource allocation. The algorithm designs of converged DRL and GNN are reviewed throughout the selected studies by presenting the state generalization, GNN-assisted action selection, and reward valuation cooperating with GNN outputs. We also survey the GNN-empowered application deployment in the autonomous control of optical networks, Internet of Healthcare Things, Internet of Vehicles, Industrial Internet of Things, and other smart city applications. Finally, we provide a potential discussion on research challenges and future directions.

AB Purpose This paper aims to design the fractional order sliding mode controller for highly maneuverable remote piloted unmanned aircraft with time-varying delays. Design/methodology/approach With the assumption that the time-varying delays are bounded and identical for different outputs, an observer-based control technique is implied which reformulates the state variables based on the system model and delayed outputs. The estimated state variables are fed as feedback into the controller. Based on the delayed output observer, a fractional order sliding mode controller is designed. Further, the stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed and asymptotical convergence is realized using Lyapunov-Razumikhin theorem. Findings The simulation is done in Matlab and Simulink. The parametric variations and trajectory tracking results are illustrated which looks propitious. Practical implications In practical operation, measurement signal is often delayed, which significantly degrade the control performance or even disturb the stability. It is emphasized to choose attitude as the evaluation indicator for unmanned aerial vehicle time delay. Originality/value A novel fractional order sliding mode control technique is designed to enhance the trajectory tracking, thus autonomous flight performance, of the aircraft system. Also, the main idea behind this novel procedure is formulated for minimizing the parametric variations in presence of time delays.

AB Power supply for underwater devices such as vehicles, sensors and autonomous systems is an important factor which limits their practical application. Solar energy is a promising energy source but high-efficient solar cells on land cannot maintain their original superiority for the change of underwater solar irradiance caused by absorption and scattering in water. Here, we investigate the solar irradiance for water with different clarity and discuss the potential applications of different materials in underwater photovoltaic cells. By calculating and comparing the device performance of underwater solar cells (UWSCs) with different bandgap, it is demonstrated that wide bandgap (1.8 eV-2.3 eV) inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) have significant advantages for underwater applications due to its outstanding photoelectric properties and suitable range of bandgap. The IPSCs can obtain the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 41.9% and power density of 3.11 mW/cm2 at the depth of 50 m in water, which is obviously higher than silicon solar cells. No matter what types of water we choose, the optimal bandgap of UWSC's active layer get wider with the increasing of water depth and the wide bandgap inorganic perovskites with 2.0-2.2 eV is an optimal choice. Our work reveals the significance of IPSCs in underwater photovoltaic applications.

ID ASSIGNMENT; FEATURES
AB Multi-subject tracking in crowded videos is an established yet challenging research direction in computer vision and information processing. High applicability of multi-subject tracking is demonstrated in smart cities (e.g., public safety, crowd management, urban planning), autonomous driving vehicles, robotic vision, or psychology (e.g., social interaction and crowd behavior understanding). In this work, we propose a real-time approach that reveals tracks of subjects in ordinary videos, captured in highly populated pedestrian areas, such as squares, malls, and stations. The tracks are discovered based on the proximity of detected bounding boxes of subjects in consecutive video frames. The reduction of track fragmentation and identity switching is achieved by the re-identification phase that uses caching of unassociated detections and mutual projection of interrupted tracks. As the proposed approach does not require time-consuming extraction of appearance-based features, the superior tracking speed is achieved. In addition, we demonstrate tracker usability and applicability by extracting valuable information about body-joint positions from discovered tracks, which opens promising possibilities for detecting human relationships and interactions. We demonstrate accurate detection of couples based on their holding hand activity and families based on children's body proportions. The discovery of these entitative groups is especially challenging in crowded city scenes where many subjects appear in each frame.

ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE; NAVIGATION
AB The paper presents an adaptive dynamic window approach (DWA) for mobile robot dynamic obstacles avoidance optimized utilizing a fuzzy logic controller. Most of the present work on autonomous navigation in dynamic environments does not take into account the dynamics of the obstacles. One of the methods used in research today for dynamic obstacles avoidance is the dynamic window approach. The (DWA) is a well-known navigation scheme. One problem facing the DWA is how to optimize the weights of its objective function to allow the robot to move towards the goal while avoiding collisions in all environments. The main contribution of this paper is to build an intelligent system that will be able to optimize the objective function weights of the dynamic window to make it more resilient to changes and moves as fast as possible towards the goal using fuzzy logic system. The proposed new adaptive controller was able to reduce the failure rate of the DWA from 20% to only five per cent in static environments, and maintain more than 60% success rate in dynamic environments with up to 25 obstacles/100 m2, on the other hand the basic algorithm was failing to less than 50% with 15 obstacles/100 m2.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are autonomous devices employed as data collectors in precision agriculture to support a large number of applications. These UAVs gather data from on-the-ground wireless sensor networks, especially in scenarios that lack any kind of fixed communication infrastructure or where the available infrastructure does not fit the application requirements. Sensors on the ground can store sensing data, and in scenarios that do not require a real-time observation and analysis of the data, like in smart farming, a drone can be used maybe once or two times each day to collect and report the data to a command-and-control center that use them directly, without any other infrastructure (cloud or edges). In this article, we study analytically how close the drone, that uses a LoRa radio, needs to fly over the sensors to collect data with a given quality of data collection. This can be used to properly spacing the sensors on the field at deployment time, to select among different type of drones, and to properly solve some tradeoff related to field size vs autonomy of the drones and the path used by the latter when collecting the data.

AB Seafloor massive sulfide deposits form in remote environments, and the assessment of deposit size and composition through drilling is technically challenging and expensive. To aid the evaluation of the resource potential of seafloor massive sulfide deposits, three-dimensional inverse modeling of geophysical potential field data (magnetic and gravity) collected near the seafloor can be carried out to further enhance geologic models interpolated from sparse drilling. Here, we present inverse modeling results of magnetic and gravity data collected from the active mound at the Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse hydrothermal vent field, located at 26 degrees 08 ' N on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, using autonomous underwater vehicle and submersible surveying. Both minimum-structure and surface geometry inverse modeling methods were utilized. Through deposit-scale magnetic modeling, the outer extent of a chloritized alteration zone within the basalt host rock below the mound was resolved, providing an indication of the angle of the rising hydrothermal fluid and the depth and volume of seawater/hydrothermal mixing zone. The thickness of the massive sulfide mound was determined by modeling the gravity data, enabling the tonnage of the mound to be estimated at 2.17 +/- 0.44 Mt through this geophysics-based, noninvasive approach.

AB Pedestrian detection is a crucial task in intelligent transportation systems, which can be applied in autonomous vehicles and traffic scene video surveillance systems. The past few years have witnessed much progress on the research of pedestrian detection methods, especially through the successful use of the deep learning based techniques. However, occlusion and large scale variation remain the challenging issues for pedestrian detection. In this work, we propose a Part-Aware Multi-Scale Fully Convolutional Network (PAMS-FCN) to tackle these difficulties. Specifically, we present a part-aware Region-of-Interest (RoI) pooling module to mine body parts with different responses, and select the part with the strongest response via voting. As such, a partially visible pedestrian instance can receive a high detection confidence score, making it less likely to become a missing detection. This module operates in parallel with an instance RoI pooling module to combine local parts and global context information. To handle vast scale variation, we construct a fully convolutional network in which multi-scale feature maps are generated efficiently, and small-scale and large-scale pedestrians are detected separately. By integrating these structures, the proposed detector achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the Caltech, KITTI, INRIA and ETH pedestrian detection datasets.

AB The recent emergence of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies in mission-critical applications in the maritime industry has led to the introduction of the Internet-of-Ships (IoS) paradigm. IoS is a novel application domain of IoT that refers to the network of smart interconnected maritime objects, which can be any physical device or infrastructure associated with a ship, a port, or the transportation itself, with the goal of significantly boosting the shipping industry toward improved safety, efficiency, and environmental sustainability. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of the IoS paradigm, its architecture, its key elements, and its main characteristics. Furthermore, we review the state of the art for its emerging applications, including safety enhancements, route planning and optimization, collaborative decision making, automatic fault detection and preemptive maintenance, cargo tracking, environmental monitoring, energy-efficient operations, and automatic berthing. Finally, the presented open challenges and future opportunities for research in the areas of satellite communications, security, privacy, maritime data collection, data management, and analytics, provide a road map toward optimized maritime operations and autonomous shipping.

DT Article
ID HISTORY
AB The first aerial photography trials in Canada took place at Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1882 and 1883. They are attributed to an Englishman, Captain Henry Elsdale (1842-1900) of the Royal Engineers Corps. He experimented with a lightweight camera and a small, tethered balloon to successfully acquire a series of vertical aerial photographs of the Citadel Hill area of Halifax. The concept of miniaturization of his apparatus and its skillful airborne deployment is echoed some 130 years later in the proliferation of unassisted aerial vehicles and aerial imaging. This paper addresses three aspects. The first includes an appreciation of Elsdale as an early leader of aerial photography and related experimental activities involving a semi-autonomous airborne device. His original documentation of the effort, including scope, technical challenge and outcome, establish him as a remote-sensing protagonist who clearly anticipated the utility of vertical aerial imaging. The second aspect focuses on the examination of locale and content of the 1883 aerial photography and a comparison with contemporary geo-spatial representations of Halifax. Finally, documentation and outcome of those air photo experiments are reviewed in the context of similar efforts in Europe and North America, ascertaining the strikingly modern vision of Henry Elsdale to innovate surveillance practices for military and civilian application.

AB In this paper, we present a hybrid visual inertial navigation algorithm for an autonomous and intelligent vehicle that combines the multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) with the nonlinear visual-inertial graph optimization. The MSCKF is a well-known visual inertial odometry (VIO) method that performs the fusion between an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and the image measurements within a sliding window. The MSCKF computes the re-projection errors from the camera measurements and the states in the sliding window. During this process, the structure-only estimation is performed without exploiting the full information over the window, like the relative interstate motion constraints and their uncertainties. The key contribution of this paper is combination of the filtering and non-linear optimization method for VIO, and the design of a novel measurement model that exploits all of the measurements and information available within the sliding window. The local visual-inertial optimization is performed using pre-integrated IMU measurements and camera measurements. It infers the probabilistically optimal relative pose constraints. These local optimal constraints are used to estimate the global states under the MSCKF framework. The proposed local-optimal-multi-state constraint Kalman filter is validated using a simulation data set, as well as publicly available real-world data sets generated from real-world urban driving experiments.

AB An automatic guidance and control system for the stationary operating mode of an agricultural Wide-Span Implement Carrier (WSIC) was developed and tested on a robotic experimental platform. Control algorithms for the parallel point-to-point tracking problem (forward point tracking and periodic operation process) were designed. Two robots were instrumented with a dual-rover Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning System, inertial measurement units, XBee-PRO wireless communication modules, and control processors. The experimental platform executes the control sequence in a master-slave cooperative manner. Results of the single point tracking experiments show that the designed velocity and steering angle control laws can effectively guide the robots from a start point to a target. The average and root-mean-square of the offset errors were less than 0.04 m for both the 2-m and 3-m implement width experiments. The lateral and orientation errors were less than 0.16 m and 11 degrees respectively. The sequential point-to-point tracking experiments confirmed the overall effectiveness of the point tracking control and the master-slave cooperative control. The motions of the master and slave robots were in good synchronization, which can permit high efficiency during autonomous WSIC operations.

AB The Cucker Smale (C-S) flocking model can be applied to design several mobile autonomous agent systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles and robot systems. In these applications, the problem of collision is usually a nonnegligible issue that should be addressed. In the literature, extra bonding/repulsive forces are added to solve the problem of collision. However, all the known results are limited to the symmetric coupling topology. In this paper, we address this problem under a group-hierarchical multileadership consisting of symmetric coupling topologies and the hierarchical leadership. We obtain the following three main results. First, we show that the augmented C-S model achieves asymptotic flocking provided, roughly, that the ratio between the rate of bounding force and communication rate is sufficiently large. Second, we prove that, for a given augmented C-S model, there exists a set of initial states, which can be explicitly described, such that their corresponding solutions maintain some minimum distance between them. Finally, we show that, for a given set of initial states, we can control the system so that its corresponding solution is collision free by suitably choosing bounding forces, which are independent of given initial states. This in turn suggests that the corresponding system can be collision free by having tolerance for error in their initial states.

AB Visual localization is widely used in autonomous navigation system and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). However, visual-based localization in seasonal changing situations is one of the most challenging topics in computer vision and the intelligent vehicle community. The difficulty of this task is related to the strong appearance changes that occur in scenes due to weather or season changes. In this paper, a place recognition based visual localization method is proposed, which realizes the localization by identifying previously visited places using the sequence matching method. It operates by matching query image sequences to an image database acquired previously (video acquired during traveling period). In this method, in order to improve matching accuracy, multi-feature is constructed by combining a global GIST descriptor and local binary feature CSLBP (Center-symmetric local binary patterns) to represent image sequence. Then, similarity measurement according to Chi-square distance is used for effective sequences matching. For experimental evaluation, the relationship between image sequence length and sequences matching performance is studied. To show its effectiveness, the proposed method is tested and evaluated in four seasons outdoor environments. The results have shown improved precision-recall performance against the state-of-the-art SeqSLAM algorithm.

AB We use autonomous underwater vehicles to characterize the spatial distribution of Upper Circumpolar Deep Water (UCDW) on the continental shelf of the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) and present the first near-synoptic measurements of mesoscale features (eddies) containing UCDW on the WAP. Thirty-three subsurface eddies with widths on the order of 10 km were detected during four glider deployments. Each eddy contributed an average of 5.8 x 10(16) J to the subpycnocline waters, where a cross-shelf heat flux of 1.37 x 10(19) J yr(-1) is required to balance the diffusive loss of heat to overlying winter water and to the near-coastal waters. Approximately two-thirds of the heat coming onto the shelf diffuses across the pycnocline and one-third diffuses to the coastal waters; long-term warming of the subpycnocline waters is a small residual of this balance. Sixty percent of the profiles that contained UCDW were part of a coherent eddy. Between 20% and 53% of the lateral onshore heat flux to the WAP can be attributed to eddies entering Marguerite Trough, a feature in the southern part of the shelf which is known to be an important conduit for UCDW. A northern trough is identified as additional important location for eddy intrusion.

AB Categorical landscapes are powerful environmental partitions that index complex biogeochemical processes that drive terrestrial species distributions. However, translating landscapes into seascapes requires that the dynamic nature of the fluid environment be reflected in spatial and temporal boundaries such that seascapes can be used in marine species distribution models and conservation decisions. A seascape product derived from satellite ocean colour and sea surface temperature partitioned mid-Atlantic coastal waters on scales commensurate with the Atlantic Sturgeon migration. The seascapes were then matched with acoustic telemetry records of Atlantic Sturgeon to determine seascape selectivity. To test for selectivity, we used real-time satellite seascape maps to normalize the sampling of an autonomous underwater vehicle that resampled similar geographic regions with time varying seascape classifications. Our findings suggest that Atlantic Sturgeon prefer one seascape class over those available in the coastal ocean, indicating selection for covarying environmental properties rather than geographical location. The recent listing of Atlantic Sturgeon as Endangered throughout much of their United States range has highlighted the need for improved understanding of marine habitat requirements to reduce interactions with anthropogenic stressors. Narrow dynamic migration corridors may enable seascapes to be used as a daily decision tool by industry and managers to reduce interactions with this imperilled species during coastal migrations.

AB Multi-tier shuttle warehousing systems are increasingly popular because of their high flexibility and robustness. These systems consist of a multi-tier shuttle sub-system that controls horizontal movement and a lift sub-system that manages vertical movement. The combination of shuttles and lifts undertakes inbound/outbound tasks instead of the stacker crane in conventional automated storage and retrieval systems. Scheduling different devices to reduce expected cycle time is an important concern. Thus, we propose a time sequence mathematical model of task operation on the basis of the movement characteristics of shuttles and lifts. The task scheduling problem between shuttles and lifts is converted into an assembly line parallel job problem by analysing the mathematical model, which generates the scheduling task queue model in the specified time window. In addition, a Pareto optimal based on an elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm is adopted to solve the multi-objective optimisation function in the task scheduling problem. Finally, we illustrate the findings of the study through a practical example. Results show that the optimisation scheduling solution can reduce the total lift idle time and the total shuttle waiting time. Furthermore, it can improve warehousing efficiency and lower operation costs.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Monocular SLAM has the potential to turn inexpensive cameras into powerful pose sensors for applications such as robotics and augmented reality. We present a relocalization module for such systems which solves some of the problems encountered by previous monocular SLAM systems-tracking failure, map merging, and loop closure detection. This module extends recent advances in keypoint recognition to determine the camera pose relative to the landmarks within a single frame time of 33 ms. We first show how this module can be used to improve the robustness of these systems. Blur, sudden motion, and occlusion can all cause tracking to fail, leading to a corrupted map. Using the relocalization module, the system can automatically detect and recover from tracking failure while preserving map integrity. Extensive tests show that the system can then reliably generate maps for long sequences even in the presence of frequent tracking failure. We then show that the relocalization module can be used to recognize overlap in maps, i.e., when the camera has returned to a previously mapped area. Having established an overlap, we determine the relative pose of the maps using trajectory alignment so that independent maps can be merged and loop closure events can be recognized. The system combining all of these abilities is able to map larger environments and for significantly longer periods than previous systems.

AB In this study, an automatic navigation land levelling system based on the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and an inertial navigation system (INS) was developed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of land levelling. The developed system platform was composed of an integrated positioning unit, steering and lifting controller, and vehicle control terminal. Automatic navigation land levelling vehicle terminal software was designed to realize data communication, processing and storage, and display. Through the cooperation of the platform and software, the system completed the automatic navigation terrain survey, automatic planning/ design and automatic navigation land levelling functions. In addition, a GNSS/INS integrated positioning method based on an adaptive square root cubature Kalman filter (ASRCKF) was designed, which obtained the correction positioning points of the tractor and scraper and adaptively predicted the state and measurement noise of the SRCKF. An automatic steering and lifting control method was designed to realize synchronous automatic navigation land levelling control, which was combined with the positioning method. Field experiments were carried out to validate the path tracking effect of the dynamic filtering navigation and a comparison of the manual and automatic land levelling operation performance. The navigation experimental results showed that the average root mean square error (RMSE) of the tractor and the scraper were 2.94 cm and 3.15 cm in tracking a straight path and 8.61 cm and 9.83 cm in tracking a curved path, respectively. The average RMSE of the path tracking based on the ASRCKF positioning method was reduced by 75.2% and 67.4% for the tractor and the scraper, respectively. The land levelling experimental results showed that the elevation distribution around the datum elevation of the automatic navigation land levelling increased by 8.7% compared to the manual operation. The GNSS/INS-based automatic navigation land levelling system can notably reduce the lateral position deviations, improve the control accuracy and land levelling efficiency, and meet the control accuracy requirements of unmanned tractor-scraper land levelling operations.

AB The modern urban environment is becoming more and more complex. In helping us identify surrounding objects, vehicle vision sensors rely more on the semantic segmentation ability of deep learning networks. The performance of a semantic segmentation network is essential. This factor will directly affect the comprehensive level of driving assistance technology in road environment perception. However, the existing semantic segmentation network has a redundant structure, many parameters, and low operational efficiency. Therefore, to reduce the complexity of the network and reduce the number of parameters to improve the network efficiency, based on the deep learning (DL) theory, a method for efficient image semantic segmentation using Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is deeply studied. First, the theoretical basis of the convolutional neural network (CNN) is briefly introduced, and the real-time semantic segmentation technology of urban scenes based on DCNN is recommended in detail. Second, the atrous convolution algorithm and the multi-scale parallel atrous spatial pyramid model are introduced. On the basis of this, an Efficient Symmetric Network (ESNet) of real-time semantic segmentation model for autonomous driving scenarios is proposed. The experimental results show that: (1) On the Cityscapes dataset, the ESNet structure achieves 70.7% segmentation accuracy for the 19 semantic categories set, and 87.4% for the seven large grouping categories. Compared with other algorithms, the accuracy has increased to varying degrees. (2) On the CamVid dataset, compared with segmentation networks of multiple lightweight real-time images, the parameters of the ESNet model are around 1.2 m, the highest FPS value is around 90 Hz, and the highest mIOU value is around 70%. In seven semantic categories, the segmentation accuracy of the ESNet model is the highest at around 98%. From this, we found that the ESNet significantly improves segmentation accuracy while maintaining faster forward inference speed. Overall, the research not only provides technical support for the development of real-time semantic understanding and segmentation of DCNN algorithms but also contributes to the development of artificial intelligence technology.

ID MODEL
AB Pedestrian trajectory prediction, which aims at predicting the future positions of all pedestrians in a crowd scene given their past trajectories, is the cornerstone of autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems. Accurate prediction and fast inference are both indispensable for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a stochastic non-autoregressive Transformer-based multi-modal trajectory prediction model to address the two challenges. Specifically, a novel graph attention module dedicated to joint learning of social and temporal interaction is proposed to explore the complex interaction among pedestrians while integrating sparse attention mechanism, pedestrian identity, and temporal order contained in the trajectory data. By doing so, the interaction across temporal and social dimensions can be simultaneously processed to extract abundant context features for prediction. Besides, to accelerate inference speed, we put forward a stochastic non-autoregressive Transformer model with multi-modal prediction capability where each future trajectory can be inferred in a parallel fashion, therefore, resulting in diverse trajectory predictions and less computational cost. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are performed to evaluate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model not only produces high prediction accuracy but also infers with fast speed. The code of the proposed method will be publicly available at https://github.com/xbchen82/SNARTF.

ID FIELDS
AB Modern 3D computer graphics technologies are able to reproduce the dynamics and appearance of real-world environments and phenomena, building on theoretical models in applied mathematics, statistics and physics. These methods are applied in architectural design and visualization, biological imaging and visual effects. Differentiable methods, instead, aim to determine how graphics outputs (that is, the real-world dynamics or appearance) change when the environment changes. We survey this growing body of work and propose a holistic and unified differentiable visual computing pipeline. Differentiable visual computing can be leveraged to efficiently solve otherwise intractable problems in physical inference, optimal control, object detection and scene understanding, computational design, manufacturing, autonomous vehicles and robotics. Any application that can benefit from an understanding of the underlying dynamics of the real world stands to benefit substantially from a differentiable graphics treatment. We draw parallels between the well-established computer graphics pipeline and a unified differentiable graphics pipeline, targeting consumers, practitioners and researchers. The breadth of fields that these pipelines draw upon-and are of interest to-includes the physical sciences, data sciences, vision and graphics, machine learning, and adjacent mathematical and computing communities.
   Traditionally, 3D graphics involves numerical methods for physical and virtual simulations of real-world scenes. Spielberg et al. review how deep learning enables differentiable visual computing, which determines how graphics outputs change when the environment changes, with applications in areas such as computer-aided design, manufacturing and robotics.

AB The intelligence and integrity of a real-time cyber-physical system depend on how trustworthy the data's legitimacy, appropriation, and authorization are during end-to-end communication between the participating nodes in its network. With the recurrent repugnant global violations of the airspace by drones and their derivatives, there is an urgent need to empirically evaluate the underlying security architectures that govern drone usage operations for priority logistics. This review examines the significant contribution of artificial intelligence models and blockchain to the development of trustworthy and reliable intelligent and secure autonomous systems by integrating cyberspace, intelligence space, and airspace security. PRISMA-SPIDER methodology was adopted for the systematic review of 133 articles based on the inclusion criteria consisting of 91 (68.4%) quantitative studies, 19 qualitative studies (14.2%), and 23 (17.3%) mixed method studies to balance article selection sensitivity and specificity. The review outcome shows a significant disconnect between model proposals and actual implementation. Through the incorporation of zero-trust architecture into the existing blockchain technology and the convergence of newer AI models, dynamic security issues like drone ownership authentication, drone package delivery verification, drone operation authorization, and drone jurisdiction accountability, can be achieved seamlessly for secure smart mobility via drone transportation systems.

AB Autonomous emergency landing capability of fixed-wing aircraft is essential for opening airspace for civil unmanned aviation. This article proposes a goal-oriented control scheme to exploit wind information for the benefit of forced landing. Different from general disturbances in a classic control system, a favorable wind would help aircraft to glide to a selected landing site more easily so increase the level of safety while an adverse wind may render a selected landing site infeasible. We formulate the forced landing problem with wind preview information in the framework of economic model predictive control (EMPC), which aims to maximize the aircraft's final altitude when reaching a target region. A double-layer model predictive control (MPC) scheme is adopted to lessen the computational burden and to increase the prediction time window for practical implementation, where a piecewise-constant disturbance-preview-based EMPC maximizes the altitude at the upper level, and a linear MPC is employed at the lower level to track the reference signal optimized by the upper-level planner. Moreover, the effectiveness of the goal-oriented optimal control scheme is illustrated by several case studies, where an unmanned aircraft is gliding toward potential landing sites under various conditions.

AB Autonomous robots are used to inspect, repair and maintain underwater assets. These tasks require energy-efficient robots, including efficient movement to extend available operational time. To examine the suitability of a propulsion system based on undulating fins, we built two robots with one and two fins, respectively, and conducted a parametric study for combinations of frequency, amplitude, wavenumber and fin shapes in free-swimming experiments, measuring steady-state swimming speed, power consumption and cost of transport. The following trends emerged for both robots. Swimming speed was more strongly affected by frequency than amplitude across the examined wavenumbers and fin heights. Power consumption was sensitive to frequency at low wavenumbers, and increasingly sensitive to amplitude at high wavenumbers. This increasing sensitivity of amplitude was more pronounced in tall rather than short fins. Cost of transport showed a complex relation with fin size and kinematics and changed drastically across the mapped parameter space. At equal fin kinematics as the single-finned robot, the double-finned robot swam slightly faster (>10%) with slightly lower power consumption (<20%) and cost of transport (<40%). Overall, the robots perform similarly to finned biological swimmers and other bio-inspired robots, but do not outperform robots with conventional propulsion systems.

AB With the development of automation technologies, autonomous robots are increasingly used in many important applications. However, precise self-navigation and accurate path planning remain a significant challenge, particularly for the robots operating in complex circumstances such as city centers. In this paper, a nonholonomically constrained robot with high-precision navigation and path planning capability was designed based on the Robot Operating System (ROS), and an improved hybrid A* algorithm was developed to increase the processing efficiency and accuracy of the global path planning and navigation of the robot. The performance and effectiveness of the algorithm were evaluated by using randomly constructed maps in MATLAB and validated in a practical circumstance. Local path planning and obstacle avoidance were carried out based on the model predictive control (MPC) theory. Compared with the conventional A* + DWA (dynamic window approach) method, the average searching time was reduced by 12.62 similar to 24.5%, and the average search length was reduced by 9.25 similar to 9.5%. In practical navigating tests, the average search time was reduced by 18 similar to 24%, and the average search length was reduced by 10.3 similar to 12%, while the overall path was smoother. The results demonstrate that the improved algorithm can enable precise and efficient navigation and path planning of the robot in complex circumstances.

AB Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) map is a powerful and detailed scene representation for intelligent vehicles that provides both the location and semantic information about nearby objects from a top-down perspective. BEV map generation is a complex multi-stage task, and the existing methods typically perform poorly for distant scenes. Thus, the authors introduce a novel multi-stage model that infers to obtain more accurate BEV map. First, the authors propose the Adaptive Aggregation with Stereo Mixture Density (AA-SMD) model, which is an improved stereo matching model that eliminates bleeding artefacts and provides more accurate depth estimation. Next, the authors employ the RGB-Depth (RGB-D) semantic segmentation model to improve the semantic segmentation performance and connectivity of their model. The depth map and semantic segmentation maps are then combined to create an incomplete BEV map. Finally, the authors propose a Multi Strip Pooling Unet (MSP-Unet) model with a hierarchical multi-scale (HMS) attention and strip pooling (SP) module to improve prediction with BEV generation. The authors evaluate their model with a Car Learn to Act (CARLA)-generated synthetic dataset. The experiment results demonstrate that the authors' model generates a highly accurate representation of the surrounding environment achieving a state-of-the-art result of 61.50% Mean Intersection-over-Union (MIoU) across eight classes.

AB Learning from demonstration (LfD) assists robots to derive a policy from a training set to execute a task. The training set consists of training demonstrations collected from a human who executes the same task. However, due to the human's varied skill level, the quality of the training set may be bad, which will affect the accuracy of the derived policy. To solve this problem, this article proposes a novel method to improve the quality of the training set. This method includes two steps, namely detecting and handling bad training demonstrations in the training set. In the detecting step, a reference set containing reference demonstrations is provided by a human teacher. Based on the reference set, we calculate the influence of each training demonstration on the policy derivation. If the influence is negative, the corresponding training demonstration is bad. Afterward, in the handling step, we calculate the proportion of the negative influence with respect to the overall influence and reduce the proportion by iteratively removing bad training demonstrations until it is less than a threshold. The results show that the accuracy of a policy derived from the improved training set increases with up to 19.30%, which verifies the effectiveness of our method.

AB Nowadays, the flurry of autonomous vehicles is in full swing regarding light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and depth perception. For such visual perception, light plays an important role. We human beings recognize and distinguish surrounding details when the eye focuses light on the retina. For the LiDAR system, pulsed lasers are employed to measure the relevant range. Thus, appropriate light sources with high performance are in urgent demand. Auspiciously, a revolutionary semiconductor laser technology, namely the photonic-crystal surface-emitting laser (PCSEL), emerges over the past two decades. PCSEL exhibits not only a symmetric beam profile with narrow beam divergence but also a high-power operation with controllability. Therefore, it may be the holy grail for an ultracompact time-of-flight (ToF) LiDAR system. Hereupon, comprehensive analyses of PCSEL-relevant scientific publications and patent documents are conducted. We thereby review the development progress of PCSEL technology. Moreover, a systematic simulation is performed, providing real-time visualization of relevant point clouds with different beam divergence. PCSEL technology with unprecedented merits indeed turns a new leaf and a paradigm shift in LiDAR application is ongoing. It is believed that a lens-free and adjustment-free ultracompact apparatus in simplicity can be expected.

AB Road segmentation in challenging domains, such as night, snow or rain, is a difficult task. Most current approaches boost performance using fine-tuning, domain adaptation, style transfer, or by referencing previously acquired imagery. These approaches share one or more of three significant limitations: a reliance on large amounts of annotated training data that can be costly to obtain, both anticipation of and training data from the type of environmental conditions expected at inference time, and/or imagery captured from a previous visit to the location. In this research, we remove these restrictions by improving road segmentation based on similar places. We use Visual Place Recognition (VPR) to find similar but geographically distinct places, and fuse segmentations for query images and these similar place priors using a Bayesian approach and novel segmentation quality metric. Ablation studies show the need to re-evaluate notions of VPR utility for this task. We demonstrate the system achieving state-of-the-art road segmentation performance across multiple challenging condition scenarios including night time and snow, without requiring any prior training or previous access to the same geographical locations. Furthermore, we show that this method is network agnostic, improves multiple baseline techniques and is competitive against methods specialised for road prediction.

TI Research on accurate modeling of hydrodynamic interaction forces on AUVs

   Hydrodynamic model
AB The hydrodynamic interaction force between autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operating in tandem can adversely affect the hydrodynamic prediction of individual AUVs and the formation control of the tandem fleet. Accurate modeling of hydrodynamic interaction forces is crucial to the model-based controller design of AUVs. In this paper, we innovatively propose a modeling method that can describe the hydrodynamic interaction relationship accurately and continuously (when the spacing between adjacent AUVs changes). First, an accurate hydrodynamic model for individual AUVs in tandem fleets is established by modifying the typical model through the consideration of memory effects. Second, a model of hydrodynamic interaction forces is derived by subtracting hydrodynamic forces acting on a single AUV operating independently from those acting on an AUV operating in tandem. To enable this model to continuously describe the hydrodynamic interaction relationship when the spacing changes, this model is further derived by taking the spacing as an independent variable based on the parameter conversion method. Finally, planar motion mechanism (PMM) tests are carried out using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method to verify the accuracy and continuity of the proposed modeling method. The results show that compared with the typical model, the average error of hydrodynamic forces predicted by the proposed model is reduced by 5.36%, which verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed modeling method.

AB In Extended Target Tracking, where estimating the shape is essential as kinematic, exploiting the dependencies between targets is often an excellent way to enhance performance. In a group of dependent targets, sampled features tend to have spatially and temporally correlations inside and between frames. Gaussian process regression has been used as a powerful Bayesian semi-supervised method to describe functions' spatial and temporal correlation. This paper exploits and models the dependency between extended targets using Gaussian Process. We propose a novel recursive approach called Multi-Output Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Process Kalman Filter (MO-STGP-KF) to estimate and track multiple dependent extended targets that have possibly been degraded or covered with clutter. We used this method for detecting and tracking the group of connected lane markings called ``lane-lines''. For detection and clustering, we propose a new Kernel-based Joint Probabilistic Data Association Coupled Filter (K-JPDACF) to cluster point features belonging to each lane-line. Compared to recently published model-based multi-lane tracking, semi-supervised, and fully supervised lane detection methods, our method shows 13 percent 34 percent and 20 percent improvement in accuracy, respectively.

AB Intelligent Transportation system are becoming an interesting research area, after Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensors have been effectively incorporated in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). The optimal route discovery in a VANET plays a vital role in establishing reliable communication in uplink and downlink direction. Thus, efficient optimal path discovery without a loop-free route makes network communication more efficient. Therefore, this challenge is addressed by nature-inspired optimization algorithms because of their simplicity and flexibility for solving different kinds of optimization problems. NIOAs are copied from natural phenomena and fall under the category of metaheuristic search algorithms. Optimization problems in route discovery are intriguing because the primary objective is to find an optimal arrangement, ordering, or selection process. Therefore, many researchers have proposed different kinds of optimization algorithm to maintain the balance between intensification and diversification. To tackle this problem, we proposed a novel Java macaque algorithm based on the genetic and social behavior of Java macaque monkeys. The behavior model mimicked from the Java macaque monkey maintains well-balanced exploration and exploitation in the search process. The experimentation outcome depicts the efficiency of the proposed Java macaque algorithm compared to existing algorithms such as discrete cuckoo search optimization (DCSO) algorithm, grey wolf optimizer (GWO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and genetic algorithm (GA).

AB In the implementation process of a convolution neural network (CNN)-based object detection system, the primary issues are power dissipation and limited throughput. Even though we utilize ultra-low power dissipation devices, the dynamic power dissipation issue will be difficult to resolve. During the operation of the CNN algorithm, there are several factors such as the heating problem generated from the massive computational complexity, the bottleneck generated in data transformation and by the limited bandwidth, and the power dissipation generated from redundant data access. This article proposes the low-power techniques, applies them to the CNN accelerator on the FPGA and ASIC design flow, and evaluates them on the Xilinx ZCU-102 FPGA SoC hardware platform and 45 nm technology for ASIC, respectively. Our proposed low-power techniques are applied at the register-transfer-level (RT-level), targeting FPGA and ASIC. In this article, we achieve up to a 53.21% power reduction in the ASIC implementation and saved 32.72% of the dynamic power dissipation in the FPGA implementation. This shows that our RTL low-power schemes have a powerful possibility of dynamic power reduction when applied to the FPGA design flow and ASIC design flow for the implementation of the CNN-based object detection system.

AB Synthetic nano/micromotors are a burgeoning class of materials with vast promise for applications ranging from environmental remediation to nanomedicine. The motility of these motors is generally controlled by the concentration of accessible fuel, and therefore, engineering speed-regulation mechanisms, particularly using biological triggers, remains a continuing challenge. Here, control over the movement of superassembled porous framework micromotors via a reversible, biological-relevant pH-responsive regulatory mechanism is demonstrated. Succinylated -lactoglobulin and catalase are superassembled in porous framework particles, where the -lactoglobulin is permeable at neutral pH. This permeability allows the fuel (H2O2) to access catalase, leading to autonomous movement of the micromotors. However, at mild acidic pH, succinylated -lactoglobulin undergoes a reversible gelation process, preventing the access of fuel into the micromotors where the catalase resides. To one's knowledge, this study represents the first example of chemically driven motors with rapid, reversible pH-responsive motility. Furthermore, the porous framework significantly enhances the biocatalytic activity of catalase, allowing ultralow H2O2 concentrations to be exploited at physiological conditions. It is envisioned that the simultaneous exploitation of pH and chemical potential of such nanosystems could have potential applications as stimulus-responsive drug delivery vehicles that benefit from the complex biological environment.

AB Advances in micro-electro mechanical system (MEMS) technology bring about revolutionary changes in autonomous vehicle navigation. As a new development, strap-down inertial navigation system (SINS) is effectively combined with global navigation satellite system (GNSS) to construct an integrated SINS/GNSS system. However, time-growing navigation error is the main challenge of using MEMS-grade inertial measurement unit (IMU) in the SINS/GNSS system. Failure of un-accounted inertial sensor error causes a rapid degradation in the overall performance of low-cost SINSs. This paper aims to enhance the long-term performance of low-cost MEMS-grade SINS/GNSS navigation system. A new integration scheme is presented for in-move aligned SINS/GNSS system. Un-modeled nonlinearities in the SINS dynamics as well as error uncertainties in the measurements of MEMS-grade IMU motivate using a robust data fusion algorithm for the proposed integration scheme. Considering these facts, a new recurrent wavelet neural network (RWNN)-based algorithm is designed for data fusion in the proposed in-move aligned SINS/GNSS system. Several vehicular field tests have been carried out to assess the long-term performance and accuracy of the proposed navigation algorithm.

AB In order for teams of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collaborate and cooperate to perform challenging group tasks, intelligent and flexible control strategies are required. One of the complex behaviors required of a team of UAVs is dynamic encirclement, which is a tactic that can be employed for persistent surveillance and/or to neutralize a target by restricting its movement. This tactic requires a high level of cooperation such that the UAVs maintain a desired and proper encirclement radius and angular velocity around the target. In this paper, model predictive control (MPC) is used to model and implement controllers for the problem of dynamic encirclement. The linear and nonlinear control policies proposed in this paper are applied as a high-level controller to control multiple UAVs to encircle a desired target in simulations and real-time experiments with quadrotors. The nonlinear solution provides a theoretical analysis of the problem, while the linear control policy is used for real-time operation via a combination of MPC and feedback linearization applied to the nonlinear UAV system. The contributions of this paper lie in the implementation of MPC to solve the problem of dynamic encirclement of a team of UAVs in real time and the application of theoretical stability analysis to the problem.

AB Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is a valuable technology for a large number of maritime applications. Other than providing the absolute positioning service, it aids many demanding applications, such as precise docking, formation of surface craft, autonomous vehicles, sinkage monitoring, etc. GNSS carrier-phase-based algorithms provide high-precision positioning solutions, but an integer number of cycles inherent to the observed signal have to be resolved. A newly developed GNSS carrier-phase ambiguity resolution method is tested. The new method solves for the unknown number of integer cycles by exploiting the known placement of the GNSS antennas aboard the vessel. The a priori information on the antennas baseline separation is employed as a hard constraint. A simplified (linearized) version of the method, suitable for large vessels, is also analyzed. The new method was tested against the most challenging scenario when processing GNSS data: single-frequency, single-epoch, unaided ambiguity resolution. Through different tests, the high performance of the new method is demonstrated: high fixing rate, large robustness, and short time-to-fix after initialization, cycle slips, and/or loss of locks. Considerations about the wide spectra of maritime applications are given, and a specific experiment is carried out to demonstrate the capabilities of the method for navigation in shallow waters.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are poised to play a central role in revolutionizing future services offered by the envisioned smart cities, thanks to their agility, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. UAVs are being widely deployed in different verticals including surveillance, search and rescue missions, delivery of items, and as an infrastructure for aerial communications in future wireless networks. UAVs can be used to survey target locations, collect raw data from the ground (i.e., video streams), generate computing task(s) and offload it to the available servers for processing. In this work, we formulate a multi-objective optimization framework for both the network resource allocation and the UAV trajectory planning problem using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization model. In consideration of the different stake holders that may exist in a Cloud-Fog environment, we minimize the sum of a weighted objective function, which allows network operators to tune the weights to emphasize/de-emphasize different cost functions such as the end-to-end network power consumption (EENPC), processing power consumption (PPC), UAV's total flight distance (UAVTFD), and UAV's total power consumption (UAVTPC). Our optimization models and results enable the optimum offloading decisions to be made under different constraints relating to EENPC, PPC, UAVTFD and UAVTPC which we explore in detail. For example, when the UAV's propulsion efficiency (UPE) is at its worst (10% considered), offloading via the macro base station is the best choice and a maximum power saving of 34% can be achieved. Extensive studies on the UAV's coverage path planning (CPP) and computation offloading have been conducted, but none has tackled the issue in a practical Cloud-Fog architecture in which all the elements of the access, metro and core layers are considered when evaluating the service offloading in a distributed architecture like the Cloud-Fog.

AB An algorithm has been developed for fusing 3D LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) systems that receive objects detected in deep learning-based image sensors and object data in the form of 3D point clouds. 3D LIDAR represents 3D point data in a planar rectangular coordinate system with a 360 & x00B0; representation of the detected object surface, including the front face. However, only the direction and distance data of the object can be obtained, and point cloud data cannot be used to create a specific definition of the object. Therefore, only the movement of the point cloud data can be tracked using probability and classification algorithms based on image processing. To overcome this limitation, the study matches 3D LIDAR data with 2D image data through the fusion of hybrid level multi-sensors. First, because 3D LIDAR data represents all objects in the sensor & x2019;s detection range as dots, all unnecessary data, including ground data, is filtered out. The 3D Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm enables the extraction of ground data perpendicular to the reference estimation 3D plane and data at both ends through ground estimation. Classified environmental data facilitates the labeling of all objects within the viewing angle of 3D LIDAR based on the presence or absence of movement. The path of motion of the platform can be established by detecting whether objects within the region of interest are movable or static. Because LIDAR is based on 8- and 16-channel rotation mechanisms, real-time data cannot be used to define objects. Instead, point clouds can be used to detect obstacles in the image through deep learning in the preliminary processing phase of the classification algorithm. By matching the labeling information of defined objects with the classified object cloud data obtained using 3D LIDAR, the exact dynamic trajectory and position of the defined objects can be calculated. Consequently, to process the acquired object data efficiently, we devised an active-region-of-interest technique to ensure a fast processing speed while maintaining a high detection rate.

AB Path planning is one of the most important process on applications such as navigating autonomous vehicles, computer graphics, game development, robotics, and protein folding. It ensures that a path is planned between an initial and final position on the collision-free region of a search space if one exists. One of the most wide algorithms used for this purpose is the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT), in which each node of a tree data structure is generated from a search space by a random sampling process, which originally follows a uniform spatial distribution. However, some authors claim that the addition of a non-uniform/ informed approach into the sampling process of the RRT could accelerate the planning time of the algorithm. Actually, many works on literature propose different strategies to include non-uniform/ informed behavior on RRT-based algorithms. However, the large number of studies on path planning subject impose difficulties on the identification of new solutions on a review process. The aim of this paper is to structure a review process to deal with the massive volume of works on this subject, by presenting the planning, development, and results of a systematic literature review (SLR), to investigate non-uniform/ informed sampling solutions applied to RRT-based algorithms on path planning literature. A review protocol with two scientific questions was developed to guide the investigation. As a result, 1136 studies were selected in the path planning literature, of which 53 were identified as claiming to contain a solution with non-uniform/ informed sampling on RRT-based algorithms. As a specific work is considered a scientific contribution only when it has not yet been explored in scientific circles, the results of the SLR can be used as a tool to search for what has not yet been proposed, helping to identify opportunities to contribute with new sampling processes of RRT-based algorithms. To the best knowledge of the authors, this paper presents the first development of an SLR of a topic related to the RRT algorithm.

TI Accident Detection and Flow Prediction for Connected and Automated
   Transport Systems
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Effective accident detection and traffic flow forecasting are of great importance for quick respond, impact elimination and intelligent control of the traffic flow consisting of autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes a traffic accident detection method for connected and automated transport systems by conducting a grid-based parameter extracting and SVC-based traffic state classification. Allowing for the dynamic spread of traffic flow over time, from upstream to downstream and from accident lanes to other lanes, a spatiotemporal Markov model is established to predict the evolution of traffic flow after accident by introducing the grid as state detection unit and fitting the spatiotemporal evolution with the parameter space mean speed to match the need of both detection accuracy and monitoring scope. Compared with actual accident data, the validation results indicate that the proposed methods present a good performance in accident detection with the accident detection rate as 87.72% and a higher precision rate than both SVM (support vector machine) and ANN (artificial neural network) models in traffic flow prediction. With the active traffic accident identification and dynamic traffic flow prediction, it is beneficial to shorten detection time, reduce possible impacts of traffic accidents and carbon emissions from congestion. The methods can be implied to traffic state recognition and traffic flow prediction, which is one of the significant sections of connected and automated transport systems, and serve as references for accident handling and urban traffic management.

AB Environment perception in autonomous driving vehicles often heavily relies on deep neural networks (DNNs), which are subject to domain shifts, leading to a significantly decreased performance during DNN deployment. Usually, this problem is addressed by unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches trained either simultaneously on source and target domain datasets or even source-free only on target data in an offline fashion. In this work, we further expand a source-free UDA approach to a continual and therefore online-capable UDA on a single-image basis for semantic segmentation. Accordingly, our method only requires the pre-trained model from the supplier (trained in the source domain) and the current (unlabeled target domain) camera image. Our method Continual BatchNorm Adaptation (CBNA) modifies the source domain statistics in the batch normalization layers, using target domain images in an unsupervised fashion, which yields consistent performance improvements during inference. Thereby, in contrast to existing works, our approach can be applied to improve a DNN continuously on a single-image basis during deployment without access to source data, without algorithmic delay, and nearly without computational overhead. We show the consistent effectiveness of our method across a wide variety of source/target domain settings for semantic segmentation. Code is available at https://github.com/ifnspaml/CBNA.

ID NAVIGATION
AB A majority of collision avoidance and motion planning algorithms deployed on autonomous mobile robots tend to be reactive to the presence and motion of nearby dynamic actors. While these algorithms can produce collision free navigation, they do not necessarily follow social protocol and exhibit unnatural motions that force actors to behave very differently from their planned paths. As humans, we can reason about why and how we might interfere with others and use this reasoning to alter our motion proactively. We also adapt our motion based on different priorities, which affect how we accommodate and interact with each other. In this letter, we propose an approach for a mobile robot to generate similar non-interfering and priority-based behaviors that pertain to how the robot accommodates dynamic actors. We augment a very efficient but reactive virtual physics-based planner with Hidden Markov Models and a Decision Tree-based monitor that: i) predicts if the robot will interfere with a nearby actor, ii) explains what factors cause the prediction, iii) plans priority-based corrective actions, and iv) updates the prediction model at runtime to improve and refine robot behaviors. Our approach is validated with simulations and extensive experiments on ground and aerial vehicles in the presence of dynamic actors.

AB The underwater robot is part of a project with "terrestrial-maritime" collaborative robots, whose mission is recognition and rescue. From a structural point of view, some small changes were made in this study to the original robot. These changes consisted of making supports to hold the two plexiglass tubes, since the tube containing the battery system is larger. A larger tube was chosen because the aim was to increase the travel autonomy of the mini remotely operated vehicle (ROV). The mini submarine will move in an unstructured environment and will be able to reach a depth of 100 m. The purpose of the article is to present a point of view regarding the effect of the behavior of the mini ROV on tensions produced by the forced assembly of the sealing cover of the cylinder containing its command-and-control system. Both the gripping elements and the sealing lids are made using 3D printing technology, and the material used is polylactic acid (PLA). For the numerical analysis, the finite element method is used in both static and dynamic conditions. The results of this work refer to the field of tensions and displacements. The main conclusions emphasize the fact that the gripping performed for sealing is influenced by the usage of oiled mechanisms.

AB As a typical scenario in future generation communication network applications, UAV-assisted communication can perform autonomous data delivery for massive machine type communication (mMTC), where the data generated from Internet of Things (IoT) devices can be carried and delivered to the corresponding locations with no direct communication channels to the IoT devices. Wireless energy transfer technique can recharge the UAV when the system is in operation, assisting the UAV to continuously collect and deliver data. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) model to describe the energy and data transfer optimization problem for the UAV. To maximize the long-term utility of the UAV, the MDP model is solved by value iteration algorithm to obtain the optimal strategies of the UAV to collect data, deliver data, and receive transferred energy to replenish on-device battery energy storage. Furthermore, to tackle the issues of system state uncertainties, partially observable states, and large state space in UAV-assisted communication systems, we extend the MDP model and solve it by using a Q-learning and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) schemes. Simulations and numerical results validate that, compared with baseline schemes, the proposed MDP model with DRL based scheme can achieve better wireless energy and data transfer strategies in terms of the higher long-term utility of the UAV.

AB Applying deep neural networks (DNNs) in mobile and safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, demands a reliable and efficient execution on hardware. The design of the neural architecture has a large influence on the achievable efficiency and bit error resilience of the network on hardware. Since there are numerous design choices for the architecture of DNNs, with partially opposing effects on the preferred characteristics (such as small error rates at low latency), multi-objective optimization strategies are necessary. In this paper, we develop an evolutionary optimization technique for the automated design of hardware-optimized DNN architectures. For this purpose, we derive a set of inexpensively computable objective functions, which enable the fast evaluation of DNN architectures with respect to their hardware efficiency and error resilience. We observe a strong correlation between predicted error resilience and actual measurements obtained from fault injection simulations. Furthermore, we analyze two different quantization schemes for efficient DNN computation and find one providing a significantly higher error resilience compared to the other. Finally, a comparison of the architectures provided by our algorithm with the popular MobileNetV2 and NASNet-A models reveals an up to seven times improved bit error resilience of our models. We are the first to combine error resilience, efficiency, and performance optimization in a neural architecture search framework.

AB The traffic driving environment is a complex and dynamic changing scene in which drivers have to pay close attention to salient and important targets or regions for safe driving. Modeling drivers' eye movements and attention allocation in traffic driving can also help guiding unmanned intelligent vehicles. However, until now, few studies have modeled drivers' true fixations and allocations while driving. To this end, we collect an eye tracking dataset from a total of 28 experienced drivers viewing 16 traffic driving videos. Based on the multiple drivers' attention allocation dataset, we propose a convolutional-deconvolutional neural network (CDNN) to predict the drivers' eye fixations. The experimental results indicate that the proposed CDNN outperforms the state-of-the-art saliency models and predicts drivers' attentional locations more accurately. The proposed CDNN can predict the major fixation location and shows excellent detection of secondary important information or regions that cannot be ignored during driving if they exist. Compared with the present object detection models in autonomous and assisted driving systems, our human-like driving model does not detect all of the objects appearing in the driving scenes, but it provides the most relevant regions or targets, which can largely reduce the interference of irrelevant scene information.

AB Device-to-device (D2D) communication is a direct means of communication between devices without an intermediate node, and it helps to expand cell coverage and to increase radio frequency reuse in a 5G network. Moreover, D2D communication is a core technology of 5G vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, which is an essential technology for autonomous driving. However, typical D2D communication in an 4G network which is typical telecommunication network has various security challenges including impersonation, eavesdropping, privacy sniffing, free-riding attack, etc. Moreover, when IoT technology emerges with 5G networks in massive machine type communication (mMTC) and ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) application scenarios, these security challenges are more crucial and harder to mitigate because of the resource-constrained nature of IoT devices. To solve the security challenges in a 5G IoT environment, we need a lightweight and secure D2D communication system that can provide secure authentication, data confidentiality/integrity and anonymity. In this paper, we survey and analyze existing results about secure D2D communication systems in terms of their security considerations and limitations. Then, we lastly propose a secure D2D communication system to address the aforementioned security challenges and the limitations of the existing results. The proposed secure D2D communication was designed based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and lightweight authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) ciphers to cover resource-constrained IoT devices.

AB The rapid-developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, fast-growing network traffic, and emerging intelligent applications (e.g., autonomous driving, virtual reality, etc.) urgently require a new, faster, more reliable and flexible network form. At this time, researchers in both industry and academia have turned their attention to the sixth generation (6G) communication networks. In the 6G vision, various intelligent application scenarios that utilize Machine Learning (ML) technology (the most important branch of AI) will bring rich heterogeneous connections, as well as massive information storage and operations. When ML meets 6G, new opportunities will emerge along with numerous privacy challenges. On one hand, a secure ML structure, or the correct application of ML, can protect privacy in 6G. On the other hand, ML may be attacked or abused, resulting in privacy violation. It is worth noting that the alliance between 6G and ML may also be a double-edged sword in many cases, rather than absolutely infringe or protect privacy. Therefore, based on lots of existing meaningful works, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey of ML and privacy in 6G, with a view to further promoting the development of 6G and privacy protection technologies.

AB Rapid advancements in multifunctional triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) for energy harvesting and self-powered sensing must be partnered with corresponding advances in durability and heat-resistance, especially under harsh working conditions. A device suitable for harsh environmental applications based on the wear-resistant triboelectric material is reported. The working modes of the harsh-environmental TENG (heTENG) are composed of freestanding and single electrode that enable both harvesting sliding/vibration energy and self-powered vibrational sensing. For the first time, a TENG possessing wear resistance, withstanding high temperature, and high hardness is achieved by employing micro-nanocomposite for triboelectric materials. It is demonstrated to be directly used as a key supporting part, such as automobile's brake pads. In addition, it is found that the heTENG outputs 221 V, 27.9 mu A cm(-2), and 33.4 mu C cm(-2). Furthermore, since heTENG is vibration-sensitive, the automobile's self-powered smart braking system and sensor network are developed successfully which can automatically provide a precise early-warning signals, such as a reminder for brake replacement, and an indicator for tire overloading, and pressure. This work shows a new strategy to enhance the performance of triboelectric materials, making it applicable to harsh environments, as well as potential applications in autonomous vehicles and industrial brakes.

ID RANDOM-ACCESS; CHALLENGES
AB Collecting data from a large number of agents scattered over a region of interest is becoming an increasingly appealing paradigm to feed big data archives that lay the ground for a vast array of applications. Vehicular Floating Car Data (FCD) collection is a major representative of this paradigm. Massive data collection from floating vehicles is the key to Intelligent Transportation Systems. We address the design and performance evaluation of a data collection protocol for the use case of periodic data collection. We target robustness, optimizing the amount of data and the value of the collection period, keeping in mind the goals of autonomous node operation and minimal coordination effort. From a system point of view, we believe that best solutions should jointly exploit the Long Term Evolution (LTE) cellular access network and the Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) based Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET). Through a detailed comparative analysis, we show that such a hybrid approach offers superior performance, especially as for offloading the cellular radio access. A lightweight signaling procedure is designed, based on the DSRC VANET, which is able to avoid most of the duplicated data records, even if a distributed operation approach is pursued. The impact of the proposed protocol on the VANET load is evaluated and proved to be quite small, so that it does not interfere with other VANET-specific messages.

ID COMPUTER
AB Artificial intelligence is exerting an influence on all professions and industries. We have autonomous vehicles, instantaneous translation among the world's leading languages, and search engines that rapidly locate information anywhere on the web in a way that is tailored to a user's interests and past search history. Law is not immune from disruption by new technology. Software tools are beginning to affect various aspects of lawyers' work, including those tasks that historically relied upon expert human judgment, such as predicting court outcomes. These new software tools present new challenges and new opportunities. In the short run, we can expect greater legal transparency, more efficient dispute resolution, improved access to justice, and new challenges to the traditional organization of private law firms delivering legal services on a billable hour basis through a leveraged partner-associate model. With new technology, lawyers will be empowered to work more efficiently, deepen and broaden their areas of expertise, and provide more value to clients. These developments will predictably transform both how lawyers do legal work and resolve disputes on behalf of their clients. In the longer term, it is difficult to predict what the impact of artificially intelligent tools will be, as lawyers incorporate them into their practice and expand their range of services on behalf of clients.

Parallel placed mixed battery modules are typically seen in second-life, repurposed or exchangeable battery systems to increase power and energy storage capacity of a battery pack in mobile, electric vehicle (EV) and stationary energy storage application. This paper addresses battery module heterogeneity by taking advantage of buck regulators on each battery module and formulating scheduling algorithms to dispatch the buck regulators to balance the current out of each battery module. In this way, mixed battery modules can be combined and coordinated to provide a balanced power flow and guarantee safety of the total battery pack. Both open-loop and closed-loop scheduling of buck regulated battery modules are analyzed in this paper. In the open-loop algorithm, buck regulator dispatch commands are computed based on full knowledge of the OCV and impedance of each battery module, while monitoring the load impedance. In the closed-loop algorithm, dispatch commands are generated automatically by a digital proportional-integral-derivative (PID) feedback controller for which battery module current reference signals are computed recursively while monitoring the load impedance. The closed-loop scheduling method is also validated through experimental work that simulates a battery pack with several parallel placed buck regulated battery modules. The experimental results illustrate that the current from each battery module can be rated based on the SOC of each module and that the current remains balanced, despite discrepancies between OCV and internal impedance between modules. The experimental results show that the closed-loop algorithm allows scheduling of buck regulated battery modules, even in the absence of knowledge on the variations of OCV and impedance between battery modules.

AB Featured Application The main idea of this paper was to deploy a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to attach a sensor to a bridge using a two-component adhesive in order to perform an inspection. Constant pressure must be applied for several minutes to form a bond between two adhesives. Therefore, one UAV sprays the colored component of an adhesive while the aerial manipulator transports the sensor, detects the contact point and attaches the sensor to it. A trajectory planning algorithm was developed around the dynamic model of the UAV and the manipulator attached to it, ensuring that the end-effector is parallel to the wall normal. Finally, the aerial manipulator achieves and maintains contact with a predefined force through an adaptive impedance control approach. Periodic bridge inspections are required every several years to determine the state of a bridge. Most commonly, the inspection is performed using specialized trucks allowing human inspectors to review the conditions underneath the bridge, which requires a road closure. The aim of this paper was to use aerial manipulators to mount sensors on the bridge to collect the necessary data, thus eliminating the need for the road closure. To do so, a two-step approach is proposed: an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a pressurized canister sprays the first glue component onto the target area; afterward, the aerial manipulator detects the precise location of the sprayed area, and mounts the required sensor coated with the second glue component. The visual detection is based on an Red Green Blue - Depth (RGB-D) sensor and provides the target position and orientation. A trajectory is then planned based on the detected contact point, and it is executed through the adaptive impedance control capable of achieving and maintaining a desired force reference. Such an approach allows for the two glue components to form a solid bond. The described pipeline is validated in a simulation environment while the visual detection is tested in an experimental environment.

AB This research mainly aims at the construction of the novel acceleration pedal, the brake pedal and the steering system by mechanical designs and mechatronics technologies, an approach of which is rarely seen in Taiwan. Three highlights can be addressed: 1. The original steering parts were removed with the fault tolerance design being implemented so that the basic steering function can still remain in case of the function failure of the control system. 2. A larger steering angle of the front wheels in response to a specific rotated angle of the steering wheel is devised when cornering or parking at low speed in interest of drivability, while a smaller one is designed at high speed in favor of driving stability. 3. The operating patterns of the throttle, brake, and steering wheel can be customized in accordance with various driving environments and drivers' requirements using the self-developed software. The implementation of a steer-by-wire system in the remote driving control for a go kart is described in this study. The mechatronic system is designed in order to support the conversion from human driving to autonomous driving for the go kart in the future. The go kart, using machine vision, is wirelessly controlled in the WiFi frequency bands. The steer-by-wire system was initially modeled as a standalone system for one wheel and subsequently developed into its complete form, including front wheel steering components, acceleration components, brake components, a microcontroller, drive circuit and digital to analog converter. The control output section delivers the commands to the subsystem controllers, relays and converters. The remote driving control of the go kart is activated when proper commands are sent by the vehicle control unit (VCU). All simulation and experiment results demonstrated that the control strategies of duel motors and the VCU control were successfully optimized. The feasibility study and performance evaluation of Taiwan's go karts will be conducted as an extension of this study in the near future.

AB High-resolution geophysical mapping using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and surface vessel revealed tectonic, volcanic and hydrothermal features of a nascent rift graben in the southern Okinawa Trough. Ship-based bathymetry identified ENE-WSW trending lineaments at a water depth of 1900-2000 m that form a rift graben, the Ishigaki Rift, which is similar to 50 km long, similar to 7 km wide and has relief of similar to 100 m. Shipboard EM122 multibeam sonar detected acoustic bubble plumes and high-backscatter intensity on the seafloor along the rift. The AUV high-resolution bathymetry (2 m) and sidescan imagery revealed the presence of a ropey texture with high acoustic reflectivity, interpreted to be relatively young lava flows. Evidence of hydrothermal venting was observed at two previously unknown sites along the rift. Steep-sided spires up to 23 m in height and a mound discharging smoke-like acoustic plumes were identified. The AUV temperature sensor observed sharp temperature increases of up to similar to 0.13 degrees C around the plumes, even at the vehicle's altitude of similar to 100 m above the seafloor. The presence of relatively young lava flows and indicators of high-temperature hydrothermal venting and gas bubbles suggest the Ishigaki Rift is magmatically active. Compared with adjacent active back-arc rifts, the Ishigaki Rift has a shorter length, narrower width and lower relief, and occurs at a shallower water depth, suggesting that the rift is relatively young and immature. Considering that the Ishigaki Rift is located near the arc volcanic front and that other mature rifts are typically located farther from the front, it is suggested that a new axial rift system is evolving within the Okinawa Trough and that back-arc rifting processes may be gradually migrating arcward in the trough during the Quaternary.

AB Operations involving the launch or recovery of a smaller vessel from a larger one are extremely dangerous in high sea states and, therefore, they are normally carried out in low to moderate sea states. However, this can be severely restrictive and in some situations, carrying out such operations in high sea states is unavoidable. Here we report on a detailed investigation of the interaction between two vessels of different size in order to characterise their hydrodynamic interaction under different conditions and to provide insight for operational purposes. Model experiments were conducted to investigate the hydrodynamic interaction between two vessels in close proximity in waves. Previous studies into this interaction have focused on two vessels with comparable size/displacement. This study focused on the interaction between vessels of very different sizes, a platform supply vessel and a lifeboat, at various separation distances between the two models and wave headings. It is found that the effect of the hydrodynamic interaction on the wave loads on the lifeboat model is substantial. The load responses show a strong non-linearity (high order harmonic components). In head waves, the effect of the hydrodynamic interaction on the wave loads is greater in the transverse modes (sway, roll and yaw) than in the longitudinal modes (surge, heave and pitch). The sheltering effects of the larger model on the lifeboat model were also evident from the experiments. The results of this investigation may be used to inform the planning of marine operations, such as the launch and recovery of a lifeboat or an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) from a mothership and the transfer of equipment or personnel between vessels. The data will also provide a useful resource for validation of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes and other numerical simulations, and can be used to better understand the limitations and potential widening of the operational weather windows and to ensure that operations are carried out safely.

AB Image restoration aims to recover a clean image from various degradations, e.g., haze, snow, and blur, playing an important role in robot vision, autonomous vehicles, and medical imaging. Recently, the use of Transformer has witnessed a significant improvement in multifarious image restoration tasks. However, despite a few remedies to reduce the quadratic complexity of self-attention, these approaches are still impractical for real-world applications, which need high efficiency and speed. To ameliorate this issue, we propose an efficient framework for image restoration based on self-attention. To this end, we combine the strengths of patch-based and strip-based self-attention units to improve efficiency. More specifically, we apply self-attention of different operation scales to features of different resolutions, i.e., we adopt a relatively smaller region for self-attention on high-resolution features while a larger region for low-restoration features. In addition, instead of using global self-attention in each partitioned region, we leverage a strip-based version for low complexity. To further improve efficiency, we insert our design into a U-shaped CNN network to establish our framework, dubbed PSNet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network receives state-of-the-art performance on five representative image restoration tasks with low computational complexity and high speed, including single-image defocus deblurring, image dehazing, image motion deblurring, image desnowing, and image denoising.

AB The detection of the vanishing point (VP) in unstructured road is crucial for the advancement of autonomous vehicle technology. However, due to the inadequate fusion of intra-level features and high computational requirements of existing CNN-based road VP detection methods, a model named RVPNet is proposed in this paper. To begin, the proposed algorithm adopts the architecture of encoder-decoder combined lightweight backbone to extract unstructured road features efficiently. Second, the Simple Residual Pyramid Pooling Module (SRPPM) is designed in this model to obtain cross-path global contextual information with low computational cost. And a Dual Attention-based Feature Aggregation Module (DAFAM) is proposed to obtain better inter-level feature representations. Finally, the offset loss is introduced to compensate for the inherent offset errors caused by the output stride of the heatmap. The experimental results show that the average detection error rate of our approach is only 0.03128 on the Kong dataset, and the average processing time reaches 238 FPS. The average detection error rate of our approach based is only 0.03600 on the Moghhadam dataset. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed approach achieves the highest detection accuracy and speed.

AB In this work, we investigate a novel covert communication system, where the legitimate transmitter attempts to communicate with a covert user in the presence of a warden and the public user covertly. Specifically, the legitimate transmitter employs non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and rate-splitting (RS) to communicate with users aided by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). In this context, we investigate key performance indicators of covert communication, namely the detection error probability and the covert communication rate. Meanwhile, we consider the physical layer security (PLS) of the proposed system in the presence of an eavesdropper, and derive the approximate secrecy outage probability (SOP) expression. Also, an asymptotic analysis of the SOP is also carried out. Various numerical results are presented that demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed analysis, which are complemented by simulated ones, verifying the correctness of the theoretical framework. From these results, it becomes evident that the use of RS, NOMA, and RIS can improve the performance of covert communication. Finally, it is also depicted that under the condition of high signal-to-noise ratio, the SOP of the system tends to be a constant value.

DE LiDAR localization; absolute pose regression; spatio-temporal
   constraints
AB LiDAR localization is of great importance to autonomous vehicles and robotics. Absolute pose regression, directly estimating the mapping from a scene to a 6-DoF pose, has achieved impressive results in learning-based localization. Different from traditional map-based methods, it does not need a pre-built 3D map during inference. However, current regression networks typically suffer from scene ambiguities, especially in challenging traffic environments, leading to large wrong predictions (e.g., outliers) and limited applications. To address this problem, a novel LiDAR localization framework with spatio-temporal constraints is proposed, termed STCLoc, to reduce scene ambiguities and achieve more accurate localization. First, we propose to regularize regression in the spatial dimension with a novel classification task to reduce outliers. Specifically, the classification task categorizes the point cloud in terms of position and orientation and then couples it with the regression task to conduct multi-task learning. Second, to learn discriminative features to reduce scene ambiguities, we propose using attention-based feature aggregation to capture the correlation in LiDAR sequences. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, where the localization takes 97ms on each dataset. Results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 43.33%/36.76% (position/orientation) on the Oxford Radar RobotCar dataset, verifying the effectiveness of our method.

AB Capsule Networks (CapsNets) preserve the hierarchical spatial relationships between objects, and thereby bear the potential to surpass the performance of traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in performing tasks like image classification. This makes CapsNets suitable for the smart cyber-physical systems (CPS), where a large amount of training data may not be available. A large body of work has explored adversarial examples for CNNs, but their effectiveness on CapsNets has not yet been studied systematically. In our work, we perform an analysis to study the vulnerabilities in CapsNets to adversarial attacks. These perturbations, added to the test inputs, are small and imperceptible to humans, but can fool the network to mispredict. We propose a greedy algorithm to automatically generate imperceptible adversarial examples in a black-box attack scenario. We show that this kind of attacks, when applied to the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark and CIFAR10 datasets, mislead CapsNets in making a correct classification, which can be catastrophic for smart CPS, like autonomous vehicles. Moreover, we apply the same kind of adversarial attacks to a 5-layer CNN (LeNet), to a 9-layer CNN (VGGNet), and to a 20-layer CNN (ResNet), and analyze the outcome, compared to the CapsNets, to study their different behaviors under the adversarial attacks.

AB Purpose The rotorcraft technology is very interesting area since last few decades due to variety of applications. One of the rotorcrafts is the quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (QUAV), which contains four rotors mounted on an airframe with an onboard controller. The QUAV is a highly nonlinear system and underactuated. Its controller design is very challenging task, and the need of controller is to make it autonomous based on mission planning. The purpose of this study is to design a controller for quadrotor UAV for attitude stabilization and trajectory tracking problem in presence of external environmental disturbances such as wind gust. Design/methodology/approach To address this problem, the model predictive control has been designed for attitude control and feedback linearization control for the position control using the linear parameter varying (LPV) approach. The trajectory tracking problem has been addressed using the circular trajectory and helical trajectory. Findings The simulation results show the efficient performance with good trajectory tracking even in presence of external disturbances in both the scenarios considered, one for circular trajectory tracking and other for helical trajectory tracking. Originality/value The novelty of the work came from using the LPV approach in controller design, which increases the robustness of the controller in presence of external disturbances.

DE Semantic scene understanding; deep learning methods
AB A key challenge for autonomous vehicles is to navigate in unseen dynamic environments. Separating moving objects from static ones is essential for navigation, pose estimation, and understanding how other traffic participants are likely to move in the near future. In this work, we tackle the problem of distinguishing 3D LiDAR points that belong to currently moving objects, like walking pedestrians or driving cars, from points that are obtained from non-moving objects, like walls but also parked cars. Our approach takes a sequence of observed LiDAR scans and turns them into a voxelized sparse 4D point cloud. We apply computationally efficient sparse 4D convolutions to jointly extract spatial and temporal features and predict moving object confidence scores for all points in the sequence. We develop a receding horizon strategy that allows us to predict moving objects online and to refine predictions on the go based on new observations. We use a binary Bayes filter to recursively integrate new predictions of a scan resulting in more robust estimation. We evaluate our approach on the SemanticKITTI moving object segmentation challenge and show more accurate predictions than existing methods. Since our approach only operates on the geometric information of point clouds over time, it generalizes well to new, unseen environments, which we evaluate on the Apollo dataset.

AB In the complex and variable marine environment, the navigation and localization of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are very important and challenging. When the conventional Kalman filter (KF) is applied to the cooperative localization of leader-follower AUVs, the outliers in the sensor observations will have a substantial adverse effect on the localization accuracy of the AUVs. Meanwhile, inaccurate noise covariance matrices may result in significant estimation errors. In this paper, we proposed an improved Sage-Husa adaptive extended Kalman filter (improved SHAEKF) for the cooperative localization of multi-AUVs. Firstly, the measurement anomalies were evaluated by calculating the Chi-square test statistics based on the innovation. The detection threshold was determined according to the confidence level of the Chi-square test, and the Chi-square test statistics exceeding the threshold were regarded as measurement abnormalities. When measurement anomalies occurred, the Sage-Husa adaptive extended Kalman filter algorithm was improved by suboptimal maximum a posterior estimation using weighted exponential fading memory, and the measurement noise covariance matrix was adjusted online. The numerical simulation of leader-follower multi-AUV cooperative localization verified the effectiveness of the improved SHAEKF and demonstrated that the average root mean square and the average standard deviation of the localization errors based on the improved SHAEKF were significantly reduced in the case of the presence of measurement abnormalities.

AB Deep learning (DL) has shown great success in many human-related tasks, which has led to its adoption in many computer vision based applications, such as security surveillance systems, autonomous vehicles and healthcare. Such safety-critical applications have to draw their path to success deployment once they have the capability to overcome safety-critical challenges. Among these challenges are the defense against or/and the detection of the adversarial examples (AEs). Adversaries can carefully craft small, often imperceptible, noise called perturbations to be added to the clean image to generate the AE. The aim of AE is to fool the DL model which makes it a potential risk for DL applications. Many test-time evasion attacks and countermeasures, i.e., defense or detection methods, are proposed in the literature. Moreover, few reviews and surveys were published and theoretically showed the taxonomy of the threats and the countermeasure methods with little focus in AE detection methods. In this paper, we focus on image classification task and attempt to provide a survey for detection methods of test-time evasion attacks on neural network classifiers. A detailed discussion for such methods is provided with experimental results for eight state-of-the-art detectors under different scenarios on four datasets. We also provide potential challenges and future perspectives for this research direction.

AB Three-dimensional information perception from point clouds is of vital importance for improving the ability of machines to understand the world, especially for autonomous driving and unmanned aerial vehicles. Data annotation for point clouds is one of the most challenging and costly tasks. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop and virtual-real interactive point cloud generation and model-upgrading framework called Parallel Point Clouds (PPCs). To our best knowledge, this is the first time that the training model has been changed from an open-loop to a closed-loop mechanism. The feedback from the evaluation results is used to update the training dataset, benefiting from the flexibility of artificial scenes. Under the framework, a point-based LiDAR simulation model is proposed, which greatly simplifies the scanning operation. Besides, a group-based placing method is put forward to integrate hybrid point clouds, via locating candidate positions for virtual objects in real scenes. Taking advantage of the CAD models and mobile LiDAR devices, two hybrid point cloud datasets, i.e., ShapeKITTI and MobilePointClouds, are built for 3D detection tasks. With almost zero labor cost on data annotation for newly added objects, the models (PointPillars) trained with ShapeKITTI and MobilePointClouds achieved 78.6% and 60.0% of the average precision of the model trained with real data on 3D detection, respectively.

AB This article presents an innovative hybrid imaging system that provides dense and accurate 3D information from harsh underwater environments. The proposed system is called MARESye and captures the advantages of both active and passive imaging methods: multiple light stripe range (LSR) and a photometric stereo (PS) technique, respectively. This hybrid approach fuses information from these techniques through a data-driven formulation to extend the measurement range and to produce high density 3D estimations in dynamic underwater environments. This hybrid system is driven by a gating timing approach to reduce the impact of several photometric issues related to the underwater environments such as, diffuse reflection, water turbidity and non-uniform illumination. Moreover, MARESye synchronizes and matches the acquisition of images with sub-sea phenomena which leads to clear pictures (with a high signal-to-noise ratio). Results conducted in realistic environments showed that MARESye is able to provide reliable, high density and accurate 3D data. Moreover, the experiments demonstrated that the performance of MARESye is less affected by sub-sea conditions since the SSIM index was 0.655 in high turbidity waters. Conventional imaging techniques obtained 0.328 in similar testing conditions. Therefore, the proposed system represents a valuable contribution for the inspection of maritime structures as well as for the navigation procedures of autonomous underwater vehicles during close range operations.

AB This paper capitalizes on the increasingly high relevance gained by data-intensive technologies in the development of intelligent transportation system, which calls for the progressive adoption of adaptive, self-learning methods for solving modeling, simulation, and optimization problems. In this regard, certain mechanisms and processes observed in nature, including the animal brain, have proved themselves to excel not only in terms of efficiently capturing time-evolving stimuli, but also at undertaking complex tasks by virtue of mechanisms that can be extrapolated to computer algorithms and methods. This paper comprehensively reviews the state-of-the-art around the application of bioinspired methods to the challenges arising in the broad field of intelligent transportation system (ITS). This systematic survey is complemented by an initiatory taxonomic introduction to bioinspired computational intelligence, along with the basics of its constituent techniques. A focus is placed on which research niches are still unexplored by the community in different ITS subareas. The open issues and research directions for the practical implementation of ITS endowed with bioinspired computational intelligence are also discussed in detail.

AB This study empirically examines the association between the extent of emerging technological ideas in a scientific publication and its future scientific impact measured by number of citations. We analyze metadata of scientific publications in three scientific domains: Nano-Enabled Drug Delivery, Synthetic Biology, and Autonomous Vehicles. By employing a bibliometric indicator for identifying and quantifying emerging technological ideas - as derived terms from the titles and abstracts - we measure the extent to which the publication contains emerging technological ideas in each domain. Then, we statistically estimate the size and statistical significance of the relationship between the publication-level technological emergence score and the normalized number of citations accruing to the publication.
   Our analysis shows that the degree to which a paper contains technologically emerging ideas is positively and strongly associated with its future citation impact in each of the three domains. An additional analysis demonstrates that this relationship holds for citations from other publications, both in the same field as, and in different fields from, the scientific domain of the focal publication. A series of tests for validation further support our argument that the greater the extent to which scientific knowledge (a paper) contains emerging ideas, the bigger its scientific impact. Implications for academic researchers, research policymakers, and firms are discussed.

AB In applications, such as autonomous driving, it is important to understand, infer, and anticipate the intention and future behavior of pedestrians. This ability allows vehicles to avoid collisions and improve ride safety and quality. This letter proposes a biomechanically inspired recurrent neural network that can predict the location and three-dimensional (3-D) articulated body pose of pedestrians in a global coordinate frame, given 3-D poses and locations estimated in prior frames with inaccuracy. The proposed network is able to predict poses and global locations for multiple pedestrians simultaneously, for pedestrians up to 45 m from the cameras (urban intersection scale). The outputs of the proposed network are full-body 3-D meshes represented in skinned multiperson linear model parameters. The proposed approach relies on a novel objective function that incorporates the periodicity of human walking (gait), the mirror symmetry of the human body, and the change of ground reaction forces in a human gait cycle. This letter presents prediction results on the PedX dataset, a large-scale, in-the-wild data set collected at real urban intersections with heavy pedestrian traffic. Results showthat the proposed network can successfully learn the characteristics of pedestrian gait and produce accurate and consistent 3-D pose predictions.

AB This paper investigates the effectiveness of multipath-decorrelating antenna motion in reducing the initialization time of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers employing low-cost single-frequency antennas for carrier-phase differential GNSS (CDGNSS) positioning. Fast initialization times with low-cost antennas will encourage the expansion of CDGNSS into the mass market, bringing the benefits of globally referenced centimeter-accurate positioning to many consumer applications, such as augmented reality and autonomous vehicles, that have so far been hampered by the several-meter-level errors of traditional GNSS positioning. Poor multipath suppression common to low-cost antennas results in large and strongly time-correlated phase errors when a receiver is static. Such errors can result in the CDGNSS initialization time, the so-called time to ambiguity resolution (TAR), extending to hundreds of seconds-many times longer than for higher cost survey-grade antennas, which have substantially better multipath suppression. This paper demon-strates that TAR can be significantly reduced through antenna motion, particularly gentle wavelength-scale random antenna motion. Such motion acts to decrease the correlation time of the multipath-induced phase errors. A priori knowledge of the motion profile is shown to further reduce TAR, with the reduction shown to be more pronounced as the initialization scenario is more challenging.

AB In ice-covered seas, traditional air-side oil spill detection methods face practical challenges. Conversely, under-ice remote sensing techniques are increasingly viable due to improving operational capabilities of autonomous and remotely operated vehicles. To investigate the potential for under-ice detection of oil spills using active acoustics, laboratory measurements of high-frequency, broadband backscatter (75-590 kHz) from crude oil layers (0.7-8.1 cm) under and encapsulated within sea ice were performed at normal and 20 degrees incidence angles. Discrete interfaces (water-oil, oil-ice, and ice-oil) are identifiable in observations following oil injections under the ice and during the subsequent encapsulation. A one-dimensional model for the total normal incidence backscatter from oil under ice, constrained by oil sound speed measurements from - 10 degrees C to 20 degrees C and improved environmental measurements compared to previous studies, agrees well with preencapsulation observations. At 20 degrees incidence angles echoes from the ice and oil under ice are more complex and spatially variable than normal incidence observations, most likely due to interface roughness and volume inhomogeneities. Encapsulated oil layers are only detected at normal incidence. The results suggest that high-frequency, broadband backscatter techniques may allow under-ice remote sensing for the detection and quantification of oil spills.

AB The Internet is a huge complex network, consisting of tens thousands of Autonomous Systems (ASes). Being a logical fabric of the Internet, the AS-level topology serves as a manageable and useful vehicle for the study of Internet characteristics. However, Internet exchange points (IXPs) have been ignored in previous studies despite of being one of the primary mechanisms for AS interconnections and playing an important role for improving data traffic. In this paper, a novel bi-layered network model is proposed to present an IXP AS topology. The bi-layered network is built based on the actual architecture, from which a comprehensive study of current AS ecosystem and the impacts of IXP can be made. As revealed by network metrics applied onto the bi-layered network, IXP is always of higher centrality as compared with ASes, well matching its role. By comparing the results in 2009 and 2014, rapid growth in IXP number, membership and impacts are noticed. There are over 98% source destination pairs routes (with shortest path routing protocol) affected by IXP in 2014. Our results also show that, being an IXP member is more favorable than being a non-member, hence it attracts many ASes, especially those with low centrality, in recent years. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB It is difficult for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to obtain accurate aided position information in many locations because of underwater conditions. The velocity accuracy from the Doppler velocity log (DVL) is a key element in deciding the AUV position accuracy when the integration system of Strapdown Inertial Navigation System/DVL/Magnetic Compass/Press Sensor (SINS/DVL/MCP/PS) is adopted. However, random noise and sudden noise in DVL caused by sound scattering, fishing populations, and seafloor gullies introduce level attitude errors and accumulate as position error. To restrain random noise, a velocity tracing method is designed based on the constant velocity model and the assumption of slow motion of AUV. To address sudden noise, a fault diagnosis method based on the
   [GRAPHICS]
   rule is introduced to judge sudden changes from innovation. When a sudden change occurs, the time update of the velocity from the tracing model is used for data fusion instead of the velocity from DVL. Simulation test results indicate that with this velocity tracing algorithm, random noise in the DVL can be effectively restrained. The level attitude accuracy and the level position accuracy are also improved with the time update of the velocity when the sudden change occurs.

AB The Brazilian Agrarian Reform Program has subsidized the settlement of over 425,000 destitute families on previously unproductive land in what has become a very effective vehicle for social inclusion and productivity growth for those settlers who reach the final stage of the process and receive definitive title to the land. Unfortunately, there is a large difference in efficiency and productivity between more and less successful settlements - fewer than 10% of relocated families have received title and over 25% of them have abandoned the property to which they were assigned. This paper presents a decision support methodology for increasing the efficiency of public investments in agrarian reform that includes a data envelopment analysis model and a mechanism for building consensus among the various constituencies of the agrarian reform process, who not infrequently have conflicting objectives. The OR model described herein uses principal component analysis and data envelopment analysis to identify the most important success factors for relocated families leading to an increase in the chance of both autonomous integration with the market economy and definitive entitlement by these displaced families as well as an increase in the predictability of future settlement success. The model was implemented successfully in Rio Grande do Sul, the southernmost state of Brazil, and was partially used in a pilot project for the countrywide agrarian reform accelerated consolidation program.

TI Navigation satellite systems: Present and future
SO NOUVELLE REVUE AERONAUTIQUE ASTRONAUTIQUE

DT Article
AB The author analyzes the deficiencies of the present navigation systems and procedures, both for locating aircraft and to answer the needs of competition.
   He then explains how GPS is a true ''revolution'' and discusses the application of this system to light and commercial aviation. he evokes the extension of the present CPS potentials: differential GPS (D-GPS), GPS Landing System, Kinematic GPS Landing System, OMNI Marker.
   Analyzing the current situation, which concerns the GNSS-1 and GNSS-2 systems and the CE-GPS European programme, he presents the following conclusions.
   TOWARDS A SINGLE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
   ''The proof is given that a satellite based system allows for precise navigation and, with the addition of a few ground installations, will make it possible in the near future to practice CAT II landings; obviously, the four criteria for the approval of an ''aeronautical system: viz., precision, integrity, availability, and continuity will have to be verified Such an evolution will have very positive consequences: i) precision shared by all aeronautical vehicles;
   ii) simplification of on-board equipment, diminution of the vehicle-borne weight, simplification of position land speed) readings, simplification of maintenance (important during stop-overs);
   iii) simplification of ground equipements;
   iv) de facto adoption of an universal reference grid (WGS-84). The present situation - GPS managed by a single county is unacceptable in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to stress our will for cooperation for both the definition of the future system (GNSS-2) and its exploitation; the latter implies multinational financing, but not necessarily multinational management: one country could be entrusted by the other countries with the management of the system, but a multinational management council is an ;absolute necessity [...]''.
   TOWARDS THE CONCEPT OF THE ''AUTONOMOUS AIRCRAFT'' ''Two or three years ago, before the actual emergence of GPS, the concept of the autonomous aircraft, le., free from airways, was a pipe dream. 'In ten or twenty years, may be, the aircraft will navigate without constraints''.
   Today, this dream is becoming a reality thanks to the CNS concept, particularly its ADS component, and on board computers (FMS, FMGC). Obviously, in the vicinity of airports areas, aircraft will still be under the guidance of a ground controller, because we cannot imagine that planes will arrange themselves for optimal landing sequencing. Descent will probably remain ground guided. However, after take off and initial climb, the choice for the climb end and the whole cruise will be left to the initiative of the crew It will choose its route depending on the criteria imposed by the company. These criteria could vary and tend towards either catching up in the schedule or minimal fuel consumption (without wind, this would be either orthodromy or loxodromy).
   The problem remains of collision avoidance, more precisely mid-air collision avoidance (the problem of collision with the relief will be solved by the use of digital maps in the WCS-84 grid with, probably, a mesh of less than 100 x 100 so. meters for the whole world.[...].''
   Two systems can be envisioned:
   automatic transmission of postion (and speed) of near-by aircraft by the ADS sob-system of CNS;
   the A-GAS sob-systems.

AB Underground fluid storage is gaining increasing attention as a means to balance energy production and consumption, ensure energy supply security, and contribute to greenhouse gas reduction in the atmosphere by CO2 geological sequestration. However, underground fluid storage generates pressure changes, which in turn induce stress variations and rock deformations. Numerical geomechanical models are typically used to predict the response of a given storage to fluid injection and withdrawal, but validation is required for such a model to be considered reliable. This paper focuses on the technology and methodology that we developed to monitor seabed movements and verify the predictions of the impact caused by offshore underground fluid storage. To this end, we put together a measurement system, integrated into an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle, to periodically monitor the seabed bathymetry. Measurements repeated during and after storage activities can be compared with the outcome of numerical simulations and indirectly confirm the existence of safety conditions. To simulate the storage system response to fluid storage, we applied the Virtual Element Method. To illustrate and discuss our methodology, we present a possible application to a depleted gas reservoir in the Adriatic Sea, Italy, where several underground geological formations could be potentially converted into storage in the future.

AB The deployment of artificial intelligence from experimental settings to concrete applications implies to consider the social aspects of the environment and consequently to conceive the interaction between humans and computers endowed with the aim of being partners in action. This article proposes a review of the research initiatives regarding human-artificial agents interaction, including eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and HRI/HCI. We argue that even if vocabulary and approaches are different, the concepts converge on the necessity for the artificial agents to provide an accurate mental model of their behavior to the humans they are interacting with. This has different implications depending on whether we consider a tool/user interaction or a cooperation interaction-which is far less documented despite being at the heart of the future concepts of autonomous vehicles. From this observation, the article uses the cognitive science corpus on joint-action to raise finer cognitive mechanisms proved to be essential for human joint-action which could be considered as cognitive requirements for future artificial agents, including shared task representation and mentalization. Finally, interactions content hypotheses are arisen to satisfy the identified mechanisms, including the ability for the artificial agent to elicit its intentions and to trigger mentalization toward them from the human cooperators.

AB The backswimmer is an aquatic insect, capable of regulating its buoyancy underwater. When it enters the water, it entraps an air bubble in a superhydrophobic hairy structure covering its abdomen. While this bubble is mainly used for respiration, it also functions as an external inflatable gas reservoir for buoyancy regulation. Namely, hemoglobin is used to store and release oxygen to the entrapped bubble, reversibly. This way, it can reach neutral buoyancy without further energy consumption. Herein, a small, centimeter-scale, backswimmer-inspired untethered robot (BackBot) with autobuoyancy regulation through controlled nucleation and release of microbubbles is developed. The bubbles nucleate and grow directly on onboard electrodes through electrolysis, regulated by low voltage. A bubble-entrapping 3D-printed canopy is introduced to create a stable external gas reservoir. To reduce buoyancy forces, the bubbles are released through linear mechanical vibrations of the canopy, decoupled from the robot's body. Through pressure sensing and a proportional integral derivative control loop mechanism, the robot autoregulates its buoyancy to reach neutral floatation underwater within seconds. This mechanism can promote the replacement of traditional, and physically larger, buoyancy regulation systems such as pistons and pressurized tanks, and enables the miniaturization of autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB In recent years, with the rise of Internet of Things (IoT), a majority of smart technologies, such as autonomous vehicles, smart healthcare, and urban surveillance, require a huge number of images of high quality and resolution. Currently, image superresolution reconstruction technologies are widely used for obtaining high quality images. Unfortunately, the existing methods generally focus on the whole image without highlighting foreground information and lack visual focus. Also, they have low utilization of shallow features and numerous training parameters. In this paper, we propose a feature extraction module that focuses on foreground information: the parallel attention module (PAM). PAM computes channel and spatial attention in parallel, inputs the obtained attention values into a cascaded gated network, and dynamically adjusts the weights of both using nonuniform joint loss to focus on image foreground information and detail features to improve the reconstructed image's foreground sharpness. To further improve the performance, we propose to connect multiple PAM modules in series with skip connections and call it PAMNet. PAMNet can better leverage the shallow residual features, and the reconstructed images are closer to ground truth. Thereby, the applications in the urban image processing IoT systems can obtain high-resolution images more quickly and precisely. The comprehensive experimental results show that PAMNet performs better than the state-of-the-art technologies.

AB When humans and robots operate in and occupy the same local space, proximity detection and proactive collision avoidance is of high importance. As legged robots, such as the Boston Dynamics (BD) Spot, start to appear in real-world application environments, ensuring safe robot-human interactions while operating in full autonomy mode becomes a critical gate-keeping technology for trust in robotic workers. Towards that problem, this article proposes a track-and-avoid architecture for legged robots that combines a visual object detection and estimation pipeline with a Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) based on the Optimization Engine, capable of generating trajectories that satisfy the avoidance and tracking problems in real-time operations where the computation time never exceeded 40 ms. The system is experimentally evaluated using the BD Spot, in a custom sensor and computational suite, and in fully autonomous operational conditions, for the robot-human safety scenario of quickly moving noncooperative obstacles. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the scheme in multiple scenarios where the maximum safety distance violation was only 9 cm for an obstacle moving at 2.5 m/s while affected by both state estimation and object detection uncertainty and noise.

ID PREDICTION
AB It is important for underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) to satisfy the diverse monitoring demands in harsh and perilous three-dimensional underwater environments. After the monitoring missions and demands transform, a large number of underwater event coverage holes will appear. Traditional network repair strategies cannot be applied to the ever-changing underwater monitoring missions and the harsh multi-constrained three-dimensional underwater environments. Multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (multi-AUVs) have strong adaptability and flexibility in perilous and harsh three-dimensional underwater environments. First, an underwater event coverage hole (UECH) repair model under various constraints is proposed. Next, a multi-agent event coverage hole repair algorithm (MECHR), which combines multi-agent strategy with diversity archive strategy, is proposed to repair UECHs in UWSNs. The presented algorithm symmetrically completes subtasks through information exchange and interactive operations with other agents. Unlike existing repair strategies, the MECHR algorithm can effectively repair a large number of UECHs resulted by the transformations in underwater monitoring scenes and demands. The MECHR algorithm can adapt to a wide range of harsh scenes and multi-constrained three-dimensional underwater environments. Eventually, the effect of the MECHR algorithm is verified through underwater repair simulation experiments, which can adapt to the constantly changing three-dimensional underwater monitoring environments.

AB This paper considers a city with a large fleet of plug-in electric taxis (PETs) and studies the charging coordination problem of the fleet. The goal is to reduce charging cost for each PET, defined as the loss of service income caused by charging, by wisely choosing when and where to charge. Considering the fact that the fleet can contain thousands of autonomous PETs, this problem is approached in a distributed way. In detail, a two-stage decision process is designed for each PET in an online fashion upon receiving real-time information. In the first stage, a thresholding method is proposed to assist a PET driver in choosing a proper time slot for charging, with comprehensive consideration of state of charge of PET, time varying income, and queuing status at charging stations (CSs). In the second stage, a game-theoretical approach is devised for PETs to select CSs, so that the traveling and queuing time of each PET can be reduced with fairness. Extensive numerical simulations illustrate the following threefold benefits of the proposed approach: it can effectively reduce the charging cost for PETs, enhance the utilization ratio for CSs, and also flatten the unevenness of charging request for power grid.

AB The state-of-the-art conception of a bionic/robotic eye is a somewhat bulky multipart system comprising a video camera connected to a processing unit that in turn communicates data through a wireless transmitter to either an in vivo retinal implant or a computer system. An artificial cogni-retina is a millimeter-scale, intelligent apparatus designed as a replacement for these systems, while executing simple image processing tasks. As a bionic limb, it can connect directly to the optic nerve and perform rudimentary cognitive functions such as perceiving, learning, remembering, and classifying elementary visual data. This theoretical system presents a quantum leap in terms of size, power consumption, and speed to both prosthetic human eyes and robotic vision in artificial intelligence-based platforms such as autonomous vehicles. Recently, an increasing number of publications have used interesting materials in artificial synaptic devices that drive this idea closer toward becoming a real-world application. Such devices may form a basis for hardware-based deep learning artificial neural networks that can potentially execute image processing tasks within a single clock cycle compared to software algorithms running on conventional von Neumann machines that require millions of cycles to perform image sensor interfacing, memory fetch operations, and data path propagation.

AB In the development of beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems, communication between the UAVs and the ground control station (GCS) is of critical importance. The commonly used economical wireless modules are restricted by the short communication range and are easily blocked by obstacles. The use of a communication relay system provides a practical way to solve these problems, improving the performance of UAV communication in BLOS and cross-obstacle operations. In this study, a communication relay system, in which a quadrotor was used to relay radio communication for another quadrotor was developed and tested. First, the UAVs used as the airborne platform were constructed, and the hardware for the communication relay system was selected and built up. Second, a set of software programs and protocol for autonomous mission control, communication relay control, and ground control were developed. Finally, the system was fully integrated into the airborne platform and tested both indoor and in-flight. The Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) and noise value in two typical application scenarios were recorded. The test results demonstrated the ability of this system to extend the communication range and build communication over obstacles. This system also shows the feasibility to coordinate multiple UAVs' communication with the same relay structure.

AB In order to enable long-term operation of autonomous vehicles in industrial environments numerous challenges need to be addressed. A basic requirement for many applications is the creation and maintenance of consistent 3D world models. This article proposes a novel 3D spatial representation for online real-world mapping, building upon two known representations: normal distributions transform (NDT) maps and occupancy grid maps. The proposed normal distributions transform occupancy map (NDT-OM) combines the advantages of both representations; compactness of NDT maps and robustness of occupancy maps. One key contribution in this article is that we formulate an exact recursive updates for NDT-OMs. We show that the recursive update equations provide natural support for multi-resolution maps. Next, we describe a modification of the recursive update equations that allows adaptation in dynamic environments. As a second key contribution we introduce NDT-OMs and formulate the occupancy update equations that allow to build consistent maps in dynamic environments. The update of the occupancy values are based on an efficient probabilistic sensor model that is specially formulated for NDT-OMs. In several experiments with a total of 17 hours of data from a milk factory we demonstrate that NDT-OMs enable real-time performance in large-scale, long-term industrial setups.

AB The information processing capabilities of the lateral line system and its potential utility in surveying foreign environments and providing sensory guidance to autonomous vehicles in dark or highly turbulent conditions is reviewed. The lateral line is a spatially-distributed system of directionally-sensitive sensors that respond to low-frequency water motions created by nearby moving sources, the animal's own movements, the ambient motions of the surrounding water, and distortions in ambient or self-generated motions caused by the presence of stationary objects. While lateral line sensors on the skin surface appear to serve behaviors dependent on large-scale stimuli, such as upstream orientation to bulk water flow, other sensors enclosed in fluid-filled canals appear to subserve behaviors requiring information about fine spatial details, such as prey localization. Stimulation patterns along sensor arrays provide rich information about the location, distance and direction of moving sources. The lateral line system has also evolved several different mechanisms-static biomechanical filters at the periphery and dynamic neural filters in the central nervous system-for enhancing signal-to-noise ratios in different behavioral contexts, ranging from unexpected events of importance (e.g., an approaching predator or prey) to expected events of little relevance (e.g., the animal's own repeated and regular breathing movements).

AB The technology of autonomous vehicle (AV) is critical in nowadays Intelligent Transportation Systems. To achieve the fully automated operation for AVs, one important prerequisite is the accurate and reliable seamless localization covering complex outdoor-indoor scenarios. Although many solutions have been proposed to support AV localization, it is still challenging inon achieving reliableglobally drift-free positioning in seamless urbanthe unknown outdoor-indoor environments. With the current on-board sensors such as( GNSS, IMU, LiDAR, and cameras, etc.), it is difficult for AVs to achieve accurate drift-free indoor positioning and smooth indoor-outdoor transition due to the lack of GNSS indoorssignals in indoor environments. Meanwhile, challenges remain in reliable navigation under obscured conditions. In this paper, we propose a tightly coupled integration algorithm of GNSS RTK, Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) and Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) to enhance the accuracy and reliability for AVs seamless localization in challengingharsh environments. The UWB techniquesystem is innovatively incorporated into the AVs navigation system to extendextent the absolute positioning indoorsinto indoor environments. The stereo cameras are utilized to improve positioning continuity and enhance GNSS/UWB usability in outdoor-indoor obscured environments.The visual-inertial-odometry is utilized to enhance the positioning performance in the outdoor-indoor obscured environments. The proposed algorithm is evaluated over a real-world datasetsdataset in complex seamless environments. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieves 0.411m and 0.077m horizontal positioning accuracy in obscured outdoor and indoor environments, yielding 71.2 % and 18.1 % improvements compared with the traditional LC integration schemes, respectively. The results show that the incorporation of UWB can instantaneously correct the drifts of VIO in unknown indoor environments. The proposed TC integration algorithm achieves 71.2 % and 18.1 % improvements of horizontal positioning in outdoor and indoor tests, compared with the traditional LC integration, respectively.

AB In order to avoid the influence of the test system itself on the autonomous navigation and performance test accuracy of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), a test method for the obstacle-avoidance performance of USVs based on mobile-buoy-shore multisource-sensing-data fusion is proposed. In this method, a mobile-buoy-integrated test system is designed (that is, the test instrument is installed on the mobile buoy). The buoy is both the carrier of the test instrument and the obstacle. The software and hardware functions of the test system are realized in modules, and the obstacle-avoidance monitoring function of the USV is realized by the trajectory-tracking method of buoy perception preprocessing and shore adaptive weighted fusion. Then, on the basis of the mobile-buoy-shore sensing-data-fusion method, performance tests and a quantitative evaluation of the obstacle perception, static-obstacle avoidance, and dynamic-obstacle avoidance of the USV were carried out. The results show that: (1) the tested USV can accurately identify the distance between buoys; (2) the three static-obstacle-avoidance performance scores of the single obstacle, continuous obstacle, and inflection-point obstacle are 74.81, 77.14, and 47.61, respectively, and the quantitative evaluation score of the static-obstacle-avoidance comprehensive performance is 66.4; (3) the obstacleavoidance-performance scores of overtaking, encounter, and cross encounter are about 53.92, 36.51, and 6.48, respectively, and the quantitative evaluation score of the comprehensive performance of the dynamic-obstacle avoidance is 72.36. The above quantitative evaluation results show that the system can: participate in track intervention and obstacle-avoidance monitoring as an obstacle; give the static- and dynamic-obstacle-avoidance quantitative evaluation results in a predetermined way, which verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the obstacle-avoidance-performance test system of the USV on the basis of mobile-buoy-shore multisource-sensing fusion; and be used for the testing and evaluation of the obstacle-avoidance performance of USVs.

AB Automatic emergency braking (AEB) system play an essential role in avoiding traffic collisions and minimizing impact strengths, which contributes to improving road traffic safety. However, the present research of the AEB system is mainly concentrated on avoiding the car to car and car to pedestrian collisions. China has typical mixed traffic characteristics, especially the frequent car to two-wheeler collision accidents. Research on the AEB system to prevent car to two-wheeler collisions in complex multi-traffic scenarios is of great significance to further improve the comprehensive performance of the AEB system. In this article, based on the cases of the car to two-wheeler collisions from China In-Depth Accident Study (CIDAS) database, the effects of three key parameters of the AEB system, braking deceleration, braking advance time, and detection range, on the accident rate and severity are studied by accident reconstruction and virtual experiment. Results show that the theoretical optimal detection range of the AEB system is 180 degrees-35 m for the car to two-wheeler collision prevention. Moreover, the current feasible optimal detection range is 120 degrees-35 m due to the limitation of environmental awareness technology. When the braking advance time is 1 s, the detection angle is 120 degrees, and the detection distance is 35 m, the installation of the AEB system can avoid 22.3% of the car to two-wheeler collision accidents. Meanwhile, in the inevitable accidents, the average collision speed of vehicles decreases from 33.93 to 21.34 km/h, which effectively reduces the collision strengths. Findings of this study could help car manufacturers and makers of AEB hardware select the appropriate detection radar. They can also provide ideas and data support for formulating relevant laws and regulations of the AEB system, future development of AEB system, or other driver assistance systems.

   Two-Dimensional Pitching Hydrofoils
SO JOURNAL OF SHIP RESEARCH

AB Propulsion and maneuvering of autonomous underwater vehicles require a combination of effective and efficient operation at both high and low speeds. The collective and cyclic pitch propeller (CCPP) is a novel system designed to provide the required operational flexibility through control of the propeller's blade pitch. Collective pitch control governs the forward generated thrust, whereas cyclic pitch control governs the generated maneuvering force(s)/side-force(s). In this article, a numerical analysis into the CCPP's hydrodynamic performance at bollard pull is set-up, reducing the complex three-dimensional flow problem to a two-dimensional problem. Through a force break-down model, the CCPP's hydrodynamic performance is related and matched to the operation of a pitching hydrofoil. Analysis of the two-dimensional numerical results can thereby provide insights into the performance of the three-dimensional CCPP. First, the performance of the pitching hydrofoils is investigated as such, relating the generated lift, drag, and moment to the occurrence of dynamic stall. Next, the methodology's applicability and limitations are discussed by comparing the umerical results with recent experiment CCPP work to allow the model to be used for a numerical evaluation of the CCPP's performance. Under the evaluated conditions, testing a range of collective and cyclic pitch angles under bollard pull, the side-force generation by the CCPP is shown to be highly dependent on the generated drag force at higher collective pitch angles. At low pitch angles, the side-force generation is controlled by the lift produced over the pitching blades, and efficient but not highly effective. As the collective pitch is increased, the generated drag affects both the effectiveness of the side-force and the side-force efficiency, defined by the large resulting side-force orientation. At larger collective pitch angles, the lift forces are overtaken by the drag generation, resulting in effective but inefficient side-force generation.

AB We investigated gas bubble emissions at the Don-Kuban paleo-fan in the northeastern Black Sea regarding their geological setting, quantities as well as spatial and temporal variabilities during three ship expeditions between 2007 and 2011. About 600 bubble-induced hydroacoustic anomalies in the water column (flares) originating from the seafloor above the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) at similar to 700 m water depth were found. At about 890 m water depth a hydrocarbon seep area named "Kerch seep area" was newly discovered within the GHSZ. We propose locally domed sediments ("mounds") discovered during ultra-high resolution bathymetric mapping with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to result from gas hydrate accumulation at shallow depths. In situ measurements indicated spatially limited temperature elevations in the shallow sediment likely induced by upward fluid flow which may confine the local GHSZ to a few meters below the seafloor. As a result, gas bubbles are suspected to migrate into near-surface sediments and to escape the seafloor through small-scale faults. Hydroacoustic surveys revealed that several flares originated from a seafloor area of about 1 km(2) in size. The highest flare disappeared in about 350 m water depth, suggesting that the released methane remains in the water column. A methane flux estimate, combining data from visual quantifications during dives with a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) with results from ship-based hydroacoustic surveys and gas analysis revealed that between 2 and 87 x 10(6) mol CH4 yr(-1) escaped into the water column above the Ketch seep area. Our results show that the finding of the Kerch seep area represents a so far underestimated type of hydrocarbon seep, which has to be considered in methane budget calculations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB The assumption of a static environment is a prerequisite for most of the traditional visual simultaneous localization and mapping (v-SLAM) algorithms, which limits their widespread application in a dynamic environment. Furthermore, in many applications such as autonomous driving, robot collaboration and AR/VR, it is necessary to track the moving objects in the environment. In this work, we propose a v-SLAM method that can effectively track multiple objects in dynamic environments by integrating a 3D object detection thread into the ORB-SLAM2 framework. The dynamic objects were detected and tracked in three steps. Firstly, 3D object detection was performed on the current frame, and the 3D bounding box was projected into a bird's-eye view. Secondly, an association for the object is made based on the motion state of the object and the bounding box in the bird's-eye view. Thirdly, we track the object and remove feature points corresponding to the dynamic region. In addition, we set up a multi-view constraint adjustment for static objects to jointly optimize the pose of the camera, object, and map point. Experiments have been conducted on the KITTI-odom and KITTI-raw datasets. The performance of our method was verified in challenging scenarios. We demonstrate that dynamic object tracking not only provides useful information for scene understanding, but also help to improve camera tracking.

AB Electric drones as an autonomous mode of transport are scaling up to transform last-mile goods delivery, raising an urgent need for assessing impacts of drone transport from a systems perspective. In this paper, we conduct systems analyses to assess the environmental, economic, and delivery time impact of large drones for delivery scenarios to pick-up centers between mid-size cities predominantly in rural areas, and deliveries within city limits compared with electric and diesel trucks. Results show that large drones have lower emissions than diesel trucks for deliveries in rural areas and that drones don't compete with electric trucks, mainly due to the high energy demand required for take-off and landing for each delivery. Furthermore, we show that electric drones are an economically more cost-effective option than road-bound transport modes such as diesel and electric trucks due to the high degree of automation, and also provide the fastest delivery times. Our analysis provides unique insights that drones can address rapid electrification and emergency applications due to low costs, high flexibility, and fast operations. However, for regulators and practitioners to realize it as an emission-friendly option it is necessary to determine the optimal size of drones, particularly for use cases in urban areas, avoid very low landings for deliveries, and have home deliveries instead of pick-up points.

ID SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION
AB In this work, we introduce panoramic panoptic segmentation, as the most holistic scene understanding, both in terms of Field of View (FoV) and image-level understanding for standard camera-based input. A complete surrounding understanding provides a maximum of information to a mobile agent, which is essential for any intelligent vehicle in order to make informed decisions in a safety-critical dynamic environment such as real-world traffic. In order to overcome the lack of annotated panoramic images, we propose a framework which allows model training on standard pinhole images and transfers the learned features to a different domain in a cost-minimizing way. Using our proposed method with dense contrastive learning, we manage to achieve significant improvements over a non-adapted approach. Depending on the efficient panoptic segmentation architecture, we can improve 3.5-6.5% measured in Panoptic Quality (PQ) over non-adapted models on our established Wild Panoramic Panoptic Segmentation (WildPPS) dataset. Furthermore, our efficient framework does not need access to the images of the target domain, making it a feasible domain generalization approach suitable for a limited hardware setting. As additional contributions, we publish WildPPS: The first panoramic panoptic image dataset to foster progress in surrounding perception and explore a novel training procedure combining supervised and contrastive training.

AB Real-time communications characterized by low-latency, deterministic, and reliable behavior are crucial for the advancement of emerging technologies. Consequently, Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has been developed to address the distinct demands of sectors such as automation and autonomous vehicles applications. This is currently achieved through various methods that emphasize the scheduling of critical data traffic. However, many of these methods determine routes independently, potentially impacting the schedulability of transmissions. Additionally, there is a noticeable lack of emphasis on the scheduling and routing of low-priority transmissions within TSN. In this paper, we introduce the Optimized Hybrid Deterministic Scheduling and Routing (OHDSR) approach. This method takes into account the priority of communications to jointly optimize the scheduling and routing of Time-Triggered (TT) communications, while also catering to low-priority Best-Effort (BE) communications. Extensive experimental evaluations show the high efficiency of our proposed method. It ensures not only the prompt delivery of TT communications but also the delivery of BE communications within suitable time frames, with a maximum difference of 14.29% from TT communications, meeting their respective deadlines. Moreover, the evaluation demonstrates the high scalability of the proposed approach, providing improved response times compared to the latest work for both routing and scheduling.

AB Broadband, omnidirectional light absorption in the infrared range is critical for emerging aerospace and ground applications, such as machine vision, autonomous vehicle technology, and aerospace telescope. Broadband absorbers (BBAs) need to possess strong absorption through thin structures for high signal-to-noise ratios, as well as manufacturing scalability and service reliability in harsh environment for practical applications. Such requirements rule out many known absorbing materials such as carbon nanotubes that are intrinsically lossy and fragile. Achieving strong light-matter interaction in the mid- and long-wavelength infrared ranges has been extremely challenging despite long-standing research efforts. Here, an aerospace-grade, approximate to 2.0 mu m-thick hierarchical coral-structured titanium nitride (coral-TiN) plasmonic metamaterial is experimentally realized with over 90% omnidirectional absorption across the visible to the long-wavelength infrared range (0.25-25 mu m) using a scalable fabrication method. The broadband optical control of the coral-TiN BBA is achieved by the superposition of the hybridized plasmonic mode in the visible and near-infrared, the cavity mode in the short-wavelength infrared as well as the propagating surface plasmon polariton mode in the mid- and long-wavelength infrared. With conformal alumina coating, the plasmonic absorber demonstrates outstanding reliability in rigorous aerospace-grade tests under harsh mechanical and thermal environmental conditions.

   neural networks
AB Real-time semantic segmentation has received considerable attention due to growing demands in many practical applications, such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, etc. Existing real-time segmentation approaches often utilize feature fusion to improve segmentation accuracy. However, they fail to fully consider the feature information at different resolutions and the receptive fields of the networks are relatively limited, thereby compromising the performance. To tackle this problem, we propose a light Cascaded Selective Resolution Network (CSRNet) to improve the performance of real-time segmentation through multiple context information embedding and enhanced feature aggregation. The proposed network builds a three-stage segmentation system, which integrates feature information from low resolution to high resolution and achieves feature refinement progressively. CSRNet contains two critical modules: the Shorted Pyramid Fusion Module (SPFM) and the Selective Resolution Module (SRM). The SPFM is a computationally efficient module to incorporate the global context information and significantly enlarge the receptive field at each stage. The SRM is designed to fuse multi-resolution feature maps with various receptive fields, which assigns soft channel attentions across the feature maps and helps to remedy the problem caused by multi-scale objects. Comprehensive experiments on well-known road scene datasets demonstrate that the proposed CSRNet outperforms the main-stream efficient semantic segmentation approaches by accuracy and can be performed at a fast inference speed.

AB This paper evaluates the performance of a robotic mobile fulfillment system (RMFS) with multiple picking stations under a zoning policy. Focusing on a single picking process performed by robot, we develop an expected travel time model for the robot considering a constant velocity, and evaluate the system performance according to the travel time. Compared with the data of the actual RMF system from FAW Logistics Co., Ltd, the model developed in this study has high accuracy and can be used to rapidly evaluate the performance of RMFS with different layouts. In addition, by the numerical experiments, the effect of the number of horizontal aisles and two zoning policies on system performance is analyzed. The results show the following: (1) With the initial total number of storage locations determined, when picking efficiency and space utilization are taken as indexes for planning and designing, the optimal scheme can be obtained more directly by focusing on the effect of the number of horizontal aisles on the expected travel time. (2) Under the relevant assumptions and system characteristics proposed herein, when the expected travel time is taken as the index, it is always better to store A-class goods in the center of the pod storage area.

AB The demand for quadcopters capable of stably taking off from and landing on a mobile surface is rising in view of the increasing use of these aircrafts in the military and marine fields. Accordingly, a novel leveling mobile platform with a two-degree-of-freedom gimbal structure for landing a quadcopter safely on a moving target is designed in this work. The basis tracking and landing operation with a quadcopter and the leveling mobile platform are performed on global positioning system (GPS) and vision system. The combined system can track a moving target as well as control altitude and attitude using various sensors, such as GPS, inertial measurement unit (IMU) and LiDAR, mounted on the quadcopter. By utilizing vision sensors, a more precise landing control is achieved. The leveling platform was designed to maintain a level landing surface and assist in the stable landing of the quadcopter. This platform was fabricated because landing may be unsafe if the landing target is moving on an uneven surface. To verify the effectiveness of the above system, experiments were conducted to land a quadcopter on a target moving on level ground and sloping surfaces. When the leveling function was not implemented, the quadcopter frequently overturned while attempting to land. In contrast, when the leveling function was used, all landing attempts were successful.

AB Plate divergence along mid-ocean ridges is accommodated through faulting and magmatic accretion, and, at overlapping spreading centers (OSC), is distributed across two curvilinear overlapping ridge axes. One-meter resolution bathymetry acquired by autonomous underwater vehicles, combined with distribution and ages of lava flows, is used to: (a) analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of flows, faults, and fissures in the OSC between the distal south rift zone of Axial Seamount and the Vance Segment, (b) locate spreading axes, (c) calculate extension, and (d) determine the proportion of extension accommodated at the surface by faults and fissures versus volcanic extrusion over a period of similar to 1300-1450 years. Our study reveals that in the recent history of the ridges, extension over a distance of 14 km across the Axial/Vance OSC was asymmetric in proportion and style: faults and fissures across 1-2 km of the Vance axial valley accommodated similar to 3/4 of the spreading, whereas dike-fed eruptions contributed similar to 1/4 of the extension and occurred across 4 km of the south rift of Axial Seamount.

TI On broadcasting time in the model of travelling agents
SO DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS

DE Broadcasting; Talkative particles; Random walk
AB Consider the following broadcasting process run on a connected graph G = (V, E). Suppose that k >= 2 agents start on vertices selected from V uniformly and independently at random. One of the agents has a message that she wants to communicate to the other agents. All agents perform independent random walks on G, with the message being passed when an agent that knows the message meets an agent that does not know the message. The broadcasting time xi(G, k) is the time it takes to spread the message to all agents.
   Our ultimate goal is to gain a better understanding of the broadcasting process run on real-world networks of roads of large cities that might shed some light on the behaviour of future autonomous and connected vehicles. Due to the complexity of road networks, such phenomena have to be studied using simulation in practical applications. In this paper, we study the process on the simplest scenario, i.e., the family of complete graphs, as in this case the problem is analytically tractable. We provide tight bounds for xi(K-n, k) that hold asymptotically almost surely for the whole range of the parameter k. These theoretical results reveal interesting relationships and, at the same time, are also helpful to understand and explain the behaviour we observe in more realistic networks.

TI Improved YOLOv3 with duplex FPN for object detection based on deep

DT Article; Early Access
DE YOLOv3; FPN; Darknet; object detection; deep learning
AB YOLOv3 is a deep learning-based real-time object detector and is mainly used in applications such as video surveillance and autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we proposed an improved YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) applied Duplex FPN, which enhanced large object detection by utilizing low-level feature information. The conventional YOLOv3 improved the small object detection performance by applying FPN (Feature Pyramid Networks) structure to YOLOv2. However, YOLOv3 with an FPN structure specialized in detecting small objects, so it is difficult to detect large objects. Therefore, this paper proposed an improved YOLOv3 applied Duplex FPN, which can utilize low-level location information in high-level feature maps instead of the existing FPN structure of YOLOv3. This improved the detection accuracy of large objects. Also, an extra detection layer was added to the top-level feature map to prevent failure of detection of parts of large objects. Further, dimension clusters of each detection layer were reassigned to learn quickly how to accurately detect objects. The proposed method was compared and analyzed in the PASCAL VOC dataset. The experimental results showed that the bounding box accuracy of large objects improved owing to the Duplex FPN and extra detection layer, and the proposed method succeeded in detecting large objects that the existing YOLOv3 did not.

ID STATISTICS
AB Traffic signs are critical for maintaining the safety and efficiency of our roads. Therefore, we need to carefully assess the capabilities and limitations of automated traffic sign detection systems. Existing traffic sign datasets are limited in terms of type and severity of challenging conditions. Metadata corresponding to these conditions are unavailable and it is not possible to investigate the effect of a single factor because of the simultaneous changes in numerous conditions. To overcome the shortcomings in existing datasets, we introduced the CURE-TSD-Real dataset, which is based on simulated challenging conditions that correspond to adversaries that can occur in real-world environments and systems. We test the performance of two benchmark algorithms and show that severe conditions can result in an average performance degradation of 29% in precision and 68% in recall. We investigate the effect of challenging conditions through spectral analysis and show that the challenging conditions can lead to distinct magnitude spectrum characteristics. Moreover, we show that mean magnitude spectrum of changes in video sequences under challenging conditions can be an indicator of detection performance. The CURE-TSD-Real dataset is available online at https://github.com/olivesgatech/CURE-TSD.

AB Gelatinous zooplankton are prominent fauna in the deep ocean, especially in the water column associated with the sea floor. This interface zone, the benthic boundary layer, is critical to biogeochemical exchanges between pelagic and benthic communities. A conspicuous member of this benthic boundary layer community in the abyssal Northeast Pacific (Sta. M; 4000 m depth) is the hydrozoan medusa, Benthocodon pedunculata. A 3-year time-series study was conducted of B. pedunculata from October 2014 to November 2017 using an autonomous time-lapse camera system and acoustic current meter deployed on the sea floor. Remotely operated vehicle benthic video transects and collections were also conducted during six servicing cruises for the long-term instruments. Over three years, a total of 123,887 B. pedunculata were recorded in hourly images with densities ranging from 0 to a high of 33 individuals m(-3) in March 2016. Density of B. pedunculata was highest when current speeds were low, and declined precipitously as speed increased beyond similar to 1 cm s(-1). Movement of B. pedunculata was parallel to the continental margin in northwest and southeast directions. The large numbers of B. pedunculata observed over this 3-year study suggests their ecological importance in the benthic boundary layer food web at Sta. M.

AB In this paper, we present and validate the concept of an autonomous aerial robot to reconstruct tomographic 2D slices of gas plumes in outdoor environments. Our platform, the so-called Unmanned Aerial Vehicle for Remote Gas Sensing (UAV-REGAS), combines a lightweight Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS) gas sensor with a 3-axis aerial stabilization gimbal for aiming at a versatile octocopter. While the TDLAS sensor provides integral gas concentration measurements, it does not measure the distance traveled by the laser diode's beam nor the distribution of gas along the optical path. Thus, we complement the set-up with a laser rangefinder and apply principles of Computed Tomography (CT) to create a model of the spatial gas distribution from a set of integral concentration measurements. To allow for a fundamental ground truth evaluation of the applied gas tomography algorithm, we set up a unique outdoor test environment based on two 3D ultrasonic anemometers and a distributed array of 10 infrared gas transmitters. We present results showing its performance characteristics and 2D plume reconstruction capabilities under realistic conditions. The proposed system can be deployed in scenarios that cannot be addressed by currently available robots and thus constitutes a significant step forward for the field of Mobile Robot Olfaction (MRO).

AB This paper presents the design, development, and field results of an autonomous, deep-submergence, depth-controlled Lagrangian camera platform. Called the "Driftcam," this relatively small system has been developed to freely probe midwater acoustic-scattering layers while being used in combination with active acoustics on a nearby research vessel. The system uses a low-light video camera and illumination system installed within a polished borosilicate spherical housing. A novel buoyancy engine, using pressure feedback control, facilitates active depth correction to a maximum depth of 1500 m. Embedded computers command the camera, lighting, and depth control. The vehicle is an acoustic modem for bidirectional communication to the surface tender. Radio direction finding and an Argos satellite beacon aid in surface recovery. In addition, the system is highly portable, measuring 1.5 m in total length with a mass of 85 kg, and has the potential to increase the visual sampling of midwater communities by reducing operational costs. All aspects of the system are discussed with focus given to design, testing, and performance of the buoyancy engine. Preliminary results are also presented for deployments into scattering layers in the Guaymas Basin of the Gulf of California, Mexico, showing the utility of the Driftcam system in the field.

AB This paper presents a novel approach for tracking static and dynamic objects for an autonomous vehicle operating in complex urban environments. Whereas traditional approaches for tracking often feature numerous hand-engineered stages, this method is learned end-to-end and can directly predict a fully unoccluded occupancy grid from raw laser input. We employ a recurrent neural network to capture the state and evolution of the environment, and train the model in an entirely unsupervised manner. In doing so, our use case compares to model-free, multi-object tracking although we do not explicitly perform the underlying data-association process. Further, we demonstrate that the underlying representation learned for the tracking task can be leveraged via inductive transfer to train an object detector in a data efficient manner. We motivate a number of architectural features and show the positive contribution of dilated convolutions, dynamic and static memory units to the task of tracking and classifying complex dynamic scenes through full occlusion. Our experimental results illustrate the ability of the model to track cars, buses, pedestrians, and cyclists from both moving and stationary platforms. Further, we compare and contrast the approach with a more traditional model-free multi-object tracking pipeline, demonstrating that it can more accurately predict future states of objects from current inputs.

ID TRAJECTORY OPTIMIZATION; AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
AB This paper focuses on the three dimensional flight path planning for a UAV on a low attitude terrain following/terrain avoidance mission. Using an approximate grid-based discretisation scheme, we transform the continuous optimisation problem into a search problem over a finite network, and apply a variant of the shortest-path algorithm to this problem. In other words using the three dimensional terrain information, three dimensional flight path from a starting point to an end point, minimising a cost function and regarding the kinematics constraints of the UAV is calculated. A network flow model is constructed based on the digital terrain elevation data (DTED) and a layered network is obtained. The cost function for each arc is defined as the length of the are, then a constrained shortest path algorithm which considers the kinematics and the altitude constraints of the UAV is used to obtain the best route. Moreover the important performance parameters of the UAV are discussed. Finally a new algorithm is proposed to smooth the path in order to reduce the workload of the autopilot and control system of the UAV. The numeric results are presented to verify the capability of the procedure to generate admissible route in minimum possible time in comparison to the previous procedures. So this algorithm is potentially suited for using in online systems.

AB Although bioluminescence (BL) in the open ocean has been extensively studied, coastal BL remains poorly understood due, in large degree, to a lack of BL instrumentation appropriate to measure the fine-scale biological and physical complexity of the coastal regime. As a contribution toward understanding coastal BL, we developed the Multipurpose Bioluminescence Bathyphotometer (MBBP). This compact, self-contained bathyphotometer (BP) was designed to function in a variety of deployment modes, including conventional shipboard profilers, towed platforms, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and profiling moorings. In all configurations, the instrument preserves signal structure at centimeter to meter scale resolution, the scale at which higher-flow instruments might disturb thin layers and other fine-scale water column features. In the MBBP, seawater is conveyed with minimal premeasurement excitation into a light-baffled stimulation and measurement chamber at a continuously measured flow rate of 350 to 400 mL s(-1). A photomultiplier tube (PMT) records light from bioluminescent organisms after they are mechanically stimulated at the chamber entrance by a high-velocity impeller. Calibration and test protocols were developed to determine BL stimulation efficiency and MBBP measurement characteristics. To illustrate the capabilities of the MBBP to resolve the fine-scale structure of the BL community, measurements from two coastal environments are presented.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have drawn increased research interest in recent years, leading to a vast number of applications, such as, terrain exploration, disaster assistance and industrial inspection. Unlike UAV navigation in outdoor environments that rely on GPS (Global Positioning System) for localization, indoor navigation cannot rely on GPS due to the poor quality or lack of signal. Although some reviewing papers particularly summarized indoor navigation strategies (e.g., Visual-based Navigation) or their specific sub-components (e.g., localization and path planning) in detail, there still lacks a comprehensive survey for the complete navigation strategies that cover different technologies. This paper proposes a taxonomy which firstly classifies the navigation strategies into Mapless and Map-based ones based on map usage and then, respectively categorizes the Mapless navigation into Integrated, Direct and Indirect approaches via common characteristics. The Map-based navigation is then split into Known Map/Spaces and Map-building via prior knowledge. In order to analyze these navigation strategies, this paper uses three evaluation metrics (Path Length, Deviation Rate and Exploration Efficiency) according to the common purposes of navigation to show how well they can perform. Furthermore, three representative strategies were selected and 120 flying experiments conducted in two reality-like simulated indoor environments to show their performances against the evaluation metrics proposed in this paper, i.e., the ratio of Successful Flight, the Mean time of Successful Flight, the Mean Length of Successful Flight, the Mean time of Flight, and the Mean Length of Flight. In comparison to the CNN-based Supervised Learning (directly maps visual observations to UAV controls) and the Frontier-based navigation (necessitates continuous global map generation), the experiments show that the CNN-based Distance Estimation for navigation trades off the ratio of Successful Flight and the required time and path length. Moreover, this paper identifies the current challenges and opportunities which will drive UAV navigation research in GPS-denied environments.

AB In the field of ocean energy detection, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) offer significant advantages in terms of manpower, resource, and energy efficiency. However, the unpredictable nature of the ocean environment, particularly the real-time changes in ocean currents, poses navigational risks for AUVs. Therefore, effective path planning in dynamic environments is crucial for AUVs to perform specific tasks. This paper addresses the static path planning problem and proposes a model called the noise net double DQN network with prioritized experience replay (N-DDQNP). The N-DDQNP model combines a noise network and a prioritized experience replay mechanism to address the limited exploration and slow convergence speed issues of the DQN algorithm, which are caused by the greedy strategy and uniform sampling mechanism. The proposed approach involves constructing a double DQN network with a priority experience replay and an exploration mechanism using the noise network. Second, a compound reward function is formulated to take into account ocean current, distance, and safety factors, ensuring prompt feedback during the training process. Regarding the ocean current, the reward function is designed based on the angle between the current direction and the AUV's heading direction, considering its impact on the AUV's speed. As for the distance factor, the reward is determined by the Euclidean distance between the current position and the target point. Furthermore, the safety factor considers whether the AUV may collide with obstacles. By incorporating these three factors, the compound reward function is established. To evaluate the performance of the N-DDQNP model, experiments were conducted using real ocean data in various complex ocean environments. The results demonstrate that the path planning time of the N-DDQNP model outperforms other algorithms in different ocean current scenarios and obstacle environments. Furthermore, a user console-AUV connection has been established using spice cloud desktop technology. The cloud desktop architecture enables intuitive observation of the AUV's navigation posture and the surrounding marine environment, facilitating safer and more efficient underwater exploration and marine resource detection tasks.

TI Effects of transition turbulence modeling on the hydrodynamic
   performance prediction of a rim-driven thruster under different duct
   designs
SO OCEAN ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE Rim-driven thruster; Transitional flow; Computational Fluid Dynamics;
   Hydrodynamic performance; Duct profile
AB The rim-driven thruster (RDT) is an innovative marine propulsion device. During the design process, scale models of RDTs are frequently used and also smaller sized units used in Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) or Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are often likely to operate under conditions where the boundary layer on the surface of the propeller makes a transition from a laminar to a turbulent regime. Accurately resolving this transitional boundary layer can help improve the performance prediction of RDTs. Studies addressing this are scarce and hence the present work investigates the influence of transition turbulence modeling on the hydrodynamic performance prediction of an RDT with different duct configurations by means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The turbulence models employed in this study are the two-equation SST k-omega model and the four-equation y-Re-theta transition model. For this purpose, three duct designs are considered, notably two modified 19A and 37 ducts, and one symmetric duct design often seen in RDT designs. Numerical calculations are performed using ANSYS Fluent 19.1 whilst a verification and validation study is firstly carried out to ensure the accuracy of the numerical model. The results demonstrate that the y - Re-theta transition model can better capture the transitional flow on the blade's surface, and substantial discrepancies are observed between both turbulence models with regard to the streamline patterns near the blades on the one hand and skin friction profiles on the other. The torque calculated using the transition model better fits the experimental data, suggesting that it is more suitable to estimate the RDT performance. Three RDT duct designs are simulated which enable different ways to guide the incoming flow and it is shown that they have an important influence on the propeller performance. The results of the open water performance of the three different duct profiles are presented and compared, along with detailed analyses of the flow fields.

DE AUVs; overall integrated design; digital model
ID SYSTEMS
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have the characteristics of a high performance, a complex coupling mechanism, a compact, complex system composition, as well as high requirements for design constraints, quality, and reliability. In the traditional overall design process, numerous design tools and software programs are used, which results in poor model data sharing, a lack of uniqueness and synchronization between system levels, and difficulty in process tracing. Moreover, it is challenging to meet the technical requirements for close collaboration and rapid iteration of multiple positions. To address the aforementioned limitations, this study proposes a digital overall integrated design method for the design and simulation integration of AUVs and defines a unified architecture and interface for system-level design simulation models, thus solving the interoperability and consistency problems in multiple tools and models. In addition, a model-based AUV system integration design verification method that combines different processes, specifications, and models is designed, and software similar to Cameo, which can provide technical means for system-level integrated design and achieve rapid modeling and simulation verification based on system design solutions, is developed. Finally, a practical system design is conducted by taking specific AUV equipment as a research object, and the proposed methods are compared with traditional methods to prove the improvement effect of the technical route on the equipment and development efficiency.

AB Current trends point to a not-too-distant future with qualitatively advanced interactions between humans and social robots. It is critical to consider the possibility of forming meaningful social relationships with robots when defining the future of human-robot interactions, as well as studying how these interactions will evolve to the point where humans are unable to distinguish between humans and robots in urban transportation. In this study, the advantages of using social robots in urban transportation are prioritized by using a multi-criteria decisionmaking tool, which consists of two consecutive stages, namely: i) a novel fuzzy sine trigonometry based on the logarithmic method of additive weights (fuzzy ST-LMAW) that is proposed to calculate the criteria weights; ii) a nonlinear fuzzy Aczel-Alsina function based the weighted aggregate sum product assessment (fuzzy ALWASWASPAS) that is developed to select and rank the alternatives. The proposed model enables flexible nonlinear processing of complex and uncertain information encountered in real applications. A case study is developed to rank three alternatives with twelve sub-criteria grouped into four aspects using the proposed method. The results show that the most advantageous alternative is to replace people with social robots as safety drivers in level four autonomous vehicles due to their possible impact on transportation.

AB This paper considers trajectory planning for a mobile robot which persistently relays data between pairs of far-away communication nodes. Data accumulates stochastically at each source, and the robot must move to appropriate positions to enable data offload to the corresponding destination. The robot needs to minimize the average time that data waits at a source before being serviced. We are interested in finding optimal robotic routing policies consisting of 1) locations where the robot stops to relay (relay positions) and 2) conditional transition probabilities that determine the sequence in which the pairs are serviced. We first pose this problem as a non-convex problem that optimizes over both relay positions and transition probabilities. To find approximate solutions, we propose a novel algorithm which alternately optimizes relay positions and transition probabilities. For the former, we find efficient convex partitions of the non-convex relay regions, then formulate a mixed-integer second-order cone problem. For the latter, we find optimal transition probabilities via sequential least squares programming. We extensively analyze the proposed approach and mathematically characterize important system properties related to the robot's long-term energy consumption and service rate. Finally, through extensive simulation with real channel parameters, we verify the efficacy of our approach.

AB High altitude platform station (HAPS) communications have made a tremendous impact on recent research into sixth-generation (6G) and beyond wireless networks. The large coverage area and significant computational capability of HAPS systems enable many areas of utilization in 6G and beyond applications, including Internet of Things (IoT) services, augmented reality, and connected autonomous vehicles. In addition, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a cutting-edge technology that can be utilized to enhance spectral efficiency in HAPS systems. In this paper, we exploit NOMA-based HAPS communications and multiple antennas to meet the connectivity, reliability, and high-data-rate requirements of 6G and beyond applications. We propose a user selection and correlation-based user pairing algorithm for a NOMA-based multi-user HAPS system. Moreover, we investigate the codebook design for HAPS communication and adapt the polar-cap codebook (PCC) to the HAPS channel which shows Rician fading propagation characteristics dominated by the line-of-sight (LOS) component. Performance evaluations show that the proposed user selection algorithm is perfectly suited to the HAPS channel and that the PCC provides a remarkable spectral efficiency.

AB Slam (simultaneous localization and mapping) play an important role in the field of artificial and driverless intelligence. A real-time dynamic visual SLAM algorithm based on an object detection network is proposed to address the robustness and camera localization accuracy issues caused by dynamic objects in indoor dynamic scenes. The YOLOv5s model, which has the smallest depth and feature map width in the YOLOv5 series, is chosen as the object detection network. The backbone network is replaced with the lightweight ShuffleNetv2 network. Experimental results on the VOC2007 dataset show that the YOLOv5-LITE model reduces the network parameters by 41.89% and speeds up the runtime by 39.00% compared to the YOLOv5s model. A motion level division strategy is adopted to provide prior information to the object detection network. In the tracking thread of the visual SLAM system, a parallel thread combining the improved object detection network and multi-view geometry is introduced to eliminate dynamic feature points. The experimental results demonstrate that in dynamic scenes, the proposed algorithm improves the camera localization accuracy by an average of 85.38% compared to ORB-SLAM2. Finally, experiments in a real environment are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

TI System noise variance matrix adaptive Kalman filter method for AUV INS/

AB The Inertial Navigation System (INS)/Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) navigation system is capable of locating the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) in real-time. However, inherent errors of sensors, especially the inertial measurement unit (IMU) measurement noise changes during navigation, make the system noise variance matrix unknown and time-dependent, resulting in inaccurate Kalman filter estimates of velocity and reducing the ac-curacy of the navigation system. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an adaptive system noise variance matrix Kalman Filter method for AUV INS/DVL navigation system. In this method, the statistical characteristics of the IMU measurement noise are estimated by distinguishing the AUV motion information obtained by the IMU measurement and the IMU measurement noise by the frequency domain analysis method. The Kalman filter velocity estimation accuracy is improved by adaptively adjusting the system noise variance matrix based on the IMU measurement noise. Six different sets of trajectory experiments were used to validate the effectiveness and applicability of the algorithm proposed in this paper. The experimental results show that the improved KF al-gorithm improves the positioning accuracy by an average of 2.29 parts per thousand navigation distance compared with the traditional KF algorithm, which proves that the proposed method can improve navigation performance.

AB Target detection and tracking algorithms are one of the key technologies in the field of autonomous driving in intelligent transportation, providing important sensing capabilities for vehicle localization and path planning. Siamese network-based trackers formulate the visual tracking mission as an image-matching process by regression and classification branches, which simplifies the network structure and improves the tracking accuracy. However, there remain many problems, as described below. (1) The lightweight neural networks decrease the feature representation ability. It is easy for the tracker to fail under the disturbing distractors (e.g., deformation and similar objects) or large changes in the viewing angle. (2) The tracker cannot adapt to variations of the object. (3) The tracker cannot reposition the object that has failed to track. To address these issues, we first propose a novel match filter arbiter based on the Euclidean distance histogram between the centers of multiple candidate objects to automatically determine whether the tracker fails. Secondly, the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm is introduced to select the winners from the dynamic template set through the backtracking process, and object relocation is achieved by comparing the Gradient Magnitude Similarity Deviation between the template and the winners. The experiments show that our method obtains better performance on several tracking benchmarks, i.e., OTB100, VOT2018, GOT-10k, and LaSOT, compared with state-of-the-art methods.

AB Most sensor setups for onboard autonomous perception are composed of LiDARs and vision systems, as they provide complementary information that improves the reliability of the different algorithms necessary to obtain a robust scene understanding. However, the effective use of information from different sources requires an accurate calibration between the sensors involved, which usually implies a tedious and burdensome process. We present a method to calibrate the extrinsic parameters of any pair of sensors involving LiDARs, monocular or stereo cameras, of the same or different modalities. The procedure is composed of two stages: first, reference points belonging to a custom calibration target are extracted from the data provided by the sensors to be calibrated, and second, the optimal rigid transformation is found through the registration of both point sets. The proposed approach can handle devices with very different resolutions and poses, as usually found in vehicle setups. In order to assess the performance of the proposed method, a novel evaluation suite built on top of a popular simulation framework is introduced. Experiments on the synthetic environment show that our calibration algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods, whereas real data tests corroborate the results obtained in the evaluation suite. Open-source code is available at <uri>https://github.com/beltransen/velo2cam_calibration</uri>.

AB Due to the refraction and absorption of light by water, underwater images usually suffer from severe degradation, such as color cast, hazy blur, and low visibility, which would degrade the effectiveness of marine applications equipped on autonomous underwater vehicles. To eliminate the degradation of underwater images, we propose a target oriented perceptual adversarial fusion network, dubbed TOPAL. Concretely, we consider the degradation factors of underwater images in terms of turbidity and chromatism. And according to the degradation issues, we first develop a multi-scale dense boosted module to strengthen the visual contrast and a deep aesthetic render module to perform the color correction, respectively. After that, we employ the dual channel-wise attention module and guide the adaptive fusion of latent features, in which both diverse details and credible appearance are integrated. To bridge the gap between synthetic and real-world images, a global-local adversarial mechanism is introduced in the reconstruction. Besides, perceptual information is also embedded into the process to assist the understanding of scenery content. To evaluate the performance of TOPAL, we conduct extensive experiments on several benchmarks and make comparisons among state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our TOPAL improves the quality of underwater images greatly and achieves superior performance than others.

DE SLAM; mapping; dynamic objects
AB In urban environments, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) are essential for autonomous driving. Most light detection and ranging (LiDAR) SLAM methodologies have been developed for relatively static environments, despite real-world environments having many dynamic objects such as vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. This paper proposes an efficient and robust. Our framework leverages the estimated background model to achieve robust motion estimation in dynamic urban environments. Based on probabilistic object estimation, the dynamic removal module estimates a nonparametric background model to recognize dynamic objects. This module estimates the probability of the difference of the range values from the accumulated frames. Then, dynamic objects are removed by adapting the sensor velocity from the estimated ego-motion. In the local mapping module, our method optimizes the LiDAR motion considering the dynamic characteristics of LiDAR point clouds. Finally, the proposed method results in a global map with static point clouds and accurate LiDAR motion with global pose optimization. We tested the proposed method on the well-known public dataset (KITTI) and the custom dataset with complex environments, including various moving objects. Comparisons with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods demonstrate that the our approach is more robust and efficient. For example, the proposed method performed an average 0.63% and 0.18 degrees/100\ m errors on the KITTI dataset with 0.96ms processing time that convinces real-time processing.

AB Traffic safety is a critical aspect of transportation. Transportation agencies and researchers have been continuously making an effort to ensure minimal error margins in the road system. There is a growing interest in the Southeast Michigan region because of the active role of original equipment manufacturers in spurring research in the new mobility field and autonomous vehicle technology. As new jobs are created and commuting trips increase, traffic safety becomes even more important. Thus, this study presents one of the first efforts to study crash patterns for Southeast Michigan using machine learning models to analyze and predict crash severity in the region based on various contributing factors. We combine a three-step method of correlation analysis, machine learning predictive models, and spatial analysis to develop a rigid schema for crash prediction. Results show that decision tree classifiers provide accurate predictions and rapid computations. Also, spatial plots of predicted injury severities reveal disproportionate errors in model predictions at intersections prompting the need to stratify the crash data for further analyses. This significantly improves severe injury predictions at non-intersection locations and highlights pedestrians as a main important feature. The converse holds for intersections that identify motorcycles as the main feature for severity prediction. Further results are elucidated in this paper.

AB The motivation for this paper is the observation that combinations of small deviations in continuous performance parameters can combine to cause failure of an entire system, even though no one of these deviations is sufficient of itself to cause any failure. To be able to trace the change of continuous parameters and predict their transfer to non-permissible regions of the system state space, we suggest construction of continuum fault trees, which allow combinations of small, continuous deviations of system parameters as well as discrete failures. The construction of continuum fault trees suggests also developing equation bi-graphs, a causal diagram visualizing and combining all continuous performance parameters. The bi-graphs serve several purposes, one of which is the explication of feedback loops and hidden loops, that allow identification of hazards attributed to the loops as a whole rather than to individual components. Construction of both bi-graphs and continuum fault trees is demonstrated on the example of an automobile engine, the performance of which is presented by an analytical model. We consider the potential for employing continuum fault trees for analysis of AI-driven systems, as their performance is built on neural networks that have underlying continuous analytical models. An example for this is also provided. The general applicability of continuum fault trees is also considered

AB Underwater wet-mateable connectors (WMCs) can be mated and de-mated in the subsea environment, which have been widely used in the ocean engineering. Since the high ocean pressure will cause a tremendous mate and de-mate force, the pressure-balanced oil-filled (PBOF) technology is introduced which can make WMCs operated at the depth of even 11,000 m. PBOF technology further gave birth to underwater pressure compensators (UPCs) which can reduce the mass of pressure housings used in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and can eliminate the influence of the ambient pressure on the hydraulic system of underwater robots. This paper aims to give a detailed investigation of PBOF technology and to develop a resilient bladder used in WMCs. First, the differential pressure equation of the bladder is derived. Second, an innovative finite element analysis (FEA) model involving fluid-solid interaction (FSI) is proposed to verify the theory by using ANSYS Mechanical and APDL co-simulation. Finally, a novel resilient bladder with a simple structure and low-cost is developed, and a prototype of UPC is manufactured to test the bladder's performance. This paper is the first report to publicly reveal the mechanism of PBOF technology in the aspects of theory, simulation and test, which provides the design methods for the application of PBOF technology.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB A balanced dataset is generally beneficial to underwater acoustic target recognition. However, the imbalanced class distribution is always meted out in a real scene. To address this, a weighted cross entropy loss function based on trigonometric function is proposed. Then, the proposed loss function is applied in a multi-scale residual convolutional neural network (named MR-CNN-A network) embedded with an attention mechanism for the recognition task. Firstly, a multi-scale convolution kernel is used to obtain multi-scale features. Then, an attention mechanism is used to fuse these multi-scale feature maps. Furthermore, a cosx-function-weighted cross-entropy loss function is used to deal with the class imbalance in underwater acoustic data. This function adjusts the loss ratio of each sample by adjusting the loss interval of every mini-batch based on cosx term to achieve a balanced total loss for each class. Two imbalanced underwater acoustic data sets, ShipsEar and autonomous underwater vehicle (self-collected data) are used to evaluate the proposed network. The experimental results show that the proposed network outperforms the support vector machine and a simple convolutional neural network. Compared with the other three loss functions, the proposed loss function achieves better stability and adaptability. The results strongly demonstrate the validity of the proposed loss function and the network.

AB Contemporary and emergent automotive systems are heavily populated by complex integrated electronics. The number of safety-critical devices used in advanced driver-assistance systems or autonomous vehicles is growing with high-end models containing hundreds of embedded microcontrollers. Achieving functionally safe automotive electronics requires test solutions that might be costly to engineer. Therefore, to address challenges posed by high-quality and long-term reliability requirements, this article presents low-cost test pattern generation schemes for a scan-based hybrid logic BIST of automotive ICs. It may allow one to optimize test coverage and test time during in-system test applications. The first presented technique deploys a seed-flipping PRPG to periodically complement PRPG stages in a methodical tree-traversal manner. The second scheme is based on a seed-sorting approach that allows additional tradeoffs between test data volume and test coverage. As shown in this article, the proposed schemes can be easily integrated with a test compression environment and deployed in different modes of in-system testing, such as key-off, key-on, and periodic (incremental) online tests. Experimental results obtained for automotive designs and reported herein show improvements in test quality over conventional logic BIST schemes.

AB Locations in railway tracks where significant variations of the track properties occur are subject to increased track deterioration. To successfully mitigate this, the mechanisms leading to the increased deterioration need to be understood. To this end, this work presents a non-linear constitutive law for a lattice model able to describe the compaction behaviour of railway ballast. The parameters of the non-linear connections are tuned against lab experiments of cyclic loading tests and direct shear tests. The tuned lattice can be used with different foundation properties provided that the ballast in the track is equivalent to that of the tests. The non-linear lattice model is applied to the case of railway transitions, for which ballast compaction under train loading is studied as a cause of geometry degradation. It is observed that for the studied cases of a culvert crossing and of a ballast-slab transition, the operation-induced compaction converges monotonously to a stable situation, without leading to significant changes in the vehicle-track interaction. Ballast compaction is therefore insufficient as a stand-alone mechanism to explain a process of progressive degradation of the track geometry. Other mechanisms like autonomous differential settlement at the foundation level must be taken into account in such cases.

AB This paper proposes a distributed deep reinforcement learning algorithm for the traffic light control problem, which consists of local learning and global consensus. Firstly, the reinforcement learning environment for the traffic light control problem is built by defining the three key elements of state, action, and reward. Then, the CNN-based deep Q-network is designed to process the quantized traffic state information to obtain the state-action values. After locally optimizing the deep Q-networks of multiple traffic light agents based on their experience samples, the consensus algorithm is subsequently applied to globally update these agents that are connected over a decentralized communication topology. In this way, the distributed learning agents learn from their neighbors' experience to optimize the modeling process without actually sharing experience data samples. Lastly, homogeneous and heterogeneous traffic flow patterns on different intersections are simulated in SUMO to verify the superiority of the proposed distributed deep Q-networks, with the comparison to the fixed-time strategy, local learning and centralized learning algorithms. The simulation study demonstrates that the distributed learning algorithm without a central server shows comparable performance with centralized learning, which is much better than fixed-time strategy and the local learning method in both homogeneous and heterogeneous traffic scenarios.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB Communications with link distance of hundreds of meters and data rate of tens of Mbps are highly demanded in underwater wireless optical communications (UWOC) between autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and submarines, or among others underwater platforms. In these cases, a high-power light source has to be used and an external modulation must be imposed. Here we present an UWOC system based on acousto-optic modulator (AOM), Non-Return-to-Zero On-Off Keying (NRZ-OOK) modulation and 520 nm green laser diode light source. A data rate of 15 Mbps, the highest reported values of an UWOC system using AOM to our best knowledge, with 9 m distance and 1.53 x 10(-4) bit error rate (BER), as well as the longest distance of 18 m with 12 Mbps data rate and 4.7 x 10(-3) BER are obtained in the tap water, in which an attenuation coefficient of 0.0503 m(-1) for 520 nm wavelength is measured. By adding different dosages of Maalox suspension, different types of water quality are prepared, and the influences of Maalox concentration on the attenuation coefficient and the BER are investigated. It is found that increasing Maalox concentrations would worse the scatter effect of light beam, which further affect the transmission performance of the signal.

AB In recent years, the Steer-by-Wire (SBW) technology has been gaining popularity and replacing classical steering systems. It plays the most crucial role in autonomous cars where the vehicle must perform ma-neuvers on its own without driver's intervention. One of the key components of this system is the steering wheel angle sensor (SAS). Its reliability and performance may affect driver's life and health. The purpose of this paper is to show a test system to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the steering wheel angle sensor in the SBW system during real-world maneuvers and show how SAS parameters such as accuracy of angle, angular speed etc. affect car trajectory resulting in hit cones. For this purpose, a test system was built, with the use of virtual test drives based on CarMaker software, CANoe and VTSystem hardware. In order to evaluate its performance, the errors introduced by the system were determined. Additionally, using the realised test system, three commercial steering wheel angle sensors were tested and compared during a virtual test drive. Their errors were determined, as well as their perfor-mance in the SBW technology and the consistency of the obtained results with the parameters declared by the manufacturer were verified as well.

AB To address the problem of extended target tracking (ETT) with measurement-origin uncertainty in a multipath environment with terrain-constrained motion model, a new generalized version of the standard probabilistic data association (PDA) filter, called MP-ET-PDA, based on random matrices (RM) is proposed in this paper. In the MP-ET-PDA filter, we assume that multipath detections and clutter are possible in the extended target tracking problem, which are prevalent in practical systems but barely addressed in the literature. Further, a clustering-aided MP-ET-PDA algorithm with a reduced computational complexity that makes use of the Variational Bayesian (VB) technique, called MP-ET-PDA-VB, is presented to provide near real-time processing capability in ETT problems with an uncertain multipath environment. In addition to using a constant velocity motion model, a new terrain-constrained motion model is presented for scenarios where terrain-following is required by motion-constrained autonomous vehicles. The posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound (PCRLB), which quantifies the best possible accuracy in realistic ETT problems with multipath detections and measurement-origin uncertainty, is derived as the benchmark for performance evaluation. Simulations results demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed algorithms.

AB A controlled CO2 release experiment was carried out in order to mimic unintended leakage of geologically stored CO2, and to study methods for detecting these leak events. The experiment was carried out at 60 m depth in the Oslo Fjord over the course of one month. During the simulated leak events, the water chemistry was monitored by sensors mounted on stationary templates located 10 and 22 m horizontally from the source, as well as sensors mounted on an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). During baseline conditions (no CO2 release), we observe a strong biogenic correlation between O-2 and CO2. This correlation is lacking during CO2 releases, indicating that the CO2-O-2 correlation can be used as a marker for CO2 leakage. The same deviations were not initially detected by the CO2 sensor mounted on the AUV due to the longer response time of membrane-based CO2 sensors. However, by applying response time correction in the post-processing of the AUV CO2 data, the generated CO2 plume was detected. Moreover, the plume was clearly detected by the AUV using the faster responding pH sensors, where the correlation with O-2 again could be used to confirm the anomaly.

AB This article discusses various approaches to the control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with the aid of different velocity-position estimation algorithms. Traditionally this field is considered as the area of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) application: It became a universal tool for nonlinear observation models and its use is ubiquitous. Meanwhile, the specific characteristics of underwater navigation, such as an incomplete sets of measurements, constraints on the range metering or even impossibility of range measurements, observations provided by rather specific acoustic beacons, sonar observations, and other features seriously narrow the applicability of common instruments due to a high level of uncertainty and nonlinearity. The AUV navigation system, not being able to rely on a single source of position estimation, has to take into account all available information. This leads to the necessity of various complex estimation and data fusion algorithms, which are the matter of the present article. Here we discuss some approaches to the AUV position estimation such as conditionally minimax nonlinear filtering (CMNF) and unbiased pseudo-measurement filters (UPMFs) in conjunction with velocity estimation based on the seabed profile acoustic sensing. The presented estimation algorithms serve as a basis for a locally optimal AUV motion control algorithm, which is also presented.

AB Location information is one of the most vital information required to achieve intelligent and context-aware capability for various applications such as driverless cars. However, related security and privacy threats are a major holdback. With increasing focus on using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) for autonomous navigation and related applications, it is important to provide robust navigation solutions, yet signal spoofing for illegal or covert transportation and misleading receiver timing is increasing and now frequent. Hence, detection and mitigation of spoofing attacks has become an important topic. Several contributions on spoofing detection have been made, focusing on different layers of a GNSS receiver. This paper focuses on spoofing detection utilizing self-contained sensors, namely inertial measurement units (IMUs) and vehicle odometer outputs. A spoofing detection approach based on a consistency check between GNSS and IMU/odometer mechanization is proposed. To detect a spoofing attack, the method analyses GNSS and IMU/odometer measurements independently during a pre-selected observation window and cross checks the solutions provided by GNSS and inertial navigation solution (INS)/odometer mechanization. The performance of the proposed method is verified in real vehicular environments. Mean spoofing detection time and detection performance in terms of receiver operation characteristics (ROC) in sub-urban and dense urban environments are evaluated.

AB Giving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) the possibility to manipulate objects vastly extends the range of possible applications. This applies to rotary wing UAVs in particular, where their capability of hovering enables a suitable position for in-flight manipulation. Their manipulation skills must be suitable for primarily natural, partially known environments, where UAVs mostly operate. We have developed an on-board object extraction method that calculates information necessary for autonomous grasping of objects, without the need to provide the model of the object's shape. A local map of the work-zone is generated using depth information, where object candidates are extracted by detecting areas different to our floor model. Their image projections are then evaluated using support vector machine (SVM) classification to recognize specific objects or reject bad candidates. Our method builds a sparse cloud representation of each object and calculates the object's centroid and the dominant axis. This information is then passed to a grasping module. Our method works under the assumption that objects are static and not clustered, have visual features and the floor shape of the work-zone area is known. We used low cost cameras for creating depth information that cause noisy point clouds, but our method has proved robust enough to process this data and return accurate results.

DT Article
DE Underwater image enhancement; anisotropic diffusion; color cast; CLAHE;

ID VISIBILITY
AB An RGB YCbCr Processing method (RYPro) is proposed for underwater images commonly suffering from low contrast and poor color quality. The degradation in image quality may be attributed to absorption and backscattering of light by suspended underwater particles. Moreover, as the depth increases, different colors are absorbed by the surrounding medium depending on the wavelengths. In particular, blue/green color is dominant in the underwater ambience which is known as color cast. For further processing of the image, enhancement remains an essential preprocessing operation. Color equalization is a widely adopted approach for underwater image enhancement. Traditional methods normally involve blind color equalization for enhancing the image under test. In the present work, processing sequence of the proposed method includes noise removal using linear and non-linear filters followed by adaptive contrast correction in the RGB and YCbCr color planes. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared with three golden methods, namely, Gray World (GW), White Patch (WP), Adobe Photoshop Equalization (APE) and a recently developed method entitled "Unsupervised Color Correction Method (UCM)". In view of its simplicity and computational ease, the proposed method is recommended for real-time applications. Suitability of the proposed method is validated by real-time implementation during the testing of the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV-150) developed indigenously by CSIR-CMERI.

AB The complexity reached by current applications of industrial control systems has motivated the development of new computational paradigms, as well as the employment of hybrid implementation techniques that combine hardware and software components to fulfill system requirements. On the other hand, continuous improvements in field-programmable devices today make possible the implementation of complex control systems on reconfigurable hardware, although they are limited by the lack of specific design tools and methodologies to facilitate the development of new products. This paper describes a model-based design approach for the synthesis of embedded fuzzy controllers on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Its main contributions are the proposal of a novel implementation technique, which allows accelerating the exploration of the design space of fuzzy inference modules, and the use of a design flow that eases their integration into complex control systems and the joint development of hardware and software components. This design flow is supported by specific tools for fuzzy systems development and standard FPGA synthesis and implementation tools, which use the modeling and simulation facilities provided by the MATLAB environment. The development of a complex control system for parking an autonomous vehicle demonstrates the capabilities of the proposed procedure to dramatically speed up the stages of description, synthesis, and functional verification of embedded fuzzy controllers for industrial applications.

AB Passive source localization in shallow water has always been an important and challenging problem. Implementing scientific research, surveying, and monitoring using a short, less than ten meter long, horizontal linear array has received considerable attention in the recent years. The short array can be conveniently placed on autonomous underwater vehicles and deployed for adaptive spatial sampling. However, it is usually difficult to obtain a sufficient spatial gain for localizing long-range sources due to its limited physical size. To address this problem, a localization approach is proposed which is based on matched-field processing of the likelihood of the passive source localization in shallow water, as well as inter-position processing for the improved localization performance and the enhanced stability of the estimation process. The ability of the proposed approach is examined through the two-dimensional synthetic test cases which involves ocean environmental mismatch and position errors of the short array. The presented results illustrate the localization performance for various source locations at different signal-to-noise ratios and demonstrate the build up over time of the positional parameters of the estimated source as the short array moves at a low speed along a straight line at a certain depth.

AB With the advancement of technology in both combat and defensive situations, the requirement of the use of autonomous vehicles which carry payload is increasing. For the different types of targets, missiles are used. The missile guidance system calculates the miss distance and the trajectory dynamics through automated system. Using image processing, multiple types of target can be identifies. The use of image processing in the guiding system to differentiate between the objects may provide the contemporary error correction in the flight path. In this paper, multiple approaches are used for target identification, tracking and control of trajectory dynamics. The approach identifies two targets, a massive missile truck and an airplane. The algorithm successfully identifies target despite colour variances and almost equivalent structural arrangements. Further trajectory estimation of target is done through constant velocity and constant turn models. When utilising motion estimates and detection, real-world success depends on the ability to recognise visual targets. The Type 1 system's main objective is flight path management using the yaw, pitch, and roll axes. A common atmospheric model and a set of equations are used by the missile autopilot system to describe the aircraft. In MATLAB Simulink, a simulated missile attack travelling at 328 m/s is modelled and simulated. In the model, the missile and its intended target came together at 3.5 s.

AB Recently, several 4D radar datasets have been published due to its high resolution and robustness in extreme weather conditions. However, most of the recent 4D radar dataset publications have insufficient odometry sensors, which is disadvantageous for 4D radar odometry research. To tackle this problem, this letter presents a 4D radar dataset with various odometry sensors based on a robot operating system (ROS) framework called MSC-RAD4R, which stands for Motivated for SLAM in City, ROS-based Automotive Dataset with 4D Radar. Our dataset at a glance includes 98,786 pairs of stereo images, 60,562 frames of LiDAR data, 90,864 frames of 4D radar data, 60,570 frames of RTK-GPS, 60,559 frames of GPS, 1,211,486 frames of IMU data and 6,057,276 wheel data covering approximately 51.6 km and 100 minutes of automotive data in various environments including day, night, snow and smoke. In particular, our setup includes a high-resolution 79 GHz Adaptive PDM FMCW Oculii 4D radar, which provides approximately 5,000-20,000 points per frame and operates at a long range of 400 meters with a frequency of 15 Hz. It is expected that the proposed dataset will be useful for researchers working on 4D radar SLAM.

AB Emerging V2X applications, like Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADASs) and Connected Autonomous Driving (CAD) require Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC). Unfortunately, none of the existing V2X communication technologies, such as ETSI ITS-G5 or C-V2X (Cellular V2X including 5G NR), can satisfy these requirements independently. In this paper, we propose a scalable hybrid vehicular communication architecture that leverages the performance of multiple Radio Access Technologies (RATs). To this purpose, we propose a novel ITS station protocol stack and a decentralized RAT selection strategy that uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The proposed approach employs a double deep Q-learning (DDQN) algorithm that allows each vehicle to determine the optimal RAT combination to meet the specific needs of the V2X application while limiting resource consumption and channel load. Furthermore, we assess the ability of our architecture to offer reliable and high throughput communication in two different scenarios with varying traffic flow densities. Numerical results reveal that the hybrid vehicular communication architecture has the potential to enhance the packet reception rate (PRR) by up to 30% compared to both the static RAT selection strategy and the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) selection algorithm. Additionally, the selection strategy exhibits about a 20% improvement in throughput and a 10% reduction in the channel busy ratio (CBR).

AB The performance of modern control methods, such as model predictive control, depends significantly on the accuracy of the system model. In practice, however, stochastic uncertainties are commonly present, resulting from inaccuracies in the modeling or external disturbances, which can have a negative impact on the control performance. This article reviews the literature on methods for predicting probabilistic uncertainties for nonlinear systems. Since a precise prediction of probability density functions comes along with a high computational effort in the nonlinear case, the focus of this article is on approximating methods, which are of particular relevance in control engineering practice. The methods are classified with respect to their approximation type and with respect to the assumptions about the input and output distribution. Furthermore, the application of these prediction methods to stochastic model predictive control is discussed including a literature review for nonlinear systems. Finally, the most important probabilistic prediction methods are evaluated numerically. For this purpose, the estimation accuracies of the methods are investigated first and the performance of a stochastic model predictive controller with different prediction methods is examined subsequently using multiple nonlinear systems, including the dynamics of an autonomous vehicle.

AB Miniature sensors are key components for applications in the Internet of Things (IoT), wireless sensor networks, autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and smart manufacturing. As a miniature and self-powered magnetic sensor, the Wiegand sensor possesses advantageous traits including changing-rate-independent output, low cost, and remarkable repeatability and reliability. A typical Wiegand sensor requires hard magnetic pole pieces that provide external fields for triggering voltage outputs that are called Wiegand pulses. However, the wire-shaped sensing element of Wiegand sensors is the critical issue that limits the design, selection, and adoption of the external triggering magnets. Currently, the widely used pole piece materials are rare-earth magnets. However, adopting rare-earth magnets brings strong stray fields, causing an electromagnetic interference (EMI) problem. In this study, patterned CoNiP hard magnets were electrodeposited on flexible substrates through microfabrication. Origami magnetization was utilized to control the resultant stray fields and thus the pole piece of CoNiP magnets can successfully trigger the output of the Wiegand pulse. In comparison, the output voltage of the triggered pulse acquired through the patterned CoNiP magnets is comparable to that acquired by using the rare-earth magnets. Furthermore, both the volume (and hence the weight) of the Wiegand sensor and the EMI issue can be significantly reduced and mitigated, respectively, by the CoNiP magnets.

AB It is significant to reduce the wave-induced vibration and ensure the safety of the offshore structure. This paper deals with the observer-based sliding mode H & INFIN;$H_\infty$ vibration control problem of offshore structures with nonlinear energy sink (NES) mechanisms. By considering the coupled nonlinear characteristics of unmodelled dynamics, system uncertainty, and external wave force, a more general nonlinear system model of the offshore structure equipped with an NES mechanism is presented. Then, an observer-based sliding mode H & INFIN;$H_\infty$ control scheme for the nonlinear structure-NES system is developed. The existence condition and the design algorithm of the observer-based sliding mode H & INFIN;$H_\infty$ controller are provided. Simulation results show that the observer-based sliding mode H & INFIN;$H_\infty$ controller is capable of reducing the wave-induced vibration amplitude of offshore structures effectively. Compared with the NES-based passive control, the observer-based sliding mode H & INFIN;$H_\infty$ controller can further reduce the response amplitudes of the offshore structure remarkably. In addition, the designed observer-based sliding mode H & INFIN;$H_\infty$ controller is robust the variations of structure parameters and the external wave loads, thereby presenting potential advantages of the active damping control of the offshore structure.

AB This paper addresses a decentralized control mechanism for the homing process of underactuated AUVs. The mechanism can be decoupled into foraging and tracking. During the homing process, the mother submarine is regarded as a Gaussian type of nutrient profile and underactuated AUVs are regarded as agents in swarm. The problem of homing is transformed into the social foraging. In the swarm, each individual has a double-integrator dynamic. Under the proposed artificial potential field, the motion of each individual is determined by repulsion or attraction from other individuals, attraction from nutrient profile and repulsion from toxicant profile. Therefore, each agent generates a collision-free trajectory tend to the nutrient profile. The trajectories can be used as reference trajectories for the underactuated AUVs. For the trajectory tracking, the speed of attitude dynamics is much faster than that of position dynamics. Such characteristic can be naturally treated by time scale decomposition method and singular perturbation theory which allows independent analysis of the dynamics in each time scale. In addition, the stability of the collective behavior of the swarm and the trajectory tracking controller are proposed by Lyapunov theorem. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control mechanism is demonstrated via a set of simulation results.

AB In this article, an adaptive sliding-mode disturbance observer (ASMDO)-based finite-time control scheme with prescribed performance is proposed for an unmanned aerial manipulator (UAM) under uncertainties and external disturbances. First, to take into account the dynamic characteristics of the UAM, a dynamic model of the UAM with state-dependent uncertainties and external disturbances is introduced. Then, note that a priori bounded uncertainty may impose a priori constraint on the system state before obtaining closed-loop stability. To remove this assumption, an ASMDO with a nested adaptive structure is introduced to effectively estimate and compensate the external disturbances and state-dependent uncertainties in finite time without the information of the upper bound of the uncertainties and disturbances and their derivatives. Furthermore, based on the proposed ASMDO, the finite-time control scheme with the prescribed performance is presented to ensure finite-time convergence and implement the specified transient and steady-state performance. The Lyapunov tools are utilized to analyze the stability of the proposed controller. Finally, the correctness and performance of the proposed controller are illustrated through numerical simulation comparisons and outdoor experimental comparisons.

AB Nanostructured Fe2O3/TiO2 composite pigments with improved NIR reflectance were prepared by a homogeneous precipitation method using urea and NH4OH. The optical and morphological properties of the resulting pigment were investigated by varying the weight ratio of Fe2O3 to TiO2 and the calcination temperature. The resulting composite pigment has a nanostructure in which Fe2O3 nanoparticles of 20-30 nm size are well coated on the surface of TiO2 (similar to 100 nm) and the reflectance is greatly improved in the wavelength range of 620-1350 nm. The ratio of Fe2O3 to TiO2 and the calcination temperature were optimized to provide both high NIR reflectance and red color, which were 0.1 and 700 degrees C. As a result, compared with pure Fe2O3 (E-g = 2.06 eV, a* = 22.6), the optimized Fe2O3/TiO2 composite pigment (E-g = 2.09 eV, a* = 24.8) showed similar color properties and improved NIR reflectance by about 23.8%. In addition, the Fe2O3/TiO2 composite pigment showed about 62.7% larger reflectance at 905 nm than Fe2O3. According to a temperature rise test under IR illumination, the Fe2O3/TiO2 composite pigment was confirmed to have improved heat shielding properties. Therefore, the nanostructured Fe2O3/TiO2 powder could be potentially applied as a LiDAR detectable cool red pigment for autonomous vehicles.

AB Path planning is an essential tool for smart cargo ships that navigate in coastal waters, inland waters or other crowded waters. These ships require expert and intelligent systems to plan safe paths in order to avoid collision with both static and dynamic obstacles. This research proposes a novel path planning approach based on the anisotropic fast marching (FM) method to specifically assist with safe operations in complex marine navigation environments. A repulsive force field is specially produced to describe the safe area distribution surrounding obstacles based on the knowledge of human. In addition, a joint potential field is created to evaluate the travel cost and a gradient descent method is used to search for appropriate paths from the start point to the end point. Meanwhile, the approach can be used to constantly optimize the paths with the help of the expert knowledge in collision avoidance. Particularly, the approach is validated and evaluated through simulations. The obtained results show that it is capable of providing a reasonable and smooth path in a crowded waters. Moreover, the ability of this approach exhibits a significant contribution to the development of expert and intelligent systems in autonomous collision avoidance. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Over the past few years, the next generation of vehicular networks is envisioned to play an essential part in autonomous driving, traffic management, and infotainment applications. The next generation of intelligent vehicular networks enabled by 5G systems will integrate various heterogeneous wireless techniques to enable time-sensitive services with guaranteed quality of service and ultimate bandwidth usage. However, to allow the dense diversity of wireless technologies, seamless and reliable wireless communication protocols need to be thoroughly investigated in vehicular networks environment. Henceforth, efficient mobility management protocols that mitigate the challenges of vehicles' mobility is essential to support massive data loads throughout various applications. In this article, we review different mobility management protocols and their ability to address issues related to 5G-enabled vehicular networks within the related works. First, we provide a broad view of existing models of vehicular networks and their applicability to the next generation of wireless networks. Next, we propose a classification of several vehicular network models that suit the 5G wireless network, followed by a thorough discussion of the mobility management challenges in each of these network models that need to be addressed and then discuss each of their benefits and drawbacks accordingly.

AB The muscle-contraction model of pre-strains is employed to study the intermittent swimming gait of a 2D freely swimming fish. The fluid-structure interaction problem of fish swimming is solved with the finite elements method. Benefits of the intermittent swimming and the effects of the duty cycle and the tail swing number in a burst phase are emphasized. The results show that, compared to the steady swimming, a huge energy saving for swimming can be achieved by sacrificing a little speed during the intermittent swimming. Moreover, the fish swimming can be gradually transited from an intermittent mode to the continuous mode by increasing the duty cycle. With a smaller duty cycle, the fish can save more energy to obtain the same swimming velocity. A smaller tail swing number in a burst phase is more helpful to improve the energy utilization rate under the condition of R-duty = 0.5. In addition, the intermittent swimming will have more benefits at the lower and the higher average swimming speeds, and it is very important to have a proper proportion of the velocity bounds for the performance improvement of the intermittent swimming. These conclusions may have direct meanings for the development of biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB Industrial-scale dumping of organic waste to the deep ocean was once common practice, leaving a legacy of chemical pollution for which a paucity of information exists. Using a nested approach with autonomous and remotely operated underwater vehicles, a dumpsite offshore California was surveyed and sampled. Discarded waste containers littered the site and structured the suboxic benthic environment. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) was reportedly dumped in the area, and sediment analysis revealed substantial variability in concentrations of p,p-DDT and its analogs, with a peak concentration of 257 mu g g(-1), similar to 40 times greater than the highest level of surface sediment contamination at the nearby DDT Superfund site. The occurrence of a conspicuous hydrocarbon mixture suggests that multiple petroleum distillates, potentially used in DDT manufacture, contributed to the waste stream. Application of a two end-member mixing model with DDTs and polychlorinated biphenyls enabled source differentiation between shelf discharge versus containerized waste. Ocean dumping was found to be the major source of DDT to more than 3000 km(2) of the region's deep seafloor. These results reveal that ocean dumping of containerized DDT waste was inherently sloppy, with the contents readily breaching containment and leading to regional scale contamination of the deep benthos.

TI H-Infinity Static Output-feedback Control for Rotorcraft
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & ROBOTIC SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article

ID STABILIZATION; ALGORITHM
AB The problem of stabilization of an autonomous rotorcraft platform in a hover configuration subject to external disturbances is addressed. Necessary and sufficient conditions are presented for static output-feedback control of linear time-invariant systems using the H-Infinity approach. Simplified conditions are given which only require the solution of two coupled matrix design equations. This paper also proposes a numerically efficient solution algorithm for the coupled design equations to determine the output-feedback gain. A major contribution is that an initial stabilizing gain is not needed. The efficacy of the control law and the disturbance accommodation properties are shown on a rotorcraft design example. The helicopter dynamics do not decouple as in the fixed-wing aircraft case, so that the design of helicopter flight controllers with a desirable intuitive structure is not straightforward. In this paper an output feedback approach is given that allows one to selectively close prescribed multivariable feedback loops using a reduced set of the states. Shaping filters are added that improve performance and yield guaranteed robustness and speed of response. This gives direct control over the design procedure and performance. Accurate identification of the System parameters is a challenging task for rotorcraft control, addition of loop shaping facilitates implementation engineers to counteract unmodeled high frequency dynamics. The net result yields control structures that have been historically accepted in the flight control community.

AB The effects of depth- related differences in environmental factors ( pressure, hydrography, habitat and disturbance) on the benthic megafauna at the mouth of Kangerdlugssuaq Fjord in Arctic Greenland were investigated using a towed camera platform and autonomous underwater vehicle photographs. Large reductions in faunal density ( 60,132 to 1881 individuals ha (-1)) and increases in diversity ( H' = 0.93 - 2.54), through increases in richness ( ES( 220) = 7.6 - 18.8) and reductions in dominance ( Berger - Parker index = 0.77 - 0.38) were found between 270 and 720 m water depth. Assemblages were separated into distinct shallow, intermediate and deep faunas by multivariate community analysis. In the shallower sites there were high levels of iceberg disturbance, directly reducing diversity as well as creating a complex, patchy environment inhabited by high densities of mobile suspension- feeding epifauna. In the deeper areas there was small- scale disturbance from the deposition of drop stones, but at a relatively low frequency and magnitude, which allowed increased species diversity. Proportions of deposit- feeding epifaunal and infaunal taxa rose with depth, as indicated by an increase with depth in faunal traces. Decreases in faunal density probably resulted from decreased food supply with depth.

AB The Nuclear Europa Mobile Ocean (NEMO) mission would land on the surface of Europa, and deploy a small, lightweight melt probe powered by a compact nuclear reactor to melt down through the multi-kilometer ice sheet. After reaching the sub-surface ocean, a small nuclear Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) would deploy to explore the sub-ice ocean. After exploration and sample collection, the AUV would return to the probe and melt back to the lander. The lander would have replenished its H-2 propellant by electrolysis of H2O ice, and then hop to a new site on Europa to repeat the probe/AUV process. After completing the mission, the NEMO spacecraft would return to Earth with its collected samples. The NEMO melt probe and AUV utilize enriched U-235 fuel and conventional water reactor technology. The lander utilizes a compact nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) engine based on the 710tungsten/UO2 cermet fuel and high-temperature H2 propellant. The compact nuclear reactors in both the NEMO melt probe and AUV drive a steam power cycle, generating over 10 kW(e) for use in each. Each nuclear reactor's operating lifetime is several years. With its high-mobility and long-duration mission, NEMO provides an ideal platform for life detection experiments. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Acoustic positioning and navigation; FPGA; real-time synchronous

AB With the development of autonomous underwater vehicles, the research of underwater acoustic positioning and navigation technology is becoming increasingly important. However, most underwater positioning systems use the traditional acoustic response synchronization method, which leads to insufficient positioning real-time performance and refresh rate. To solve this problem, this article proposes a real-time global synchronization mechanism with high-precision atomic clocks, which can realize one positioning through one-way propagation, so that the positioning efficiency is at least doubled. To further improve the positioning accuracy, an M-sequence-based phase offset modulation method is proposed to facilitate beacon identification. Consequently, a normalized signal matching capture algorithm against Doppler effect is designed, and the positioning solution is fused with the real-time sound ray bending compensation mechanism. Based on the above mentioned content, we developed an FPGA-based real-time synchronous parallel underwater positioning and navigation system, which uses FPGA+MCU architecture to accelerate signal processing operations in a low power and parallel way. The test results in the South China Sea show that the operating range of the system can reach 8 km, the positioning refresh rate can reach 0.2 Hz, and the relative average position error is 0.25%, confirming the effectiveness of the designed system in industrial applications.

AB With the advancements made in deep learning, computer vision problems have seen a great improvement in performance. However, in many real-world applications such as autonomous driving vehicles, the risk associated with incorrect predictions of objects or segmentation of images is very high. Standard deep learning models for object detection and segmentation such as YOLO models are often overconfident in their predictions and do not take into account the uncertainty in predictions on out-of-distribution data. In this work, we propose an efficient and effective approach, Monte-Carlo DropBlock (MC-DropBlock), to model uncertainty in YOLO and convolutional vision Transformers for object detection. The proposed approach applies drop -block during training time and testing time on the convolutional layer of the deep learning models such as YOLO and convolutional transformer. We theoretically show that this leads to a Bayesian convolutional neural network capable of capturing the epistemic uncertainty in the model. Additionally, we capture the aleatoric uncertainty in the data using a Gaussian likelihood. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on modeling uncertainty in object detection and segmentation tasks using out-of-distribution experiments. Experimental results show that MC-DropBlock improves the generalization, calibration, and uncertainty modeling capabilities of YOLO models and convolutional Transformer models for object detection and segmentation.

AB The Ocean Observation Network (OON) is an ocean science and engineering observation platform which integrates underwater wireless sensors, acoustic buoys, submersible buoys, and sonars. The complex underwater environment makes it challenging to place the observation nodes flexibly. In this research, firstly, a novel OON data collection optimization scheme is proposed, which is based on Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) path planning and communication. By combining the Voronoi diagram and K-means algorithm, an optimized clustering algorithm (VorK-means) is proposed to optimize the location of junction boxes and reduce the losses in the transmission energy of submarine cables in the OON simultaneously. Subsequently, a computational algorithm for AUV data collection position is proposed based on Voronoi vertices and communication circles. Moreover, an improved Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm, based on the Levy flight and dimension (LD) search strategy, is proposed and applied for the AUV path planning, which is named LD-GWO. The accuracy and efficiency are validated by applying the proposed algorithms to the Canadian North-East Pacific Time-series Underwater Networked Experiment (NEPTUNE). Compared with the K-means algorithm, the VorKmeans algorithm can reduce the total length of submarine cables by nearly 14%, and compared with the GWO algorithm, LD-GWO can obtain shorter data collection paths under identical parameter settings.

AB The trustworthiness of a cyber-physical system is essential for it to be qualified for utilization in most real-life deployments. This is especially critical for systems that deal with precious human lives. Although these safety-critical systems can be investigated using both experimental testing and model-based verification, accurate models have the potential to permit risk-free mimicking of the system behavior even in the most extreme scenarios. To overcome the CPS modeling and design challenges, the INCOSE/OMG standard System Modeling Language (SysML) is utilized in this work to accurately specify cyber-physical systems. For that, a bounded set of SysML constructs are defined to precisely capture the semantics of continuous-time and discrete-time system behaviors. Then, the SysML constructs are substituted by developing a new algebra, called Enhanced Activity Calculus (EAC). So, EAC helps construct equivalent priced timed automata models by developing a new systematic procedure to correctly translate the SysML models into the statistical model checking tool UPPAAL-SMC inputs. The latter checks whether the system is correct and safe or not. Moreover, the soundness of the developed translation mechanism has been proved and its effectiveness has been shown on a real use case, namely the artificial pancreas.

AB State-of-the-art stixel methods fuse dense stereo disparity and semantic class information, e.g., from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), into a compact representation of driveable space, obstacles and background. However, they do not explicitly differentiate instances within the same semantic class. We investigate several ways to augment single-frame stixels with instance information, which can be extracted by a CNN from the RGB image input. As a result, our novel Instance Stixels method efficiently computes stixels that account for boundaries of individual objects, and represents instances as grouped stixels that express connectivity. Experiments on the Cityscapes dataset demonstrate that including instance information into the stixel computation itself, rather than as a post-processing step, increases the segmentation performance (i.e., Intersection over Union and Average Precision). This holds especially for overlapping objects of the same class. Furthermore, we show the superiority of our approach in terms of segmentation performance and computational efficiency compared to combining the separate outputs of Semantic Stixels and a state-of-the-art pixel-level CNN. We achieve processing throughput of 28 frames per second on average for 8 pixel wide stixels on images from the Cityscapes dataset at 1792 x 784 pixels. Our Instance Stixels software is made freely available for non-commercial research purposes.

AB High-precision and robust localization is the key issue for long-term and autonomous navigation of mobile robots in industrial scenes. In this article, we propose a high-precision and robust localization system based on laser and artificial landmarks. The proposed localization system is mainly composed of three modules, namely scoring mechanism-based global localization module, laser and artificial landmark-based localization module, and relocalization trigger module. Global localization module processes the global map to obtain the map pyramid, thus improve the global localization speed and accuracy when robots are powered on or kidnapped. Laser and artificial landmark-based localization module is employed to achieve robust localization in highly dynamic scenes and high-precision localization in target areas. The relocalization trigger module is used to monitor the current localization quality in real time by matching the current laser scan with the global map and feeds it back to the global localization module to improve the robustness of the system. Experimental results show that our method can achieve robust robot localization and real-time detection of the current localization quality in indoor scenes and industrial environment. In the target area, the position error is less than 0.004 m and the angle error is less than 0.01 rad.

ID SYSTEMS
AB This paper deals with formal controller synthesis for discrete-time dynamical systems. We consider a specification provided under the form of a discrete-time hybrid automaton with external inputs, which can represent, for instance, instructions or informations received from a human user or from another system. The hybrid automaton describes the intended behavior of the system and we first consider the problem of synthesizing a controller such that the maximal trajectories of the closed-loop system are also maximal trajectories of the hybrid automaton. We show that the existence of an alternating simulation relation from the specification to the open-loop system is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such controllers. To be able to solve this problem using symbolic (i.e. finite-state) abstractions, we provide a method to compute a symbolic specification that under-approximates the behavior of the hybrid automata. Then, we extend our approach to consider additional safety or reachability requirements so that some unsafe (e.g. blocking) states are avoided or some target states are reached, respectively. The originality of the problem is that these additional requirements are not formulated over the states of the system but over the states of the specification. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with two illustrative examples from autonomous vehicle control. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study explores the scattering of signals within the mm and low Terahertz frequency range, represented by frequencies 79 GHz, 150 GHz, 300 GHz, and 670 GHz, from surfaces with different roughness, to demonstrate advantages of low THz radar for surface discrimination for automotive sensing. The responses of four test surfaces of different roughness were measured and their normalized radar cross sections were estimated as a function of grazing angle and polarization. The Fraunhofer criterion was used as a guideline for determining the type of backscattering (specular and diffuse). The proposed experimental technique provides high accuracy of backscattering coefficient measurement depending on the frequency of the signal, polarization, and grazing angle. An empirical scattering model was used to provide a reference. To compare theoretical and experimental results of the signal scattering on test surfaces, the permittivity of sandpaper has been measured using time-domain spectroscopy. It was shown that the empirical methods for diffuse radar signal scattering developed for lower radar frequencies can be extended for the low THz range with sufficient accuracy. The results obtained will provide reference information for creating remote surface identification systems for automotive use, which will be of particular advantage in surface classification, object classification, and path determination in autonomous automotive vehicle operation.

AB In recent years, with the rapid development of automated driving technology, the task for achieving continuous, dependable, and high-precision vehicle navigation becomes crucial. The integration of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and inertial navigation system (INS), as a proven technology, is confined by the grade of inertial measurement unit and time-increasing INS errors during GNSS outages. Meanwhile, the ability of simultaneous localization and environment perception makes the vision-based navigation technology yield excellent results. Nevertheless, such methods still have to rely on global navigation results to eliminate the accumulation of errors because of the limitation of loop closing. In this case, we proposed a GNSS/INS/Vision integrated solution to provide robust and continuous navigation output in complex driving conditions, especially for the GNSS-degraded environment. Raw observations of multi-GNSS are used to construct double-differenced equations for global navigation estimation, and a tightly coupled extended Kalman filter-based visual-inertial method is applied to achieve high-accuracy local pose. The integrated system was evaluated in experimental validation by both the GNSS outage simulation and vehicular field experiments in different GNSS availability situations. The results indicate that the GNSS navigation performance is significantly improved comparing to the GNSS/INS loosely coupled solution in the GNSS-challenged environment.

   programming
AB An autonomous mobile robot may encounter adversarial environments in which an attacker tries to influence its decisions. Through physical or software-level attacks, some of the robot's sensors might be compromised-a special concern for self-driving vehicles. Motivated by this scenario, this letter introduces and studies the problem of planning kinematically feasible (and possibly efficient) paths with bounded collision probability in adversarial settings where the obstacles perceived online by the robot display two layers of uncertainty. The first is the "usual" Gaussian uncertainty one would obtain from a standard object tracker (e.g., an Extended Kalman Filter); the second is an additional layer of uncertainty that captures possible sensor attacks and describes the actual existence of groups of obstacles in the environment. We study the complexity of the problem and propose a general sampling-based solution framework that uses the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) to check collision probability constraints along the computed trajectory. We also show how probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) can simplify programming common algorithms (such as RRT and Hybrid A*) for mixed uncertainty. In addition to providing an easy-to-use programming framework, our approach is shown to plan safer paths compared to a Naive Monte Carlo baseline when both approaches are allowed to use at most the same given number of samples to perform collision checks.

AB Parts kitting is a frequently adopted method to feed parts from a warehouse to an assembly line. While kitting allows minimisation of space occupation and Work In Process holding cost at the workstations, also simplifying materials flow and supporting manual assembly, it is penalised by high workforce cost for manual kits preparation. For this reason, automated kitting systems have been also proposed although their practical application is somewhat limited owing to the relevant capital investment and scarce performances of robotised kitting systems. Moreover, economic models allowing a quantitative comparison of manual and automated kitting systems are not yet available in the literature. As a contribution to fill this gap, in this paper a cost model useful to compare manual and automation-assisted parts retrieval and kitting systems is presented. The model can be used as a decision-making tool when planning and justifying kitting systems. The model includes capital investment, workforce, space occupation and quality costs. A case study as an application example is also included to demonstrate the model capabilities. Results show that automation-assisted kitting systems can be competitive in comparison to manual kitting and that break-even conditions can be also identified by the proposed method.

DE Computer vision for transportation; deep learning in robotics and
   automation
AB Recentwork has shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be applied successfully in disparity estimation, but these methods still suffer from errors in regions of low texture, occlusions, and reflections. Concurrently, deep learning for semantic segmentation has shown great progress in recent years. In this letter, we design a CNN architecture that combines these two tasks to improve the quality and accuracy of disparity estimation with the help of semantic segmentation. Specifically, we propose a network structure in which these two tasks are highly coupled. One key novelty of this approach is the two-stage refinement process. Initial disparity estimates are refined with an embedding learned from the semantic segmentation branch of the network. The proposed model is trained using an unsupervised approach, in which images from one half of the stereo pair are warped and compared against images from the other camera. Another key advantage of the proposed approach is that a single network is capable of outputting disparity estimates and semantic labels. These outputs are of great use in autonomous vehicle operation; with real-time constraints being key, such performance improvements increase the viability of driving applications. Experiments on KITTI and Cityscapes datasets show that our model can achieve state-of-the-art results and that leveraging embedding learned from semantic segmentation improves the performance of disparity estimation.

AB X-ray pulsar-based navigation (XPNAV) is one of the perfect ways for autonomous deep-space navigation in the future. Due to spacecraft state model errors and strong cosmic background noises, low navigation accuracy is one of the main problems in XPNAV. This paper proposes a robust navigation filtering method to reduce the serious effect of spacecraft state model errors and strong noises on XPNAV. This method uses state model errors and pulsar observation errors to estimate and correct the state model. And then, to predict the spacecraft state in the next moment with high precision, the gain matrix is adjusted in quasi real-time by using the fading factor to ensure a minimized state estimation error variance in the next moment and an orthogonal residual sequence at different times. Finally, experimental results of multi-group simulations show that the proposed method had significantly improved navigation accuracy. And the accuracy of the proposed method is better than that of $\text{H}\infty $ robust filter and STUKF, especially when the state model errors and noise are great. Under the same conditions, compared with the other two methods, the proposed method has the minimum navigation filtering error and the strongest robustness.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a distributed and integrated method to get a fast and feasible solution for cooperative mission planning of multiple heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
   Design/methodology/approach - In this study, the planning process is conducted in a distributed framework; the cooperative mission planning problem is reformulated with some specific constraints in the real mission; a distributed genetic algorithm is the algorithm proposed for searching for the optimal solution; genes of the chromosome are modified to adapt to the heterogeneous characteristic of UAVs; a fixed-wing UAV's six degrees-of-freedom (DOF) model with a path following method is used to test the proposed mission planning method.
   Findings - This method not only has the ability to obtain good feasible solutions but also improves the operating rate vastly.
   Research limitations/implications - This study is only applied to the case where the communication among UAVs is linked during the mission.
   Practical implications - This study is expected to be practical for a real mission because of its fast operating rate and good feasible solution.
   Originality/value - This solution is tested on a fixed-wing UAV's 6-DOF model by a path following method, so it is believable from the perspective of an autonomous UAV guidance and control system.

AB The automobile industry is set to undergo a structural transformation in the progress toward next-generation industries that involve autonomous vehicles and connected cars. Thus, supply chain management has become increasingly important for corporate competitiveness. This study aims to identify opportunities for improving supply chain performance by quantifying the impact of suppliers on the supply chain. An analysis was conducted in two phases. First, the efficiency of 139 partners that supply automobile components to the Hyundai Motor Company was measured using the Charnes-Cooper-Rhodes model, while the efficiency of Hyundai Motor Company's 540 supply chains comprising partners, subsidiaries, and parent companies was measured using the network epsilon-based measure model. Second, the relationship between the partner efficiency and the supply chain efficiency was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and the Tobit regression model. The results showed that efficient operation of partners hampers the efficiency of the total supply chain. Thus, there may be several partners that are not committed to quality improvement, while the Hyundai Motor Company seeks to promote quality management through win-win cooperation with partners. Consequently, automakers must review their partner management system, including their performance measurement and incentive systems.

AB An AUV(Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) docking test got finished successfully in the general deep water pool lab of Harbin Engineering University. Two major problems got solved. One is reliable underwater navigation method providing accurate relative position information, which is basically needed while AUV approaching. Four green LED lights are fixed around the station and two cameras are installed in AUV's head part. A reliable vision positioning method using two cameras is adopted. Core algorithm switches between combining monocular and binocular positioning method according to the number of image in both cameras.. The other problem is that control system should be designed suited to the docking procedure, that is to say, outputs of controller ensures the declining of deviation between AUV position and center line of dock station. A two-layer control system is adopted considering the underactuated feature of our test bed. The guidance controller is designed based on Lyapunov stability theory. It outputs reference heading and trimming angle according to position deviations in horizontal and vertical plane respectively. Control parameters are adaptively adjusted by fuzzy algorithm. The execution controller eliminates errors of attitude angle employing an adaptively S-surface non-linear function. Pool test demonstrates that the navigating and control system works well. The system guarantees successful docking rate greater than 80%. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB High-resolution vector magnetic measurements were performed on five hydrothermal vent fields of the back-arc spreading region of the southern Mariana Trough using Shinkai 6500, a deep-sea manned submersible. A new 3-D forward scheme was applied that exploits the surrounding bathymetry and varying altitudes of the submersible to estimate absolute crustal magnetization. The results revealed that magnetic-anomaly-derived absolute magnetizations show a reasonable correlation with natural remanent magnetizations of rock samples collected from the seafloor of the same region. The distribution of magnetic-anomaly-derived absolute magnetization suggests that all five andesite-hosted hydrothermal fields are associated with a lack of magnetization, as is generally observed at basalt-hosted hydrothermal sites. Furthermore, both the Pika and Urashima sites were found to have their own distinct low-magnetization zones, which could not be distinguished in magnetic anomaly data collected at higher altitudes by autonomous underwater vehicle due to their limited extension. The spatial extent of the resulting low magnetization is approximately 10 times wider at off-axis sites than at on-axis sites, possibly reflecting larger accumulations of nonmagnetic sulfides, stockwork zones, and/or alteration zones at the off-axis sites.

AB We present a novel integrated visualization system that enables interactive visual analysis of ensemble simulations of the sea surface height that is used in ocean forecasting. The position of eddies can be derived directly from the sea surface height and our visualization approach enables their interactive exploration and analysis. The behavior of eddies is important in different application settings of which we present two in this paper. First, we show an application for interactive planning of placement as well as operation of off-shore structures using real-world ensemble simulation data of the Gulf of Mexico. Off-shore structures, such as those used for oil exploration, are vulnerable to hazards caused by eddies, and the oil and gas industry relies on ocean forecasts for efficient operations. We enable analysis of the spatial domain, as well as the temporal evolution, for planning the placement and operation of structures. Eddies are also important for marine life. They transport water over large distances and with it also heat and other physical properties as well as biological organisms. In the second application we present the usefulness of our tool, which could be used for planning the paths of autonomous underwater vehicles, so called gliders, for marine scientists to study simulation data of the largely unexplored Red Sea.

AB To enhance the anti-submarine and search capabilities of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) groups in complex marine environments, this paper proposes a flexible action-evaluation algorithm known as Knowledge-Driven Soft Actor-Critic (KD-SAC), which can effectively interact with real-time environmental information. KD-SAC is a reinforcement learning algorithm that consists of two main components: UAV Group Search Knowledge Base (UGSKB) and path planning strategy. Firstly, based on the UGSKB, we establish a cooperation search framework that comprises three layers of information models: the data layer provides prior information and fundamental search rules to the system, the knowledge layer enriches search rules and database in continuous searching processes, and the decision layer utilizes above two layers of information models to enable autonomous decision-making by UAVs. Secondly, we propose a rule-based deductive inference return visit (RDIRV) strategy to enhance the knowledge base of search. The core concept of this strategy is to enable UAVs to learn from both successful and unsuccessful experiences, thereby enriching the search rules based on optimal decisions as exemplary cases. This approach can significantly enhance the learning performance of KD-SAC. The subsequent step involves designing an event-based UGSKB calling mechanism at the decision-making level, which calls a template based on the target and current motion. Finally, it uses a punishment function, and is then employed to achieve optimal decision-making for UAV actions and states. The feasibility and superiority of our proposed algorithm are demonstrated through experimental comparisons with alternative methods. The final results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a success rate of 73.63% in multi-UAV flight path planning within complex environments, surpassing the other three algorithms by 17.27%, 29.88%, and 33.51%, respectively. In addition, the KD-SAC algorithm outperforms the other three algorithms in terms of synergy and average search reward.

AB Underwater localization has consistently remained a prominent technical challenge for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The advent of cooperative localization techniques has emerged as a novel avenue for enhancing localization accuracy. The master-slave cooperative localization mode has gained widespread adoption due to its cost-effectiveness in implementation. In view of the complexity of underwater noise characteristics, in the multi-AUVs cooperative localization system, this paper addresses scenarios involving distance-dependent noise in a master-slave-based multi-AUVs cooperative localization system. To tackle the negative impact of distance-dependent noise and the non-linearity of the distance function, a two-step algorithm is proposed that combines maximum likelihood estimation and the Gaussian belief propagation algorithm (ML-GBP) to estimate the positions of AUVs. The maximum likelihood estimation is employed to cope with the interference caused by distance-dependent noise, and subsequently, the Gaussian belief propagation algorithm, based on range observations and reference information, is used to achieve accurate estimation of AUV positions and implement position correction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ML-GBP algorithm outperforms traditional extended Kalman filter (EKF) and nonparametric belief propagation (NBP) methods by enhancing the localization accuracy of the system while exhibiting superior performance in terms of computational complexity and system communication overhead.

AB RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) semantic segmentation provides the pixel-level prediction of surrounding environments for autonomous vehicles and mobile robots in harsh conditions such as insufficient illumination and severe weather. Existing RGB-Thermal semantic segmentation networks with two modalities feature extraction branches and insufficient feature fusion strategy limit their segmentation performance. To this end, this study proposed a novel RGB-Thermal semantic segmentation network with hybrid adaptive feature fusion strategy (HAFFseg). The proposed HAFFseg contains three feature extraction branches to achieve outstanding feature extraction capacity. The frequency domain feature enhanced module is invented and inserted in the first feature extraction stage to enhance the low-level extracted features. A hybrid adaptive feature fusion strategy which consists of hybrid feature fusion architecture and feature enhanced adaptive fusion modules (FEAFM) to obtain excellent feature fusion performance is designed for the proposed network. The full-scale fusion connection decoder is developed to perform multi-stage feature integration and further boost segmentation accuracy. Extensive ablation studies and comparison experiments have been conducted on MF dataset and RoadScene-seg dataset. Experimental results proved the effectiveness of the proposed HAFFseg structure and demonstrated the superiority of HAFFseg over other state-of-the-art RGB-T semantic segmentation networks.

AB The practical usage of V2X communication protocols started emerging in recent years. Data built on sensor information are displayed via onboard units and smart devices. However, perceptually obtaining such data may be counterproductive in terms of visual attention, particularly in the case of safety-related applications. Using the windshield as a display may solve this issue, but switching between 2D information and the 3D reality of traffic may introduce issues of its own. To overcome such difficulties, automotive light field visualization is introduced. In this paper, we investigate the visualization of V2X communication protocols and use cases via projection-based light field technology. Our work is motivated by the abundance of V2X sensor data, the low latency of V2X data transfer, the availability of automotive light field prototypes, the prevalent dominance of non-autonomous and non-remote driving, and the lack of V2X-based light field solutions. As our primary contributions, we provide a comprehensive technological review of light field and V2X communication, a set of recommendations for design and implementation, an extensive discussion and implication analysis, the exploration of utilization based on standardized protocols, and use-case-specific considerations.

AB Internet of Things application in disaster responses and management is a predominant research domain. The introduction of the consumer drones, flying ad-hoc networks, low latency 5G, and beyond 5G produce significant acceleration of this research. The work proposed the implementation of the Consumer Internet of Drone Things (CIoDT) framework for emergency message transfer among smart grid systems and other power sources and enables stable network connectivity in a disaster scenario. A real-life mobility model has been engineered, and the edge-enabled opportunistic MQTT message transfer mechanism is implemented. Also, a dedicated network slice is devised to examine routing performance. A real-life prototype test-bed emulator has been designed to evaluate mobility, message delivery, and flight attitude performance. The results show a message delivery probability of nearly 0.99 in Quality of Service 2(QoS2), and 1.19 seconds of end-to-end latency in Quality of Service level 1(QoS1). An experiment also shows a 94% of coverage ratio in a network slice for QoS2, 84% of bandwidth utilization per network slice, and a minimum of 100ms latency per network slice. The proposed system is highly suitable for mass production of light weight drone network for disaster management.

AB This paper is concerned with the homing process in which a multi-underactuated AUV recovery system tracks the moving mother submarine in finite time in the presence of uncertain hydrodynamic parameters and unknown environmental disturbances. In the homing stage, underactuated AUVs and the moving mother submarine are treated as followers and the leader, respectively. The multi-underactuated AUV system finite time homing problem is converted to the leader-following finite-time formation control problem. The proposed leader-following formation strategy requires only the position information of the leader. The velocity of the leader can be designed as an additional degrees of freedom to stabilize position errors of the formation. A novel robust adaptive super-twisting sliding mode formation controller (ASTASMC) is proposed, specifically the super-twisting algorithm (STA) with adaptive uncertainty estimation. Wherein, the robust adaptive law can compensate for uncertainty with unknown upper bound in real time. Therefore, the proposed controller can not only enhance the tracking accuracy but also reduce the chattering. In addition, the finite-time convergence of estimation errors and tracking errors is rigorously proved. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of theoretical results. (c) 2022 ISA.

AB Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, additive manufacturing, advanced robotics, autonomous vehicles, and the Internet of Things are frequently mentioned as part of "Industry 4.0." As such, how will they influence operations and supply chain management? We answer this question by providing a brief review of the evolution of technologies and operations management (OM) over time. Because terms such as "Industry 4.0" do not have a precise definition, we focus on more fundamental issues raised by Industry 4.0 emerging technologies for research in OM. We propose a theory of disruptive debottlenecking and the SACE framework by classifying emerging technologies in terms of the functionalities they enable: sense, analyze, collaborate, and execute. Subsequently, we review the nascent but rapidly growing literature at the interface between digital technologies and OM. Our review suggests that one way to assess the value of Industry 4.0 technologies can be via their influence on adding revenues, differentiating, reducing costs, optimizing risks, innovating, and transforming business models and processes. Finally, we conclude by proposing an agenda for further research.

AB New applications such as intelligent manufacturing, autonomous vehicles and smart cities drive large-scale deep learning models deployed in the Internet of Things (IoT) edge environments. However, deep learning models require substantial computations, storage and communication resources to run. It is generally difficult to deploy and execute a complete deep neural network (DNN) on a resource-constrained edge device. One possible solution is to slice the DNN into multiple tiles distributed to different edge devices, which can reduce the number of computations and quantity of data on each edge device. In this paper, we propose DISSEC, a distributed scheduling strategy for DNN inference on IoT edge clusters. DISSEC leverages spatial partitioning techniques through fusing the convolutional layers and dividing them into multiple partitions that can be executed independently, and proposes a method to express the dependencies between partitions. It further proposes a search algorithm based on heuristics to produce a distributed parallel strategy with the best overall inference execution latency. The evaluation shows that our strategy can fully utilize the edge device resources by cooperating with multiple edge devices to perform partitioning tasks in parallel. Furthermore, compared to the existing work scheduling strategy, our strategy reduces communication overhead by 20% and overall execution latency by 9% under different partitioning granularities and numbers of edge devices.

ID MOBILE ROBOT LOCALIZATION; VISION; NAVIGATION
AB Navigation in Global Positioning System-denied environments is notoriously difficult for small unmanned aerial vehicles due to reduction of visible satellites and urban canyon multipath interference. Several existing methods can be used for navigating in a constrained environment, but they often require additional specific sensing hardware for a localization solution or only provide local frame navigation. Autonomous systems often include LiDAR and RGB cameras for mapping, sensing, or obstacle avoidance. Utilizing these sensors for navigation could provide the only or complimentary localization solutions to other Global Positioning System-denied localization methods in a global or local frame, especially in urban canyons where unique landmarks can be identified. Information from scanning LiDAR can be correlated with camera pixel coordinates and used to range unique visual landmarks that have known locations. The present work included surface function fitting to reduce ranging error to spherical landmarks since multiple lasers were able to range each landmark. Simulation and experimental validation of the unique camera-LiDAR modified trilateration process was undertaken using colored light orbs as landmarks with a 16-laser scanning LiDAR and known positions. Position error was computed and verified that the position estimate process was successful at varying landmark configurations and viewing angles in simulation. Experimental results verified the process while also providing higher accuracy than a previous method of using a single point on landmark surfaces, for the tested setup.

AB Understanding and predicting human motion behavior with social interactions have become an increasingly crucial problem for a vast number of applications, ranging from visual navigation of autonomous vehicles to activity prediction of intelligent video surveillance. Accurately forecasting crowd motion behavior is challenging due to the multimodal nature of trajectories and complex social interactions between humans. Recent algorithms model and predict the trajectory with a single resolution, making them difficult to exploit the long-range information and the short-range information of the motion behavior simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a temporal pyramid network for pedestrian trajectory prediction through a squeeze modulation and a dilation modulation. The hierarchical design of our framework allows to model the trajectory with multi-resolution, then can better capture the motion behavior at various tempos. By progressively combining the global context with the local one, we finally construct a coarse-to-fine hierarchical pedestrian trajectory prediction framework with multi-supervision. Further, we introduce a unified spatial-temporal attention mechanism to adaptively select important information of persons around in both spatial and temporal domains. We show that our attention strategy is intuitive and effective to encode the influence of social interactions. Experimental results on two benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme.

AB Instance segmentation is an important pre-processing task in numerous real-world applications, such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and human-computer interaction. Compared with the rapid development of deep learning for two-dimensional (2D) image tasks, deep learning-based instance segmentation of 3D point cloud still has a lot of room for development. In particular, distinguishing a large number of occluded objects of the same class is a highly challenging problem, which is seen in robotic binpicking. In a usual bin-picking scene, many identical objects are stacked together and the model of the objects is known. Thus, the semantic information can be ignored; instead, the focus in the bin-picking is put on the segmentation of instances. Based on this task requirement, we propose a Fast Point Cloud Clustering (FPCC) for instance segmentation of industrial bin-picking scene. FPCC includes a network named FPCC-Net and a fast clustering algorithm. FPCC-Net extracts features of each point and infers geometric center points of each instance simultaneously. After that, the proposed clustering algorithm clusters the remaining points to the closest geometric center in feature embedding space. Experiments show that FPCC also surpasses the existing works in bin-picking scenes and is more computationally efficient. Our code and data are available at (https://github.com/xyjbaal/FPCC).

AB Wireless charging is an attractive technology that often promises increased mobility for electrical devices. However, commonly available wireless charging systems are generally intolerant to misalignment between the charger and the receiving device due to the need for inductive coupling between the two, defeating the promise of mobility. Many techniques have been studied to address this issue, including improved electrical circuits, novel charger coil designs, and the use of sensors for detecting misalignment. In this article, a new arrangement of sensing coils is used to detect lateral misalignment between a moving wireless charger and a mobile robot. Data from the sensing coils are used in a dual-loop control of the robot. The inner loop controls the robot velocities and consists of a linear quadratic regulator with integral action. The outer loop provides reference velocities to the inner loop based on the readings of the sensing coils. Using this method, an experimental mobile robot maintains alignment within 2 cm with respect to a 5-W wireless charger that moves up to 0.145 m/s. This automated alignment method is a low-cost solution that enables mobile systems, such as autonomous vehicles, to wirelessly charge while the charger is moving.

AB Active surface morphing is a nonintrusive flow control technique that can delay separation in laminar and turbulent boundary layers. Most of the experimental studies of such control strategy have been carried out in wind tunnels at low Reynolds numbers with costly actuators. In contrast, the implementation of such a control strategy at low cost for an underwater environment remains vastly unexplored. This paper explores active surface morphing at low cost and at low Reynolds for underwater applications. We do this with a 3D printed foil submerged in a water tunnel. The suction surface of the foil is covered with a magnetoelastic membrane. The membrane is actuated via two electromagnets that are positioned inside of the foil. Three actuation frequencies (slow, intermediate, fast) are tested and the deformation of the membrane is measured with an optosensor. We show that lift increases by 1%, whilst drag decreases by 6% at a Strouhal number of 0.3, i.e., at the fast actuation case. We demonstrate that surface actuation is applicable to the marine environment through an off the shelf approach, and that this method is more economical than existing active surface morphing technologies. Since the actuation mechanism is not energy intensive, it is envisioned that it could be applied to marine energy devices, boat appendages, and autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB Space-air-ground-sea integrated network (SAGSIN), which integrates satellite communication networks, aerial networks, terrestrial networks, and marine communication networks, has been widely envisioned as a promising network architecture for 6G. In consideration of its cooperation characteristics of multi-layer networks, open communication environment, and time-varying topologies, SAGSIN faces many unprecedented security challenges, and there have been a number of researches related to SAGSIN security performed over the past few years. Based on such observation, we provide in this paper a detailed survey of recent progress and ongoing research works on SAGSIN security in the aspects of security threats, attack methodologies, and defense countermeasures. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present the state-of-the-art of security for SAGSIN, since existing surveys focused either on a certain segment or on several segments of the integrated network, and little can be found on the full coverage network. In addition to reviewing existing works on SAGSIN security, we also present some discussions on cross-layer attacks and security countermeasure in SAGSIN, and identify new challenges ahead and future research directions.

AB Various sampling and monitoring strategies have been developed to assess marine habitats and life-forms. However, the cost-effectiveness of such survey methods (e.g. line intercept transects and autonomous underwater vehicles) is still not high. In this paper, a practical seafloor habitat mapping method combining a cost-effective survey system (P-SSS: portable speedy sea scanner) and a deep learning-based quantification method were proposed. P-SSS is a highly portable transport system and a towed-type system with five cameras arrayed on its platform. The sea trial was conducted at Pujada Bay, Philippines, on 7 December 2019. The high-quality orthophotos of the seafloor with a high resolution of similar to 3.0 mm/pixel were successfully generated. The attained survey efficiency was 12,900 m(2)/hr. In addition, in this paper, a segmentation method utilizing the U-Net architecture to estimate the coverage of corals, seagrass and sea urchins using a large-scale 2D image is proposed. Overall, this highly portable survey system is expected to become a promising tool for marine environmental surveys, especially in the areas where the rich nature of the oceans is susceptible to environmental changes, such as the remote islands that lack sufficient survey facilities.

AB This letter presents a self-contained system for the robust utilization of aerial robots in the autonomous exploration of cave environments to help human explorers, first responders, and speleologists. The proposed system is generally applicable to an arbitrary exploration task within an unknown and unstructured subterranean environment and interconnects crucial robotic subsystems to provide full autonomy of the robots. Such subsystems primarily include mapping, path and trajectory planning, localization, control, and decision making. Due to the diversity, complexity, and structural uncertainty of natural cave environments, the proposed system allows for the possible use of any arbitrary exploration strategy for a single robot, as well as for a cooperating team. A multi-robot cooperation strategy that maximizes the limited flight time of each aerial robot is proposed for exploration and search & rescue scenarios where the homing of all deployed robots back to an initial location is not required. The entire system is validated in a comprehensive experimental analysis comprising of hours of flight time in a real-world cave environment, as well as by hundreds of hours within a state-of-the-art virtual testbed that was developed for the DARPA Subterranean Challenge robotic competition. Among others, experimental results include multiple real-world exploration flights traveling over 470 m on a single battery in a demanding unknown cave environment.

AB With the rapid evolution and proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) throughout the past decade, industrywide Deep Learning (DL) applications within IIoT ecosystems are expected to rise exponentially within this coming decade. However, recent studies have highlighted the extreme sensitivity and vulnerability of modern Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to adversarial examples. While being imperceptible and benign to the naked human eye, those adversarial perturbations crafted from one-pixel attacks can drastically impact the accuracy of DNNs. The consequences of those adversarial attacks in critical applications such as healthcare and autonomous vehicles can prove disastrous. Therefore, the urge to ensure the robustness and resilience of DL systems against one-pixel attacks has recently started attracting stupendous attention from both academicians and industry professionals. Throughout this paper, we first develop a one-pixel threat model within an IIoT ecosystem and propose a novel image recovery defense mechanism to detect and mitigate one-pixel attacks based on Accelerated Proximal Gradient approach. Experimental results proved that our proposed solution is highly effective and efficient in detecting and mitigating one-pixel attacks in state-of-the-art neural networks, more specifically LeNet and ResNet, using the CIFAR10 and MNIST datasets.

AB Detecting and classifying the plankton in situ to analyze the population diversity and abundance is fundamental for the understanding of marine planktonic ecosystem. However, the features of plankton are subtle, and the distribution of different plankton taxa is extremely imbalanced in the real marine environment, both of which limit the detection and classification performance of them while implementing the advanced recognition models, especially for the rare taxa. In this paper, a novel plankton detection strategy is proposed combining with a cycle-consistent adversarial network and a densely connected YOLOV3 model, which not only solves the class imbalanced distribution problem of plankton by augmenting data volume for the rare taxa but also reduces the loss of the features in the plankton detection neural network. The mAP of the proposed plankton detection strategy achieved 97.21% and 97.14%, respectively, under two experimental datasets with a difference in the number of rare taxa, which demonstrated the superior performance of plankton detection comparing with other state-of-the-art models. Especially for the rare taxa, the detection accuracy for each rare taxa is improved by about 4.02% on average under the two experimental datasets. Furthermore, the proposed strategy may have the potential to be deployed into an autonomous underwater vehicle for mobile plankton ecosystem observation.

AB Smart Assistants have rapidly emerged in smartphones, vehicles, and many smart home devices. Establishing comfortable personal spaces in smart cities requires that these smart assistants are transparent in design and implementation-a fundamental trait required for their validation and accountability. In this article, we take the case of Google Assistant (GA), a state-of-the-art smart assistant, and perform its diagnostic analysis from the transparency and accountability perspectives. We compare our discoveries from the analysis of GA with those of four leading smart assistants. We use two online user studies (N = 100 and N = 210) conducted with students from four universities in three countries (China, Italy, and Pakistan) to learn whether risk communication in GA is transparent to its potential users and how it affects them. Our research discovered that GA has unusual permission requirements and sensitive Application Programming Interface (API) usage, and its privacy requirements are not transparent to smartphone users. The findings suggest that this lack of transparency makes the risk assessment and accountability of GA difficult posing risks to establishing private and secure personal spaces in a smart city. Following the separation of concerns principle, we suggest that autonomous bodies should develop standards for the design and development of smart city products and services.

ID RESOLUTION
AB In response to the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, there has occurred the unabated growth in the number of airborne platforms developed to perform radiation mapping-each utilising various designs of a low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicle. Alongside the associated advancements in the airborne system transporting the radiation detection payload, from the earliest radiological analyses performed using gas-filled Geiger-Muller tube detectors, modern radiation detection and mapping platforms are now based near-exclusively on solid-state scintillator detectors. With numerous varieties of such light-emitting crystalline materials now in existence, this combined desk and computational modelling study sought to evaluate the best-available detector material compatible with the requirements for low-altitude autonomous radiation detection, localisation and subsequent high spatial-resolution mapping of both naturally occurring and anthropogenically-derived radionuclides. The ideal geometry of such detector materials is also evaluated. While NaI and CsI (both elementally doped) are (and will likely remain) the mainstays of radiation detection, LaBr3 scintillation detectors were determined to possess not only a greater sensitivity to incident gamma-ray radiation, but also a far superior spectral (energy) resolution over existing and other potentially deployable detector materials. Combined with their current competitive cost, an array of three such composition cylindrical detectors were determined to provide the best means of detecting and discriminating the various incident gamma-rays.

AB Trust is believed to be a foundational cornerstone for artificial intelligence (AI). In April 2019 the European Commission High Level Expert Group on AI adopted the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI, stressing that human beings will only be able to confidently and fully reap the benefits of AI if they can trust the technology. Trustworthy M is defined as ethical.. lawful and robust AI. Time things strike me about the EC Guidelines. Firstly, though building trust in AI seems to be a shared aim, it is not explicated what trust is, and how it can be built and maintained. Secondly, the Guidelines ignore the widespread distinction made in philosophical literature between trust and reliance. Thirdly, it is not clear how the values have been selected with which AI has to align and what would happen if they came into conflict. In this paper, I shall provide a conceptual analysis of trust in contrast to reliance and ask when it is warranted to talk about trust in AI and trustworthy AI. I shall show how trust and risk are related and what benefits and risks are associated with narrow and general M. Also, I shall point out that metaphorical talk about ethically aligned AI ignores the real disagreements we have about ethical values.

AB Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has been a research focus in recent years. This paper studies the inductor-capacitor-capacitor and parallel (LCC-P) compensation topology to achieve a compact receiver for AUVs. Unlike the series-series (SS) compensation topology, the LCC-P topology retains the advantages of the double-sided LCC topology and has a more compact receiver than the double-sided LCC topology with fewer elements used on the receiver side. The analytical model of such a WPT system is established to analyze the output power and transfer efficiency. The LCC-P topology has a higher efficiency compared to the SS topology due to the smaller conduction loss of the inverter. Moreover, a method of eliminating the DC filter inductor L-0 is proposed to further decrease the size and weight of the receiver. The amplitude of the withstanding voltage on the receiver compensation capacitor without L-0 is approximately decreased by 40% compared to that with L-0. Both cases of with and without L-0 have a constant current output and the peak efficiency without L-0 is about 94%, which is 1% lower than that with L-0. A prototype was built and the experimental results verified the theoretical analysis.

AB Since its introduction in 2008, blockchain technology has outgrown its use in cryptocurrencies and is now preparing to revolutionize a multitude of commercial applications including value and supply chains, business models, and market structures. This work follows design science research to guide the implementation of a blockchain-based proof-of-concept prototype that enables the automated transaction of real-world assets, such as cars, and provides a valid, transparent, and immutable record of vehicle history to market participants, authorities, and other third parties. The contribution of this study to existing research is threefold: First, it introduces a built-in mechanism to reduce transaction risk resulting from the irreversibility of transactions in blockchain-based systems. Second, it replaces a trust-based, centralized, and bureaucratic register with a tamper-free and autonomous transactional database system that comprises a secure registration and transaction process. Third, it proposes a novel approach to mitigate adverse selection effects in lemon markets by providing a reliable, transparent, and complete record of each marketable asset's history. In total, the findings in this article illustrate the potential of blockchain-based systems but also highlight technological shortcomings and challenges for commercial applications, such as scalability or privacy issues.

AB For future driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles, the road course, i.e., the width and shape of the driving path, is an important source of information. In this paper, we introduce a new hierarchical two-stage approach for learning the spatial layout of road scenes. In the first stage, base classifiers analyze the local visual properties of patches extracted from monocular camera images and provide metric confidence maps. We use classifiers for road appearance, boundary appearance, and lane-marking appearance. The core of the proposed approach is the computation of SPatial RAY (SPRAY) features from each metric confidence map in the second stage. A boosting classifier selecting discriminative SPRAY features can be trained for different types of road terrain and allows capturing the local visual properties together with their spatial layout in the scene. In this paper, the extraction of road area and ego-lane on inner-city video streams is demonstrated. In particular, the detection of the ego-lane is a challenging semantic segmentation task showing the power of SPRAY features, because on a local appearance level, the ego-lane is not distinguishable from other lanes. We have evaluated our approach operating at 20 Hz on a graphics processing unit on a publicly available data set, demonstrating the performance on a variety of road types and weather conditions.

AB A novel approach is proposed for multimodal collective awareness (CA) of multiple networked intelligent agents. Each agent is here considered as an Internet-of-Things (IoT) node equipped with machine learning capabilities; CA aims to provide the network with updated causal knowledge of the state of execution of actions of each node performing a joint task, with particular attention to anomalies that can arise. Data-driven dynamic Bayesian models learned from multisensory data recorded during the normal realization of a joint task (agent network experience) are used for distributed state estimation of agents and detection of abnormalities. A set of switching dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) models collectively learned in a training phase, each related to particular sensorial modality, is used to allow each agent in the network to perform synchronous estimation of possible abnormalities occurring when a new task of the same type is jointly performed. Collective DBN (CDBN) learning is performed by unsupervised clustering of generalized errors (GEs) obtained from a starting generalized model. A growing neural gas (GNG) algorithm is used as a basis to learn the discrete switching variables at the semantic level. Conditional probabilities linking nodes in the CDBN models are estimated using obtained clusters. CDBN models are associated with a Bayesian inference method, namely, distributed Markov jump particle filter (D-MJPF), employed for joint state estimation and abnormality detection. The effects of networking protocols and of communications in the estimation of state and abnormalities are analyzed. Performance is evaluated by using a small network of two autonomous vehicles performing joint navigation tasks in a controlled environment. In the proposed method, first the sharing of observations is considered in ideal condition, and then the effects of a wireless communication channel have been analyzed for the collective abnormality estimation of the agents. Rician wireless channel and the usage of two protocols (i.e., IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 802.15.4) along with different channel conditions are considered as well.

AB At 5:39 am on June 24, 2017, a landslide occurred in the village of Xinmo in Maoxian County, Aba Tibet and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture (Sichuan Province, Southwest China). On June 25, aerial images were acquired from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and a digital elevation model (DEM) was processed. Landslide geometrical features were then analyzed. These are the front and rear edge elevation, accumulation area and horizontal sliding distance. Then, the volume and the spatial distribution of the thickness of the deposit were calculated from the difference between the DEM available before the landslide, and the UAV-derived DEM collected after the landslide. Also, the disaster was assessed using high-resolution satellite images acquired before the landslide. These include QuickBird, Pleiades-1 and GF-2 images with spatial resolutions of 0.65 m, 0.70 m, and 0.80 m, respectively, and the aerial images acquired from the UAV after the landslide with a spatial resolution of 0.1 m. According to the analysis, the area of the landslide was 1.62 km(2), and the volume of the landslide was 7.70 +/- 1.46 million m(3). The average thickness of the landslide accumulation was approximately 8 m. The landslide destroyed a total of 103 buildings. The area of destroyed farmlands was 2.53 ha, and the orchard area was reduced by 28.67 ha. A 2-km section of Songpinggou River was blocked and a 2.1-km section of township road No. 104 was buried. Constrained by the terrain conditions, densely populated and more economically developed areas in the upper reaches of the Minjiang River basin are mainly located in the bottom of the valleys. This is a dangerous area regarding landslide, debris flow and flash flood events. Therefore, in mountainous, high-risk disaster areas, it is important to carefully select residential sites to avoid a large number of casualties.

AB The advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded systems, 5G networks and next-generation wireless systems, and embedded and distributed artificial intelligence are empowering Industry 4.0. In this new industrial era, smart autonomous and connected systems will improve efficiency, reduce cost and pollution, and increase productivity and safety in industrial 4.0 based applications. Nevertheless, the new generation technologies mentioned above have not been explored to improve safety in multiplant and industrial zones. In this article, we shed light on the design of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted systems for emergence response in multiplant and industrial zones. We discuss the important contributions of UAV-mounted cloudlet systems to support SAR missions by providing computation, communication, and storage resources to first responders, surveillance of the affected area, real-time monitoring of SAR members and victims, and caching nodes to improve content delivery among SAR teams. Besides, we design an envisioned UAV-cloudlet reference system for emergency response in industrial areas. Moreover, we highlight the current challenges that are being addressed in the literature aimed at making possible the efficient use of the designed UAV-mounted cloudlet systems for emergency response. Finally, we point out some future research directions that require further investigation.

AB From the viewpoint of urban administration, simulation is regarded as a policy tool that provides administrators with information about the current urban situation and enables them to verify the effectiveness of urban policies. This study proposes a traffic simulation model for a real city named Sejong in South Korea. Our proposed model employs agent-based simulation with the city-level real data, which mainly focuses on describing the movement behavior of individuals using urban traffics in the real city. By aggregating the agents' decisions and interactions during the movement, the proposed model can discover a demand for the city's transportation system. To do this, this study validated the proposed model so that the modeled traffic system was similar to the real one, and then we conducted a case study to compare and analyze the effects of traffic dispersion led by the upcoming bridge construction in the real city. The case study showed that the proposed model can provide policy evaluation on the optimal location of the bridge construction considering the city traffic flow. Furthermore, the case study presented that the agent-based modeling enables micro-level analysis on the city traffic flow to understand on the policy implications.

AB As a key technology of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have been promising to provide safety and infotainment for drivers and passengers. To support different applications about traffic safety, traffic efficiency, autonomous driving and entertainment, it is important to investigate how to effectively deliver content in VANETs. Since it takes resources such as bandwidth and power for base stations (BSs) or roadside units (RSUs) to deliver content, the optimal pricing strategy for BSs and the optimal caching incentive scheme for RSUs need to be studied. In this paper, a framework of content delivery is proposed first, where each moving vehicle can obtain small-volume content files from either the nearest BS or the nearest RSU according to the competition among them. Then, the profit models for both BSs and RSUs are established based on stochastic geometry and point processes theory. Next, a caching incentive scheme for RSUs based on Stackelberg game is proposed, where both competition sides (i.e., BSs and RSUs) can maximize their own profits. Besides, a backward introduction method is introduced to solve the Stackelberg equilibrium. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that BSs can obtain their own optimal pricing strategy for maximizing the profit as well as RSUs can obtain the optimal caching scheme with the maximum profit during the content delivery.

AB Many expert systems have been developed for self-adaptive PID controllers of mobile robots. However, the high computational requirements of the expert systems layers, developed for the tuning of the PID controllers, still require previous expert knowledge and high efficiency in algorithmic and software execution for real-time applications. To address these problems, in this paper we propose an expert agent based system, based on a reinforcement learning agent, for self-adapting multiple low-level PID controllers in mobile robots. For the formulation of the artificial expert agent, we develop an incremental model-free algorithm version of the double Q-Learning algorithm for fast on-line adaptation of multiple low-level PID controllers. Fast learning and high on-line adaptability of the artificial expert agent is achieved by means of a proposed incremental active-learning exploration-exploitation procedure, for a non-uniform state space exploration, along with an experience replay mechanism for multiple value functions updates in the double Q-Iearning algorithm. A comprehensive comparative simulation study and experiments in a real mobile robot demonstrate the high performance of the proposed algorithm for a real-time simultaneous tuning of multiple adaptive low-level PID controllers of mobile robots in real world conditions.

AB Underwater docking is currently a key technology for supplementing energy and self-recovery of autonomous underwater vehicles(AUVs). Three types of docking methods are introduced first. The captured-rod docking method is selected for this research effort, and its mechanical properties are analyzed. A Remus100 and a captured-rod with a radius of 50 nun are used to simulate the dynamic underwater docking and collision processes. The theoretical model analysis of deformation and collision of the captured-rod is carried out. Finally, a portable AUV is tested for collisions under different conditions. Through simulation and test, we found that there is a Karman vortex behind the captured-rod. When Remus100 approaches the captured-rod and the distance between them is less than a certain value, the captured-rod's wake will have an influence on the forces on the Remus100. The degree of influence positively correlates with the current's velocity. The lateral and vertical forces on the Remus100 are more susceptible to the captured-rod's wake, and are affected by the captured-rod's wake earlier. The collision force increases as the collision velocity increases, but the collision time is the opposite. We analyze and compare the results obtained by simulations, tests and theoretical model.

AB Cameras are essential components to almost every underwater vehicle including ROV's, AUV's, manned sub-mersibles, ocean observatories, and baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVs). Deep-sea cameras are traditionally expensive components, and are almost exclusively fabricated as 1-atm pressure housings made of aluminum, stainless steel or titanium, combined with custom-made optical viewports. In autonomous recording systems such as BRUVs and biologging animal tags, camera size and form factor directly influences the physical design of the entire system and limits the operational endurance. In this paper, we describe a novel design for DEEPi, a deep-sea imaging and control system based on the Raspberry Pi family of single-board computers. The DEEPi camera is an extremely compact remote head unit (similar to 16 ml volume), can operate to depths of at least 5500 m, and uses a photopolymer 3D-printed shell partially filled with epoxy as a pressure housing. A flat polished borosilicate glass disc serves as the optical viewport, and protects the lens assembly from pressure and water intrusion. The control computer is completely potted in epoxy, and is accessible through a wifi connection. The DEEPi system is described in detail, along with example imagery from deep-sea deployments to depths of up to 1096 m.

AB Here, we present an open-source cloud (4G) connected and controlled self-flying airplane based on a secure, encrypted flight stack with all up weight of < 300 g as an example of a new class of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The avionics portion (including the flight controller, 4G cellular data modem, and on-board companion Linux computer) weighs only 40 g, which is about 10 times lighter than previous avionics package achieving the same mission: 4G secure encrypted robust self-healing Internet connectivity for video and telemetry, autonomous flight capability without the need for a pilot in local proximity to the UAV, and GPS positioning. With a flight time of 1 h, this represents the lightest, longest flight time 4G UAV ever demonstrated. Enabled by the convergence of advances in multiple hardware and software systems and disciplines, this effectively defines a new class of the UAVs, distinct from larger multirotors for aerial surveys and photography and smaller nano-quadcopters with short flight times and ranges, defined by the characteristics of inherently stable aerodynamic flight in case of hardware failure (such as motor failure), inherently long flight times, inherently long range due to the efficiency of a wing over quadrotor, and Internet connectivity for control from any point on earth to virtually any point on earth.

SO KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE Named entity recognition; Fiction documents; Verb analysis; Anaphora
   resolution; Character identification
AB Named entity recognition (NER) is a subtask in information extraction which aims to locate atomic element into predefined types. Various NER techniques and tools have been developed to fit the interest of the applications developed. However, most NER works carried out focus on non-fiction domain. Fiction based domain displays a complex context in locating its NE, specifically whereby its characters could be represented in diverse spectrums, ranging from living things (animals, plants, and person) to non-living things (vehicle, furniture). Motivated by a hypothesis such that there always exists verb specifically describes human being conduct, in this paper, we propose a NER system which aims to identify NEs that perform human activity based on verb analysis (VAHA) in an autonomous manner. More specifically, our approach attempts to identify dominant character (DC) by studying the nature of verb that associates with human activity via TreeTagger, Stanford packages and WordNet. Our experimental results validate our initial hypothesis that NEs can be accurately identified by referring to the associated verbs that associate with human activity. Our empirical study also proves that the approach is applicable to small text size articles. Another significant contribution of our approach is that it does not require training data set and anaphora resolution. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rhythmic motion employed in animal locomotion is ultimately controlled by neuronal circuits known as central pattern generators (CPGs). It appears that these controllers produce efficient oscillatory command signals by entraining to a resonant gait via sensory feedback. This property is of great interest in the control of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we experimentally validate synthesized CPG control of tensegrity structures. The prestressed cables in a tensegrity structure provide a method of simultaneous actuation and sensing, analogous to the biological motor control mechanism of regulating muscle stiffness through motoneuron activation and sensing the resulting motion by stretch receptors. A three-cell class-two tensegrity structure is designed, built, and modeled to predict the structure's dynamic response. The models are experimentally validated using open-loop control tests. Next, a simple CPG, called a reciprocal inhibition oscillator (RIO), is designed and synthesized in real time. The RIOs outputs are used as actuation commands, while sensory signals from the tensegrity are fed back to the RIO. Multiple controller configurations are tested to validate an RIO design method developed and reported in a complementary study. Finally, the tensegrity dynamics are perturbed by altering the mass of the tensegrity, and the robustness of RIO control is demonstrated through its ability to entrain to the perturbed system.

TI Resolving meso-scale seabed variability using reflection measurements

ID SHALLOW-WATER; GEOACOUSTIC INVERSION; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; ARRAY
AB Seabed geoacoustic variability is driven by geological processes that occur over a wide spectrum of space-time scales. While the acoustics community has some understanding of horizontal fine-scale geoacoustic variability, less than O(10(0)) m, and large-scale variability, greater than O(10(3)) m, there is a paucity of data resolving the geoacoustic meso-scale O(10(0)-10(3)) m. Measurements of the meso-scale along an ostensibly "benign" portion of the outer shelf reveal three classes of variability. The first class was expected and is due to horizontal variability of layer thicknesses: this was the only class that could be directly tied to seismic reflection data. The second class is due to rapid changes in layer properties and/or boundaries, occurring over scales of meters to hundreds of meters. The third class was observed as rapid variations of the angle/frequency dependent reflection coefficient within a single observation and is suggestive of variability at scales of meter or less. Though generally assumed to be negligible in acoustic modeling, the second and third classes are indicative of strong horizontal geoacoustic variability within a given layer. The observations give early insight into possible effects of horizontal geoacoustic variability on long-range acoustic propagation and reverberation. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of America.

ID AUTONOMOUS BRAKING
AB Objective: The introduction of integrated safety technologies in new car models calls for an improved understanding of the human occupant response in precrash situations. The aim of this article is to extensively study occupant muscle activation in vehicle maneuvers potentially occurring in precrash situations with different seat belt configurations. Methods: Front seat male passengers wearing a 3-point seat belt with either standard or pre-pretensioning functionality were exposed to multiple autonomously carried out lane change and lane change with braking maneuvers while traveling at 73 km/h. This article focuses on muscle activation data (surface electromyography [EMG] normalized using maximum voluntary contraction [MVC] data) obtained from 38 muscles in the neck, upper extremities, the torso, and lower extremities. The raw EMG data were filtered, rectified, and smoothed. All muscle activations were presented in corridors of mean +/- one standard deviation. Separate Wilcoxon signed ranks tests were performed on volunteers' muscle activation onset and amplitude considering 2 paired samples with the belt configuration as an independent factor. Results: In normal driving conditions prior to any of the evasive maneuvers, activity levels were low (<2% MVC) in all muscles except for the lumbar extensors (3-5.5% MVC). During the lane change maneuver, selective muscles were activated and these activations restricted the sideway motions due to inertial loading. Averaged muscle activity, predominantly in the neck, lumbar extensor, and abdominal muscles, increased up to 24% MVC soon after the vehicle accelerated in lateral direction for all volunteers. Differences in activation time and amplitude between muscles in the right and left sides of the body were observed relative to the vehicle's lateral motion. For specific muscles, lane changes with the pre-pretensioner belt were associated with earlier muscle activation onsets and significantly smaller activation amplitudes than for the standard belt (P < .05). Conclusions: Applying a pre-pretensioner belt affected muscle activations; that is, amplitude and onset time. The present muscle activation data complement the results in a preceding publication, the volunteers' kinematics and the boundary conditions from the same data set. An effect of belt configuration was also seen on previously published volunteers' kinematics with lower lateral and forward displacements for head and upper torso using the pre-pretensioner belt versus the standard belt. The data provided in this article can be used for validation and further improvement of active human body models with active musculature in both sagittal and lateral loading scenarios intended for simulation of some evasive maneuvers that potentially occur prior to a crash.

AB An output- and state-dependent Riccati equation (OSDRE) is investigated for a set of coupled k-th order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in the framework of nonlinear optimal control, in terms of stability, optimality, and application. A state-feedback control is a dominant part of the SDRE in the literature in comparison with an output feedback design. The output feedback design removes outer layers of kinematics or coordinate transformations in some systems and directly controls the output dynamics. This enables efficient control over many systems in which there is an indirect relation between outputs and states such as robots, mobile manipulators, autonomous vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, etc. To present the OSDRE, the co-state vector of the optimal control must include both state and output vector; and then the optimality conditions result in a control law and a Riccati equation, which are derived based on the output vector. The application of the OSDRE is devoted to the control of free-floating space manipulators (FFSM). The end-effector position of the FFSM is a function of mobile base coordinates (position and orientation) that are not actuated due to the free-floating condition. Then the output feedback SDRE directly controls the end-effector and guides the mobile base to provide enough reaction force/moment to push the gripper towards the desired end-point. So, the workspace analysis is crucial since the motion of the end-effector depends on the distance and configuration between the initial and final conditions. Simulation results for a mathematical third-order coupled ODE and a three-link FFSM confirm success in the control of the output dynamics. It was shown that the output of the mathematical model successfully tracked the desired output regardless of the individual state regulation. The FFSM has also tracked the desired output position with an accuracy of 0.02% of the travel distance. (c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Disaster management, search and rescue missions, and health monitoring are examples of critical applications that require object localization with high precision and sometimes in a timely manner. In the absence of the global positioning system (GPS), the radio received signal strength index (RSSI) can be used for localization purposes due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. However, due to the low accuracy of RSSI, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones may be used as an efficient solution for improved localization accuracy due to their agility and higher probability of line-of-sight (LoS). Hence, in this context, we propose a novel framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) to enable a UAV (agent) to autonomously find its trajectory that results in improving the localization accuracy of multiple objects in shortest time and path length, fewer signal-strength measurements (waypoints), and/or lower UAV energy consumption. In particular, we first control the agent through initial scan trajectory on the whole region to 1) know the number of nodes and estimate their initial locations, and 2) train the agent online during operation. Then, the agent forms its trajectory by using RL to choose the next waypoints in order to minimize the average location errors of all objects. Our framework includes detailed UAV to ground channel characteristics with an empirical path loss and log-normal shadowing model, and also with an elaborate energy consumption model. We investigate and compare the localization precision of our approach with existing methods from the literature by varying the UAV's trajectory length, energy, number of waypoints, and time. Furthermore, we study the impact of the UAV's velocity, altitude, hovering time, communication range, number of maximum RSSI measurements, and number of objects. The results show the superiority of our method over the state-of-art and demonstrates its fast reduction of the localization error.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are high-end marine equipment. In turbid, dimly lit waters that require high concealment, traditional methods struggle to detect targets effectively. Fish, however, can accu-rately perceive nearby targets using lateral line systems even in harsh environments. This provides inspiration for intelligent detection in AUVs. In this study, the flow field cloud around copepods and visualization of pressure difference matrix are analyzed. A method combining the pressure difference matrix and residual neural network regression is proposed to study how fish lateral lines perceive the direction of cruising copepods. Furthermore, the effects of three key parameters on direction perception are discussed, including perception time scale, initial vertical distance and training angular intervals number. The results indicate that most predicted directions are close to the true directions, with only a small number of misjudgments occurring in the vicinity of the opposite or perpendicular directions to the true direction. Moderate perception time scales (100 ms), shorter vertical dis-tances (2.5 mm), and reasonable training angular intervals number (24 or 36) all lead to lower perception error. This study provides a quantitative analysis of fish lateral line perception mechanism, offering valuable theo-retical guidance and technical support for intelligent detection in AUVs.

AB Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs) are widely applied in marine based applications, but traditional security mechanisms are not feasible due to the underwater sensor nodes' limited constraints and capabilities. Moreover, few existing routing protocols for underwater sensor networks considered underwater transmision limited constraints. In this paper, we propose T-SAPR, a trust management-based secure routing protocol with AUV-aided path repairing that addresses these challenges. T-SAPR uses an attention-based long short-term memory (LSTM) to build a trust model that considers node trust, communication trust, and environment surrounding's trust. T-SAPR evaluates trust evidence to measure the trust level of the sensor nodes in the network and uses energy, packet delivery ratio, and latency jointly to seek optimal routing policies in the reward function of Q-Learning. Additionally, we propose a repairing mechanism with the assistance of AUVs to improve the reliability of UASNs in cases of multiple sensor node failures or the detection of malicious nodes. Evaluation results show that T-SAPR identifies malicious nodes by detecting their anomalous behavior while improving the packet delivery ratio and energy efficiency by 13.3% and 48.1% as compared to existing algorithms such as GEDAR, TADR-EAODV, and AFSA-ACOA-SCP.

AB Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) is a promising paradigm for autonomous driving. It can reduce delay and energy consumption of tasks. The problem of joint task offloading scheduling and resource allocation in VEC is a challenge issue. In this paper, we investigate the problem of joint task offloading, task scheduling, and resource allocation in VEC, and the fast changing channel between a vehicle and an edge server. A target problem of joint considering task offloading scheduling, resource allocation and time-varying channel in VEC is formulated. The goal is to minimize the delay and energy consumption of tasks to guarantee the Quality of Service (QoS) of VEC. Constraints on the completion time, the energy consumption, and the computing capability are considered for each task. The resulting mixed integer optimization problem is decomposed into a two-layer optimization problem. In the upper layer, we use a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to solve the task offloading scheduling problem. In the lower level, the CPU frequency allocation is determined using the Gradient Descent (GD) method. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can minimize the delay and energy consumption of VEC for different network parameter settings.

AB Currently, interest in deep learning-based semantic segmentation is increasing in various fields such as the medical field, automatic operation, and object division. For example, UNet, a deep learning network with an encoder-decoder structure, is used for image segmentation in the biomedical area, and an attempt to segment various objects is made using ASPP such as Deeplab. A recent study improves the accuracy of object segmentation through structures that extend in various receptive fields. Semantic segmentation has evolved to divide objects of various sizes more accurately and in detail, and various methods have been presented for this. In this paper, we propose a model structure that reduces the overall parameters of the deep learning model in this development and improves accuracy. The proposed model is an encoder-decoder structure, and an encoder half scale provides a feature map with few encoder parameters. A decoder integrates feature maps of various scales with high area details and forward features of low areas. An integrated feature map learns a feature map of each encoder hierarchy over an area of previous data in the form of a continuous coupling structure. To verify the performance of the model, we learned and compared the KITTI-360 dataset with the Cityscapes dataset, and experimentally confirmed that the proposed method was superior to the existing model.

AB Unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) are preferred for regional electronic reconnaissance due to their versatility and stealth. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to enable UCAVs to complete regional multi-target electronic reconnaissance (MER) tasks with continuous autonomous maneuvers. Distinguishing from traditional heuristic search algorithms, we first derive the objective function of MER and elucidate sufficient conditions to improve the success rate of reconnaissance recognition. Then, using the original cognitive electronic warfare framework, a three-dimensional MER simulator named Scouer-N is created to satisfy the requirements of dynamic environment training for DRL-based agents. To enable the processing of sequential situation awareness, a generative network is constructed by introducing a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model, which assists the UCAV in filtering the observations from the sensor and predicting the actual states. Finally, we propose a priority-driven state reward shaping method that provides normalized state representation and dense rewards to the agent during training to improve the agent's behavioral knowledge for MER. The experimental results demonstrate a considerable improvement in the task success rate of the trained UCAV relative to the benchmark, proving the efficacy of our approach in helping agents learn the optimal reconnaissance strategy from the potential state space.

AB Multispectral sensing is extremely desired in intelligent systems, e.g., autonomous vehicles, encrypted information communication, and health biometric monitoring, due to its highly sensitive spectral discrimination ability. Nevertheless, rigid bulky optics and delicate optical paths in devices significantly increase their complexity and size, which subsequently impede their integration in smart optoelectronic chips for universal applications. In this work, a filterless miniaturized multispectral photodetector is realized with an organic narrowband response unit array. With the manipulation of Frenkel exciton dissociation in active layers, a series of narrowband organic sensing units with full-width-at-half-maximum (fwhm) narrowing to similar to 50 nm are achieved from 700 to 1050 nm with a laudable performance of responsivity of over 60 mA/W, -3 dB bandwidth over 10 kHz, linear dynamic range (LDR) reaching similar to 120 dB, and a low noise current of less than 4 X 10(-14) A.Hz(-0.5). Furthermore, a 6 x 8 multispectral sensing array on a flexible substrate was fabricated with blade-coating. Assisted by a computational process, we successfully demonstrate the spectral recognition with a resolution of similar to 50 nm and a mismatch of similar to 10 nm. Finally, the function of matter identification is successfully achieved with our multispectral detector array.

AB Multi-source data fusion is an important method to improve the performance of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) fault diagnosis. However, most of the current fault diagnosis methods are based on a single data source or treat multi-source data as single. Firstly, we demonstrate the necessity of multi-source data fusion and propose a universal data hierarchy. Then, a hierarchical attention based multi-source data fusion method is proposed for fault diagnosis (HAMFD). The method consists of an encoder-decoder network, a fusion network stacked with encoders and attention mechanisms, and a fault recognition method based on attention distribution. The fusion network uses the encoder and hierarchical attention to extract the deep features, and fuse the features hierarchically. We use the multi-layer attention distribution to explain the fault evaluation and realize fault recognition. A random mask fusion strategy is designed for redundancy and a feature orthogonalization method is proposed for the strong coupling among multiple data sources. The proposed method is validated on the monitoring data of Qianlong-2 AUV obtained during the sea trial in the South China Sea. The fault detection rate is more than 98%, the recognition rate is about 100% for strong faults, and more than 90% for other faults.

AB Curved artificial compound eyes (ACEs) attract enormous research interest owing to their potential applications in medical devices, surveillance imaging, target tracking, and so on. However, fog, dust, or other liquids are likely to condense on the device surface under a humid, low-temperature environment or outdoors, thus affecting the optical performance. In this work, a multi-functional ACE (MF-ACE) is fabricated by a combination of i) femtosecond laser wet etching, ii) soft lithography, and iii) polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) swelling methods. The fabricated device is close-packed with over 3000 microlenses (approximate to 108 mu m diameter and approximate to 15 mu m height) on a spherical macrolens (6.56 cm diameter and 0.87 cm height). The trapped silicone oil in the cross-linked PDMS endows the as-fabricated ACE with excellent water repellence and anti-fogging, anti-fouling, and self-cleaning abilities. In addition, the ACE shows high optical performance and the ommatidia have a spatial resolution of 50.8 lp mm(-1). The imaging and focusing experiments demonstrate its high optical properties and uniformity. It is anticipated that this research may provide useful guidelines for the fabrication of anti-fogging and anti-fouling optical devices, and such device enables potential applications in autonomous vehicles, medical, or vision systems under harsh environmental conditions.

AB In recent years, the development of self-driving cars and their inclusion in our daily life has rapidly transformed from an idea into a reality. One of the main issues that autonomous vehicles must face is the problem of traffic sign detection and recognition. Most works focusing on this problem utilize a two-phase approach. However, a fast-moving car has to quickly detect the sign as seen by humans and recognize the image it contains. In this paper, we chose to utilize two different solutions to solve tasks of detection and classification separately and compare the results of our method with a novel state-of-the-art detector, YOLOv5. Our approach utilizes the Mask R-CNN deep learning model in the first phase, which aims to detect traffic signs based on their shapes. The second phase uses the Xception model for the task of traffic sign classification. The dataset used in this work is a manually collected dataset of 11,074 Taiwanese traffic signs collected using mobile phone cameras and a GoPro camera mounted inside a car. It consists of 23 classes divided into 3 subclasses based on their shape. The conducted experiments utilized both versions of the dataset, class-based and shape-based. The experimental result shows that the precision, recall and mAP can be significantly improved for our proposed approach.

AB Marine pollution, which can cause damage to marine ecosystems, cut fishery production, and even harm human health, has aroused worldwide interest in recent years. Marine pollution reduction operations can stagnate in the case that the source of the pollution is unknown or hidden. In this paper, we present a novel method for marine pollution source localization using a network of mobile sensor nodes, such as autonomous underwater vehicles equipped with chemical sensors. Traditional reactive control methods can respond quickly to the shape dynamics of a chemical plume; however, they can hardly achieve intelligent cooperation unlike deliberative methods. In this study, we present a behavior composition method that attempts to combine the advantages of reactive and deliberative methods. An upwind-customized crossover operation based on the genetic algorithm was formulated as one of the elementary behaviors. The upwind sprint and movement away from the centroid of the sensor nodes were also modeled as another two elementary behaviors. Different sensor nodes are capable of different simultaneous elementary behaviors, enabling behavior composition in the mobile sensor network during plume source localization. The proposed method was evaluated using a widely used filamentous plume simulation platform, which has been used to facilitate field experiments in real marine environments. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method achieved high time-efficiency and localization accuracy during plume source localization in marine environments.

TI A virtual velocity-based integrated navigation method for strapdown
   inertial navigation system and Doppler velocity log coupled with unknown

SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
LA English
DT Article
ID DESIGN
AB The integration of the strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) and Doppler velocity log (DVL) has become a basic navigation solution for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). However, DVL cannot obtain the velocity relative to the ground when the distance between the AUV and seabed is over the operating range, which occurs often when AUVs are sailing in the middle layer of the ocean. When the DVL velocity relative to the current is used for an integrated filter, the unknown current velocity is coupled with the measured velocity error, which decreases the positioning accuracy. To address this problem, the effect of unknown coupled current velocity is analyzed from the perspective of filter observability, and an integrated SINS/DVL/virtual velocity navigation method is proposed. The virtual velocity based on the velocity variation extracted from the inertial measurement unit and DVL is constructed and used as an aided measurement for the Kalman filter. With the help of virtual velocity, the current velocity can be easily decoupled from measured SINS velocity error. The results of simulation and experiments demonstrated that the proposed method can effectively improve both the convergence speed and accuracy of velocity error compared with the classical method with SINS/DVL integration and, thus, significantly improve the positioning accuracy.

AB The number of devices equipped with global satellite positioning has exceeded seven billion recently. There are a wide variety of receivers regarding their accuracy and reliability. Low cost, multi-frequency units have been released on the market latterly; however, the number of single-frequency receivers is still significant. Since their measurements are influenced by ionospheric delay, accurate ionosphere models are of utmost importance to reduce the effect. This paper summarizes how Gauss process regression (GPR) can be applied to derive near real-time regional ionosphere models using raw Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations of permanent stations. While Gauss process is widely used in machine learning, GPR is a nonparametric, Bayesian approach to regression. GPR has several benefits for ionosphere monitoring since it is quite robust and efficient to derive a grid model from data available in irregular set of ionospheric pierce points. The corresponding instrumental delays are estimated by a parallel Kalman filter. The presented algorithm can be applied near real-time, however the results are offline calculated and are compared to two high quality TEC map products. Based on the analysis, the accuracy of the GPR modell is in 2 TECu range. The developed methods could be efficiently applied in the field of autonomous vehicle navigation with meeting both accuracy and integrity requirements.

ID DETECTION ALGORITHM
AB Complex mechanical systems used in the mining industry for efficient raw materials extraction require proper maintenance. Especially in a deep underground mine, the regular inspection of machines operating in extremely harsh conditions is challenging, thus, monitoring systems and autonomous inspection robots are becoming more and more popular. In the paper, it is proposed to use a mobile unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) platform equipped with various data acquisition systems for supporting inspection procedures. Although maintenance staff with appropriate experience are able to identify problems almost immediately, due to mentioned harsh conditions such as temperature, humidity, poisonous gas risk, etc., their presence in dangerous areas is limited. Thus, it is recommended to use inspection robots collecting data and appropriate algorithms for their processing. In this paper, the authors propose red-green-blue (RGB) and infrared (IR) image fusion to detect overheated idlers. An original procedure for image processing is proposed, that exploits some characteristic features of conveyors to pre-process the RGB image to minimize non-informative components in the pictures collected by the robot. Then, the authors use this result for IR image processing to improve SNR and finally detect hot spots in IR image. The experiments have been performed on real conveyors operating in industrial conditions.

AB The advent of protein design in recent years has brought us within reach of developing a "nanoscale programing language," in which molecules serve as operands with their conformational states functioning as logic gates. Combining these operands into a set of operations will result in a functional program, which is executed using nanoscale computing agents (NCAs). These agents would respond to any given input and return the desired output signal. The ability to utilize natural evolutionary processes would allow code to "evolve" in the course of computation, thus enabling radically new algorithmic developments. NCAs will revolutionize the studies of biological systems, enable a deeper understanding of human biology and disease, and facilitate the development of in situ precision therapeutics. Since NCAs can be extended to novel reactions and processes not seen in biological systems, the growth of this field will spark the growth of biotechnological applications with wide-ranging impacts, including fields not typically considered relevant to biology. Unlike traditional approaches in synthetic biology that are based on the rewiring of signaling pathways in cells, NCAs are autonomous vehicles based on single-chain proteins. In this perspective, I will introduce and discuss this new field of biological computing, as well as challenges and the future of the NCA. Addressing these challenges will provide a significant leap in technology for programming living cells.

AB Aiming at the problem that the quality of measurement information directly affects the performance of cooperative localization of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (multi-AUV), a design method for the optimal formation configuration of multi-AUV is proposed to select the best measurement information. First, for the two cases of whether the measurement information is correlated with the measurement error, the performance evaluation functions of formation configuration of multi-AUV are established based on the information ellipse area. Second, through in-depth analysis of these functions, the design methods of the optimal formation configuration in two cases are proposed respectively. Subsequently, taking the multi-AUV cooperative localization systems with four-master and five-master as examples, based on the proposed design method, the optimal formation configuration for cooperative localization system of multi-AUV in two cases is studied deeply, and the results show that it is dynamic. Besides, a special formation configuration is proposed for the cooperative localization system of multi-AUV, which is easier to be implemented compared with the optimal formation configuration when the localization performance is almost the same. At last, the simulation experiments verify the correctness of the proposed method and the effectiveness of the proposed special formation configuration.

AB Storage and retrieval automation has progressed rapidly. One such popular storage and retrieval system deploys two passing aisle-bound cranes. Each crane can access every location in the rack. To pass the other crane and prevent collision, each crane has to timely move the platform to an appropriate level and simultaneously rotate it. We develop a queuing model with preemptive-resume interrupted service to estimate the system response time (and hence throughput capacity) while considering two I/O point positions, random storage, and a crane assignment policy where all requests are shared between the cranes. The analytical models are validated with simulation based on the data from real cases. We find that a design with I/O points located in the middle of the rack will increase the interference, but it has a high relative throughput because of the reduced expected travel time. Compared with a system with one crane, a two-crane system has interference, but it can improve the system efficiency, especially in large systems with high job arrival rates. The model can be extended to other systems where multiple cranes are used in a single travel aisle with crane interference, e.g. passing cranes operating in a container stack lane.

AB This work aims at developing an efficient path planning algorithm for the driving objective of a Martian day (sol) that can take into account terrain information for application to the proposed Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission. To prepare the planning process for one sol (i.e., with a limited time allocated to driving), a map of expected rover velocity over a chosen area is constructed, obtained by combining traversability classes, rock abundance and slope at that location. The planning phase starts offline by computing several potential paths that can be traversed in one sol (i.e., a few hours), which will later provide suitable options to the rover if replanning is necessary due to unexpected mobility difficulties. Online, the rover gains information about its environment as it drives and updates the map locally if major discrepancies are found. If an update is made, the remaining driving time along the different options is recalculated and the most efficient path is chosen. The online process is repeated until the rover has reached its daily goal. When simulated on different areas at Gusev Crater, Mars, the algorithm correctly captured changes of terrain initially not mapped, and rerouted the rover to a more efficient path when necessary, in which case it effectively complied with the time constraint to reach the goal.

AB Exploring the underwater solar energy by solar photovoltaic (PV) cells leads to a huge advantage by utilizing the humongous space of water covered by the earth's surface. Even though the amount of solar radiation decreases with the depth of the water, water provides sustainable cooling and cleaning for solar PV cells underwater. There are many challenges and constraints to develop solar PV cells underwater because they are mostly calibrated and amenable to space, dryland, terrestrial, etc., and the solar spectrum is prone to get narrower with the depth of the water. The implementation of solar PV cells underwater is pliable in various commercial and defense applications, such as sensors, water monitoring systems, autonomous vehicles, underwater gliders, etc. In this article, first, a mathematical model has been developed for the solar cell spectrum to incorporate the changes in the solar irradiance with the depth of the water. Furthermore, an experimental setup was designed and implemented to mimic an underwater environment. The performance of the polycrystalline encapsulated solar cell was studied based on the different types of water and the depth of the solar cell underwater. This article manifests that there is a sufficient amount of underwater solar power that can be utilized using PV cells to operate various devices and systems.

AB As the world's population grows, agriculture is facing an increasing demand for productivity, efficiency, and sustainability to ensure food security. The adoption of a production system similar to that of Industry 4.0 is considered to be a way to address this problem in agriculture. This approach can be seen in precision agriculture. This new technological trend has an impact on agricultural machinery and the way it is designed. Therefore, the objective of this article is to provide an overview of digital systems in agricultural machinery and their impact on equipment design processes in a developing digital agriculture scenario. Digital devices are already present in several types of equipment, performing or supporting tasks such as automatic steering and variable-rate applications. In addition, a large number of sensors monitor the crops, environment, production losses, and operational parameters in real time. Technological breakthroughs, however, are the adoption of emerging alternatives such as IoT, electric power vehicles, and small autonomous machines, which are already being implemented in other areas. Consequently, the development process of agricultural machines now involves several specialty domains besides the usual mechanics, compelling companies to employ the transverse concurrent engineering of several specialties at the same design situation and moment.

AB Semantic segmentation is a process of linking each pixel in an image to a class label, and is widely used in the field of autonomous vehicles and robotics. Although deep learning methods have already made great progress for semantic segmentation, they either achieve great results with numerous parameters or design lightweight models but heavily sacrifice the segmentation accuracy. Because of the strict requirements of real-world applications, it is critical to design an effective real-time model with both competitive segmentation accuracy and small model capacity. In this paper, we propose a lightweight network named DABNet, which employs Depth-wise Asymmetric Bottleneck (DAB) and Point-wise Aggregation Decoder (PAD) module to tackle the challenging real-time semantic segmentation in urban scenes. Specifically, the DAB module creates a sufficient receptive field and densely utilizes the contextual information, and the PAD module aggregates the feature maps of different scales to optimize performance through the attention mechanism. Compared with existing methods, our network substantially reduces the number of parameters but still achieves high accuracy with real-time inference ability. Extensive ablation experiments on two challenging urban scene datasets (Cityscapes and CamVid) have proved the effectiveness of the proposed approach in real-time semantic segmentation.

A control law is presented, which solves this problem for almost all initial conditions in any given compact set. The proposed control law is local and distributed, meaning that each unicycle is only required to sense its relative displacement measured in its own body frame, and the relative heading angle with respect to each of its neighbors. No communication between the unicycles is required. The sensing graph is assumed to be connected, undirected, and time invariant. The idea used to solve the above-mentioned formation control problem is to rigidly attach to the body frame of each unicycle an appropriate fixed offset vector. Stabilizing the desired formation amounts to achieving consensus of the endpoints of the offset vectors, and simultaneously synchronizing the unicycles' heading angles. A control law achieving this goal is constructed by combining a bounded translational consensus controller with an attitude synchronizer. As a special case, the proposed solution solves the full unicycle synchronization problem, in which the unicycle positions are made to converge to each other, while the unicycle headings are made to align.

AB The growing demand of infrared sensors for emerging applications such as autonomous vehicles and remote control and sensing systems has driven the development of flexible, low-power, and infrared detectors for seamless product integration. Although semiconducting polymer (SCP)-based photodetectors are promising solutions, challenges in synthesis chemistry and high thermal dark currents associated with narrowing of band gaps have limited their progress. To address these challenges, we have designed a new class of composites comprising SCPs with moderate band gap and rare earth doped-nanoparticles (RENPs) that enable photon-to-electron conversion beyond the SCP's response range. Using this RENP-SCP (RE-SCP) composite, we demonstrated detection at multiple wavelengths (808, 975, and 1532 nm) for planar-type photodetectors. Notably, the RE-SCP composite-based device detected an eye-safe, shortwave infrared (SWIR) source at 1532 nm with high SWIR responsivity of 0.02 A/W and an SWIR external quantum efficiency of 2%. The key attribute governing the excellent SWIR responsivity and sensitivity was the distinctive SWIR upconversion characteristic of RENPs that extended and improved the SCP's detection range and performance, respectively. Additionally, the absence of significant performance degradation of the SWIR photodetector for bending curvatures from 0-0.67 cm(-1) highlights the promise of our RE-SCP composite-based flexible SWIR photodetectors.

AB This paper reviews and assesses the current state of knowledge on the complex relationship between tourism travel and climate change for the case study of Austria, taking into account developments to date and expected future trends of tourism-related transport and their impacts on greenhouse gas emissions as well as impacts of climate change on tourist travel. Three quarters of tourists travel to and from Austria by car and approximately 10% by plane, contributing significantly to the sector's GHG emissions. Should pre-COVID 19 trends continue, an expansion of further distant home markets and an increase of guests arriving by plane can be expected. Low-carbon technologies, intelligent mobility management and societal trends towards shared mobility solutions can improve the environmental performance of tourist travel but will not suffice to achieve the Paris Agreement's climate targets. Further strong incentives will be necessary to avoid these unsustainable forms of mobility and shift trips to climate-friendly modes of transport and the number and distance of tourism trips can be reduced by focussing marketing on closer rather than long-distance home markets and promotion of longer stays. Local tourism stakeholders in Austria can contribute by awareness-raising campaigns and promoting sustainable mobility solutions at the destinations. Politics need enable this shift by setting framework conditions such as full incorporation of climate costs for all modes of travel.
   Management implications: To reduce travel related GHG emissions significantly, tourism cannot only rely on technological solutions (electric vehicles) and trends (sharing) but must also initiate a shift from air and private road transport to rail and public transport. This requires measures that offer incentives (fast and direct train and bus connections, climate-friendly local transport, luggage services, attractive all-in packages, etc.), but also a focus on closer rather than long-distance home markets, promotion of longer stays and awareness-raising campaigns for local stakeholders and tourists. The awareness created by the COVID-19 and climate crises can be seen as an opportunity to take these measures.

AB As a result of the new telecommunication ecosystem landscape, wireless communication has become an interdisciplinary field whose future is shaped by several interacting dimensions. These interacting dimensions, which form the cyber-physical convergence, closely link the technological perspective to its social, economic, and cognitive sciences counterparts. Beyond the current operational framework of the Internet of Things (IoT), network devices will be equipped with capabilities for learning, thinking, and understanding so that they can autonomously make decisions and take appropriate actions. Through this autonomous operation, wireless networking will be ushered into a paradigm that is primarily inspired by the efficient and effective use of (i) AI strategies, (ii) big data analytics, as well as (iii) cognition. This is the Cognitive Internet of People Processes Data and Things (CIoPPD&T), which can be defined in terms of the cyber-physical convergence. In this article, through the discussion of how the cyber-physical convergence and the interacting dynamics of the socio-technical ecosystem are enablers of digital twins (DTs), the network DT (NDT) is discussed in the context of 6G networks. Then, the design and realization of edge computing-based NDTs are discussed, which culminate with the vehicle-to-edge (V2E) use cases.

AB Frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar is increasingly used for various detection and classification applications in different fields, such as autonomous vehicles and mining fields. Our objective is to increase the classification accuracy of objects detected using millimeter-wave radar. We have developed an approach based on millimeter-wave radar. The proposed solution combines the use of an FMCW radar, a YOLOv7 model, and the Pix2Pix architecture. The latter architecture was used to reduce noise in the heatmaps. We create a dataset of 4125 heatmaps annotated with five different object classes. To evaluate the proposed approach, 14 different models were trained using the annotated heatmap dataset. In the initial experiment, we compared the models using metrics such as mean average precision (mAP), precision, and recall. The results showed that the proposed model of YOLOv7 (YOLOv7-PM) was the most efficient in terms of mAP_0.5, which reached 90.1%, and achieved a mAP_0.5:0.95 of 49.51%. In the second experiment, we compared the models with a cleaned dataset generated using the Pix2Pix architecture. As a result, we observed improved performances, with the Pix2Pix + YOLOv7-PM model achieving the best mAP_0.5, reaching 91.82%, and a mAP_0.5:0.95 of 52.59%.

AB This paper presents Bayesian techniques for conservative claims about software reliability, particularly when evidence suggests the software's executions are not statistically independent. We formalise informal notions of "doubting" that the executions are independent, and incorporate such doubts into reliability assessments. We develop techniques that reveal the extent to which independence assumptions can undermine conservatism in assessments, and identify conditions under which this impact is not significant. These techniques - novel extensions of conservative Bayesian inference (CBI) approaches - give conservative confidence bounds on the software's failure probability per execution. With illustrations in two application areas - nuclear power-plant safety and autonomous vehicle (AV) safety - our analyses reveals: (1) the confidence an assessor should possess before subjecting a system to operational testing. Otherwise, such testing is futile - favourable operational testing evidence will eventually decrease one's confidence in the system being sufficiently reliable; (2) the independence assumption supports conservative claims sometimes; (3) in some scenarios, observing a system operate without failure gives less confidence in the system than if some failures had been observed; (4) building confidence in a system is very sensitive to failures - each additional failure means significantly more operational testing is required, in order to support a reliability claim.

AB Variable frequency drives (VFDs) have been used for position sensors for many years. Alternatively, reliable VFDs for smart autonomous systems require the simultaneous configuration of sensors and sensorless operation. This article details the design and implementation of a continuous fast terminal (CFT) sliding mode controller (SMC)-based speed controller and speed estimation through the CFT sliding mode observer that accounts for iron loss while calculating total disturbances. The rotor speed dynamics of the permanent magnet brushless dc motor drive system is first investigated considering lumped disruption (interference, parametric complexity, and nonlinear dynamics). The built-in SMC can control the rotor speed in real time, as well as analyze and compensate for aggregated interruptions in rotor speed dynamics. In addition, the field-oriented control (FOC) method is developed to maximize torque production while drastically minimizing torque ripples. With this approach, the zero-torque pulsation constraint is gradually achieved at a wide speed range. The validation of the proposed CFT-SMC with FOC is carried out using simulation and experiments. According to the comparative study, the proposed sensorless control outperforms conventional methods due to the inclusion of iron loss.

AB This paper presents a novel methodology to enforce motion safety guarantees even in the event of a sudden loss of control capabilities by any agent within a multi-agent system. This passive safety methodology permits the replacement of point-evaluated constraints on the trajectory following a contingency with a single function of the integration constants of the equations of motion at contingency instants. The effects of uncertainties on the trajectory are compensated for through the method of variation of parameters. This permits a reduction in the number of required constraints by one polynomial degree in the number of discrete time samples, and allows computationally efficient enforcement of passive safety within a multi-agent optimal control problem, solvable using direct methods. The main application is distributed space systems employing miniaturized low-size-weight-and-power and commercial-off-the-shelf technology, which reduce mission financial costs at the expense of reliability. Experimental results for the upcoming VIrtual Super-resolution Optics with Reconfigurable Swarms mission, as well as complementary formation-flying test cases in eccentric orbits, demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methodology in achieving fault-tolerant safety guarantees, as well as computational efficiency.

AB The wave glider (WG) is a pioneering surface autonomous unmanned vehicle driven by wave energy and solar energy, which theoretically has the possibility of unlimited endurance. For the weak maneuverability and underactuated problems of the WG with a rudder system, an 8-DOF mathematical model of the WG with a propeller-rudder system is established in this paper. The performances of the turning ability, course response and course keeping of the WG with the propeller-rudder system and the rudder system are compared through nu-merical simulation, and the correctness of the mathematical model is verified through sea trial. In the envi-ronment of large current speed, a path following system based on predictive line-of-sight (PLOS) is proposed to solve the problem of large cross-track error in the path following performance of the WG with the rudder system. A state predictor is added to traditional LOS algorithm, the look-ahead distance is calculated by the predicted cross-track error and the actual cross-track error, and the desired course and desired course rate output by the PLOS are input to the course controller and the course rate controller, respectively. The simulation and sea trial show that the path following system with the PLOS is feasible and effective.

AB Due to the increasing number of fatal traffic accidents, there are strong desire for more effective and convenient techniques for driving fatigue detection. Here, we propose a unified framework - E-Key to simultaneously perform personal identification (PI) and driving fatigue detection using a convolutional neural network and attention (CNN-Attention) structure. The performance was assessed using EEG data collected through a wearable dry-sensor system from 31 healthy subjects undergoing a 90-min simulated driving task. In comparison with three widely-used competitive models (including CNN, CNN-LSTM, and Attention), the proposed scheme achieved the best (p < 0.01) performance in both PI (98.5%) and fatigue detection (97.8%). Besides, the spatial-temporal structure of the proposed framework exhibits an optimal balance between classification performance and computational efficiency. Additional validation analyses were conducted to assess the reliability and practicability of the model via re-configuring the kernel size and manipulating the input data, showing that it can achieve a satisfactory performance using a subset of the input data. In sum, these findings would pave the way for further practical implementation of in-vehicle expert system, showing great potential in autonomous driving and car-sharing where currently monitoring of PI and driving fatigue are of particular interest.

AB This work presents a bionic ciliary piezoelectric microsensor in d33 mode for enhancing performance of self -powered hydrodynamic perception. The sensor is composed of a cylindrical pillar emulating the fish cilium and a piezoelectric sensing diaphragm imitating the hair cell. Interdigital electrodes are designed on both sides of the sensing diaphragm to realize the radial polarization, whose pattern consists of a few semi-circular rings connected to each other. Based on the receptance method and Kirchhoff plate theory, a mathematical model is established to evaluate the resonance frequency of the sensor. The output characteristics of the sensor are numerically obtained by coupling the drag force acquired by computational fluid dynamics into the finite element model. The effects of key structural parameters on the sensor response are further investigated for the purpose of optimizing the device design. Prototypes are fabricated by the microelectromechanical systems technology and stereolithography, characterized using the impedance spectrum and tested employing a dipole stimulus. The experimental values of the sensor response to hydrodynamic flow velocities are in fine agreement with the numerical simulation. The results indicate a high sensitivity of 2.483 V/(m/s) and a relatively flat frequency response of the sensor. This work provides important guidance for designing the more efficient ciliary microsensor that can conduct flow field perception for underwater autonomous vehicles.

AB Many gaze tracking applications focus on use in personal devices such as mobile phones and PCs. However, gaze tracking in large screens poses challenges because with an increase in screen size, gaze tracking in the edge region decreases owing to the restricted range of human eye movement. In addition, as large screens are often exposed to the public, anyone can use the gaze tracking module. This makes it difficult to apply personalized calibration as in personal devices. To acquire accurate gaze in the edge region, we propose a novel approach-symmetric angle amplifying function-for the gaze angle, which amplifies angles when a user is looking at the edge area of the large screen. Our function is designed particularly for the case where the screen is divided into grid-shaped regions. Furthermore, for the better user experience, we optimize neural networks using the network-optimization framework and also propose a center gravity function that pulls gaze coordinates presented on the screen to the predefined center of the region to compensate for the person-wise difference in movement of the human eyes. Experimental results revealed the superiority of the proposed methods over the baseline and different types of fitting functions. The gaze tracking module serves as a part of an aggregated system and is implemented for use in autonomous vehicles.

AB The article presents a comprehensive study of a visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm designed for aerial vehicles. The goal of the research is to propose an improvement to the particle filter SLAM system that allows for more accurate and robust navigation of unknown environments. The authors introduce a modification that utilizes a homography matrix decomposition calculated from the camera frame-to-frame relationships. This procedure aims to refine the particle filter proposal distribution of the estimated robot state. In addition, the authors implement a mechanism of calculating a homography matrix from robot displacement, which is utilized to eliminate outliers in the frame-to-frame feature detection procedure. The algorithm is evaluated using simulation and real-world datasets, and the results show that the proposed improvements make the algorithm more accurate and robust. Specifically, the use of homography matrix decomposition allows the algorithm to be more efficient, with a smaller number of particles, without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, the incorporation of robot displacement information helps improve the accuracy of the feature detection procedure, leading to more reliable and consistent results. The article concludes with a discussion of the implemented and tested SLAM solution, highlighting its strengths and limitations. Overall, the proposed algorithm is a promising approach for achieving accurate and robust autonomous navigation of unknown environments.

AB Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has been widely used in augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), robotics, and autonomous vehicles as the theoretical basis for robots to perceive their environment. Most popular SLAM algorithms assume that objects in the scene are static. Solving dynamic problems in SLAM is now attracting increasing attention. In this article, we propose a method that combines semantic segmentation information and spatial motion information of associated pixels to cope with dynamic objects based on ORB-SLAM2. We add a deep segmentation network SegNet to segment input image and obtain the semantic information for each feature point. Next, the spatial velocity of feature points between adjacent frames is calculated assuming uniform motion. Finally, the two parts are fused for the final judgment, and the dynamic feature points are removed to improve positioning accuracy. We evaluate our SLAM algorithms using the public KITTI dataset. The proposed algorithm has a similar overall accuracy level to ORB-SLAM2, but it is more accurate in sequences with many dynamic objects. On KITTI's raw data sequence containing multiple dynamic objects, our pipeline achieves the best performance, improving 39.5% compared with the original ORB-SLAM2 system. We compare our algorithm with other state-of-the-art SLAM systems used to cope with dynamic environments. The results show that the proposed algorithm has a better performance.

   monocular 3D object detection
AB Monocular 3D object detection aims to predict the object location, dimension and orientation in 3D space alongside the object category given only a monocular image. It poses a great challenge due to its ill-posed property, which is a critical lack of depth information in the 2D image plane. While existing approaches leverage off-the-shelf depth estimation or rely on LiDAR sensors to mitigate this problem, dependence on the additional depth model or expensive equipment severely limits their scalability to generic 3D perception. In this paper, we propose a stereo-guided monocular 3D object detection framework, dubbed SGM3D, which aligns the monocular feature to the stereo feature and exploits the network's ability of generating the cross-modal feature for accurate 3D object detection. We present a multi-granularity feature alignment (MG-FA) mechanism to exploit the network's ability to generate stereo-mimicking features given only monocular cues. Coarse feature-level, as well as fine anchor-level feature alignment, are both leveraged for monocular feature guidance. In addition, we introduce an IoU matching-based feature alignment (IoU-MA) method for object-level feature alignment between the stereo and monocular predictions to alleviate the mismatches while adopting the MG-FA. Extensive experiments on the KITTI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhouzheyuan/sgm3d.

TI Path Planning of Unmanned Helicopter in Complex Environment Based on

AB Unmanned helicopters (UH) can evade radar detection by flying at ultralow altitudes, so as to conduct raids on targets. Path planning is one of the key technologies to realize UH's autonomous completion of raid missions. Since the probability of UH being detected by radar varies with height, how to accurately identify the radar coverage area to avoid crossing has become a difficult problem in UH path planning. Aiming at this problem, a heuristic deep Q-network (H-DQN) algorithm is proposed. First, as part of the comprehensive reward function, a heuristic reward function is designed. The function can generate dynamic rewards in real time according to the environmental information, so as to guide the UH to move closer to the target and at the same time promote the convergence of the algorithm. Second, in order to smooth the flight path, a smoothing reward function is proposed. This function can evaluate the pros and cons of UH's actions, so as to prompt UH to choose a smoother path for flight. Finally, the heuristic reward function, the smooth reward function, the collision penalty, and the completion reward are weighted and summed to obtain the heuristic comprehensive reward function. Simulation experiments show that the H-DQN algorithm can help UH to effectively avoid the radar coverage area and successfully complete the raid mission.

AB Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer both compelling potential advantages, including energy efficiency and low latencies and challenges including the non-differentiable nature of event spikes. Much of the initial research in this area has converted deep neural networks to equivalent SNNs, but this conversion approach potentially negates some of the advantages of SNN-based approaches developed from scratch. One promising area for high-performance SNNs is template matching and image recognition. This research introduces the first high-performance SNN for the Visual Place Recognition (VPR) task: given a query image, the SNN has to find the closest match out of a list of reference images. At the core of this new system is a novel assignment scheme that implements a form of ambiguity-informed salience, by up-weighting single-place-encoding neurons and down-weighting "ambiguous" neurons that respond to multiple different reference places. In a range of experiments on the challenging Nordland, Oxford RobotCar, SPEDTest, Synthia, and St Lucia datasets, we show that our SNN achieves comparable VPR performance to state-of-the-art and classical techniques, and degrades gracefully in performance with an increasing number of reference places. Our results provide a significant milestone towards SNNs that can provide robust, energy-efficient, and low latency robot localization.

AB Advanced technologies and innovation are essential for promoting sustainable food systems (SFSs) because these technologies can be used to answer some of the critical questions needed to transform SFSs and help us better understand global food security and nutrition. The main objective of this study is to address the question of whether technological innovations have an impact on the transformation of SFSs. There are certain innovations including agricultural land utilization, food processing, production systems, improvement in diets according to people's needs, and management of waste products. This study provides an overview of new technologies and innovations being used with potential to transform SFSs. Applications of emerging technologies in digital agriculture, including the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence and machine learning, drones, use of new physical systems (e.g., advanced robotics, autonomous vehicles, advanced materials), and gene technology (e.g., biofortified crops, genome-wide selection, genome editing), are discussed in this study. Additionally, we suggest eight action initiatives, which are transforming mindsets, enabling social licensing, changing policies and regulations, designing market incentives, safeguarding against undesirable effects, ensuring stable finance, building trust, and developing transition pathways that can hasten the transition to more SFSs. We conclude that appropriate incentives, regulations, and social permits play a critical role in enhancing the adoption of modern technologies to promote SFSs.

AB Accurate curved line shape object detection is important for assistant Autonomous Underwater Vehicles)AUVs(to complete underwater cable inspection tasks. In this article an algorithm based on adaptive canny's edge detection and an improved random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, called Crossline Correction Non-linear RANSAC (CCNL-RANSAC), is proposed to detect curved line object. The algorithm is featured on adaptive threshold in the canny's operator to improve correctness of edge detection, preliminary check and cross line correction introduced in a nonlinear RANSAC method to locate cables with better success rate and less execution time. Comprehensive underwater cable detection experiments were carried out by a range-gated imaging system in a big water tank. With the proposed CCNL-RANSAC algorithm, we increased success rate to 96% similar to 99% in line detection for the images of curved cable taken as far as 21 m long in clear water. The average execution time is reduced from 202 ms (using standard RANSAC) to 88 ms on average using CCNL-RANSAC, with 80% time reduction at most. With the help of CCNL-RSNSAC algorithm proposed in the paper, vision based AUVs is able to make auto inspection of curved cables and pipeline underwater, which will make the periodical checking of those marine structures more efficiently.

AB Persistent surveillance in a complex unknown urban area by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm is a low-cost, promising future application for anti-terrorism, disaster monitoring, and battlefield situational awareness. Based on over-simplified simulated surroundings and a UAV dynamic model, a few remarkable approaches have been proposed; however, they typically rely on non-sensor-based inputs and prior knowledge on the environment or targets. To overcome these limitations, based on simulated city blocks, a two-level quasi-distributed control framework is proposed for realizing the continuous control of a UAV swarm in two defined surveillance phases. With the support of a well-trained and corrected artificial neural network (ANN) in low-level UAV manoeuvre control for target homing and collision avoidance, several preliminary high-level target allocation strategies are designed for a cooperative overall objective based on the synchronization of local surveillance data. Then, via a series of numerical simulations, an optimal high-level strategy combination is identified. Finally, the surveillance performance of this strategy combination is evaluated under various swarm sizes and UAV launching patterns. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control framework is applicable for UAV swarm control in the persistent surveillance of unknown urban areas. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB This paper presents coupled and decoupled multi-autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) motion planning approaches for maximizing information gain. The work is motivated by applications in which multiple AUVs are tasked with obtaining video footage for the photogrammetric reconstruction of underwater archeological sites. Each AUV is equipped with a video camera and side-scan sonar. The side-scan sonar is used to initially collect low-resolution data to construct an information map of the site. Coupled and decoupled motion planning approaches with respect to this map are presented. Both planning methods seek to generate multi-AUV trajectories that capture close-up video footage of a site from a variety of different viewpoints, building on prior work in single-AUV rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) motion planning. The coupled and decoupled planners are compared in simulation. In addition, the multiple AUV trajectories constructed by each planner were executed at archeological sites located off the coast of Malta, albeit by a single-AUV due to limited resources. Specifically, each AUV trajectory for a plan was executed in sequence instead of simultaneously. Modifications are also made by both planners to a baseline RRT algorithm. The results of the paper present a number of trade-offs between the two planning approaches and demonstrate a large improvement in map coverage efficiency and runtime.

ID EXTREMUM SEEKING; GAME; STABILITY; NETWORKS
AB The problem of fast convergence to Nash equilibrium without steady state oscillation in static noncooperative games with N players is considered in this paper. In this regard, players can generate their actions to achieve Nash equilibrium only by measuring their own payoff values, which means that the players do not need any information about the details of payoff function or other players' actions. Additionally, in contrast to the most classical extremum seeking algorithms, this algorithm can converge to Nash equilibria without steady state oscillation and faster, because the amplitude of excitation sinusoidal signal in the conventional extremum seeking is adjusted to converge to zero, so the deleterious effects of steady state oscillation will be eliminated. Moreover, since each player can possess a dynamic, the actions are filtered before applying to the payoff function, which can make this algorithm appealing to many applications such as mobile sensor networks. In addition, the details of convergence to Nash equilibria are provided. Finally, we illustrate the application of this algorithm to solve the formation control problem of non-holonomic unicycles, and evasion of jammer attacks on unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs), which clearly shows the effectiveness and superiority of this algorithm through simulation results.

AB A detailed field investigation of a saline gravity current in the southwest Black Sea has enabled the first complete analysis of three-dimensional flow structure and dynamics of a series of linked hydraulic jumps in,stratified, density-driven, flows. These field observations were collected using an acoustic Doppler current profiler mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle, and reveal that internal mixing processes in hydraulic jumps, including flow expansion and recirculation, provide a previously unrecognised mechanism for grain-size sorting and segregation in stratified density-driven flows. Field observations suggest a newly identified type of hydraulic jump, that is a stratified low Froude number (<1.5-2) subaqueous hydraulic jump, with an enhanced ability to transport sediment downstream of the jump, in comparison to hydraulic jumps in other subaerial and submarine flows. These novel field data underpin a new process-based conceptual model of channel lobe transition zones (CLTZs) that explains the scattered offset nature of scours within such settings, the temporal variations in infill and erosion between adjacent scours, how bed shear stresses are maintained across the CLTZ, and why the locus of deposition is so far downstream of the scour zone.

ID NAVIGATION
AB Motivated by the advances in acoustic modem technology and the growing number of applications that call for ad hoc deployable autonomous underwater systems (floating sensors, crawlers, vehicles), we address the problem of network initialization upon deployment. A neighbor discovery protocol is proposed, whose goal is to establish communication links over a large area, with a finite power budget that mandates multi-hopping to provide full coverage. The protocol uses random access to eliminate the need for scheduling (i.e., enable system operation without a global clock reference) and power control to ensure that full connectivity is provided using shortest links (i.e., to conserve batteries and prolong the system's lifetime). Transmit power allocation takes into account the acoustic propagation loss, while additional large-scale variation in the average received power is modeled via log-normal fading which is confirmed by experimental observations. System performance is assessed through simulation, by measuring the energy consumption, time to completion, and reliability in the presence of fading. Fading is shown to have a degrading effect on the system reliability, and protocol adjustments are proposed to recover the performance under the constraint on maximum power. The key features of the protocol are simplicity of implementation and efficient use of power.Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper presents a general review of the distribution of mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) in relationship to geomorphology in US waters. It was specifically concerned with the depth range of 30-100 m, where more than 186,000 km(2) of potential seafloor area was identified within the US Gulf of Mexico/Florida, Caribbean, and main Hawaiian Islands. The geomorphology of MCEs was largely inherited from a variety of pre-existing structures of highly diverse origins, which, in combination with environmental stress and physical controls, restrict the distribution of MCEs. Sea-level history, along with depositional and erosional processes, played an integral role in formation of MCE settings. However, mapping the distribution of both potential MCE topography/substrate and existing MCE habitat is only beginning. Mapping techniques pertinent to understanding morphology and MCE distributions are discussed throughout this paper. Future investigations need to consider more cost-effective and remote methods (such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and acoustics) in order to assess the distribution and extent of MCE habitat. Some understanding of the history of known MCEs through coring studies would help understand their initiation and response to environmental change over time, essential for assessing how they may be impacted by future environmental change.

AB Light transmission through sea ice is a critical process for energy partitioning at the polar atmosphere-ice-ocean boundary. Transmission of sunlight strongly impacts sea ice melting by absorption, as well as heat deposition, and primary productivity in the upper ocean. While earlier observations relied on a limited number of point observations, the recent years have seen an increase in spatially distributed light measurements underneath sea ice using remotely operated vehicles covering a wide range of ice conditions. These measurements allow us to reconstruct the seasonal evolution of the spatial variability in light transmission. Here we present measurements of sea ice light transmittance distributions from 6 years of Arctic under-ice remotely operated vehicle operations. The data set covers the entire melt period of Central Arctic sea ice. Data are combined into a pseudo time series describing the seasonal evolution of the spatial variability of sea ice optical properties from spring to autumn freezeup. In spring, snowmelt increases light transmission continuously, until a secondary mode originating from translucent melt ponds appears in the histograms of light transmittance. This secondary mode persists long into autumn, before snowfall reduces overall light levels again. Comparison to several autonomous time series measurements from single locations confirms the detected general patterns of the seasonal evolution of light transmittance variability. This also includes characteristic spectral features caused by biological processes at the ice underside. The results allow for the evaluation of three different light transmittance parameterizations, implying that light transmission in current ice-ocean models may not be accurately represented on large scales throughout all seasons while ice thickness alone is a poor predictor of light transmittance.
   Plain Language Summary The interaction of sunlight with sea ice is an important key to the understanding of Arctic climate. The amount of sunlight penetrating through the ice is strongly dependent on ice and snow thickness. Optical properties of ice and snow change throughout the season. Also, sea ice properties, such as ice thickness, the cover by snow, or melt ponds are drastically changing within a few meters. To investigate the effect of these differences, we use an underwater robot to acquire high-resolution light measurements under Arctic sea ice. This enables us to describe the variations of optical properties of sea ice during the seasonal cycle. On the basis of a compilation of data from multiple expeditions, we discuss how current parameterizations in climate models need to be adapted to correctly describe the amount of light present under sea ice.

AB Chemical harvest aids applied by ground-based machines with heavy wheels and high-volume spraying in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) fields to defoliate leaves and ripen bolls before harvest threaten soil health and result in cotton yield loss. For example, ground-based machines roll over cotton plants at corners and pull the cotton branches between rows, resulting in yield loss. Furthermore, heavy wheels can cause soil compaction, resulting in decreased soil biodiversity. High-volume spraying often results in harvest aids polluting the soil. A new harvest-aid application method that can save water, increase harvest-aid utilization rate without damage to soils and crops is needed to apply chemical harvest aids before harvest. Small plant protection unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with low-volume spraying methods have emerged as pesticide application technologies in recent years in China due to their high efficiency, high flexibility, low labor requirements, water savings and lack of damage to crops and soils. Here, UAVs are developed for chemical harvest-aid application by evaluating the cotton defoliation efficacy, boll opening rate, lint cotton yield and fiber quality components at two cotton field experimental sites in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China in 2016 and 2017. Ground-based machine treatment is used as a reference. The assessment is proceeded with the following steps: (1) The spray volume of UAV is optimized in 2016; (2) The experiment of 2016 is repeated to determine the optimal spray volume in 2017. The results show the following: (1) The harvest-aid performance is sensitive to the spray volume in the UAV low-volume spraying treatment, and optimal defoliation efficacy is achieved when the spray volume is 22.5 L/ha and flight velocity is 4 m/s, according to the field tests in 2016 and 2017. (2) Low-volume spraying using UAV has no negative influence on the lint cotton yield and fiber quality components. In conclusion, it is feasible to use plant protection UAV for cotton harvest-aid applications in preparation for machine harvesting.

AB An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) carrying a multibeam sonar and a chirp profiler was used to map sections of the seafloor within the La Jolla Canyon, offshore southern California, at sub-meter scales. Close-up observations and sampling were conducted during remotely operated vehicle (ROV) dives. Minisparker seismic-reflection profiles from a surface ship help to define the overall geometry of the La Jolla Canyon especially with respect to the pre-canyon host sediments.
   The floor of the axial channel is covered with unconsolidated sand similar to the sand on the shelf near the canyon head, lacks outcrops of the pre-canyon host strata, has an almost constant slope of 1.0 and is covered with trains of crescent shaped bedforms. The presence of modern plant material entombed within these sands confirms that the axial channel is presently active. The sand on the canyon floor liquefied during vibracore collection and flowed downslope, illustrating that the sediment filling the channel can easily fail even on this gentle slope.
   Data from the canyon walls help constrain the age of the canyon and extent of incision. Horizontal beds of moderately cohesive fine-grained sediments exposed on the steep canyon walls are consistently less than 1.232 million years old. The lateral continuity of seismic reflectors in minisparker profiles indicate that pre-canyon host strata extend uninterrupted from outside the canyon underneath some terraces within the canyon. Evidence of abandoned channels and point bar-like deposits are noticeably absent on the inside bend of channel meanders and in the subsurface of the terraces. While vibracores from the surface of terraces contain thin (<10 cm) turbidites, they are inferred to be part of a veneer of recent sediment covering pre-canyon host sediments that underpin the terraces. The combined use of state of the art seafloor mapping and exploration tools provides a uniquely detailed view of the morphology within an active submarine canyon. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Lane detection is a crucial task in the field of autonomous driving, as it enables vehicles to safely navigate on the road by interpreting the high-level semantics of traffic signs. Unfortunately, lane detection is a challenging problem due to factors such as low-light conditions, occlusions, and lane line blurring. These factors increase the perplexity and indeterminacy of the lane features, making them hard to distinguish and segment. To tackle these challenges, we propose a method called low-light enhancement fast lane detection (LLFLD) that integrates the automatic low-light scene enhancement network (ALLE) with the lane detection network to improve lane detection performance under low-light conditions. Specifically, we first utilize the ALLE network to enhance the input image's brightness and contrast while reducing excessive noise and color distortion. Then, we introduce symmetric feature flipping module (SFFM) and channel fusion self-attention mechanism (CFSAT) to the model, which refine the low-level features and utilize more abundant global contextual information, respectively. Moreover, we devise a novel structural loss function that leverages the inherent prior geometric constraints of lanes to optimize the detection results. We evaluate our method on the CULane dataset, a public benchmark for lane detection in various lighting conditions. Our experiments show that our approach surpasses other state of the arts in both daytime and nighttime settings, especially in low-light scenarios.

AB In this paper, we investigate jamming-resilient UAV path planning strategies for data collection in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, in which the typical UAV can learn the optimal trajectory to elude such jamming attacks. Specifically, the typical UAV is required to collect data from multiple distributed IoT nodes under collision avoidance, mission completion deadline, and kinematic constraints in the presence of jamming attacks. We first design a fixed ground jammer with continuous jamming attack and periodical jamming attack strategies to jam the link between the typical UAV and IoT nodes. Defensive strategies involving a reinforcement learning (RL) based virtual jammer and the adoption of higher SINR thresholds are proposed to counteract against such attacks. Secondly, we design an intelligent UAV jammer, which utilizes the RL algorithm to choose actions based on its observation. Then, an intelligent UAV anti-jamming strategy is constructed to deal with such attacks, and the optimal trajectory of the typical UAV is obtained via dueling double deep Q-network (D3QN). Simulation results show that both non-intelligent and intelligent jamming attacks have significant influence on the UAV's performance, and the proposed defense strategies can recover the performance close to that in no-jammer scenarios.

AB Realizing autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) inspection is of great significance for power line maintenance. This paper introduces a scheme of using the structure of a tower to realize visual geographical positioning of UAV for tower inspection and presents a monocular semantic simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) framework termed PTI-SLAM (power tower inspection SLAM) to cope with the challenge of a tower inspection scene. The proposed scheme utilizes prior knowledge of tower component geolocation and regards geographical positioning as the estimation of transformation between SLAM and the geographic coordinates. To accomplish the robust positioning and semi-dense semantic mapping with limited computing power, PTI-SLAM combines the feature-based SLAM method with a fusion-based direct method and conveys a loosely coupled architecture of a semantic task and a SLAM task. The fusion-based direct method is specially designed to overcome the fragility of the direct method against adverse conditions concerning the inspection scene. Experiment results show that PTI-SLAM inherits the robustness advantage of the feature-based method and the semi-dense mapping ability of the direct method and achieves decimeter-level real-time positioning in the airborne system. The experiment concerning geographical positioning indicates more competitive accuracy compared to the previous visual approach and artificial UAV operating, demonstrating the potential of PTI-SLAM.

AB This paper presents a novel work for classification of road surfaces using deep learning method-based convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. With the development of advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies, the need for research on vehicle state recognition has increased. However, research on road surface classification has not yet been conducted. If road surface classification and recognition are possible, the control system can make a more robust decision by validating the information from other sensors. Therefore, road surface classification is essential. To achieve this, tire-pavement interaction noise (TPIN) is adopted as a data source for road surface classification. Accelerometers and vision sensors have been used in conventional approaches. The disadvantage of acceleration signals is that they can only represent the surface profile properties and are masked by the resonance characteristics of the car structure. An image signal can be easily contaminated by factors such as illumination, obstacles, and blurring while driving. However, the TPIN signal reflects the surface profile properties of the road and its texture properties. The TPIN signal is also robust compared to those in which the image signal is affected. The measured TPIN signal is converted into a 2-dimensional image through time-frequency analysis. Converted images were used together with a CNN architecture to examine the feasibility of the road surface classification system.

AB This paper proposes a novel Distributed-Integrated Model Predictive Control (DI-MPC) strategy for the multi-vessel cooperative path following, formation control and obstacle avoidance. Each vessel is designed with an individually distributed controller based on the MPC theory and communication graph. Subject to actuator limitations and formation constraints, the motion control and thrust allocation are integrated into a dynamic model to achieve direct control to the thrusters. A bivariate thrust efficiency matrix is embedded into the model to consider the hydrodynamic interaction effects between adjacent thrusters. The Nominal System is introduced to generate the linearized predictive model. To achieve consensus among various vessels, a real-time iterative negotiation framework is established. The Kalman Filter is utilized to estimate the low-frequency state variables from the external disturbances of environment loads and measurement noises. Numerical simulations based on the proposed distributed strategy and the centralized strategy are carried out under the scenario of cooperative operation in the Huangpu River (in Shanghai). Comparative analysis results demonstrate the high control performance of both the strategies. DI-MPC mainly contributes to the system flexibility, computational cost reduction (67.65%), energy consumption reduction (5.03%) and fault-tolerant capability. Furthermore, DI-MPC also shows strong applicability to large-scale cooperative control problems.

AB Mobile robot autonomous path planning is an essential factor for its wide deployment in real-world applications. Conventional sampling-based algorithms have gained tremendous success in the path planning field, but they usually take much time to find the optimal solution so that the planning quality (evaluated with time cost and path length) cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, based on Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) and the family of Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) schemes, we propose the GMR-RRT* algorithm to achieve fast path planning for mobile robots. The proposed GMR-RRT* consists of learning navigation behaviors from human demonstrations and planning a high-quality path for the robot. Using the GMR, the key features of human demonstrations are captured to form a probability density distribution of the human trajectory in the current environment. This distribution is further utilized to guide the RRT scheme's sampling process to generate a feasible path in the current environment quickly. We test the proposed GMR-RRT* in different environments, comparing it with three state-of-the-art sampling-based algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the GMR-RRT* algorithm can achieve better performance in terms of time cost, memory usage, and path length.

AB Vision processing for control of agile autonomous robots requires low-latency computation, within a limited power and space budget. This is challenging for conventional computing hardware. Parallel processor arrays (PPAs) are a new class of vision sensor devices that exploit advances in semiconductor technology, embedding a processor within each pixel of the image sensor array. Sensed pixel data are processed on the focal plane, and only a small amount of relevant information is transmitted out of the vision sensor. This tight integration of sensing, processing, and memory within a massively parallel computing architecture leads to an interesting trade-off between high performance, low latency, low power, low cost, and versatility in a machine vision system. Here, we review the history of image sensing and processing hardware from the perspective of in-pixel computing and outline the key features of a state-of-the-art smart camera system based on a PPA device, through the description of the SCAMP-5 system. We describe several robotic applications for agile ground and aerial vehicles, demonstrating PPA sensing functionalities including high-speed odometry, target tracking, obstacle detection, and avoidance. In the conclusions, we provide some insight and perspective on the future development of PPA devices, including their application and benefits within agile, robust, adaptable, and lightweight robotics.

AB While AI has benefited humans, it may also harm humans if not appropriately developed. The priority of current HCI work should focus on transiting from conventional human interaction with non-AI computing systems to interaction with AI systems. We conducted a high-level literature review and a holistic analysis of current work in developing AI systems from an HCI perspective. Our review and analysis highlight the new changes introduced by AI technology and the new challenges that HCI professionals face when applying the human-centered AI (HCAI) approach in the development of AI systems. We also identified seven main issues in human interaction with AI systems, which HCI professionals did not encounter when developing non-AI computing systems. To further enable the implementation of the HCAI approach, we identified new HCI opportunities tied to specific HCAI-driven design goals to guide HCI professionals addressing these new issues. Finally, our assessment of current HCI methods shows the limitations of these methods in support of developing HCAI systems. We propose the alternative methods that can help overcome these limitations and effectively help HCI professionals apply the HCAI approach to the development of AI systems. We also offer strategic recommendation for HCI professionals to effectively influence the development of AI systems with the HCAI approach, eventually developing HCAI systems.

AB To mitigate road-related problems such as safety and traffic congestion, the evolution towards cooperative communicating technologies and autonomous systems is considered a solution to overcome human physical limitations and the limited perception horizon of on-board sensors. This paper describes the implementation of the Collective Perception Service (CPS) in a real road infrastructure with the goal of providing information to automated vehicles and to a central road operator. The Collective Perception Messages are built by retrieving information from traffic classification radars for local dissemination using ITS-G5 radio technology and for broader access by disseminating the messages into a central entity. The service is improved by applying some rules for optimizing the message dissemination in order to increase radio channel efficiency. The results of the experimental tests showed that the end-to-end delay between the production event of the Collective Perception Message (CPM) and the reception by other ITS stations is within the boundaries defined by ETSI standards. Moreover, the algorithm for message dissemination also shows improvement in the radio channel efficiency by limiting the number of objects disseminated by CPM messages. The developed Collective Perception Service and the road infrastructure are, therefore, a valuable asset to provide useful information for increasing road safety and fostering the deployment of Cooperative, Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM) applications.

AB Collision-free space detection is a critical component of autonomous vehicle perception. The state-of-the-art algorithms are typically based on supervised deep learning. Their performance is dependent on the quality and amount of labeled training data. It remains an open challenge to train deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) using only a small quantity of training samples. Therefore, in this article, we mainly explore an effective training data augmentation approach that can be employed to improve the overall DCNN performance, when additional images captured from different views are available. Due to the fact that the pixels in collision-free space (generally regarded as a planar surface) between two images, captured from different views, can be associated using a homography matrix, the target image can be transformed into the reference view. This provides a simple but effective way to generate training data from additional multiview images. Extensive experimental results, conducted with six state-of-the-art semantic segmentation DCNNs on three datasets, validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for enhancing collision-free space detection performance. When validated on the KITTI road benchmark, our approach provides the best results, compared with other state-of-the-art stereo vision-based collision-free space detection approaches.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES; GLOBAL OCEAN
AB Ocean gliders are increasingly a platform of choice to close the gap between traditional ship-based observations and remote sensing from floats (e.g., Argo) and satellites. However, gliders move slowly and are strongly influenced by currents, reducing useful battery life, challenging mission planning, and increasing pilot workload. We describe a new cloud-based interactive tool to plan glider navigation called OceanGNS(C) (Ocean Glider Navigation System). OceanGNS integrates current forecasts and historical data to enable glider route-planning at varying scales. OceanGNS utilizes optimal route-planning by minimizing low current velocity constraints by applying a Dijkstra algorithm. The complexity of the resultant path is reduced using a Ramer-Douglas Pueckler model. Users can choose the weighting for historical and forecast data as well as bathymetry and time constraints. Bathymetry is considered using a cost function approach when shallow water is not desirable to find an optimal path that also lies in deeper water. Initial field tests with OceanGNS in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Labrador Sea show promising results, improving the glider speed to the destination 10-30%. We use these early tests to demonstrate the utility of OceanGNS to extend glider endurance. This paper provides an overview of the tool, the results from field trials, and a future outlook.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Robust autonomous driving, as long as it relies on satellite-based positioning, requires carrier-phase-based algorithms, among other types of data sources, to obtain precise and true positions, which is also primarily true for the use of GNSS geodetic receivers, but also increasingly true for mass-market devices. The experiment was conducted under line-of-sight conditions on a straight road during a period of no traffic. The receivers were positioned on the roof of a car travelling at low speed in the presence of a static jammer, while kinematic relative positioning was performed with the static reference base receiver. Interference mitigation techniques in the GNSS receivers used, which were unknown to the authors, were compared using (a) the observed carrier-to-noise power spectral density ratio as an indication of the receivers' ability to improve signal quality, and (b) the post-processed position solutions based on RINEX-formatted data. The observed carrier-to-noise density generally exerts the expected dependencies and leaves space for comparisons of applied processing abilities in the receivers, while conclusions on the output data results comparison are limited due to the non-synchronized clocks of the receivers. According to our current and previous results, none of the GNSS receivers used in the experiments employs an effective type of complete mitigation technique adapted to the chirp jammer.

AB Consider a set of landmarks that are distributed in an emergency scene and each needs a specific number of robots in its vicinity. This paper presents a two-stage framework for deploying robots autonomously for such scenarios. In the first stage, a Two-hop Cooperative Virtual Force Robot Deployment (Two-hop COVER) technique is employed. It expedites the deployment process by establishing a cooperative relationship between robots and neighboring landmarks. Two-hop communication is utilized as well to reduce the deployment time and traveled distance by robots to satisfy the mission requirements and optimize the deployment process. However, in certain scenarios, Two-hop COVER may not achieve full demand satisfaction. Therefore, the second stage, called Trace Fingerprint is invoked to guarantee full satisfaction. Finally, a fairness-aware version of Two-hop COVER is presented to consider scenarios in which the mission requirements are greater than the available resources (i.e. robots) and hence, the fairness-aware approach dispatches robots in proportion to each landmark's need. Extensive simulation experiments have been carried out to assess the performance of the proposed framework. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches considering several performance factors, such as total travelled distance, total exchanged messages, total deployment time, and Jain's fairness index.

AB Global economic and social life has been severely challenged since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 disease a pandemic. Travel, tourism and hospitality, in particular, has been massively impacted by the lockdowns used to maintain social distance to manage the disease. Robotics, artificial intelligence, and human-robot interactions have gained an increased presence to help manage the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals, airports, transportation systems, recreation and scenic areas, hotels, restaurants, and communities in general. Humanoid robots, autonomous vehicles, drones, and other intelligent robots are used in many different ways to reduce human contact and the potential spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including delivering materials, disinfecting and sterilizing public spaces, detecting or measuring body temperature, providing safety or security, and comforting and entertaining patients. While controversial in the past due to concerns over job losses and data privacy, the adoption of robotics and artificial intelligence in travel and tourism will likely continue after the COVID-19 pandemic becomes less serious. Tourism scholars should seize this opportunity to develop robotic applications that enhance tourist experiences, the protection of natural and cultural resources, citizen participation in tourism development decision making, and the emergence of new 'high-touch' employment opportunities for travel, tourism and hospitality workers.

AB With the advent of the 5G and Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) era, related technologies such as the Internet of Things, big data analysis, cloud applications, and artificial intelligence have brought broad prospects to many application fields, such as smart homes, autonomous vehicles, smart cities, healthcare, and smart campus. At present, most university campus app is presented in the form of static web pages or app menus. This study mainly developed a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based emotionally aware campus virtual assistant. The main contributions of this research are: (1) This study introduces the Chinese Word Embedding to the robot dialogue system, effectively improving dialogue tolerance and semantic interpretation. (2) The traditional method of emotion identification must first tokenize the Chinese sentence, analyze the clauses and part of speech, and capture the emotional keywords before being interpreted by the expert system. Different from the traditional method, this study classifies the input directly through the convolutional neural network after the input sentence is converted into a spectrogram by Fourier Transform. (3) This study is presented in App mode, which is easier to use and economical.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is a ubiquitous system connecting many different devices-the things-which can be accessed from the distance. The cyber-physical systems (CPSs) monitor and control the things from the distance. As a result, the concepts of dependability and security get deeply intertwined. The increasing level of dynamicity, heterogeneity, and complexity adds to the system's vulnerability, and challenges its ability to react to faults. This paper summarizes the state of the art of existing work on anomaly detection, fault-tolerance, and self-healing, and adds a number of other methods applicable to achieve resilience in an IoT. We particularly focus on non-intrusive methods ensuring data integrity in the network. Furthermore, this paper presents the main challenges in building a resilient IoT for the CPS, which is crucial in the era of smart CPS with enhanced connectivity (an excellent example of such a system is connected autonomous vehicles). It further summarizes our solutions, work-in-progress and future work to this topic to enable "Trustworthy IoT for CPS". Finally, this framework is illustrated on a selected use case: a smart sensor infrastructure in the transport domain.

AB Fundamental computer science concepts have inspired novel information-processing molecular systems in test tubes(1)(-13) and genetically encoded circuits in live cells(14)(-21). Recent research has shown that digital information storage in DNA, implemented using deep sequencing and conventional software, can approach the maximum Shannon information capacity(22) of two bits per nucleotide(23). In nature, DNA is used to store genetic programs, but the information content of the encoding rarely approaches this maximum(24). We hypothesize that the biological function of a genetic program can be preserved while reducing the length of its DNA encoding and increasing the information content per nucleotide. Here we support this hypothesis by describing an experimental procedure for compressing a genetic program and its subsequent autonomous decompression and execution in human cells. As a test-bed we choose an RNAi cell classifier circuit(25) that comprises redundant DNA sequences and is therefore amenable for compression , as are many other complex gene circuits(15)(,18,26-28). In one example, we implement a compressed encoding of a ten-gene four-input AND gate circuit using only four genetic constructs. The compression principles applied to gene circuits can enable fitting complex genetic programs into DNA delivery vehicles with limited cargo capacity, and storing compressed and biologically inert programs in vivo for on-demand activation.

AB Collaboration is essential for effective performance by groups of robots in disaster response settings. Here we are particularly interested in heterogeneous robots that collaborate in complex scenarios with incomplete, dynamically changing information. In detail, we consider an automated victim search setting, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with different capabilities work together to scan for mobile phones and find and provide information about possible victims near these phone locations. The state of the art for such collaboration is robot control based on independent planning for robots with different tasks and typically incorporates uncertainty with only a limited scope. In contrast, in this paper, we take into account complex relations between robots with different tasks. As a result, we create a joint, full horizon plan for the whole robot team by optimising over the uncertainty of future information gain using an online planner with hindsight optimisation. This joint plan is also used for further optimisation of individual UAV paths based on the long-term plans of all robots. We evaluate our planner's performance in a realistic simulation environment based on a real disaster and find that our approach finds victims 25% faster compared to current state-of-the-art approaches.

AB The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to carry out remote aerial surveys has become prominent in recent years. The UAV-based survey faces several operational issues, such as complicated terrain, limited UAV resources, obstacles, sensor limitations, and other environmental factors. In addition, the coverage plan includes numerous objectives, such as lowering path length, maximizing coverage, and limiting survey time, necessitating multi-objective optimization. UAVs require effective coverage path planning (CPP) to generate the ideal route. It involves determining the path which encompasses every point inside the required region under different constraints. The process automates the process of route determination for autonomous operation by considering various environmental constraints. In this paper, we explore and analyze the existing research on the various techniques used in coverage route planning for UAVs. It provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art CPP methods for UAVs. The study discusses the key challenges and requirements of CPP for UAVs and presents various approaches proposed in the literature to tackle these challenges. We explore a variety of geometric flight patterns for the area of interest having UAV deployment. It also features multi-UAV and multi-region coverage strategies, providing a new dimension to UAV-based operations. The energy consumption of UAVs during CPP is an essential factor, as it influences their flight length and mission duration. The design of the CPP algorithm is determined by the unique requirements of the UAV application, such as the size and form of the region to be mapped, the existence of obstacles, and the desired coverage resolution. Path planning strategies in a three-dimensional environment and dynamic coverage are also included in the study. Moreover, we compare the existing strategies using different performance metrics to evaluate the success of covering missions. Finally, the problems and unresolved concerns related to UAV coverage path planning are examined to provide valuable insights to the readers.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB It is of great significance to ensure public transportation management capabilities by improving urban public transport services. One method is to solve the problems related to the quality of data submitted for public funding as well as the accuracy and transparency of the supervision and review processes; moreover, improving public-transportation-service systems is a viable method to solve such problems. With technological advancements and the application of new technologies such as automatic driving and multiple payment, it has gradually become difficult for user-data verification systems, based on the original single bus payment method, to cater to these new technologies. Diversified payment and complex management methods have highlighted the need for new verification methods. Firstly, in this paper, we constructed the Origin-Destination (OD) model of bus-passenger flows by using real-time transmission of passenger-multiple-payment data, on-board-video passenger flow detection data and vehicle real-time positioning data. On this basis, the bus waybill data of other intelligent bus systems and the wait data of bus stations were integrated, so as to establish the travel chain theory by matching passenger flow and the temporal and spatial distribution model. Then, an OD analysis of public-transport passenger flows could be carried out, with a detailed analysis of vehicle, station and line-passenger flow, and the travel characteristics of public transport passenger flow could be excavated. Then, according to the means-end chain theory, the spatiotemporal distribution of the passenger flow data was obtained to carry out an OD analysis of the passenger flow, so as to perform a refinement analysis of the vehicle, station, and passenger flow. Thereby, the characteristics of the passenger flow were explored. Subsequently, payment-authenticity-verification models were established for the data-validity assessment, video-data analysis, passenger-flow estimation, and early warnings in order to determine the authenticity of the payment data. Lastly, based on the multi-sensor passenger flow data fusion and the data authenticity verification models, combined with the application of new technologies such as the use of autonomous buses, the test was promoted. That is, by taking intelligent bus scheduling as the scenario, the research method was tested and verified with real-time passenger flow data according to historical data. The results showed that the method accurately predicted the passenger flow, and had a positive role in improving the efficiency of payment-data-authenticity verification. The application of the method can enhance the management and service quality of public transportation.

ID MODEL
AB Identifying lane markings is a key technology in assisted driving and autonomous driving. The traditional sliding window lane detection algorithm has good detection performance in straight lanes and curves with small curvature, but its detection and tracking performance is poor in curves with larger curvature. Large curvature curves are common scenes in traffic roads. Therefore, in response to the problem of poor lane detection performance of traditional sliding window lane detection algorithms in large curvature curves, this article improves the traditional sliding window algorithm and proposes a sliding window lane detection calculation method, which integrates steering wheel angle sensors and binocular cameras. When a vehicle first enters a bend, the curvature of the bend is not significant. Traditional sliding window algorithms can effectively detect the lane line of the bend and provide angle input to the steering wheel, enabling the vehicle to travel along the lane line. However, as the curvature of the curve increases, traditional sliding window lane detection algorithms cannot track lane lines well. Considering that the steering wheel angle of the car does not change much during the adjacent sampling time of the video, the steering wheel angle of the previous frame can be used as input for the lane detection algorithm of the next frame. By using the steering wheel angle information, the search center of each sliding window can be predicted. If the number of white pixels within the rectangular range centered around the search center is greater than the threshold, the average of the horizontal coordinate values of these white pixels will be used as the horizontal coordinate value of the sliding window center. Otherwise, the search center will be used as the center of the sliding window. A binocular camera is used to assist in locating the position of the first sliding window. The simulation and experimental results show that compared with traditional sliding window lane detection algorithms, the improved algorithm can better recognize and track lane lines with large curvature in bends.

ID SELECTION
AB Deep learning networks, emerging machine learning models that present beyond human-level performance in terms of accuracy, are critically vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This vulnerability limits the utilization of deep learning architecture in many real-world safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, sensitive industrial systems, etc. Adversarial attacks are methods to measure the robustness of different architectures and can be used to evaluate the suitability of a model to be used in a safety-critical situation. White-box sparse adversarial attacks can unhide interesting features of deep learning networks by identifying critical elements in the input pattern to design black-box attacks. This motivated us to design a new algorithmic procedure to design sparse adversarial attacks to feed-forward neural networks based on sparsity regularization. The proposed method comes with the gradual sparsification which starts by designing a dense attack and prone it until a desired level of sparsity is attained. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in designing attacks on convolutional neural networks and attention-based architectures for image classification task using three non-smooth sparsity-promoting regularizers. Compared to the state-of-the-art sparse attack schemes, we show that the proposed method can significantly decrease the time needed to design the attack, while the perturbation distortion is unchanged or reduced in some cases.

AB Safety is a critical concern for autonomous quadrotor systems, which can be compromised by geofences such as narrow terrains and physiographic barriers. Moreover, the maneuverability of quadrotors within geofences is significantly impacted by the underactuated system properties. This article focuses on designing a constructive error-state linear quadratic regulation (LQR) geofencing tracking controller for underactuated quadrotor systems. In particular, the translational and rotational information of quadrotors are unified in one feedback loop to achieve full-state feedback control, while still maintaining external motion constraints and inherent input saturation. First, the rotational error is expressed in the Lie algebra using the logarithmic map of SO(3), enabling attitude errors to be operated in a vector space. Then, the error-state dynamics are linearized at each time step based on the current information, far from the singularity. Furthermore, an optimal LQR control strategy is proposed to directly control the quadrotor's force and torque without requiring parameter tuning. The Lyapunov stability theory is used to rigorously prove the asymptotic stability of the proposed controller. Exponential control barrier functions based on superellipsoid envelopes are employed to solve the position constraint of a higher relative degree and input saturation. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the proposed safe tracking control scheme is demonstrated through numerical simulations and real-world experiments.

AB Many autonomous agents, such as intelligent vehicles, are inherently required to interact with one another. Game theory provides a natural mathematical tool for robot motion planning in such interactive settings. However, tractable algorithms for such problems usually rely on a strong assumption, namely that the objectives of all players in the scene are known. To make such tools applicable for ego-centric planning with only local information, we propose an adaptive model-predictive game solver, which jointly infers other players' objectives online and computes a corresponding generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) strategy. The adaptivity of our approach is enabled by a differentiable trajectory game solver whose gradient signal is used for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of opponents' objectives. This differentiability of our pipeline facilitates direct integration with other differentiable elements, such as neural networks (NNs). Furthermore, in contrast to existing solvers for cost inference in games, our method handles not only partial state observations but also general inequality constraints. In two simulated traffic scenarios, we find superior performance of our approach over both existing game-theoretic methods and non-game-theoretic model-predictive control (MPC) approaches. We also demonstrate our approach's real-time planning capabilities and robustness in two-player hardware experiments.

AB This paper considers the formation trajectory tracking problem of discrete-time distributed multi-AUVs (multiple autonomous underwater vehicles) with control input in a nonconvex set and weak communication. Firstly, a linear model of a single AUV is obtained by the feedback linearization of a single AUV model using the Lie derivative theory. Then, a linear equation of multi-AUV formation is obtained, and the formation coordinated control system of multi-AUVs based on the feedback linearization model is given. Secondly, the formation trajectory tracking problem of multi-AUVs is transformed into the coordination control problem of leader-followers formation. The coordination controller of the leader-followers formation under a weak communication environment is designed, and the controller satisfies the nonconvex constraints. Next, the coordination control problem of leader-followers formation is transformed into the stability of the error of leader and followers at zero by coordinate transformation. By establishing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii function, the corresponding linear matrix inequalities are obtained, and the condition of zero stability is obtained by solving the linear matrix inequalities of the leader-followers formation. Under this condition, stable trajectory tracking can be achieved in the multi-AUV formation. Finally, the stability of the designed coordination controller is verified by simulation experiments.

AB Sustainable and connected mobility concepts for the future are increasingly sought-after. Among many factors, providing high service quality is key to their commercial success. In pick-up scenarios of shared automated mobility on-demand (SAMOD), the new concept of virtual stops (vStop) improves control and planning, and the human-machine interface (HMI) associated with it aims to increase usability for users. This paper elaborates on the new concept in-depth and presents two user-centered online-interview studies. The objectives were 1) capturing users' information requirements when using SAMOD, and 2) evaluating an early-stage vStop HMI prototype in terms of user experience. Results show that the HMI prototype's high pragmatic quality corresponds to the user's desire for distinctive information. This aspect becomes especially valuable to users when picked up at unfamiliar traffic locations. Conclusions from both studies lead to initial design guidelines for a vStop HMI, which could be implemented using mobile augmented reality. This work is a starting point for user-centered HMI development for vStops. It contributes to widespread deployment of SAMOD in the future and fosters the change towards more sustainable mobility solutions.

AB Compared with the previous cooling technologies for electronics, the miniature refrigeration technology can effectively eliminate hot spots and ensure that the junction temperature is at a lower level to ensure that elec-tronics operate with better performance, especially in harsh environments. However, the high cost and low performance of the refrigeration system hinder its practical application. In this paper, based on a simple porous media evaporator, a simple structured and economic miniature vapor compression refrigeration system is pro-posed and developed. The overall size of the system is 380 mm x 350 mm x 58 mm and the total weight is only 2.0 kg. It can achieve a heat dissipation of 100 W with a total energy efficiency ratio (EER) of 2.25 and ensure that the chip temperature is approximately the ambient temperature (e.g., 30 celcius). The effects of the compressor speed and heat load on the cooling performance of the system under steady-state conditions are studied. Meanwhile, the transient processes of the system at different heat loads are systematically examined. The results show that the system can maintain a chip temperature lower than/close to the ambient temperature, which is critical for autonomous vehicle electronics in harsh environments.

AB Private transport has become a viable and increasingly popular alternative to urban transportation. However, with this growth, an old and recurring problem becomes more latent: the relationship between passenger demands and taxi supply. This problem suggests the creation and use of techniques which make it possible to reduce the gap between the demand for taxi passengers and the effective contingent of vehicles needed to meet this demand. This work introduces a new approach to forecasting and classifying taxi passengers' demands. The proposed approach uses historical data from taxi rides and meteorological data. The Kruskal-Wallis method identifies the most relevant variables, and an evolving fuzzy system performs demand forecasting/classification. Five evolving systems are evaluated with our approach: Autonomous Learning Multi-Model (ALMMo), evolving Multivariable Gaussian Fuzzy System (eMG), evolving Fuzzy with Multivariable Gaussian Participatory Learning and Recursive Maximum Correntropy (eFCE), evolving Fuzzy with Multivariable Gaussian Participatory Learning and Multi-Innovations RecursiveWeighted Least Squares (eFMI), and evolving Neo-Fuzzy Neuron (eNFN). In addition, computational experiments using real-world data were conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed approach. The results revealed that it obtained performance superior or comparable to state-of-the-art ones. Therefore, the experimental results suggest that the proposed approach is promising as an alternative for forecasting and classifying taxi passenger demand.

AB Image segmentation plays an important role in the sensing systems of autonomous underwater vehicles for fishing. Via accurately perceiving the marine organisms and surrounding environment, the automatic catch of marine products can be implemented. However, existing segmentation methods cannot precisely segment marine animals due to the low quality and complex shapes of collected marine images in the underwater situation. A novel multi-scale transformer network (MulTNet) is proposed for improving the segmentation accuracy of marine animals, and it simultaneously possesses the merits of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a transformer. To alleviate the computational burden of the proposed network, a dimensionality reduction CNN module (DRCM) based on progressive downsampling is first designed to fully extract the low-level features, and then they are fed into a proposed multi-scale transformer module (MTM). For capturing the rich contextural information from different subregions and scales, four parallel small-scale encoder layers with different heads are constructed, and then they are combined with a large-scale transformer layer to form a multi-scale transformer module. The comparative results demonstrate MulTNet outperforms the existing advanced image segmentation networks, with MIOU improvements of 0.76% in the marine animal dataset and 0.29% in the ISIC 2018 dataset. Consequently, the proposed method has important application value for segmenting underwater images.

ID MULTITARGET
AB Deep learning algorithms for multi-object tracking have made great progress and have powered the emergence of state-of-the-art models to address multi-object tracking problems. Though a lot of efforts have been made, false detections (named "FP ") and missed detections (named "FN ") caused by inaccurate tracking still cannot be well addressed especially in extremely crowded driving situations. To address these problems, we develop a new online one-shot multi-object tracking system based on convolutional neural networks with spatial-channel attention mechanism. Firstly, we propose a feature combination module (FCM) that uses dilated convolution to obtain different receptive fields to adapt to the deformation of the targets, instead of introducing a large number of parameters to deal with the problem of target scale transformation like the recent feature pyramid network. Then, an attention mechanism network (AM-Net) is designed to allow the model to dynamically focus on certain parts of the input that help perform the task and ignore irrelevant information. Finally, we introduce a combination of triple loss and online instance matching loss (TOIM Loss) to distinguish similar instances within a class. Our proposed method is evaluated in three commonly used multi-object tracking datasets including 2DMOT15, MOT16 and MOT20. The results show that our proposed method is generally superior to the compared models.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) require the ability to robustly perceive surrounding scenes for autonomous navigation. The semantic reconstruction of the scene is a truly functional understanding of the environment. However, high-performance computing is generally not available on most UAVs, so a lightweight real-time semantic reconstruction method is necessary. Existing methods rely on GPU, and it is difficult to achieve real-time semantic reconstruction on CPU. To solve the problem, an indoor dense semantic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) method using CPU computing is proposed in this paper, named CDSFusion. The CDSFusion is the first system integrating RGBD-based Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), semantic segmentation and 3D reconstruction in real-time on a CPU. In our VIO method, the depth information is introduced to improve the accuracy of pose estimation, and FAST features are used for faster tracking. In our semantic reconstruction method, the PSPNet (Pyramid Scene Parsing Network) pre-trained model is optimized to provide the semantic information in real-time on the CPU, and the semantic point clouds are fused using Voxblox. The experimental results demonstrate that camera tracking is accelerated without loss of accuracy in our VIO, and a 3D semantic map is reconstructed in real-time, which is comparable to one generated by the GPU-dependent method.

AB Intelligent touch sensing is now becoming an essential part of various human-machine interactions and communication, including in touchpads, autonomous vehicles, and smart robotics. Usually, sensing of physical objects is enabled by applied force/pressure sensors; however, reported conventional tactile devices are not able to differentiate sharp and blunt objects, although sharp objects can cause unavoidable damage. Therefore, it is central issue to implement electronic devices that can classify sense of touch and simultaneously generate pain signals to avoid further potential damage from sharp objects. Here, concept of force-enabled nociceptive behavior is proposed and demonstrated using vanadium oxide-based artificial receptors. Specifically, versatile criteria of bio-nociceptor like threshold, relaxation, no adaptation, allodynia, and hyperalgesia behaviors are triggered by pointed force, but the device does not mimic any of these by the force applied by blunt objects; thus, the proposed device classifies the intent of touch. Further, supported by finite element simulation, the nanoscale dynamic is unambiguously revealed by conductive atomic force microscopy and results are attributed to the point force-triggered Mott transition, as also confirmed by temperature-dependent measurements. The reported features open a new avenue for developing mechano-nociceptors, which enable a high-level of artificial intelligence within the device to classify physical touch.

AB In this work, we propose a method for AUV to reconstruct the docking ring autonomously under the guidance of visual information. The proposed method is based on the knowledge of self-reconfiguration of two AUVs in underwater environment. In order to enable long distance performance, we make use of blue-green light beacons. The light beacons are detected by using YOLO V3 algorithm. In addition, P4P algorithm is applied to resolve the problem of relative poses of AUVs. In case of short distances, we use Aruco marker to precisely guide the AUV towards the docking ring. In addition, we use KCF algorithm to shorten the recognition time, and Kalman filter method to eliminate the interference of occlusions and jitters. The feasibility of the proposed method is verified by performing multiple experiments. Under the reasonable control flow and visual algorithm, the proposed solution avoids the situation where the accuracy of long-distance monocular recognition is low and is easy to be misjudged. The underwater multi-target integrated guidance method based on monocular vision is convenient for the recovery of underwater AUV, and can effectively take into account the advantages of wide effective guidance range and high precision of close range guidance.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB In underwater navigation, sonars are useful sensing devices for operation in confined or structured environments, enabling the detection and identification of underwater environmental features through the acquisition of acoustic images. Nonetheless, in these environments, several problems affect their performance, such as background noise and multiple secondary echoes. In recent years, research has been conducted regarding the application of feature extraction algorithms to underwater acoustic images, with the purpose of achieving a robust solution for the detection and matching of environmental features. However, since these algorithms were originally developed for optical image analysis, conclusions in the literature diverge regarding their suitability to acoustic imaging. This article presents a detailed comparison between the SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features), ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF), BRISK (Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Keypoints), and SURF-Harris algorithms, based on the performance of their feature detection and description procedures, when applied to acoustic data collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle. Several characteristics of the studied algorithms were taken into account, such as feature point distribution, feature detection accuracy, and feature description robustness. A possible adaptation of feature extraction procedures to acoustic imaging is further explored through the implementation of a feature selection module. The performed comparison has also provided evidence that further development of the current feature description methodologies might be required for underwater acoustic image analysis.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel approach to establish a reliable high-speed broadcast communication link between a group of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) swarm under-sea ice. We utilize the fact that sea ice exists above the AUVs to diffuse the optical beam sent from AUV transmitter. We model this channel using a new seawater-sea ice cascaded layers (SSCL) model in which the vertical channel is divided into multiple layers based on their optical characteristics. The diffusing pattern of the SSCL model is computed using a Monte Carlo numerical ray-tracing technique. We derive a quasi-analytic equation for the channel impulse response (CIR) which is valid for AUV receivers with different configurations, locations and orientations. The communication performance of underwater sea ice diffusing systems is quantified via bit error rate performance, power penalty and maximum achievable bit rate. Our results reveal that, for a snow-covered sea ice sheet with thickness of 36 cm and bare sea ice sheet with thickness 12 cm, the proposed system can achieve a broadcast communication rate of 100 Mbps with ranges up to 3.5 meters and 3 meters, respectively, with BER less than 10(-3) and average transmitted power of 100 mW.

AB The Amalia lander is a modular gravity-based structure capable of executing different tasks in subsea conditions such as monitoring, surveillance and docking autonomous underwater vehicles, and could work as a platform for validating coatings, damage at foundations and scour protections and integrity of new materials, among other applications. This lander has a unique complex geometry and is made of the eco-friendly material polyoxymethylene, a high-performance thermoplastic of low cost, low density and high stiffness. This paper elaborates on the latest design developments of Amalia, including in situ material characterisation and numerical modelling activities, which focus on fulfilling the rising needs of the blue economy in the subsea engineering field. Material characterisation included tensile and Charpy impact experimental tests. The experimental curve was used to improve the numerical models (Ansys software). Full-scale data, obtained at Berlenga Grande Island, were used to compile design information on loads and boundary conditions in order to set numerical and experimental trials used to study Amalia's structural reliability. The Amalia lander was studied and its design was upgraded, the details of which are presented here. Further research showed that both the interface between the rod and the ballast weight and the bearing connection between the cage and the sphere fork can be improved.

For example, on a rainy day, autonomous vehicles have difficulty determining how to navigate due to the degraded visual quality of images. In this paper, we address a single-image rain removal problem (de-raining). As compared to video-based methods, single-image based methods are challenging because of the lack of temporal information. Although many existing methods have tackled these challenges, they suffer from overfitting, over-smoothing, and unnatural hue change. To solve these problems, we propose a GAN-based de-raining method. The optimal generator is determined by experimental comparisons. To train the generator, we learn the mapping between rainy and residual images from the training dataset. Besides, we synthesize a variety of rainy images to train our network. In particular, we focus on not only the orientations and scales of rain streaks but also the rainy image composite models. Our experimental results show that our method is suitable for a wide range of rainy images. Our method also achieves better performance on both synthetic and real-world images than state-of-the-art methods in terms of quantitative and visual performances.

AB This paper presents an algorithm for multi-UAV path planning in scenarios with heterogeneous Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) coverage. In these environments, cooperative strategies can be effectively exploited when flying in GNSS-challenging conditions, e.g., natural/urban canyons, while the different UAVs can fly as independent systems in the absence of navigation issues (i.e., open sky conditions). These different flight environments are taken into account at path planning level, obtaining a distributed multi-UAV system that autonomously reconfigures itself based on mission needs. Path planning, formulated as a vehicle routing problem, aims at defining smooth and flyable polynomial trajectories, whose time of flight is estimated to guarantee coexistence of different UAVs at the same challenging area. The algorithm is tested in a simulation environment directly derived from a real-world 3D scenario, for variable number of UAVs and waypoints. Its solution and computational cost are compared with optimal planning methods. Results show that the computational burden is almost unaffected by the number of UAVs, and it is compatible with near real time implementation even for a relatively large number of waypoints. The provided solution takes full advantage from the available flight resources, reducing mission time for a given set of waypoints and for increasing UAV number.

AB This paper presents a scalable approach to model uncertainties within a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) embedded mission manager. It proposes a concurrent version of BFM models, which are Bayesian Networks built from FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) and used by MDPs (Markov Decision Processes). The models can separately handle different applications during the mission; they consider the context of the mission including external constraints (luminosity, climate, etc.), the health of the UAV (Energy, Sensor) as well as the computing resource availability including CPU (Central Processing Unit) load, FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) use and timing performances. The proposed solution integrates the constraints into a mission specification by means of FMEA tables in order to facilitate their specifications by non-experts. Decision-making processes are elaborated following a "just enough" quality management by automatically providing adequate implementation of the embedded applications in order to achieve the mission goals, in the context given by the sensors and the on-board monitors. We illustrate the concurrent BFM approach with a case study of a typical tracking UAV mission. This case also considers a FPGA-SoC (FPGA-System on Chip) platform into consideration and demonstrates the benefits to tune the quality of the embedded applications according to the environmental context.

AB Collecting water samples in remote or dangerous places can help identify chemical spills, discover clandestine weapons production, or determine if there has been natural or human-caused biological contamination of waterways. These collections can be expensive or put humans at risk due to the nature of the locale or the detection target. Such sample collection challenges are similar to those faced in oceanography, where accessibility and the physical realities of remoteness, corrosiveness, and pressure, place severe requirements on instrumentation, especially for unattended operations over long periods of time. The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) has been at the forefront of developments that push forward sample collection and processing capabilities in the ocean. Specifically, the development of the environmental sample processor (ESP), a microbiology laboratory-in-a-can, has allowed extended presence with high frequency sampling. When deployed, the ESP filters water to collect particles, then either preserves those particles, or creates a homogenate for molecular analysis. Originally designed for detecting harmful algae blooms and the toxins they produce, the ESP now has expanded analytical capabilities. A newer version of the ESP is now being tested on an autonomous underwater vehicle, providing never-before-seen mobility and unprecedented access to the top 300 m of the ocean.

TI CUSTOMIZED INDUSTRIAL NETWORKS: NETWORK SLICING TRIAL AT HAMBURG SEAPORT
SO IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB Driven by a massive surge in digitization and customization, so-called vertical industries are expected to be a major beneficiary of the 5G of mobile networks. The use cases of such vertical industries define qualitative and quantitative requirements unprecedented in the history of mobile network development. Autonomous vehicles, traffic light control, video surveillance, and IIoT, to only name a few, introduce challenging requirements regarding both conventional performance metrics, such as throughput and coverage, as well as formerly rather subordinate system metrics, such as deterministic latency, ultra-high reliability and resilience, high number of devices, multi-tenant networks, and demanding security mechanisms. Nokia, Deutsche Telekom, and Hamburg Port Authority have deployed a large-scale 5G trial testbed in the Hamburg port area. The testbed proves in a real, large-scale industrial environment that basic features of network slicing, namely slice isolation, flexible slice customization, and multitenancy, are already technically feasible. Three exemplary communication services have been selected and are demonstrated in the testbed. Multi-connectivity is implemented as a key component to achieve high reliability throughout the testbed area. The testbed shows that all network domains must be involved in the setup of network slices, that is, user terminals, radio access, core network, and enterprise networks, in order to efficiently operate and manage network slices. Therefore, the discussed life cycle management is key for the interaction between mobile service provider and tenants of the network.

ID MODULATION
AB In this work, carrier aggregation in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based underwater acoustic cellular networks is proposed, and its achievable communication rate and energy efficiency are evaluated. This technique improves the total throughput of OFDM using an expanded bandwidth, where multiple carriers are aggregated for data transmission from one transmitter. In this paper, a study is presented for a practical communication system consisting of a surface buoy station mounting single transducer and an autonomous underwater vehicle also with single transducer. The results are evaluated in a simulation environment as well as by field experiments. The simulation is first performed on a wide bandwidth up to 500 kHz, where the results indicate that carrier aggregation can greatly improve the achievable underwater communication rate for distances up to 5 km. It is further found by simulation that the maximum bandwidth configuration does not achieve the optimal energy efficiency; instead, there is an optimal bandwidth that can lead to such optimal energy efficiency. Further measurement results obtained in sea trials with a specifically designed sounding sequence are then presented. The achievable rate and energy efficiency are evaluated by the field measurement data. The measurement results provide insights into the performance of the system under narrow bandwidth settings.

AB As the fundamental technology of autonomous vehicles and high-speed tracking, high-speed vision always suffers from the bottlenecks of on-chip bandwidth and storage due to the resource constraints. To improve the resource efficiency, we propose a hardware-efficient image compression circuit based on the vector quantization for a high-speed image sensor. In this circuit, a self-organizing map is implemented for the on-chip learning of codebook to flexibly satisfy the requirements of different applications. To reduce the hardware resources, we present a reconfigurable complete-binary-adder-tree, where the arithmetic units are reused completely. In addition, a mechanism of partial vector-component storage is adapted to make the compression ratio adjustable. Finally, a parallel-elementary-stream design ensures a high processing speed. The proposed circuit has been implemented on the field-programmable gate araray and also applied in a high-speed object tracking system. The experimental results indicate that it achieves an encoding speed of 722 frames/s with 128 weight vectors when working at 79.8 MHz, and the worst tracking error caused by the proposed circuit is merely 9 pixels. These results evince that our proposed circuit can be completely integrated with a high-speed image sensor and used in high-speed vision systems.

AB Over the past few years, underwater vehicles have greatly improved as a tool for undersea exploration and navigation. In particular, autonomous navigation, localization, and mapping through optical imaging have become topics of interest for researchers in both underwater robotics and marine science. Underwater imagery can be used to construct image composites (photomosaics) used in many different application areas such as underwater surveying and navigation. For surveying operations with a low-cost robot limited to a down-looking camera and a sonar altimeter, it is common practice to ensure that there is enough overlap between time-consecutive images as this is the only data source of navigation. When the robot revisits a previously surveyed area, it is essential to detect and match the non-time-consecutive images to close a loop and, thus, improve trajectory estimation. While creating the mosaic, most of the existing algorithms try to match all image pairs to detect the non-time-consecutive overlapping images when there is no additional navigation information. We present a framework to obtain a two-dimensional mosaic with minimum image matching attempts and simultaneously get the best possible trajectory estimation by exploring the contribution of the image pairs matching to the whole system. Different strategies for choosing match candidates have been tested, and the results are given in different challenging underwater image sequences. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Flight in flies results from a feedback cascade in which the animal converts mechanical power produced by the flight musculature into aerodynamic forces. A major goal of flight research is to understand the functional significance of the various components in this cascade ranging from the generation of the neural code, the control of muscle mechanical power output, wing kinematics and unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms. Here, I attempted to draw a broad outline on fluid dynamic mechanisms found in flapping insect wings such as leading edge vorticity, rotational circulation and wake capture momentum transfer, as well as on the constraints of flight force control by the neuromuscular system of the fruit fly Drosophila. This system-level perspective on muscle control and aerodynamic mechanisms is thought to be a fundamental bridge in any attempt to link the function and performance of the various flight components with their particular role for wing motion and aerodynamic control in the behaving animal. Eventually, this research might facilitate the development of man-made biomimetic autonomous micro air vehicles using flapping wing motion for propulsion that are currently under construction by engineers.

AB Integrated System Health Management (ISHM) is a promising technology that fuses sensor data and historical state-of-health information of components and subsystems to provide actionable information and enable intelligent decision-making regarding the operation and maintenance of aerospace systems. ISHM fundamentally relies on assessments and predictions of system health, including the early detection of failures and estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL). Model-based, data-driven or hybrid reasoning techniques can be utilized to maximise the timeliness and reliability of diagnosis and prognosis information. The benefits of ISHM include enhancing the maintainability, reliability, safety and performance of systems. The next evolution of the ISHM concept, Intelligent Health and Mission Management (IHMM), delves deeper into the utilization of on-line system health predictions to modify mission profiles to ensure safety and reliability, as well as efficiency through predictive integrity. This concept is particularly important for Trusted Autonomous System (TAS) applications, where an accurate assessment of the current and future system state-of-health to make operational decisions (with or without human intervention) is integral to both flight safety and mission success. IHMM systems introduce the capability of predicting degradation in the functional performance of subsystems, with sufficient time to dynamically identify which appropriate restorative or reconfiguration actions to take in order to ensure that the system can perform at an acceptable level of operational capability before the onset of a failure event. This paper reviews some of the key advancements and contributions to knowledge in the field of ISHM for the aerospace industry, with a particular focus on various architectures and reasoning strategies involving the use of artificial intelligence. The paper also discusses the key challenges faced in the development and deployment of ISHM systems in the aerospace industry and highlights the safety-critical role that IHMM will play in future cyber-physical and autonomous system applications (both vehicle and ground support systems), such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM), Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and Distributed Satellite Systems (DSS).

AB Mapping and exploration of a Martian terrain with an aerial vehicle has become an emerging research direction, since the successful flight demonstration of the Mars helicopter Ingenuity. Although the autonomy and navigation capability of the state of the art Mars helicopter has proven to be efficient in an open environment, the next area of interest for exploration on Mars are caves or ancient lava tube like environments, especially towards the never-ending search of life on other planets. This article presents an autonomous exploration mission based on a modified frontier approach along with a risk aware planning and integrated collision avoidance scheme with a special focus on energy aspects of a custom designed Mars Coaxial Quadrotor (MCQ) in a Martian simulated lava tube. One of the biggest novelties of the article stems from addressing the exploration capability, while rapidly exploring in local areas and intelligently global re-positioning of the MCQ when reaching dead ends in order to efficiently use the battery based consumed energy, while increasing the volume of the exploration. The proposed novel algorithm for the Martian exploration is able to select the next way point of interest, such that the MCQ keeps its heading towards the local exploration direction where it will find maximum information about the surroundings. The proposed three layer cost based global re-position point selection assists in rapidly redirecting the MCQ to previously partially seen areas that could lead to more unexplored part of the lava tube. The Martian fully simulated mission presented in this article takes into consideration the fidelity of physics of Mars condition in terms of thin atmosphere, low surface pressure and low gravity of the planet, while proves the efficiency of the proposed scheme in exploring an area that is particularly challenging due to the subterraneanlike environment. The proposed exploration-planning framework is also validated in simulation by comparing it against the graph based exploration planner. Intensive simulations with true Mars conditions are carried out in order to validate and benchmark our approach in a utmost realistic Mars lava tube exploration scenario using a Mars Coaxial Quadrotor.(c) 2022 COSPAR.

TI Hover Performance of a Small-Scale Helicopter Rotor for Flying on Mars
SO JOURNAL OF AIRCRAFT

DT Article
ID MICRO-AIR-VEHICLE
AB The present study is in response to increased interest towards assessing the feasibility of a small-scale autonomous helicopter (gross weight less than 1 kg) for Martian exploration. An autonomous rotorcraft may be ideally suited for such an application because of its unique advantages, which include the ability to take off/land vertically on harsh terrain, and greater speed, range, and field of view, when compared to a traditional surface rover. The atmospheric conditions on Mars present a unique set of design challenges. Even though the Martian gravity is only about 38% of Earth's gravity, the Martian average atmospheric density is about 70 times lower than Earth's atmospheric density. Therefore, the rotors would be operating at extremely low Reynolds numbers, even lower than 5000 for a small-scale helicopter. However, the Mach number will be significantly higher (M > 0.4) because of the higher tip speed required (due to lower density) and because of the fact that the speed of sound on Mars is only about 72% of the speed of sound on Earth. This low-Reynolds-number, high-Mach-number flow condition on the blade imposes severe constraints on the rotor design. The solution proposed in the present study involves scaling up the rotor size to produce the required thrust at acceptable Mach and Reynolds numbers. The hover performance of a full-scale rotor for a 200 g Martian coaxial helicopter was experimentally evaluated in an evacuation chamber, where the exact Martian air density was simulated. The maximum figure of merit obtained for the baseline rotor was less than 0.4 at an operating Reynolds number of 3300 and Mach number of 0.34. Increasing the Reynolds number at a constant Mach number by changing the air density increased the figure of merit of the same rotor to over 0.6 at a Reynolds number of 35,000. As the Reynolds numbers was decreased to ultralow values (Re < 5000), the blade collective pitch angle for maximum figure of merit increased even up to 30 deg. A key conclusion from this study is the feasibility of small-scale hovering flight on Mars with a realistic endurance (12-13 min).

AB PurposeSimultaneous localization and map building (SLAM), as a state estimation problem, is a prerequisite for solving the problem of autonomous vehicle motion in unknown environments. Existing algorithms are based on laser or visual odometry; however, the lidar sensing range is small, the amount of data features is small, the camera is vulnerable to external conditions and the localization and map building cannot be performed stably and accurately using a single sensor. This paper aims to propose a laser three dimensions tightly coupled map building method that incorporates visual information, and uses laser point cloud information and image information to complement each other to improve the overall performance of the algorithm. Design/methodology/approachThe visual feature points are first matched at the front end of the method, and the mismatched point pairs are removed using the bidirectional random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. The laser point cloud is then used to obtain its depth information, while the two types of feature points are fed into the pose estimation module for a tightly coupled local bundle adjustment solution using a heuristic simulated annealing algorithm. Finally, the visual bag-of-words model is fused in the laser point cloud information to establish a threshold to construct a loopback framework to further reduce the cumulative drift error of the system over time. FindingsExperiments on publicly available data sets show that the proposed method in this paper can match its real trajectory well. For various scenes, the map can be constructed by using the complementary laser and vision sensors, with high accuracy and robustness. At the same time, the method is verified in a real environment using an autonomous walking acquisition platform, and the system loaded with the method can run well for a long time and take into account the environmental adaptability of multiple scenes. Originality/valueA multi-sensor data tight coupling method is proposed to fuse laser and vision information for optimal solution of the positional attitude. A bidirectional RANSAC algorithm is used for the removal of visual mismatched point pairs. Further, oriented fast and rotated brief feature points are used to build a bag-of-words model and construct a real-time loopback framework to reduce error accumulation. According to the experimental validation results, the accuracy and robustness of the single-sensor SLAM algorithm can be improved.

AB Situational awareness formation is one of the most critical elements in solving the problem of UAV behavior control. It aims to provide information support for UAV behavior control according to its objectives and tasks to be completed. We consider the UAV to be a type of controlled dynamic system. The article shows the place of UAVs in the hierarchy of dynamic systems. We introduce the concepts of UAV behavior and activity and formulate requirements for algorithms for controlling UAV behavior. We propose the concept of situational awareness as applied to the problem of behavior control of highly autonomous UAVs (HA-UAVs) and analyze the levels and types of this situational awareness. We show the specifics of situational awareness formation for UAVs and analyze its differences from situational awareness for manned aviation and remotely piloted UAVs. We propose the concept of situational awareness as applied to the problem of UAV behavior control and analyze the levels and types of this situational awareness. We highlight and discuss in more detail two crucial elements of situational awareness for HA-UAVs. The first of them is related to the analysis and prediction of the behavior of objects in the vicinity of the HA-UAV. The general considerations involved in solving this problem, including the problem of analyzing the group behavior of such objects, are discussed. As an illustrative example, the solution to the problem of tracking an aircraft maneuvering in the vicinity of a HA-UAV is given. The second element of situational awareness is related to the processing of visual information, which is one of the primary sources of situational awareness formation required for the operation of the HA-UAV control system. As an example here, we consider solving the problem of semantic segmentation of images processed when selecting a landing site for the HA-UAV in unfamiliar terrain. Both of these problems are solved using machine learning methods and tools. In the field of situational awareness for HA-UAVs, there are several problems that need to be solved. We formulate some of these problems and briefly describe them.

AB Objective: To study the potential of active, passive, and integrated (combined active and passive) safety systems in reducing pedestrian upper body loading in typical impact configurations.
   Methods: Finite element simulations using models of generic sedan car fronts and the Polar II pedestrian dummy were performed for 3 impact configurations at 2 impact speeds. Chest contact force, head injury criterion (HIC15), head angular acceleration, and the cumulative strain damage measure (CSDM0.25) were employed as injury parameters. Further, 3 countermeasures were modeled: an active autonomous braking system, a passive deployable countermeasure, and an integrated system combining the active and passive systems. The auto-brake system was modeled by reducing impact speed by 10 km/h (equivalent to ideal full braking over 0.3 s) and introducing a pitch of] degree and in-crash deceleration of] g. The deployable system consisted of a deployable hood, lifting 100 mm in the rear, and a lower windshield air bag.
   Results: All 3 countermeasures showed benefit in a majority of impact configurations in terms of injury prevention. The auto-brake system reduced chest force in a majority of the configurations and decreased HIC15, head angular acceleration, and CSDM in all configurations. Averaging all impact configurations, the auto-brake system showed reductions of injury predictors from 20 percent (chest force) to 82 percent (HIC). The passive deployable countermeasure reduced chest force and HIC15 in a majority of configurations and head angular acceleration and CSDM in all configurations, although the CSDM decrease in 2 configurations was minimal. On average a reduction from 20 percent (CSDM) to 58 percent (HIC) was recorded in the passive deployable countermeasures. Finally, the integrated system evaluated in this study reduced all injury assessment parameters in all configurations compared to the reference situations. The average reductions achieved by the integrated system ranged from 56 percent (CSDM) to 85 percent (HIC).
   Conclusions: Both the active (autonomous braking) and passive deployable system studied had a potential to decrease pedestrian upper body loading. An integrated pedestrian safety system combining the active and passive systems increased the potential of the individual systems in reducing pedestrian head and chest loading.

AB Electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles (eVTOL) are expected to be the key drivers for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) scenarios, by satisfying on-demand air travel needs in the short or mid-term. Despite the high number of eVTOL prototypes, nowadays only few studies have focused on UAM travel demand estimation, in particular Airport Shuttle demand estimation. The aim of this work is to use Stated Preference methods to collect data necessary to understand the main features of the potential UAM Airport Shuttle trip demand, also by calibrating some discrete choice models. Data were collected by both on-line surveys and face-to-face interviews, which captured mainly the Italian context. Three different Multinominal Logit models and a Mixed Logit model have been calibrated in order to identify the main variables driving people's choices for Airport Shuttle services. The results show the positive impact of income, air travel frequency and shared ride in increasing the willingness to use Airport Shuttle services. On the other hand, user that still prefers the ground transportation modes to reach the airport, high ratio between the number of cars and the driving licenses per family unit and the lack of experience with autonomous systems (i.e., driving assistance systems) seem to have a negative impact on people intention to use Airport Shuttle services.

ID TRANSPORTATION
AB A subsea shuttle tanker (SST) concept for liquid carbon dioxide transportation was recently proposed to support studies evaluating the ultra-efficient underwater cargo submarine concept. One important topic is the position keeping ability of SST during the offloading process. In this process, the SST hovers above the well and connects with the wellhead using a flowline. This process takes around 4 h. Ocean currents can cause tremendous drag forces on the subsea shuttle tanker during this period. The flow velocities over hydroplanes are low throughout this process, and the generated lift forces are generally insufficient to maintain the SST's depth. The ballast tanks cannot provide such fast actuation to cope with the fluctuation of the current. It is envisioned that tunnel thrusters that can provide higher frequency actuation are required. This paper develops a maneuvering model and designs a linear quadratic regulator that facilitates the SST station-keeping problem in stochastic current. As case studies, the SST footprints at 0.5 m/s, 1.0 m/s, and 1.5 m/s mean current speeds are presented. Numerical results show that the designed hovering control system can ensure the SST's stationary during offloading. The required thrust from thrusters and the propeller are presented. The presented model can serve as a basis for obtaining a more efficient design of the SST and provide recommendations for the SST operation.

AB Optimal path planning is considered as a crucial problem in mobile robotics. The conventional A* algorithm is primarily focused on the heuristic values of nodes. However, during the experimental analysis, it observed that the occupied node due to obstacles, effect the selection of shortest and time efficient path in conventional A*. Therefore, a modified bidirectional path planning technique-Time Optimized A* (TOA*) algorithm is proposed that always choose the time efficient and shortest path with lesser number of operations to reach the destination from start position. The proposed TOA* algorithm is trial in various simulated tests and the execution time is reduce by 33.75% (Conventional A*), 71.47% (Breadth First Search) and 67.66% (Jump point search) is observed likewise, a reduction in number of operations by 66.14% (conventional A*), 91.35% (Breadth First Search) and 89.80% (Jump point search) is observed. The proposed TOA* is also tested on a mobile robot in real-world experiments and a significant reduction of 31.33% in number of closed nodes and 14.08% reduction in sharp turns has achieved. The reduction of sharp turns with lesser number of operations resulted in reduction in total time by 5.63% and the acceleration of mobile robot is increased by 7.01% proportionate to conventional A*.

AB In this study, we focus on the Multi-robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP) problem for maritime Search And Rescue (SAR) missions using a multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) system, with the ultimate purpose of efficiently and accurately discovering the target from sonar images taken by Side-Scan Sonar (SSS) mounted on the AUVs. Considering the specificities of real maritime SAR projects, we propose a novel MCPP method, in which the MCPP problem is transformed into two sub-problems: Area partitioning and single-AUV coverage path planning. The structure of the task area is first defined using Morse decomposition of the spike pattern. The area partitioning problem is then formulated as an AUV ordering problem, which is solved by developing a customized backtracking method to balance the workload and to avoid segmentation of the possible target area. As for the single-AUV coverage path planning problem, the SAR-A* method is adopted, which generates a path that preferentially visits the possible target areas and reduces the number of turns to guarantee the high quality of the resulting sonar images. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can maintain the workload balance and significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of discovering the target. Moreover, our experimental results indicate that the proposed method is practical and the mentioned specificities are useful for discovering targets.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) carrying sonar for object detection has become one of the main ways of ocean exploration. However, object detection in sonar images always faces the problems of balancing detection accuracy and efficiency. To this end, this paper proposes an efficient underwater object detection network for sonar images named SDNet. In the model, the authors construct a new feature extraction network based on RepVGG to balance the detection accuracy and speed. By combining channel attention with RepVGG, useful information of high-order feature maps captured can be selectively paid attention to. Then, the authors design a feature fusion network to efficiently converge the location and semantic information of multi-scale feature maps. In the network, the authors propose a lightweight cross stage partial network for sonar (CSP_S) module suitable for sonar images, which can enhance the model's feature fusion capability and simplify the model.Finally, to reduce the conflict between classification and regression tasks, the authors leverage the Decoupled Head for the sonar object classification and localization. By testing on the self-built Underwater Sonar Dataset underwater sonar dataset (USD) and the public sonar dataset sonar common target detection dataset (SCTD), the detection accuracy of SDNet reaches 99.52% and 95.20%, respectively. Moreover, the detection speed reaches 114 frames per second (FPS) and 138 FPS, respectively. The experimental results show that SDNet can effectively balance the sonar detection accuracy and efficiency.Code is available at .

AB Travel time prediction is essential to intelligent transportation systems directly affecting smart cities and autonomous vehicles. Accurately predicting traffic based on heterogeneous factors is highly beneficial but remains a challenging problem. The literature shows significant performance improvements when traditional machine learning and deep learning models are combined using an ensemble learning approach. This research mainly contributes by proposing an ensemble learning model based on hybridized feature spaces obtained from a bidirectional long short-term memory module and a bidirectional gated recurrent unit, followed by support vector regression to produce the final travel time prediction. The proposed approach consists of three stages-initially, six state-of-the-art deep learning models are applied to traffic data obtained from sensors. Then the feature spaces and decision scores (outputs) of the model with the highest performance are fused to obtain hybridized deep feature spaces. Finally, a support vector regressor is applied to the hybridized feature spaces to get the final travel time prediction. The performance of our proposed heterogeneous ensemble using test data showed significant improvements compared to the baseline techniques in terms of the root mean square error (53.87 +/- 3.50), mean absolute error (12.22 +/- 1.35) and the coefficient of determination (0.99784 +/- 0.00019). The results demonstrated that the hybridized deep feature space concept could produce more stable and superior results than the other baseline techniques.

AB Seafloor hydrothermalism plays a critical role in fundamental interactions between geochemical and biological processes in the deep ocean. A significant number of hydrothermal vents are hypothesized to exist, but many of these remain undiscovered due in part to the difficulty of detecting hydrothermalism using standard sensors on rosettes towed in the water column or robotic platforms performing surveys. Here, we use in situ methane sensors to complement standard sensing technology for hydrothermalism discovery and compare sensors on a towed rosette and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) during a 17 km long transect in the Northern Guaymas Basin in the Gulf of California. This transect spatially intersected with a known hydrothermally active venting site. These data show that methane signalled possible hydrothermal-activity 1.5-3 km laterally (100-150 m vertically) from a known vent. Methane as a signal for hydrothermalism performed similarly to standard turbidity sensors (plume detection 2.2-3.3 km from reference source), and more sensitively and clearly than temperature, salinity, and oxygen instruments which readily respond to physical mixing in background seawater. We additionally introduce change-point detection algorithms-streaming cross-correlation and regime identification-as a means of real-time hydrothermalism discovery and discuss related data supervision technologies that could be used in planning, executing, and monitoring explorative surveys for hydrothermalism.

AB The recognition and detection of 3D point cloud data are important research tools in the field of computer vision, with important applications in many significant fields, such as in unmanned driving, high-precision mapping, and robot-assisted vision. At the same time, with the development of deep learning technology, research on the recognition and detection of 3D point cloud data combined with deep learning technology is receiving more and more attention. One of the main problems with the current self-driving cars is that the detection ability of the optical radar's echo can be affected by bad weather such as heavy rain, snow, thick smoke, or thick fog. The real signal is attenuated and often very weak or submerged in a large amount of noise, which affects its judgment of the outside environment, meaning that the autonomous vehicle is unable to move. Therefore, it is urgent to solve this problem to improve the accuracy of post-stereoscopic images. This study uses LiDAR to collect point cloud data, and then applies PointNet for deep learning training. Random noise added to the original point cloud data is filtered out with a filter. The accuracy of the original signal state and the signal after filtering the noise is compared. There is an improvement of 60.8% in the method detailed in this study. This method can be widely developed and applied to improve the LiDAR technology in the future.

AB Mission abort is an effective way to enhance system safety during mission execution. Existing multi-attempt mission abort models can be divided into two main categories according to the additivity of completed mis-sions: non-accumulative models and completely cumulative models. This paper studies the optimal mission abort and allocation of standby components policies for the k-out-of -(n + m) : F system considering partial mission loss. During each attempt, the mission abort decision is dynamically controlled via predetermined abort thresholds and the rescue procedure (RP) starts immediately upon mission abort. In most studies, after a successful RP, the system is commonly restored to an 'as good as new' state with the underlying assumption that the standby components are always adequate. However, due to factors such as cost and capacity, the number of standby components may be limited. This paper proposes a dynamic allocation policy of a fixed number of standby components. The aim is to determine the optimal number of the failed components be replaced after each RP. By using a recursive algorithm, mission reliability and system survivability are derived. The objective is to minimize the expected cost and balance the mission reliability and the system survivability. The advantage of the proposed policy is justified by the policy comparison. Finally, the obtained results are demonstrated considering an autonomous underwater vehicle performing a photography mission.

AB Estimating when pedestrians cross the street is essential for intelligent transportation systems. Accurate, real-time prediction is critical to ensure the safety of the most vulnerable road users while improving passenger comfort. In the present work, we developed a model called Pedestrian Graph +, an improvement of our previous work, Pedestrian Graph, which predicts pedestrian crossing action in urban areas based on a Graph Convolution Network. We integrated two convolutional modules in the new model that provide additional context information (cropped images, cropped segmentation maps, ego-vehicle velocity data) to the main Graph Convolutional module, thus increasing accuracy. Our model is faster and smaller than other state-of-the-art models, achieving equivalent accuracy. Our model is faster than state-of-the-art models, with an inference time of 6 ms (on a GTX 1080) and low memory consumption (0.3 MB). We tested our model on two datasets, Joint Attention in Autonomous Driving (JAAD) and Pedestrian Intention Estimation (PIE), achieving 86% and 89% accuracy, respectively. Another contribution of our work is the ability to dynamically process almost any input size in the time domain without significant loss of accuracy. It is possible due to the fully convolutional property of ConvNets. Our models and results are available at https://github.com/RodrigoGantier/Pedestrian_graph_plus.

AB We propose a multi-hop control scheme (MHCS) that aims to route traffic through a set of designated intermediate checkpoints (ICs). Because travelers are allowed to freely choose routes for each "hop" that connects real (origin and destination) and ICs, MHCS promises to keep intervention at a more tolerable level, compared to conventional route-based control schemes. The MHCS problem has a natural bi-level structure: the upper level attempts to minimize congestion by adjusting the hopping ratios, which are then used in the lower level problem to route travelers according to user equilibrium conditions. Accordingly, we formulate the problem as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC), establish its solution existence, and propose to solve it using a sensitivity analysis based algorithm. We examine sixteen heuristic rules for choosing ICs. Results based on five hundred experiments suggest that selecting the most used and most congested nodes at system optimum as the ICs delivered the largest travel time savings. Based on this finding, a set of efficient ICs are identified and adopted to test the potential of a full-scale scheme. The results from numerical experiments indicate that these checkpoints are highly effective in reducing traffic congestion at a reasonable cost of control and unfairness. In particular, they outperform, by a large margin, other choices such as most congested nodes at user equilibrium.

AB Continuously and reliably estimating the relative configuration of robotic swarms in real-time constitutes a core functionality when pursuing the autonomy of such a swarm. Relying on external positioning systems, such as GPS or motion tracking systems, can provide the required information, but significantly limits the generality of an approach. In this letter, we target formation estimation for autonomous flights of swarms of small UAVs, as they pose particularly challenging restrictions on onboard resources, while opening up a large variety of practical scenarios for a multi-robot setup. While state-of-the-art has been addressing efficient formation estimation, scalability remains limited to only very few agents that can be handled in real-time, with the workload of each agent depending on the total number of agents in the swarm. Aiming for scalable multi-robot systems, here we propose a distributed formation estimation approach, where the computational load of each agent is decoupled from the swarm size. This approach is implemented in a setup with minimal communication effort, requiring only ego-motion estimates from each agent and pairwise distance measurements between them, constraining their configuration globally. Evaluations on swarms of up to 49 UAVs demonstrate the power of our approach to handle large swarms, while keeping the computational load bounded for individual agents and requiring only little data exchange between two robots.

AB Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) allow easy deployment, three-dimensional maneuverability and high reconfigurability, as they sustain communication network in the absence of pre-installed infrastructure. The proposed FOg Computing in UAS Software-defined mesh network (FOCUS) paradigm aims to realize an implementable network design that considers practical issues of aerial connectivity and computation. It allocates UASs to the tasks of data forwarding and in-network fog computing while maximizing number of ground-users in UAS coverage. FOCUS improves efficient utilization of network resources by introducing on-board computation and innovates on top of software-defined networking stack by integrating the capabilities of network and ground controllers to enable simultaneous orchestration of both UASs and communication flows. There are three main contributions of the paper: First, a SDN-based architecture is designed enabling autonomous configuration of computation and communication as well as managing multi-hop aerial links. Second, a global optimization problem to achieve optimal forwarding and computational allocation is formulated using Open Jackson Network model and solved via a heuristic approach with well defined complexity. Third, FOCUS framework is implemented on a small-scale testbed of Intel(R) Aero UASs performing image analysis with a full software stack. Experiments reveal at least 32% latency improvement in computation service time compared to traditional centralized computation at the end-server or greedy task allocation schemes within the network.

AB Underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) are widely used in a variety of ocean applications, such as exploring ocean resources or monitoring abnormal ocean environments. However, data collection schemes in UASNs are significantly different from those in wireless sensor networks due to high power consumption, severe propagation delay, and so on. Furthermore, previous research has overlooked practical conditions, such as characteristics of water delamination and energy constraint on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In this paper, a stratification-based data collection scheme for three-dimensional UASNs is proposed to solve these problems. In this scheme, the network is divided into two layers on the basis of the Ekman drift current model. The upper layer, called the Ekman layer, suffers large water velocity. Thus, nodes in the upper layer will follow the water flow. In this case, we employ a forward set-based multihop forwarding algorithm for data collection. The lower layer suffers small water velocity so that nodes in this layer are considered as relatively static. A neighbor density clustering-based AUV data gathering algorithm is applied in this layer for data collection. By employing different data collection algorithms in different layers, we can integrate the advantages of a multihop transmission scheme and AUV-aided data collection scheme to reduce network consumption and improve network lifetime. The simulation results also confirm the proposed method has good performance.

AB Software-defined networking (SDN) is recognized as the next-generation networking paradigm. The software-defined architecture for underwater acoustic sensor networks (SDUASNs) has become a hot topic. However, the current researches on SDUASNs is still in its infancy, which mainly focuses on network architecture, data transmission and routing. There exists some shortcomings that the scale of the SDUASNs is difficult to expand, and the security maintenance is seldom dabble. Therefore, a scalable software-definition architecture for underwater acoustic sensor networks (SSDUASNs) is introduced in this paper. It realizes an organic combination of the knowledge level, control level, and data level. The new nodes can easily access the network, which could be conducive to large-scale deployment. Then, the basic security authentication mechanism called BSAM is designed based on our architecture. In order to reflect the advantages of flexible and programmable in SSDUASNs, security authentication mechanism with pre-push (SAM-PP) is proposed in the further. In the current UASNs, nodes authentication protocol is inefficient as high consumption and long delay. In addition, it is difficult to adapt to the dynamic environment. The two mechanisms can effectively solve these problems. Compared to some existing schemes, BSAM and SAM-PP can effectively distinguish between legal nodes and malicious nodes, save the storage space of nodes greatly, and improve the efficiency of network operation. Moreover, SAM-PP has a further advantage in reducing the authentication delay.

   DESIGN
AB Waveguide-fed dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) can be used in a variety of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) modalities for microwave and millimeter-wave imaging. The DMA consists of an electrically large array of resonant, dynamically reconfigurable metamaterial radiators, each excited by the fields of a guided wave. A given metamaterial element can be modeled as a polarizable dipole, with polarizability that equates to a complex weighting factor in the context of antenna array calculations. The DMA produces a sequence of diverse radiation patterns as a function of the weights, which can be rapidly varied by external control. The unconventional radiation patterns of the DMA, however, introduce added computational complexity for traditional SAR processing algorithms. One SAR reconstruction approach that has successfully been adapted for the static (motionless) DMA is the range migration algorithm (RMA). Here, we extend the RMA to scenarios in which the DMA is physically translated in one or two dimensions, deriving the RMA for each case and providing experimental demonstrations using a fabricated microstrip-based DMA. Excellent reconstruction quality is observed in all cases, verifying the efficacy of the proposed algorithms and demonstrating the imaging capabilities of the DMA in the synthetic aperture context. The combination of the DMA platform with efficient reconstruction algorithms can find applications in fields such as Earth observation, security screening, and autonomous vehicle navigation.

AB This study presents a new approach to improve the performance of FastSLAM. The aim of the study is to obtain a more robust algorithm for FastSLAM applications by using a Kalman filter that uses Stirling's polynomial interpolation formula. In this paper, some new improvements have been proposed; the first approach is the square root central difference Kalman filter-based FastSLAM, called SRCD-FastSLAM. In this method, autonomous vehicle (or robot) position, landmarks' position estimations, and importance weight calculations of the particle filter are provided by the SRCD-Kalman filter. The second approach is an improved version of the SRCD-FastSLAM in which particles are improved by a differential evolution (DE) algorithm for reducing the risk of the particle depletion problem. Simulation results are given as a comparison of FastSLAM II, unscented (U)-FastSLAM, SRCD-Kalman filter-aided FastSLAM, SRCD particle filter-based FastSLAM, SRCD-FastSLAM, and DE-SRCD-FastSLAM. The results show that SRCD-based FastSLAM approaches accurately compute mean and precise uncertainty of the robot position in comparison with FastSLAM II and U-FastSLAM methods. However, the best results are obtained by DE-SRCD-FastSLAM, which provides significantly more accurate and robust estimation with the help of DE with fewer particles. Moreover, consistency of the DE-SRCD-FastSLAM is more prolonged than that of FastSLAM II, U-FastSLAM, and SRCD-FastSLAM.

   anomaly
AB Gravity Aided Navigation (GravAN) and Geomagnetism Aided Navigation (GeomAN) are two methods for correcting Inertial Navigation System (INS) errors of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) without compromising the AUV mission. One requirement for applying these methods is the relatively large field feature variations along the navigation trajectory. But in some regions with small gravity or geomagnetic variation, it is very difficult to achieve a reliable result solely by GravAN or GeomAN. If these two methods were combined, gravity and geomagnetism information could be complementary and the aided navigation ability could potentially be improved, especially in those regions when neither method is valid. Based on that concept, a Gravity and Geomagnetism Combined Aided Navigation (GGCAN) method is consequently proposed in this paper as a possible solution. The Gravity Anomaly Grid (GAG2) and Earth Geomagnetic Anomaly Grid (EMAG2) are utilized as the background databases, and then a Multiple Model Adaptive Estimation (MMAE) is adopted to obtain an optimal estimated navigation position. Furthermore, an Optimal Weight Allocation Principle (OWAP) is introduced to the combined GravAN and GeomAN methods, together with a weighted average. In simulation, two special regions in the Western Pacific Ocean were chosen to test the proposed method. The results show that GGCAN can improve the position success rate and reduce the error, compared to GravAN or GeomAN. Results indicate that the GGCAN method proposed in this study is able to improve the accuracy and reliability of an aided navigation system.

AB Detailed near-bottom investigation of a series of giant, kilometer scale, elongate pockmarks along the edge of the mid-Atlantic continental shelf confirms that methane is actively venting at the site. Dissolved methane concentrations, which were measured with a commercially available methane sensor (METS) designed by Franatech GmbH mounted on an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), are as high as 100 nM. These values are well above expected background levels (1-4 nM) for the open ocean. Sediment pore water geochemistry gives further evidence of methane advection through the seafloor. Isotopically light carbon in the dissolved methane samples indicates a primarily biogenic source. The spatial distribution of the near-bottom methane anomalies (concentrations above open ocean background), combined with water column salinity and temperature vertical profiles, indicate that methane-rich water is not present across the entire width of the pockmarks, but is laterally restricted to their edges. We suggest that venting is primarily along the top of the pockmark walls with some advection and dispersion due to local currents. The highest methane concentrations observed with the METS sensor occur at a small, circular pockmark at the southern end of the study area. This observation is compatible with a scenario where the larger, elongate pockmarks evolve through coalescing smaller pockmarks. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Mars sample return: Testing the last meter of rendezvous and sample
   capture
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB One of the key challenges of a future Mars sample return mission is the autonomous capture of an orbiting sample canister, previously lofted from the Martian surface, by an Earth Return Vehicle. To accomplish the capture, the latter spacecraft rendezvous with the sample canister and captures it using a capture cone. Understanding the capture dynamics between the sample canister and capture cone in the zero gravity environment is paramount to designing an effective capture mechanism. Moreover, testing and validating the sample capture event in a zero gravity environment is a crucial, though challenging, element to ensure mission success. Although ground-based simulations and flat-floor facilities are cost-effective, they are lacking the required fidelity. On the other hand, space-based testing opportunities provide a true zero gravity environment, but are prohibitive because of their costs. This paper presents a novel, efficient, and cost-effective way to test and validate the "last-meter" rendezvous and capture event. The testing strategy exploits the zero gravity periods provided by NASA's C-9 parabolic aircraft and a novel free-floating test setup that allows the exploration of various capture conditions in a controlled manner. The testing methodology and test hardware are described, and the results and lessons learned from a weeklong flight test campaign are discussed. The methodology and the conclusions described herein can serve as a pathfinder for the test and validation of other zero gravity capture events including those envisioned for future planetary sample return missions.

AB Despite what some may believe, the agriculture industry is really more accurate, data-driven, and intelligent than ever before in today's modern farming business. In practically each business, particularly "smart agriculture," the fast development of Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based technology has led to a redesign that has switched from statistical to numerical techniques. Such radical developments are upending traditional agricultural practises and opening up new possibilities alongside a number of difficulties. This article discusses the promise of wireless sensor nodes and the Internet of Things (IoT) in agricultural in addition to the difficulties that will inevitably arise when combining this technology with conventional agricultural methods. In-depth analysis is done on IoT devices and communications methods related to wireless sensors used in agricultural applications. There is a list of the sensors that are suitable for various agricultural applications, such as land preparation, crop condition, watering, and pest and insect detection. It is stated how well this technology assists farmers in all crop-related processes, including planting, growing, harvesting, packing, and transportation. This article also takes into account the usage of unmanned drones for agricultural monitoring as well as other advantageous purposes like increasing crop output. Modern IoT-based technologies and architectures utilised in farming also are emphasised where appropriate. We conclude by highlighting future research difficulties and identifying existing and future IoT in agricultural developments based on our in-depth assessment.

AB An algorithm is introduced for generating frequency selective surfaces (FSSs) capable of conforming to any curvature while maintaining the proper size, shape, and spacing of the elements. Compared to traditional projection and mapping methods, the presented algorithm maintains the electromagnetic properties of the FSS array despite the curvature. The algorithm can be used to conform to radomes, parts of autonomous vehicles, or any surface. The algorithm is agnostic to both element design and surface curvature. This allows the user to design a FSS for any curved surface while maintaining its response comparable to a flat array. The algorithm outputs two standard tessellation language (STL) files, one describing the curved surface and the other the elements of the FSS placed onto the curved surface. This makes the algorithm suitable for 3-D printing using systems with more than three axes or for flexible electronics. Several examples of arbitrary surfaces are shown. Lastly, the algorithm was applied to a Jerusalem-cross (JC) FSS on a nonsymmetrical parabolic dome. The dimensions of the parabolic dome were chosen to test the response of the array on a rather extreme surface against a projected array on the same surface. Simulations were carried out using Ansys HFSS from the infinite array to finite arrays to confirm the operation. Three test surfaces were manufactured with measured results found to be in good agreement with the simulation.

AB Path planning plays an important role in navigation and motion planning for robotics and automated driving applications. Most existing methods use iterative frameworks to calculate and plan the optimal path from the starting point to the endpoint. Iterative planning algorithms can be slow on large maps or long paths. This work introduces an end-to-end path-planning algorithm based on a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) for grid maps with the concept of the traversability cost, and this trains a general path-planning model for 10 x 10 to 80 x 80 square and rectangular maps. The algorithm outputs the lowest-cost path while considering the cost and the shortest path without considering the cost. The FCNN model analyzes the grid map information and outputs two probability maps, which show the probability of each point in the lowest-cost path and the shortest path. Based on the probability maps, the actual optimal path is reconstructed by using the highest probability method. The proposed method has superior speed advantages over traditional algorithms. On test maps of different sizes and shapes, for the lowest-cost path and the shortest path, the average optimal rates were 72.7% and 78.2%, the average success rates were 95.1% and 92.5%, and the average length rates were 1.04 and 1.03, respectively.

ID VISION
AB As the next-generation network, beyond fifth generation (B5G) provides transmission capability up to terabits and processes hundreds of exabytes of content data per day from the internet of Everything. From 5G to B5G, the information-centric network (iCN) is expected to play a vital role due to the strong capabilities of content distribution, caching, and processing. As security is a major concern in B5G, content trust of iCN is of critical importance. Lack of content trust leads to the untrustworthiness and maliciousness of services and applications in B5G, such as malicious accidents resulting from the untrusted content of vehicle navigation and autonomous system. To deal with this issue, we propose a blockchain and artificial intelligence (Ai) empowered trust-information- centric network architecture for B5G. First, we design a blockchain-based trust evaluation and circulation scheme for B5G nodes called TrustCoin, which quantifies the credibility of B5G nodes in a dynamic and fine-grained way, and manages trust quotas of B5G nodes as well as trust-coin circulation. Second, to obtain the content credibility, we devise a credibility decision method based on content status and B5G nodes' behaviors by exploiting the excellent properties of deep reinforcement learning, which provides the intelligent allocation criterion for TrustCoin. Third, we propose a smart incentive mechanism for the endogenous trust of B5G networks according to the allocation criterion, thereby establishing the trust-information-centric network. Experimental results have verified the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.

AB In this work, the combined undulating-motion pattern (LUMP) of the undulatory ribbon-fin propulsion is numerically investigated, inspired by the swimming of the large-mouthed catfish (Silurus soldatovi meridionalis Chen). The swimming of a juvenile large-mouthed catfish is observed and recorded to study the undulation of its elongated anal fin, commonly known as the "ribbon fin". Compared with the knifefish, which undulates the ribbon fin to swim while maintaining a relatively rigid fish body, the large-mouthed catfish performs a CUMP propulsion, which comprises the undulation of the fish body and the active undulation of the ribbon fin. Accordingly, a fin-body fish model is used to study the effect of the CUMP propulsion on the swimming performance. Simulation results show that the phase-angle difference between the undulations of the fish body and the ribbon fin has a significant impact on the thrust and heave forces. More specifically, an in-phase CUMP propulsion, which is commonly found in the swimming of actual large-mouthed catfish, can dramatically improve the thrust. In addition, the effects of the angular amplitude of ribbon fin and the swimming frequency are considered as well. Finally, the reasons for the thrust augmentation in the in-phase CUMP propulsion are detailed and analyzed.

AB A paraffin-dominated battery thermal management system (BTMS) is developed in this work, to protect the Li-ion battery (LIB) module from thermal runaway and improve the output performance of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). First, a physical model is established for analyzing the transient heat transfer process and corresponding thermal behavior, occurring in the AUV's battery module during its charge/discharge cycles. Second, numerical calculations are performed by using a pressure-velocity coupled algorithm based on a finite volume solver, to reveal heat dissipation and temperature distribution on the battery module cooled by the paraffin-dominated BTMS. Third, the calculation results are verified comparing with the open literature data. It indicates that air-dependent thermal resistance in the battery module causes an inevitable temperature rise and nonuniformity accounting for potential thermal runaway. Also, the customized RT48 paraffin mixture with a melting temperature range from 321.0 K to 325.0 K is high-efficiency to maintain the optimal working temperature and temperature difference for the battery module. In conclusion, a well-controlled phase change temperature range and equivalent thermal conductivity combined with the optimized charge/discharge strategy is exceedingly crucial for guaranteeing thermal safety and high performance regarding the AUVs. Besides, the research findings are in good agreement with the open literature data.

AB Accurate predictions of how vortices grow, evolve, and separate from aerodynamic objects are desirable for various applications ranging from autonomous aerial vehicles to wind turbines. Here, we present an experimental characterisation of the formation process of vortices created by the rotation of a thin rectangular flat plate. The plate is rapidly accelerated from rest up to a constant rotational velocity that was varied to explore the effect of the Reynolds number on the limit strength and the timing of successively generated vortices at the tip of the plate. The total non-dimensional positive circulation released at the tip of the plate during the entire rotation varies solely as a function of the angular position of the plate. Initially, all this circulation accumulates in a primary or starting vortex until this vortex separates after a constant non-dimensional time for all rotational velocities and different plate dimensions tested. An empirical model of the prediction of the limit strength of the primary vortex based on the constant non-dimensional formation is presented. The limit strength of the primary vortex is independent of the Reynolds number. After the primary vortex separates, a series of smaller secondary vortices form at the tip of the plate. These secondary vortices are discretely released at increasing time intervals. The timing of the release of the secondary vortices and their non-dimensional strength depend on the Reynolds number, and an empirical prediction model is presented.

ID KERNEL DENSITY-ESTIMATION
AB Mobile robots are essential tools for gathering knowledge of the environment and monitoring areas of interest as well as industrial assets. Informative Path Planning methodologies have been successfully applied making robots able to autonomously acquire information and explore unknown surroundings. Rapidly-exploring Information Gathering approaches have been validated in real-world applications, proving they are the way to go when aiming for Information Gathering tasks. In fact, RIG can plan paths for robots with several degrees of freedom and rapidly explore complex workspaces by using the state-of-the-art Voronoi-biased expansion. Nevertheless, it is an efficient solution when most of the area is unknown but its effectiveness decreases as the exploration/gathering evolves. This paper introduces an innovative informed expansion for IG tasks that combines the Kernel Density Estimation technique and a rejection sampling algorithm. By learning online the distribution of the acquired information (i.e., the discovered map), the proposed methodology generates samples in the unexplored regions of the workspace, and thus steers the tree toward the most promising areas. Realistic simulations and an experimental campaign, conducted in the underwater robotics domain, provide a proof-of-concept validation for the developed informed expansion methodology and demonstrate that it enhances the performance of the RIG algorithm.

AB Analysis of point clouds through deep convolutional neural networks is an active area of research due to their massive real-world applications including autonomous driving, indoor navigation, robotics, virtual/ augmented reality, unmanned aerial vehicles, and drone technology. However, capturing the fine-grained geometric and semantic properties for the underlying recognition task with raw unstructured point cloud is highly challenging due to the lack of explicit neighborhood relationship and sparsity among the points. In this paper, we have introduced a deep, hierarchical 3D point based architecture for object classification and part segmentation that is able to learn robust geometric features which remain invariant to both the geometry and orientation of the local patches. The proposed architecture consists of multiple layers of sampling, concentric annular convolution, pooling, and residual feature propagation blocks. In the skip connections of our deep residual design, we propose to use a combination of linear projection shortcut and nonlinear ReLU group normalization shortcut with batch normalization, to improve both the opti-mization landscape and the representational power. Our network achieves on par or even better than state-of-the-art results on synthetic and real-world object classification (i.e., ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN) and part segmentation (i.e., ShapeNet-part) benchmark datasets.

AB Machine learning (ML) is the study of computational methods for improving performance by mechanizing the acquisition of knowledge from experience. As a modern data-driven optimization and applied regression methodology, ML aims to provide increasing levels of automation in the knowledge engineering process, replacing much time-consuming human activity with automatic techniques that improve accuracy and/or efficiency by discovering and exploiting regularities in training data. Indeed, many ML and data-driven methods, such as conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs), were introduced and studied within electromagnetics a few decades ago. However, these past studies did not benefit from the most recent advances in ML, which have been driven by the present confluence of improved hardware performance at lower cost, advanced network algorithms and architectures, data science, and considerable efforts dedicated to advancing the computational electromagnetics (CEM) benchmark. Today, a broader family of ML techniques based on ANNs has been developed. Examples include deep neural network (DNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network, generative adversarial network, and deep reinforcement learning, which have been successfully applied to different engineering and science problems, ranging from image and video recognition, social media services, virtual personal assistant to autonomous vehicles, to name a few. This naturally suggests that applying ML to real-world electromagnetic problems could be one of the emerging trends in ML and artificial intelligence (AI) [1]-[4]. Indeed, ML has been becoming an important complement to existing experimental, computational, and theoretical aspects of electromagnetics.

AB With the increasing integration of distributed generators (DGs), renewable energy sources (RESs), and energy storage systems (ESSs) in the hybrid AC/DC microgrid (HMG), the paralleled bidirectional interlinking converters (BILCs) play a significant role in the economic power interaction (EPI) between AC and DC subgrids. This paper proposes a distributed dynamic event-triggered control (ETC) strategy for the HMG to realize the global economic operation. In each subgrid, economic power sharing (EPS) among DGs can be achieved by economic droop controllers with no global information. The proposed distributed dynamic ETC includes a continuous-time part and a discrete-time part, where the former part realizes the EPI between two subgrids, while the latter part ensures the proportional power sharing between BILCs. Thus, a particular over-stressed BILC can be avoided, and system reliability and scalability are significantly improved. Additionally, only data from neighboring BILCs at the event-triggered times are involved, which greatly minimizes the communication burden and costamong BILCs. Furthermore, the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system dynamics and the communication time delay stability are proven. Finally, the hardware-in-loop experimental results are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

AB Technological devices are becoming more and more integrated in the management and control of traffic in big cities. The population perceives the benefits provided by these systems, and, therefore, citizens usually have a favorable opinion of them. However, emerging countries, which have fewer available infrastructures, could present a certain lack of trust. The objective of this work is to detect the level of knowledge and predisposition towards the use of new technologies in the transportation field of the Dominican Republic. For this study, the National Survey on Mobility was administered to a sample of Dominican citizens, proportional to the ONE census and to sex, age and province. The knowledge of ITS topics, as well as the use of mobile applications for mobility, are scarce; however, there was a significant increase that can be observed in only one year. Moreover, technology is, in general, positively assessed for what concerns the improvement of the traffic field, even though there is a lack of predisposition to provide one's personal data, which is necessary for these devices. The process of technological development in the country must be backed up by laws that protect the citizens' privacy. Thus, technologies that can improve road safety, mobility and sustainability can be implemented in the country.

AB Recent advances in silicon photonic chips have made huge progress in optical computing owing to their flexibility in the reconfiguration of various tasks. Its deployment of neural networks serves as an alternative for mitigating the rapidly increased demand for computing resources in electronic platforms. However, it remains a formidable challenge to train the online programmable optical neural networks efficiently, being restricted by the difficulty in obtaining gradient information on a physical device when executing a gradient descent algorithm. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an efficient, physics-agnostic, and closed-loop protocol for training optical neural networks on chip. A gradient-free algorithm, that is, the genetic algorithm, is adopted. The protocol is on-chip implementable, physical agnostic (no need to rely on characterization and offline modeling), and gradient-free. The protocol works for various types of chip structures and is especially helpful to those that cannot be analytically decomposed and characterized. We confirm its viability using several practical tasks, including the crossbar switch and the Iris classification. Finally, by comparing our physics-agonistic and gradient-free method to the off-chip and gradient-based training methods, we demonstrate the robustness of our system to perturbations such as imperfect phase implementation and photodetection noise. Optical processors with gradient-free genetic algorithms have broad application potentials in pattern recognition, reinforcement learning, quantum computing, and realistic applications (such as facial recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles).

AB Ultra-low latency communication for mobile intelligent machines, such as autonomous vehicles and robots, is a central technology in Internet of Things (IoT) to achieve system reliability. Proactive network association and communication has been suggested to achieve ultra-low latency under the assistance of mobile edge computing. Highly dynamic and stochastic nature of IoT mobile machines suggests applying machine learning methodology to effectively enhance the proactive network association. In this paper, an online proactive network association is proposed for this distributed computing and networking scenario, in order to minimize the average task delay subject to time-average energy consumption. We first formulate an event-triggered delay model for mobility-aware anticipatory network association mechanism that takes future possible handovers into account. Based on the Markov decision processes (MDP) and Lyapunov optimization, a two-stage online decision algorithm for proactive network association is innovated for individual mobile machine without the statistical knowledge of random events that may lack of enough prior data. Theoretical analysis proves that the delay performance of proposed algorithm attains asymptotic optimality within the bounded deviation. Furthermore, an asynchronous online distributed association decision algorithm based on the nonlinear problem transformation is proposed to support more general scenarios of multi-machine event-triggered associations. Simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

AB Safety critical systems in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) depend on multiple sensors to perceive the environment in which they operate. Radar sensors provide many advantages and complementary capabilities to other available sensors but are not without their own shortcomings. Performance of radar perception algorithms still pose many challenges, one of which is in object detection and classification. In order to increase redundancy in ADAS, the ability for a radar system to detect and classify objects independent of other sensors is desirable. In this paper, an investigation of a machine learning based radar perception algorithm for object detection is implemented, along with a novel, automated workflow for generating large-scale virtual datasets used for training and testing. Physics-based electromagnetic simulation of a complex scattering environment is used to create the virtual dataset. Objects are classified and localized within Doppler-Range results using a single channel 77 GHz FMCW radar system. Utilizing a fully convolutional network, the radar perception model is trained and tested. The training is performed using a wide range of environments and traffic scenarios. Model inference is tested on completely new environments and traffic scenarios. These simulated radar returns are highly scalable and offer an efficient method for dataset generation. These virtual datasets facilitate a simple method of introducing variability in training data, corner case evaluation and root cause analysis, amongst other advantages.

AB Automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RSs) are widely used for storing and retrieving products in all types of warehouses. Dwell point policy is a vital control policy that can greatly affect the performance of AS/RSs. In this paper, we study dwell point policies in AS/RSs with input and output stations at opposite ends of the aisle. We first propose two dwell point policies. We find that five existing dwell point policies in the literature are special cases of exactly one of our policies. We then develop expected travel time models for the proposed policies, solve these models with the objective of minimising expected travel time, and obtain closed-form solutions for the optimal dwell location(s). We prove that one proposed policy dominates the other in terms of expected travel time. Numerical experiments are performed to quantify the percentage gap of expected travel time between the proposed policies and policies in the literature. We find that, in some situations, the better proposed policy can achieve up to 8%?10% reduction in expected travel time in comparison with the best literature policy. A real-data case study validates that these situations arise with high probability in typical daily warehouse operations.

AB This paper addresses the analysis issue of the complex interactions arising among different components of a warehouse logistic system. In particular, the focus is on a case study related to the handling operations required by the flow of goods within a store of Ikea, located in the center of Italy. The proposed study has been performed using Petri Nets (PNs) as discrete event modelling and simulation framework. In particular, this paper aims to bring out the innovative aspect of the use of PNs as tools to support the functional specifications of warehouse systems, highlighting their strengths and weakness. The goal is to emphasize critical factors in the entire logistic chain within the store and suggest solutions for improving its efficiency. In this regards, PNs have been proved to be quite suitable to easily represent the main features of the departments under consideration, showing at the same time the main logistic processes in which both labor and equipment are involved. The dynamics of the considered logistic system is evaluated, focusing on the three main operating cycles implemented at the Ikea store under consideration. Further, simulating directly the PN model, along with a quantitative analysis, has been possible to identify delays in the complete logistic chain and determine performance indices, such as utilization rate of the resources. Suggestions for improving the productivity of the system are given.

AB The aim of this study was to introduce a new relief distribution system for emergency response after an earthquake. Extensive literature is used to explain the ground transportation difficulties following a disaster and some possible alternative choices. Due to roads blockage and time limits in the disaster response phase, small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) helicopter can be utilized as relief distributors. The use of UAV helicopters for humanitarian purposes and even for commercial purposes by some companies has been discussed in several publications. Yet no one has considered an autonomous small UAV helicopter network for post-earthquake relief distribution in highly populated cities. In an applied sense, the study offers a system that helps earthquake response managers in the early hours following an earthquake. The suggested system is a synthesis of many new technical results achieved in the area of earthquake detection, data fusion, and UAV helicopters. The relief distribution system by medium-scale UAV helicopters is investigated in Tehran metropolis as a case study for the worst-case earthquake scenario. The outcomes reveal that the system has efficient capability for urban areas with high population density. The proposed aerial distribution system can supply a large amount of demand in a small amount of time. Moreover, it works without disturbing the ground transportation system and may turn out to be managed as a complementary system for serving the affected people in non-accessible areas.

TI Underwater Glider Reliability and Implications for Survey Design

AB It has been 20 years since the concept of the Autonomous Ocean Sampling Network (AOSN) was first introduced. This vision has been brought closer to reality with the introduction of underwater gliders. While in terms of functionality the underwater glider has shown to be capable of meeting the AOSN vision, in terms of reliability there is no communitywide hard evidence on whether persistent presence is currently being achieved. This paper studies the reliability of underwater gliders in order to assess the feasibility of using these platforms for future AOSN. The data used are taken from nonunderwater glider developers, which consisted of 205 glider deployments by 12 European laboratories between 2008 and 2012. Risk profiles were calculated for two makes of deep underwater gliders; there is no statistically significant difference between them. Regardless of the make, the probability of a deep underwater glider surviving a 90-day mission without a premature mission end is approximately 0.5. The probability of a shallow underwater glider surviving a 30-day mission without a premature mission end is 0.59. This implies that to date factors other than the energy available are preventing underwater gliders from achieving their maximum capability. This reliability information was used to quantify the likelihood of two reported underwater glider surveys meeting the observation needs for a period of 6 months and to quantify the level of redundancy needed in order to increase the likelihood of meeting the observation needs.

AB This paper focuses on the wake features of autorotation status mainly including the induced velocity and tip vortex trajectory in order to preliminary explanation the principle of rotation. In this work, the flow features of autorotating rotor were investigated in water tunnel via particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. The experiments were conducted with a two-blade single rotor which can freely rotate. The stable rotational speed with various pitch and shaft backward angle was recorded and analyzed. The results show that there is a threshold value of stable rotational speed at shaft backward angle and an optimal region at pitch angle. The PIV results showed that the velocity of the internal wake was much lower than the external, indicating a consuming of energy from the flow, which was in accord with momentum theory. The vortices have three prominent parts: tip vortices, wake sheets and root vortices. There is no apparent interference between wake sheets and tip vortices. The vorticity of the tip was observed to increase in near wake due to lesser interference with the sheets. The Beddoes's model was employed to calculate the tip vortex location with respect to the rotor. The experimental results are in good agreement with the calculated results. It is meaningful for the study to enrich the autorotation theory of rotor and develop underwater rotorcraft.

AB Circular Economy (CE) implementation is considered an instrumental strategy to help reaching the world's resource, energy, and climate mitigation targets, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030. However, major barriers must be overcome to facilitate CE implementation in industry such as cultural, market, regulatory and technological considerantions (Kirchherr et al., 2018). Improving management systems within industrial companies is crucial when implementing effective CE solutions in compliance with existing industrial standards such as quality and environmental management systems. However, it is not yet common practice yet due to the lack of standardized, suitable, and easy-to-use supporting analytical tools. This paper attempts to fill this gap by presenting Industrial Circular Economy Questionnaire (ICEQ), a self-diagnosis questionnaire built upon the revision of industrial harmonized standards and, academic literature on business-level CE assessment tools. ICEQ, compiling a set of 165 questions for company self-CE assessment, was applied to 30 industrial companies belonging to 17 economic sectors (automotive, machining and metalworking transformation, waste management, machine tool, etc.) in the Basque Autonomous Community (BAC) in Spain. The automotive sector stands out with 70% of circularity while Machining and metalworking transformation only has 34%, showing that the automotive sector is more conscious of CE since they must comply with End-of-Life Vehicles (EoLV) legislation.

AB The oceans play an important role in our daily life and they form the lungs of our planet. Subsequently, the world ocean provides so many benefits for humans and the planet including oxygen production, climate regulation, transportation, recreation, food, medicine, economic, etc. However, the oceans suffer nowadays from several challenges ranging from pollution to climate change and destruction of underwater habitat. Hence, the use of remote sensing technologies, like sensor networks and IoT, is becoming essential in order to continuously monitor the wide underwater areas and oceans. Unfortunately, the limited battery power constitutes one of the major challenges and limitations of such technologies. In this paper, we propose an efficient LOcal and GlObal data collection mechanism, called LOGO, that aims to conserve the energy in remote sensing applications. LOGO is based on the cluster scheme and works on two network stages: local and global. The local stage is at the sensor node and aims to reduce its data transmission by eliminating on-period and in-period data redundancies. The global stage is at the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) level and aims to minimize the data redundancy among neighboring nodes based on a spatial-temporal node correlation and Kempe's graph techniques. The simulation results on real underwater data confirm that LOGO mechanism is less energy consumption with high data accuracy than the existing techniques.

AB Multi-access Edge Computing represents a key enabling technology for emerging mobile networks. It offers intensive computational resources very close to the end-users, useful for task offloading purposes. Many scientific contributions already proposed approaches for optimally allocating these resources over time. However, most of them fail to take advantage of the prediction of both users' mobility and service demands over a look-ahead temporal horizon. To bridge this gap, this paper formulates a novel methodology for anticipatorily allocating communication and computational resources at the network edge, based on the prediction of spatio-temporal dynamics of mobile users. The conceived architecture exploits a Software-Defined Networking approach to monitor users' mobility, a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory to predict over different look-ahead horizons the number of users within a given number of cells and their related service demands, and Dynamic Programming to optimally allocate users' requests among available Multi-access Edge Computing servers. Computer simulations investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a realistic autonomous driving use case and compare its behavior against a baseline solution. Obtained results demonstrate its unique ability to dynamically and fairly distribute users' requests among the resources available at the network edge, while ensuring the targeted quality of service level.

AB This article introduces two new algorithms to accurately estimate the process noise covariance of a discrete-time Kalman filter online for robust orbit determination in the presence of dynamics model uncertainties. Common orbit determination process noise techniques, such as state noise compensation and dynamic model compensation, require offline tuning and a priori knowledge of the dynamical environment. Alternatively, the process noise covariance can be estimated through adaptive filtering. However, many adaptive filtering techniques are not applicable to onboard orbit determination due to computational cost or the assumption of a linear time-invariant system. Furthermore, existing adaptive filtering techniques do not constrain the process noise covariance according to the underlying continuous-time dynamical model, and there has been limited work on adaptive filtering with colored process noise. To overcome these limitations, a novel approach is developed which optimally fuses state noise compensation and dynamic model compensation with covariance matching adaptive filtering. This yields two adaptive and dynamically constrained process noise covariance estimation techniques. Unlike many adaptive filtering approaches, the new techniques accurately extrapolate over measurement outages and do not rely on ad hoc methods to ensure the process noise covariance is positive semidefinite. The benefits of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated through two case studies: an illustrative linear system and the autonomous navigation of two spacecraft orbiting an asteroid.

AB In the context of Fifth Generation mobile networks (5G), Search and Rescue (SAR) missions using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can benefit from a dynamic, intelligent, and autonomous placement of both Network Functions (NFs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems to quickly adapt in minimal human intervention scenarios. This article examines current 5G architectures and timely standardization efforts within this context. The contribution of this work is to identify associated 5G components and propose AI modules that enable efficient UAV-based SAR missions: the System Intelligence (SI) and Edge Intelligence (EI) concepts. SI is conceived as the entity responsible for defining and orchestrating the placement and processing tasks of NFs and AI systems, while EI is responsible for the optimization of AI-based end-user applications. The article also presents an open-source virtualized testbed that enables a concrete example of SI and EI roles in a SAR mission based on object detection with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In this proof-of-concept, the DNN layers are partitioned and the tradeoffs between communication and computational costs are highlighted. For instance, the results indicate that the latency can severely degrade the UAV trajectory and different DNN partitioning options can reduce the required bit rate to transmit DNN scores by more than three times.

AB Visual place recognition is challenging because there are so many factors that can cause the appearance of a place to change, from day-night cycles to seasonal change to atmospheric conditions. In recent years a large range of approaches have been developed to address this challenge including deep-learnt image descriptors, domain translation, and sequential filtering, all with shortcomings including generality and velocity-sensitivity. In this letter we propose a novel descriptor derived from tracking changes in any learned global descriptor over time, dubbed Delta Descriptors. Delta Descriptors mitigate the offsets induced in the original descriptor matching space in an unsupervised manner by considering temporal differences across places observed along a route. Like all other approaches, Delta Descriptors have a shortcoming - volatility on a frame to frame basis - which can be overcome by combining them with sequential filtering methods. Using two benchmark datasets, we first demonstrate the high performance of Delta Descriptors in isolation, before showing new state-of-the-art performance when combined with sequence-based matching. We also present results demonstrating the approach working with four different underlying descriptor types, and two other beneficial properties of Delta Descriptors in comparison to existing techniques: their increased inherent robustness to variations in camera motion and a reduced rate of performance degradation as dimensional reduction is applied.

AB Visual object tracking has achieved remarkable progress in recent years and has been broadly applied in intelligent transportation systems such as autonomous vehicles and drones to monitor and analyze the behavior of specific targets. One typical tracking approach is the discriminative tracker, which branches into two main categories: the correlation filter (CF) and the convolutional neural network (CNN). However, most of the current researches consider both categories as two separate techniques and only rely on one of them. Thus, a dense cooperation between the CF and the CNN still remains less discovered and the question of how to effectively join both techniques to further boost the tracking performance is still open. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a collaborative architecture which incorporates models constructed with both techniques and dynamically aggregates their response maps for target inference. By an alternating optimization, both models are learned on each other's errors to persistently improve the classification power of the whole tracker. For further efficiency, we present a faster solver for our utilized CF and an analytical solution for dynamic model weighting. Through experiments on standard benchmarks, we reveal the influence of key factors on the joint learning architecture and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

AB The supervised training of deep networks for semantic segmentation requires a huge amount of labeled real world data. To solve this issue, a commonly exploited workaround is to use synthetic data for training, but deep networks show a critical performance drop when analyzing data with slightly different statistical properties with respect to the training set. In this work, we propose a novel Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) strategy to address the domain shift issue between real world and synthetic representations. An adversarial model, based on the cycle consistency framework, performs the mapping between the synthetic and real domain. The data is then fed to a MobileNet-v2 architecture that performs the semantic segmentation task. An additional couple of discriminators, working at the feature level of the MobileNet-v2, allows to better align the features of the two domain distributions and to further improve the performance. Finally, the consistency of the semantic maps is exploited. After an initial supervised training on synthetic data, the whole UDA architecture is trained end-to-end considering all its components at once. Experimental results show how the proposed strategy is able to obtain impressive performance in adapting a segmentation network trained on synthetic data to real world scenarios. The usage of the lightweight MobileNet-v2 architecture allows its deployment on devices with limited computational resources as the ones employed in autonomous vehicles. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Whereas many existing computer vision algorithms based on color images work well in robot navigation, most of them are sensitive to illumination and the reflectance of objects. Furthermore, according to the Oren-Nayar reflectance model, the reflectance depends on the material and surface of objects. Therefore, different sensors, passive sensors and active sensors, arc used simultaneously to scan objects of different materials. In this paper, an integrated sensor system, including light detection and ranging (Li DA R), global positioning system (GPS), gyroscopes (Gyro), and a camera, is proposed for an autonomous vehicle. The GPS and Gyros arc used for locating the robot position and identifying its orientation, which are used for global path planning to move toward a goal. The camera is used for remote video monitoring. LiDAR is used to capture the point clouds of the current environment for use in planning the local path. In this paper, a fast segmentation method is proposed for obstacle detection. The proposed method includes ground point removal, region of interest (ROI) detection. 3D -to -2D projection, and clustering by grids. The purpose of ROI detection is to determine whether the points are candidate obstacle points. The experimental results show that the proposed segmentation method can reduce the size of the point cloud and computation complexity significantly. The integrated multisensor system is expected to be practically used in the field.

   map optimization
AB In scenarios involving local map missing and local environmental changes, map-matching localization systems (MMLS) may experience degradation in localization due to the deficiency of texture and geometrical features. This consequently leads to a decrease in localization accuracy or divergence in a map-matching-based fusion localization system (MMBFLS). To address this issue and ensure the safety of the intended functionality of autonomous vehicles, this study proposes a degradation state detection and local map optimization-based fusion localization frame. To detect the degradation state of pose estimation in MMLS, the analysis of the mathematical mechanisms underlying the localization degradation in MMLS is conducted first. Subsequently, a degradation state detection method based on incremental matrix eigenvalue analysis is proposed, which leverages the magnitude of individual eigenvalues of the incremental matrix to determine the corresponding degradation state and isolates it accordingly. Furthermore, we employ sliding window-based factor graph optimization to maintain a local map that matches Light detection and ranging point clouds, compensating for the degraded states and thereby ensuring the localization performance of MMBFLS. Real-world sensor data is collected to validate the proposed method. The results indicate that the accuracy of the proposed degradation detection method reached as high as 94.67%. Moreover, the proposed localization framework can effectively ensure the localization accuracy of MMBFLS in typical highway scenarios.

AB In the context of sustainable development, this paper rationalises the outbound process of a four-way shuttle system with a focus on their modelling, performance evaluation and configuration using a parallel operation strategy to reduce resource waste, thus achieving sustainable development. The parallelism of the hoist and shuttle is innovatively incorporated into the four-way shuttle system, so the modelling content is divided into parallel and serial types. In the parallel operation strategy model, a separation-aggregation queueing network model is constructed, and the open-loop queueing network is innovatively solved using the maximum entropy method. In the serial operation strategy model, a semi-open-loop queuing network is constructed and solved using the geometric matrix method. By varying different parameters, the accuracy of the model is verified by Arena simulation with an error range of 10% or less, and the error of the system performance index calculation is reduced by 20% compared with the existing methods. Setting up 18 different sizes of shuttle systems provided a better performance than a single serial-operation strategy through the addition of parallel strategies, with an average reduction of 12.6% in the system response time and a minimum reduction of 1.8%. The conclusions of this paper were verified on the basis of an arithmetic case analysis.

AB As low-frequency and broadband acoustic emission capability is beneficial to the detection range and acoustic communication speed of small scale autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), this type of transducer is required, especially in cases of complex acoustic environments. A broadband bender transducer with cavity baffle that suits small scale AUV is proposed. Rather than additional benders, a passive cavity baffle, which would be capable of providing mutual radiation and a fluid cavity mode, is introduced to a single bender. The bending resonant frequency is reduced by the mutual radiation between the bender and the cavity baffle, the cavity baffle extends the lower limit of the available frequency band of the transducer, the liquid resonant frequency behind the former expands the higher limit, then the cavity baffle bender transducer fills the role of radiating low-frequency and broadband emissions through multimode coupling. The finite element method is used to analyze the acoustic performance of the transducer under different baffle conditions. Then, a prototype of the broadband cavity baffle bender transducer is developed according to the optimized parameters of simulation. The acoustic parameters of the prototype were measured in an anechoic pool. The resonant frequency measured in water of the bender itself is 3 kHz, and the -3dB bandwidth is 560 Hz. The prototype test results show that the cavity baffle scheme can improve the -3dB bandwidth of the bender from 560 Hz to 1000 Hz, which fundamentally realizes the expectations of the prototype design.

In the systems that were studied, first we use a problem that involves system identification, this is the case of the tipper problem, which is compared with the original algorithm; then, we proceed to use some control problems, one is cruise control, which focuses on achieving a desired speed on a vehicle with a certain weight; from here, we use the temperature control in a shower, which controls the temperature of the water by adjusting the water valves, another control problem is the inverted pendulum, which is one of the most common test control problems used for optimization in fuzzy logic controllers. The last control problem is the autonomous mobile robot, which consists in controlling the direction of the robot by adjusting the torque on its wheels. In all of these problems we optimize the membership functions for fuzzy controllers. The main goal of this study is to analyze whether Fuzzy Logic can improve the Multiverse Optimizer performance in certain cases by dynamically adjusting some parameters of the algorithm so it can be more competitive on more complex problems.

TI Learning Risk-Aware Costmaps for Traversability in Challenging

AB One of the main challenges in autonomous robotic exploration and navigation in unknown and unstructured environments is determining where the robot can or cannot safely move. A significant source of difficulty in this determination arises from stochasticity and uncertainty, coming from localization error, sensor sparsity and noise, difficult-to-model robot-ground interactions, and disturbances to the motion of the vehicle. Classical approaches to this problem rely on geometric analysis of the surrounding terrain, which can be prone to modeling errors and can be computationally expensive. Moreover, modeling the distribution of uncertain traversability costs is a difficult task, compounded by the various error sources mentioned above. In this work, we take a principled learning approach to this problem. We introduce a neural network architecture for robustly learning the distribution of traversability costs. Because we are motivated by preserving the life of the robot, we tackle this learning problem from the perspective of learning tail-risks, i.e. the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). We show that this approach reliably learns the expected tail risk given a desired probability risk threshold between 0 and 1, producing a traversability costmap which is more robust to outliers, more accurately captures tail risks, and is more computationally efficient, when compared against baselines. We validate our method on data collected by a legged robot navigating challenging, unstructured environments including an abandoned subway, limestone caves, and lava tube caves.

AB Driven by environmental and economic aspects, the proliferation of renewable energy sources (RES) has been expanded in power systems worldwide. In this regard, the intermittent generation of such RESs (e.g., photovoltaic and wind farms) can cause several operational and stability problems in such low-inertia power systems. To handle these issues, great interest in the literature has been directed to develop feasible grid-forming voltage source converters (VSC) control schemes that have voltage/frequency regulatory functions. Accordingly, an inclusive review is presented in this paper for these promising grid-forming VSC control schemes which will be the backbone of sustainable converter-dominated power systems. Specifically, control structures, smart grid-support functionalities, stability issues, and fault current mitigations are compared considering the existing grid-forming VSC control schemes. Besides, the applications of grid-forming VSC along with their benefits and drawbacks are investigated for both isolated and bulk power systems. The evaluation aspects are also explored for assessing the performance of the existing VSC control schemes in the grid. Finally, the current challenges that face VSC in forthcoming applications and existing gaps are highlighted while corresponding perspectives for future research studies are defined for stable sustainable low-inertia power systems.

AB Accelerating the development of agricultural aviation technology is the need of China's modern agricultural construction. With the rise of emerging industries such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, autonomous navigation, and the Internet of Things, agricultural aviation is further developing toward the direction of intelligence to meet the requirements of efficient and sophisticated agricultural aviation operations. Bionics is a multi-discipline and comprehensive border subject. It is produced by the mutual penetration and integration of life science and engineering science. Bionic technology has received more and more attention in recent years, and breakthroughs have been made in the fields of biomedicine and health, military, brain science and brain-like navigation, and advanced manufacturing. This study summarized the research progress of biomimetic technology in the field of agricultural aviation from three aspects of biological perception, biological behavior, and biological intelligence. On this basis, problems of related research and application of agricultural aircraft in real-time obstacle avoidance, path planning, and intelligent navigation were analyzed. Combined with the practice of the rapid development of agricultural aircraft, research and application of bionic technology suitable for agricultural aircraft were then proposed. Finally, prospects of agricultural aero-bionic technology were also discussed from multiple bionic target fusion, three-dimensional spatial information exploration, sensors, and animal brain system mechanism. This review provides a reference for the development of bionic technology in China's agricultural aviation.

AB Edge Computing in 5G and Beyond is a promising solution for ultra-low latency applications (e.g., Autonomous Vehicle, Augmented Reality, and Remote Surgery), which have an extraordinarily low tolerance for delay and require fast data processing for a very high volume of data. The requirements of delay-sensitive applications (e.g., Low latency, proximity, and Location/Context-awareness) cannot be satisfied by Cloud Computing due to the high latency between User Equipment and Cloud. Nevertheless, Edge Computing in 5G and beyond can promise ultra-high-speed data processing thanks to the placement of computation capabilities closer to endpoint devices, where 5G encourages the speed rate that is 10 times faster than 4G LTE-Advanced. This paper deeply investigates Edge Computing in 5G and characterizes it based on the requirements of ultra-low latency applications. As a contribution, we propose a hybrid architecture that takes advantage of novel and sustainable technologies (e.g., D2D communication, Massive MIMO, SDN, and NFV) and has major features such as scalability, reliability, and ultra-low latency support. The proposed architecture is evaluated based on agent-based simulations demonstrating that our proposal can satisfy requirements and has the ability to respond to high volume demands with low latency.

ID SCATTERING MEDIA; FLIGHT; RECONSTRUCTION
AB Non-line-of-sight imaging allows reconstruction and recognition of an obscured object, but external manipulation of the data can lead to inaccurate results. Here, the accuracy and robustness of passive non-line-of-sight recognition and its fragility to adversarial attacks are studied.
   Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging is attractive for its potential applications in autonomous vehicles, robotic vision, and biomedical imaging. NLOS imaging can be realized through reconstruction or recognition. Recognition is preferred in some practical scenarios because it can classify hidden objects directly and quickly. Current NLOS recognition is mostly realized by exploiting active laser illumination. However, passive NLOS recognition, which is essential for its simplified hardware system and good stealthiness, has not been explored. Here, we use a passive imaging setting that consists of a standard digital camera and an occluder to achieve a NLOS recognition system by deep learning. The proposed passive NLOS recognition system demonstrates high accuracy with the datasets of handwritten digits, hand gestures, human postures, and fashion products (81.58 % to 98.26%) using less than 1 second per image in a dark room. Beyond, good performance can be maintained under more complex lighting conditions and practical tests. Moreover, we conversely conduct white-box attacks on the NLOS recognition algorithm to study its security. An attack success rate of approximately 36% is achieved at a relatively low cost, which demonstrates that the existing passive NLOS recognition remains somewhat vulnerable to small perturbations.

AB As research into technology for autonomous vehicles becomes ever more intensive, the need for redundant system designs, as a solution for fail-operational functionality, has also increased. Redundant systems are those involved in maintaining normal operation even when one or more components fails. In particular, in electric power steering (EPS) systems, redundancy is achieved by applying dual-winding (DW), permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) and dual electronic control units (ECUs). In this study, the torque and efficiency of DW-PMSMs is analysed based on the manner in which the currents in each winding mechanism are combined. It was found that the PMSMs have maximum torque and efficiency when the current ratio was the same between DWs. A diagnostic strategy is proposed whereby the phase current ratio of dual lanes is not matched. The proposed diagnostic process includes the selection of the optimal fault threshold of the current difference between two ECUs and a method for distinguishing which of these was a failure for disagreement. In addition, depending on whether or not failure detection has occurred, a current compensation control method is proposed for reverting to normal operation or for failure operations. The dual-lane system was fabricated and the proposed solutions were experimentally verified.

AB Although a lot of work has been conducted on car-following modeling, model calibration and validation are still a great challenge, especially in the era of autonomous driving. Most challengingly, besides the immediate benefit incurred with a car-following action, a smart vehicle needs to learn to evaluate the long-term benefits and become foresighted in conducting car-following behaviors. Driving memory, which plays a significant role in car-following, has seldom been considered in current models. This paper focuses on the impact of driving memory on car-following behavior, particularly, historical driving memory represents certain types of driving regimes and drivers' maneuver in coordination with the variety of driving regimes. An autoencoder was used to extract the main features underlying the time-series data in historical driving memory. Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model has been employed to investigate the relationship between driving memory and car-following behavior. The results show that velocity, relative velocity, instant perception time (IPT), and time gap are the most relevant parameters, while distance gap is insignificant. Furthermore, we compared the accuracy and robustness of three patterns including various driving memory information and span levels. This study contributes to bridging the gap between historical driving memory and car-following behavior modeling. The developed LSTM methodology has the potential to provide personalized warnings of dangerous car-following distance over the next second.

AB Reliable detection and recognition of planar objects including traffic sign, street sign, and road surface in dynamic cluttered natural scenes are a big challenge for self-driving cars. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive method for planar object detection and recognition. First, the data association of LIDAR and camera is set up to acquire colorized laser scans, which simultaneously contain both color and geometrical information. Second, we combine three color spaces of RGB, HSV, and CIE L*a*b* with laser reflectivity as an aggregation-based feature vector. Third, the 3-D geometrical characteristics of planar objects that contain planarity, size, and aspect ratio are exploited to further reduce false alarm. Fourth, in order to increase robustness to any viewpoint variation, we present a new virtual camera-based rectification method to synthesize fronto-parallel views of refined object descriptors in 3-D space. Finally, experimental results achieved under a variety of challenging conditions show that integration of color space aggregation and laser reflectivity is superior to individuals. Specifically, the proposed perspective distortion rectification method remarkably eliminates false recognition error by 45.5%. Overall, the detection rate of our comprehensive method has up to 95.87% and the recognition rate even reaches 95.07% for traffic signs ranging within 100 m, with about 33.25 ms average running time per frame.

AB Forests are a challenging environment for autonomous operations. The automatic driving and control of hydraulic forestry cranes have been studied earlier as separate problems. However, this study focuses on control where the boom and the forest machine are employed in a coordinated manner. Such control could be beneficial in certain tasks, such as forest cleaning operations where small trees are removed. To accomplish the coordinated actions, nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is utilized. NMPC is a control strategy based on numerical optimization which minimizes a given objective function. The coordinated control was tested with real hardware consisting of a tractor and a forestry crane. In the tests, the tractor has a target path and the tip of the boom has a target trajectory. These tests correspond to a real world situation where the forest machine has its own driving lines and the tool is used to accomplish a given task. Two different trajectories for the boom tip were tested with the target velocity of the boom tip being 0.5 m/s or 1.0 m/s. At these velocities, the average tracking error of the tractor ranged from 6.7 cm to 36.2 cm while the average error of the boom tip varied between 3.7 cm and 13.6 cm. In a separate test where only the tractor was controlled, its tracking error was 15.4 cm. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The feasibility of measuring drivers' automation trust via gaze behavior during highly automated driving was assessed with eye tracking and validated with self-reported automation trust in a driving simulator study.
   Background: Earlier research from other domains indicates that drivers' automation trust might be inferred from gaze behavior, such as monitoring frequency.
   Method: The gaze behavior and self-reported automation trust of 35 participants attending to a visually demanding non-driving-related task (NDRT) during highly automated driving was evaluated. The relationship between dispositional, situational, and learned automation trust with gaze behavior was compared.
   Results: Overall, there was a consistent relationship between drivers' automation trust and gaze behavior. Participants reporting higher automation trust tended to monitor the automation less frequently. Further analyses revealed that higher automation trust was associated with lower monitoring frequency of the automation during NDRTs, and an increase in trust over the experimental session was connected with a decrease in monitoring frequency.
   Conclusion: We suggest that (a) the current results indicate a negative relationship between drivers' self-reported automation trust and monitoring frequency, (b) gaze behavior provides a more direct measure of automation trust than other behavioral measures, and (c) with further refinement, drivers' automation trust during highly automated driving might be inferred from gaze behavior.
   Application: Potential applications of this research include the estimation of drivers' automation trust and reliance during highly automated driving.

DE underwater sensor networks; ad hoc routing; AUVs
AB Deploying a multi-hop underwater acoustic sensor network (UASN) in a large area brings about new challenges in reliable data transmissions and survivability of network due to the limited underwater communication range/bandwidth and the limited energy of underwater sensor nodes. In order to address those challenges and achieve the objectives of maximization of data delivery ratio and minimization of energy consumption of underwater sensor nodes, this paper proposes a new underwater routing scheme, namely AURP (AUV-aided underwater routing protocol), which uses not only heterogeneous acoustic communication channels but also controlled mobility of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In AURP, the total data transmissions are minimized by using AUVs as relay nodes, which collect sensed data from gateway nodes and then forward to the sink. Moreover, controlled mobility of AUVs makes it possible to apply a short-range high data rate underwater channel for transmissions of a large amount of data. To the best to our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to employ multiple AUVs as relay nodes in a multi-hop UASN to improve the network performance in terms of data delivery ratio and energy consumption. Simulations, which are incorporated with a realistic underwater acoustic communication channel model, are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, and the results indicate that a high delivery ratio and low energy consumption can be achieved.

AB This study proposes the use of ductless Archimedes screw turbine (DAST) arrays to provide power to deep-ocean observation platforms. The primary objective is to expand the deployment range and reduce the environmental effects associated with deep-ocean observations. An experimentally validated numerical model was developed to assess the efficiency and self-starting capability of the DAST arrays considering different configurations, rotation directions, and flow orientations. To address the limitations of fixed rotational speeds and phase angle differences, a variable step-length optimal rotational speed tracking algorithm was incorporated into the numerical model. The findings illustrate that the optimal triangular DAST array, in comparison with an isolated DAST, can enhance the maximum power coefficient by 8%, reaching a value of 0.37. Moreover, this array can maintain high performance for more than one-third of the incoming flow directions without the need for a yaw device. Furthermore, a novel full-process simulation platform was devised to evaluate the power generation capacity of DAST arrays with varying dimensions under different flow velocity conditions. The results suggest that in typical deep ocean current scenarios, an optimal DAST array with a turbine radius of 500 mm can generate an excess of 25 Wh of daily power supply, which is adequate to support the periodic operations of miniature autonomous underwater vehicles such as ZF-01.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is a global system of networked physical devices that will play a significant part in the next generation of the web (FI). More than 50 billion gadgets are predicted to be linked to the internet by 2023. As a result, a large number of Apps and services will be necessary to make these items readable, identifiable, locatable, accessible, and/or controlled through the web. Trust in the IoT security architecture is crucial for the IoT to be extensively accepted by both consumers and businesses. It is crucial to specify how data may be sent and received between devices in the IoT in a safe and reliable manner. We begin by developing a mechanism for establishing group keys, which will allow for secure multicast group communication in the Internet of Things. The second security aspect of our work is the design of a lightweight biometric user anonymity-preserving authentication protocol. "The third security aspect of our work is a technique for preserving the Source Location privacy. Improvements in accessibility are being made possible by the Internet of Things and the data it generates, in areas as diverse as smart homes and autonomous vehicles." As a result, Internet of Things gadgets and services are helping individuals with impairments become more independent and engaged in their daily lives.

DE Monocular 3D object detection; Pseudo-LiDAR; Confidence sampling;
   Hierarchical geometric feature extraction
AB The high bandwidth and low latency of 6G network technology enable the successful application of monocular 3D object detection on vehicle platforms. Monocular 3D-object-detection-based Pseudo-LiDAR is a low-cost, lowpower solution compared to LiDAR solutions in the field of autonomous driving. However, this technique has some problems, i.e., (1) the poor quality of generated Pseudo-LiDAR point clouds resulting from the nonlinear error distribution of monocular depth estimation and (2) the weak representation capability of point cloud features due to the neglected global geometric structure features of point clouds existing in LiDAR-based 3D detection networks. Therefore, we proposed a Pseudo-LiDAR confidence sampling strategy and a hierarchical geometric feature extraction module for monocular 3D object detection. We first designed a point cloud confidence sampling strategy based on a 3D Gaussian distribution to assign small confidence to the points with great error in depth estimation and filter them out according to the confidence. Then, we present a hierarchical geometric feature extraction module by aggregating the local neighborhood features and a dual transformer to capture the global geometric features in the point cloud. Finally, our detection framework is based on Point-VoxelRCNN (PV-RCNN) with high-quality Pseudo-LiDAR and enriched geometric features as input. From the experimental results, our method achieves satisfactory results in monocular 3D object detection.

AB This paper proposes the design of a 360 degrees map establishment and real-time simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm based on equirectangular projection. All equirectangular projection images with an aspect ratio of 2:1 are supported for input image types of the proposed system, allowing an unlimited number and arrangement of cameras. Firstly, the proposed system uses dual back-to-back fisheye cameras to capture 360 degrees images, followed by the adoption of the perspective transformation with any yaw degree given to shrink the feature extraction area in order to reduce the computational time, as well as retain the 360 degrees field of view. Secondly, the oriented fast and rotated brief (ORB) feature points extracted from perspective images with a GPU acceleration are used for tracking, mapping, and camera pose estimation in the system. The 360 degrees binary map supports the functions of saving, loading, and online updating to enhance the flexibility, convenience, and stability of the 360 degrees system. The proposed system is also implemented on an nVidia Jetson TX2 embedded platform with 1% accumulated RMS error of 250 m. The average performance of the proposed system achieves 20 frames per second (FPS) in the case with a single-fisheye camera of resolution 1024 x 768, and the system performs panoramic stitching and blending under 1416 x 708 resolution from a dual-fisheye camera at the same time.

AB Lane-level road maps are crucial for urban traffic management, autonomous driving, and vehicle navigations. Optical remote sensing image suffers from trees and buildings occlusion for lane-level road mapping due to the top-down view. While street view images (SVIs) have been used for road detection, however, most of the previous articles focused on extracting road in image space. The reconstruction of lane-level road maps with measurability in geographic space remains challenging. Hence, this article proposed an operational framework for extracting and reconstructing lane-level road maps from urban open access data. First, a sample strategy was used to collect SVIs based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) road central lines. Then, a deep-learning-based method was adopted to identify lanes accurately, and road width was extracted based on design knowledge and OSM information. Finally, the lane-level road map was reconstructed by integrating the lane and its width information. The proposed framework achieves the transformation from image space to geographic space. The case study shows that 82.43% of the roadway is accurately reconstructed in lane-level. The difference between the reconstructed width of the roadway and the reference true value is within the m-level and the RMSE is 0.32 m. The proposed method is cost-effective and accurate-acceptable for acquiring lane-level road datasets in cities.

ID PROBABILITY
AB Consumption Markov decision processes (CMDPs) are a kind of resource-constrained probabilistic decision-making systems allowing the consumption and replenishment to capacity of resource. Making each decision in CMDPs consumes some amount of resource, which can be reloaded to the full capacity in a specified set of states. We consider here the quantitative reachability probability controller synthesis problems for CMDPs that extract a policy preventing resource exhaustion and achieve (repeated) reachability goals with the maximal probability, in contrast to the original work focusing on the qualitative controller synthesis for CMDPs, e.g., fulfilling the (repeated) reachability goals with positive probability or probability one. We first prove that the exact quantitative reachability probability problems are NP-hard by a reduction from the 0-1 Knapsack problem. We solve them by converting a given CMDP to a flattened Markov decision process (MDP) and then constructing an optimal policy for that MDP. Unfortunately, the naive flattened MDPs are prohibitively large and thus make the subsequent synthesis not scale well. To overcome this drawback, we propose a pruned construction and a quotient construction of the flattened MDP to reduce the sizes of MDPs. The empirical evaluation shows that our optimizations can significantly improve the scalability of the purely flattening-based synthesis method for CMDPs on benchmarks from real-world scenarios - autonomous electric vehicle routing and helicopter planning in Mars Perseverance Rover project.

ID UNDERWATER GLIDER
AB Glider-type autonomous underwater vehicles are today one of the most promising areas of marine robotics. This is confirmed by the frequent and remarkable results of various research missions and projects. The cumulative group application of underwater and no less innovative wave gliders can significantly reduce the time of obtaining oceanographic data. Together with wave gliders, one group of such robotic objects can significantly increase the efficiency, time and volume of obtaining oceanographic data. There is big interest in increasing the functionality of such a group. This article presents one of the possible alternatives to increase the functionality of a group of underwater and waveguide hang gliders. We present the process of upgrading the existing design, control algorithms and software of the SHADOW underwater glider, which was developed by the teams of the St. Petersburg State Marine Technical University (SMTU) and Okeanos JSC in order to jointly study the monitoring of underwater potentially dangerous objects with the St. Petersburg State Fire Service EMERCOM of Russia. A structural-functional approach to the group application of underwater and waveguides is also proposed, which is capable of providing oceanographic, meteorological and environmental monitoring data online, based on the developed multilayer system for planning the trajectories of group movement of objects. The results of full-scale sea trials and the developed algorithms are demonstrated.

AB This article proposes a visual servo control method based on image dynamics for an unmanned aerial manipulator (UAM) combining an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a multidegree-of-freedom onboard manipulator. First, taking into account the dynamic characteristics of the coupled UAM, the dynamic model of the coupled system is derived. Then, based on the perspective projection model, the appropriate image features are defined on the virtual image plane to obtain decoupled image feature dynamics. Combining image features dynamics and UAM dynamics, the position and attitude controller of the UAM flying platform with the center of gravity compensation is derived. Furthermore, the image feature motion is further applied to the positioning control of the end-effector of the onboard manipulator. In addition, the UAM motion distribution strategy is designed to coordinate the movement between the UAM flying platform and the onboard manipulator. The simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed visual servo control based on image dynamics. As a result, the trajectories of the feature points are smooth in the real image plane, which means the UAM movement is stable. Finally, the experimental results in an outdoor environment verify the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed visual servo control method for autonomous operations. The proposed control method manages the UAM from an unknown initial position to the desired position, which can be applied to various types of aerial operations missions such as object transmission.

AB Due to the complexity and uncertainty of the nonlinear autonomous underwater glider (AUG) system, the control algorithms for attitude tracking of the AUG system are very difficult to directly design. In this paper, a novel autotuning control algorithm (ATCA) based on relay feedback and adaptive neural network is proposed to effectively implement the attitude tracking of the AUG system. The proposed algorithm only utilizes the online input/output (I/O) data to achieve the AUG system attitude control, ignoring the mathematical system model. The ATCA control parameters are initialized by relay feedback and adjusted online based on gradient descent algorithm with the partial derivative of the AUG system provided by adaptive neural network. Besides, in the ATCA, the fast adaptive learning factor is employed to make the AUG system respond quickly to the evolving reference trajectory. Furthermore, the complete stability of the closed-loop AUG system with the ATCA has been proven via the Lyapunov stability theory. The simulation studies illustrate the correctness the proposed algorithm. Compared with three popular data driven control algorithms, the proposed algorithm has superiority in terms of system response time, integral squared error (ISE) and integral absolute error (IAE).

AB This article presents a distributed resilient demand response program integrated with electrical energy storage systems for residential consumers to maximize their comfort level. A dynamic real-time pricing method is proposed to determine the hourly electricity prices and schedule the electricity consumption of smart home appliances and energy storage systems commitment. The algorithm is employed in normal and emergency operating conditions, taking into account the comfort level of consumers. In emergency conditions, the power outage of consumers is modeled for different hours and outage patterns. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed model, real samples of Southern California households are considered to model the smart homes and their appliances. Further, a sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the impacts of the number of households and number of persons per household on the output results. The results showed that the proposed model reduced the costs of utility in normal and emergency conditions by about 33.77% and 30.92%, respectively. The values of total payments of consumers in normal and emergency conditions were decreased by about 34.26% and 31.31%, respectively. Further, the consumers comfort level for normal and emergency conditions increased by about 146.78% and 110.2%, respectively. Finally, the social welfare for normal and emergency conditions increased by about 46% and 49.06%, respectively.

AB An internal combustion engine (ICE) is a highly nonlinear dynamic and complex engineering system whose operation is constrained by operational limits, including emissions, noise, peak in-cylinder pressure, combustion stability, and actuator constraints. To optimize today's ICEs, seven to ten control actuators and 10-20 feedback sensors are often used, depending on the engine applications and target emission regulations. This requires extensive engine experimentation to calibrate the engine control module (ECM), which is both cumbersome and costly. Despite these efforts, optimal operation, particularly during engine transients and to meet real driving emission (RDE) targets for broad engine speed and load conditions, has still not been obtained. Methods of model predictive control (MPC) have shown promising results for real-time multi-objective optimal control of constrained multi-variable nonlinear systems, including ICEs. This paper reviews the application of MPC for ICEs and analyzes the recent developments in MPC that can be utilized in ECMs. ICE control and calibration can be enhanced by taking advantage of the recent developments in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in applying Machine Learning (ML) to large-scale engine data. Recent developments in the field of ML-MPC are investigated, and promising methods for ICE control applications are identified in this paper.</p>

AB Estimation of distance from objects in real-world scenes is an important topic in several applications such as navigation of autonomous robots, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and augmented reality (AR). Even though there is a technology for this purpose, in some cases, this technology has some disadvantages. For example, GPS systems are susceptible to interference, especially in places surrounded by buildings, under bridges or indoors; alternatively, RGBD sensors can be used, but they are expensive, and their operational range is limited. Monocular vision is a low-cost suitable alternative that can be used indoor and outdoor. However, monocular odometry is challenging because the object location can be known up a scale factor. Moreover, when objects are moving, it is necessary to estimate the location from consecutive images accumulating error. This paper introduces a new method to compute the distance from a single image of the desired object, with known dimensions, captured with a monocular calibrated vision system. This method is less restrictive than other proposals in the state-of-the-art literature. For the detection of interest points, a Region-based Convolutional Neural Network combined with a corner detector were used. The proposed method was tested on a standard dataset and images acquired by a low-cost and low-resolution webcam, under noncontrolled conditions. The system was tested and compared with a calibrated stereo vision system. Results showed the similar performance of both systems, but the monocular system accomplished the task in less time.

AB The need for search and rescue is not one that will go away. Extending beyond the concerns of hikers, natural disasters have brought the necessity for search and rescue in the heart of civilization. The advent of new technologies, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, can help decrease the cost of search and rescue operations and increase survival rates by finding the lost individuals in a faster manner. Visual object recognition is key to successful drone application for assisting search and rescue activities, and it is critical to develop a fully autonomous system. In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks have proven themselves as a powerful class of models and have become de facto a standard in a computer vision community. Moreover, a number of studies have shown that intermediate activations extracted from a deep convolutional neural network, pre-trained on large image dataset, can be adopted as universal image representation and transferred to other image classification tasks, leading to striking performances. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of different layer activations on the performance of convolutional features for binary person classification from UAV imagery, using various deep network architectures. Experiments have demonstrated that convolutional network generated features can deliver extremely competitive results, comparable to human-level performance. Furthermore, they reveal that in said context fully connected layer activations generalize well and are more expressive than the mid- or higher-level layers activations. Our work provides guidance for transferring pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks to address remote person classification tasks.

AB Considering the difficult maneuverability of the hovercraft and the driving burden of the pilot, an automatic tracking system including an intuitive human-computer interface and an adaptive chatteringfree full-order terminal sliding mode (ACFTSM) controller is designed for humans (non-engineers in particular). The human-computer interface is easy to be understood and used. For the design of the controller, four degrees of freedom (DOF) model of hovercraft is established. And based on the four DOF model, the desired velocities are proposed by a TSM manifold to achieve the finite-time trajectory tracking. Then, the desired velocities can be tracked by the designed CFTSM controller which has superior properties, such as fast and finite-time convergence, highly robust to the disturbances, and low sensitivity to the system parameter variations. Moreover, both the chattering and singularity problems of TSM are resolved by the CFTSM method. By the well combining with radial basis function neural networks in this paper, the new method, named ACFTSM, also has an ability to deal with the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty of hovercraft's complex model. The controller guarantees the fast and finite-time convergence of velocities and position tracking errors. And numerical simulations are implemented to demonstrate the robustness and superiority of the designed controller.

AB A frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) generator with an ultra-large time-bandwidth product (TBWP) is crucial in modern radar systems. Herein we propose and experimentally demonstrate a programmable FMCW generator with an ultra-large TBWP based on two three-electrode distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser diodes (LDs) and one photodetector (PD). Thanks to the rapid response of the refractive index to the injection current in the passive phase control section, which is caused by the free-carrier plasma effect, the three-electrode DBR LD takes advantage of programmable and ultra-fast wavelength tuning. In the proposed FMCW generator, a programmable current source injects one three-electrode DBR LD to generate a broadband frequency-chirped optical signal. A constant current source injects the other one to perform a stable optical carrier. By beating the frequency-chirped optical signal and the optical carrier at the PD, a programmable FMCW is generated. Experimental results show that an ultra-wideband FMCW generator with full reconfigurability in modulation type, bandwidth, center frequency, chirp rate, and temporal duration is realized. A chirp rate over 10 GHz/mu s and a TBWP up to 2 x 10(7) are experimentally demonstrated. Thanks to the monolithic integration of the critical devices, including two three-electrode DBR LDs and one PD, the demonstration promises breakthroughs in small-size and high-performance FMCW generators, facilitating applications in autonomous vehicles and space exploration systems.

AB In this paper, we study to employ geographic information to address the blockage problem of air-to-ground links between UAV and terrestrial nodes. In particular, a UAV relay is deployed to establish communication links from a ground base station to multiple ground users. To improve communication capacity, we first model the blockage effect caused by buildings according to the three-dimensional (3-D) geographic information. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the minimum capacity among users by jointly optimizing the 3-D position and power allocation of the UAV relay, under the constraints of link capacity, maximum transmit power, and blockage. To solve this complex non-convex problem, a two-loop optimization framework is developed based on Lagrangian relaxation. The outer-loop aims to obtain proper Lagrangian multipliers to ensure the solution of the Lagrangian problem converge to the tightest upper bound on the original problem. The inner-loop solves the Lagrangian problem by applying the block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques, where UAV 3-D positioning and power allocation are alternately optimized in each iteration. Simulation results confirm that the proposed solution significantly outperforms three benchmark schemes and achieves a performance close to the upper bound on the UAV relay system.

Images can be categorized into a limited number of 3D scene geometries, called stages, and each one of them is having a unique depth pattern to provide a specific context for stage objects. Moreover, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown high performance of scene classification due to their powerful perspective of feature learning and reasoning. However, we found that edge-preserving Laplacian filter (LF) based on Laplacian pyramids, which enhances the edge details of image scene owing to this, it can improve the performance of stage classification. We introduce a novel method of stage classification based on two-stream CNN model in which one stream is encoded by LF, and another stream is normal RGB images and their output is fused at the decision level. This proposed method is evaluated on two different stage datasets: first 'stage-1209' contains 1209 images, and second, '12-scene' image dataset contains 12,000 images. Results exhibited that LF encoded images have a positive influence on stage classification accuracy. Following this, while using product rule the proposed method obtains the most significant improvement in the stage classification for both datasets. It improves particularly 7.96% stage accuracy on 12-scene image dataset, compared to the state-of-the-art method.

AB Trust is regarded as one of the main predictors for adopting automated buses (ABs). However, theories about trust (development) in technology generally vary and an in-depths study about trust in ABs specifically is still outstanding. The present study fills this gap by presenting results from focus group interviews to trust (development) in shared automated buses prior to exposure. The objectives of this study are to contrast participants' naive concepts of trust with theory and to identify underlying factors influencing a-priori trust in ABs. Results show that the N = 21 focus group participants use different strategies to familiarise themselves with the new technology of ABs, e.g., comparisons with familiar technologies, fundamental tendencies to approach or avoid, additional information seeking, or anthropomorphisation. These strategies largely support existing theories on trust (development) in technology. Differences between naive interpretations of trust and its theoretical assumptions were found in focus group debates where more control over technology limited uncertainty and led to more trust. While theories suggest control and trust to be incompatible opposites, participants see control as a way to enhance trust. We provide starting points for further theory development and expansion and stress the importance of explanations in emerging technologies for trust and acceptance building.

AB Event cameras which transmit per-pixel intensity changes have emerged as a promising candidate in applications such as consumer electronics, industrial automation, and autonomous vehicles, owing to their efficiency and robustness. To maintain these inherent advantages, the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy stands as a priority in event-based algorithms. Thanks to the preponderance of deep learning techniques and the compatibility between bio-inspired spiking neural networks and event-based sensors, data-driven approaches have become a hot spot, which along with the dedicated hardware and datasets constitute an emerging field named event-based data-driven technology. Focusing on data-driven technology in event-based vision, this paper first explicates the operating principle, advantages, and intrinsic nature of event cameras, as well as background knowledge in event-based vision, presenting an overview of this research field. Then, we explain why event-based data-driven technology becomes a research focus, including reasons for the rise of event-based vision and the superiority of data-driven approaches over other event-based algorithms. Current status and future trends of event-based data-driven technology are presented successively in terms of hardware, datasets, and algorithms, providing guidance for future research. Generally, this paper reveals the great prospects of event-based data-driven technology and presents a comprehensive overview of this field, aiming at a more efficient and bio-inspired visual system to extract visual features from the external environment.

AB The effect of air pollution on the environment, economic and health of the people in the affected countries cannot be overemphasized. This paper investigates large scale air pollution elimination to remove pollutants that are already in existence in the environment. This method involves the use of Environmental Drones (E-drones) to autonomously monitor the air quality at a specific location. The E-drone flies up to a predetermined height (Ealtitude) every hour, measures the air pollutants at that location, implements on-board pollution abatement solutions for pollutants above the recommended threshold, and then flies back down to its location on the ground. The advantages of this system is its ability to measure air pollution concentration of CO2, CO, NH3, SO2, PM, O-3 and NO2, detect when they are too high, and implement on-board pollution abatement solutions as needed. This system's novelty lies in the fact that it not only detects when there is excessive pollution, but it also automatically deals with and abates the detected air pollution above earth. When multiple E-drones are used in different locations, a custom software generates an Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) map of the region that can be used for present and long-term environmental analysis.

DE AUV acoustic navigation; unscented Kalman filter; adaptive filter;
   Sage-Husa filter; robust estimation
AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) acoustic navigation is challenged by unknown system noise and gross errors in the acoustic observations caused by the complex marine environment. Since the classical unscented Kalman filter (UKF) algorithm cannot control the dynamic model biases and resist the influence of gross errors, an adaptive robust UKF based on the Sage-Husa filter and the robust estimation technique is proposed for AUV acoustic navigation. The proposed algorithm compensates the system noise by adopting the Sage-Husa noise estimation technique in an online manner under the condition that the system noise matrices are kept as positive or semi positive. In order to control the influence of gross errors in the acoustic observations, the equivalent gain matrix is constructed to improve the robustness of the adaptive UKF for AUV acoustic navigation based on Huber's equivalent weight function. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by the simulated long baseline positioning experiment of the AUV, as well as the real marine experimental data of the ultrashort baseline positioning of an underwater towed body. The results demonstrate that the adaptive UKF can estimate the system noise through the time-varying noise estimator and avoid the problem of negative definite of the system noise variance matrix. The proposed adaptive robust UKF based on the Sage-Husa filter can further reduce the influence of gross errors while adjusting the system noise, and significantly improve the accuracy and stability of AUV acoustic navigation.

AB This work considers the processing of acoustic data froma multibeam forward-looking sonar (FLS) on amoving underwater platform to estimate the platform's attitude and trajectory. We propose an algorithm to produce an estimate of the attitude trajectory for an FLS based on the optical flow between consecutive sonar frames. The attitude trajectory can be used to locate an underwater platform, such as an autonomous underwater vehicle, to a degree of accuracy suitable for navigation. It can also be used to build a mosaic of the underwater scene. The estimation is performed in three steps. First, a selection of techniques based on the optical flow model is used to estimate a pixel displacement map (DM) between consecutive sonar frames represented in the native polar (range/ bearing) format. The second step finds the best match between the estimated DM and DMs for a set of modeled sonar sensor motions. To reduce complexity, it is proposed to describe the DM with a small parameter vector derived from the displacement distribution. Thus, an estimate of the incremental sensor motion between frames is made. Finally, using a weighted regularized spline technique, the incremental interframe motions are integrated into an attitude trajectory for the sonar sensor. To assess the accuracy of the attitude-trajectory estimate, it is used to register FLS frames from a field experiment data set and build a high-quality mosaic of the underwater scene.

AB Fault diagnosis and prognosis (FDP) are important capabilities that can enable autonomous detection and prediction of failures' progress in complex engineering systems. This paper introduces an innovative modular FDPmethod for a hydro-control valve system. The hydro-control valve is a critical part of the space launch vehicle propulsion system, and health monitoring of this hydro-valve is essential to ensure safety and reliability of the spacecraft. In this study, three main failures, i.e., piston leakage, drain blockage, and filter malfunction, in the hydro-control valve system are considered for monitoring and prognosis. The proposed FDP system has three main components including fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) unit, failure parameter estimation unit, and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation unit. A feature selection strategy and a support vector machine technique are together utilized to capture redundancy in multisensor data information and to isolate failures in the FDD unit. Then, a decentralized network of three adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) is developed to estimate the failure parameters. Afterward, the RUL unit is constructed using an adaptive Bayesian algorithm. Finally, a performance measure, called the relative accuracy index, is introduced and applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed health monitoring system. Simulation studies confirm the effective performance of the proposed design methodology.

AB In this research, a novel autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) cooperative positioning algorithm is proposed to solve the implementation problem of multi-sensor-fusion applications. Different from the traditional methods [i.e., the extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and iteration extended Kalman filter (IEKF)], which have large linearity error under the condition of nonlinear observation equation when multiple AUV are cooperative positioning, the proposed algorithm utilized the Baysis filter to solve the AUV cooperative problem. Factor graph and sum-product (FGS)-based cooperative positioning algorithm is established to mathematically implement the Bayse filter by converting the global function estimation problem into a local function sum-product estimation problem. Furthermore, to improve the performance of the proposed algorithm, a robust data processing method is presented by introducing a transform matrix to the estimated position information. To demonstrate and verify the proposed methods, the simulation and real tests in different scenarios are performed in this research. Compared with the traditional EKF, UKF, and IEKF cooperative positioning algorithm, the positioning error of the proposed improved FGS (IFGS) cooperative positioning algorithm is obviously smaller than that of the other three algorithms. Moreover, the IFGS algorithm can reduce the complexity of the algorithm, available improving the computational speed of the whole system. This proposed algorithm has important theoretical and practical value for the both industry and academic areas.

AB Small satellite platforms are becoming very appealing both for scientific and commercial applications, thanks to their low cost, short development times and availability of standard components and subsystems. The main disadvantage with such vehicles is the limitation of available resources to perform mission tasks. To overcome this drawback, mission concepts are under study that foresee cooperation between autonomous small satellites to accomplish complex tasks; among these, on-orbit servicing and on-orbit assembly of large structures are of particular interest and the global scientific community is putting a significant effort in the miniaturization of critical technologies that are required for such innovative mission scenarios. In this work, the development and the laboratory testing of an accurate relative navigation package for nanosatellites compliant to the CubeSat standard is presented. The system features a small camera and two sets of LED fiducial markers, and is conceived as a standard package that allows small spacecraft to perform mutual tracking during rendezvous and docking maneuvers. The hardware is based on off-the-shelf components assembled in a compact configuration that is compatible with the CubeSat standard. The image processing and pose estimation software was custom developed. The experimental evaluation of the system allowed to determine both the static and dynamic performances. The system is capable to determine the close range relative position and attitude faster than 10 S/s, with errors always below 10 mm and 2 deg.

AB Similar flight control principles operate across insect and vertebrate fliers. These principles indicate that robust solutions have evolved to meet complex behavioral challenges. Following from studies of visual and cervical feedback control of flight in insects, we investigate the role of head stabilization in providing feedback cues for controlling turning flight in pigeons. Based on previous observations that the eyes of pigeons remain at relatively fixed orientations within the head during flight, we test potential sensory control inputs derived fromhead and bodymovements during 90 degrees aerial turns. We observe that periods of angular head stabilization alternate with rapid head repositioning movements (head saccades), and confirm that control of head motion is decoupled from aerodynamic and inertial forces acting on the bird's continuously rotating body during turning flapping flight. Visual cues inferred fromhead saccades correlate with changes in flight trajectory; whereas the magnitude of neck bending predicts angular changes in body position. The control of head motion to stabilize a pigeon's gaze may therefore facilitate extraction of importantmotion cues, in addition to offeringmechanisms for controlling body and wing movements. Strong similarities between the sensory flight control of birds and insects may also inspire novel designs of robust controllers for human-engineered autonomous aerial vehicles.

AB Pedestrian detection reliability is a key problem for autonomous or aided driving, and methods that use Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) are very popular. Embedded Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are exploited to run HOG in a very efficient manner. Unfortunately, GPUs architecture has been shown to be particularly vulnerable to radiation-induced failures. This article presents an experimental evaluation and analytical study of HOG reliability. We aim at quantifying and qualifying the radiation-induced errors on pedestrian detection applications executed in embedded GPUs.
   We analyze experimental results obtained executing HOG on embedded GPUs from two different vendors, exposed for about 100 hours to a controlled neutron beam at Los Alamos National Laboratory. We consider the number and position of detected objects as well as precision and recall to discriminate critical erroneous computations. The reported analysis shows that, while being intrinsically resilient (65% to 85% of output errors only slightly impact detection), HOG experienced some particularly critical errors that could result in undetected pedestrians or unnecessary vehicle stops.
   Additionally, we perform a fault-injection campaign to identify HOG critical procedures. We observe that Resize and Normalize are the most sensitive and critical phases, as about 20% of injections generate an output error that significantly impacts HOG detection. With our insights, we are able to find those limited portions of HOG that, if hardened, are more likely to increase reliability without introducing unnecessary overhead.

AB The present paper focuses on the experimental validation of a numerical approach previously proposed by the authors for the prediction of vibrations inside buildings due to railway traffic in tunnels. The numerical model is based on the concept of dynamic substructuring and is composed by three autonomous models to simulate the following main parts of the problem: i) generation of vibrations (train-track interaction); ii) propagation of vibrations (track-tunnel-ground system); iii) reception of vibrations (building coupled to the ground). The experimental validation consists in the comparison between the results predicted by the proposed numerical model and the measurements performed inside a building due to the railway traffic in a shallow tunnel located in Madrid. Apart from the brief description of the numerical model and of the case study, the main options and simplifications adopted on the numerical modeling strategy are discussed. The balance adopted between accuracy and simplicity of the numerical approach proved to be a path to follow in order to transfer knowledge to engineering practice. Finally, the comparison between numerical and experimental results allowed finding a good agreement between both, fact that ensures the ability of the proposed modeling strategy to deal with real engineering practical problems.

AB Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP beta CD) is a complexation agent used to enhance drug solubilization and formulation stability. Although its toxicity is well characterized, its cardiovascular effects are less known. To investigate them, HP beta CD was infused intravenously over 10 min in anesthetized dogs (10-40% (w/v, i.e. 200-800 mg/kg) in non-denervated animals and at 40% in denervated animals). HP beta CD increased renal arteriolar resistance and decreased renal blood flow at all doses, almost immediately after infusion start, more drastically in females. A less pronounced increase in total peripheral resistance occurred in females only due to sex difference in sympathetic tone. Pulmonary hemodynamic parameters remained unaffected, suggesting that the renal effect was rather selective. As a consequence of the increased systemic blood pressure, heart rate decreased in normal animals without direct effect on cardiac conductance. This effect was abolished in denervated animals. This suggests that autonomous nervous feedback loops are functional in normal animals and that HP beta CD has no direct chronotropic effect. In conclusion, systemic and renal hemodynamic changes should be considered as potential background effects at 200-400 mg/kg. At higher doses (800 mg/kg), changes are more pronounced and could mask/exacerbate hemodynamic response of drug candidate; such doses should be avoided in nonclinical safety studies.

AB This paper presents an adaptive scheme for localization of a target from distance measurements and motion control of a mobile agent to pursue this target. The localization and motion control task of interest is approached within a parameter-identifier-based adaptive control framework, where the localization is formulated as a parameter identification problem and the motion control is achieved using an adaptive controller based on the produced location estimates of the target. First, a robust adaptive law is designed to generate location estimate of the target using distance measurements. Then, following the standard certainty equivalence approach, a motion control law is developed considering substitution of the estimate generated by the localization algorithm for the unknown location of the target. Noting that there is some incompatibility between the persistence of excitation requirements of the localization algorithm and the target pursuit goal of the motion control law, the base motion control law is (re)designed to eliminate the effects of this incompatibility. The novelty of this paper is in this motion control design eliminating the persistence of excitation incompatibility. Stability and convergence analysis for the overall adaptive control scheme is presented. The results are valid in both two and three dimensions of motion space. The applications of the adaptive scheme include rescue localization, surveillance of signal sources, and formation acquisition of autonomous multi-robot/vehicle systems.

AB New types of Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems (AS/RS) able to achieve high throughput are continuously being developed and require new control polices to take full advantage of the developed system. In this paper, a dynamic storage system has been studied as developed by Vanderlande Industries, consisting of a conveyor, two non-passing lifts that share a mast, multiple transfer shuttles, and a storage rack. This study is concerned with the scheduling problem of these two lifts, i.e. which lift is going to handle which (storage or retrieval) request, and in which order. An integrated look-ahead strategy heuristic to simultaneously assign a set of pre-defined requests to the lifts and the order in which they will be handled taking into account delays caused by interference between the lifts. A practical methodology to characterize the system to identify and resolve situations where the lifts would interfere with each other is presented. Experimental results compare several priority rules to handle interference between lifts, and provide empirical evidence that the dynamic system with multiple lifts controlled by the proposed look-ahead strategy achieved average improvements of 44.34% and 35.82% in terms of total handling times (82.49% and 60.08% in terms of throughput) compared to a single lift system and to a simple rule of thumb, respectively.

In the existing studies, most of the researchers introduced routing scheme for routing the packets towards the base station through a cluster head. However, these schemes use static or mobile nodes for deployment, but nodes move from its original position to another position and get stuck in a particular region due to ocean current, natural disaster and environmental interference. Therefore, this leads to high energy depletion, link failure, disjoint path and overloaded data. To resolve this issue, we have proposed fault resilient routing based on moth flame optimization (MFO\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ MFO $$\end{document}) scheme for transferring the packets towards the base station through autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ AUVs $$\end{document}).

AB Purpose Recently, disruptive technologies (DTs) have proposed several innovative applications in managing logistics and promise to transform the entire logistics sector drastically. Often, this transformation is not successful due to the existence of adoption barriers to DTs. This study aims to identify the significant barriers that impede the successful adoption of DTs in the logistics sector and examine the interrelationships amongst them. Design/methodology/approach Initially, 12 critical barriers were identified through an extensive literature review on disruptive logistics management, and the barriers were screened to ten relevant barriers with the help of Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM). Further, an Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) approach was built with the inputs from logistics experts working in the various departments of warehouses, inventory control, transportation, freight management and customer service management. ISM approach was then used to generate and examine the interrelationships amongst the critical barriers. Matrics d'Impacts Croises-Multiplication Applique a Classement (MICMAC) analysed the barriers based on the barriers' driving and dependence power. Findings Results from the ISM-based technique reveal that the lack of top management support (B6) was a critical barrier that can influence the adoption of DTs. Other significant barriers, such as legal and regulatory frameworks (B1), infrastructure (B3) and resistance to change (B2), were identified as the driving barriers, and industries need to pay more attention to them for the successful adoption of DTs in logistics. The MICMAC analysis shows that the legal and regulatory framework and lack of top management support have the highest driving powers. In contrast, lack of trust, reliability and privacy/security emerge as barriers with high dependence powers. Research limitations/implications The authors' study has several implications in the light of DT substitution. First, this study successfully analyses the seven DTs using Adner and Kapoor's framework (2016a, b) and the Theory of Disruptive Innovation (Christensen, 1997; Christensen et al., 2011) based on the two parameters as follows: emergence challenge of new technology and extension opportunity of old technology. Second, this study categorises these seven DTs into four quadrants from the framework. Third, this study proposes the recommended paths that DTs might want to follow to be adopted quickly. Practical implications The authors' study has several managerial implications in light of the adoption of DTs. First, the authors' study identified no autonomous barriers to adopting DTs. Second, other barriers belonging to any lower level of the ISM model can influence the dependent barriers. Third, the linkage barriers are unstable, and any preventive action involving linkage barriers would subsequently affect linkage barriers and other barriers. Fourth, the independent barriers have high influencing powers over other barriers. Originality/value The contributions of this study are four-fold. First, the study identifies the different DTs in the logistics sector. Second, the study applies the theory of disruptive innovations and the ecosystems framework to rationalise the choice of these seven DTs. Third, the study identifies and critically assesses the barriers to the successful adoption of these DTs through a strategic evaluation procedure with the help of a framework built with inputs from logistics experts.
   Fourth, the study recognises DTs adoption barriers in logistics management and provides a foundation for future research to eliminate those barriers.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) traffic management (TM) has focused on applications based on line-of-sight (LOS) links, such as aerial mapping, delivery services, farming, and monitoring. In the future dense UAV traffic situation, UAV-TM must properly maintain numerous fully autonomous UAVs beyond the line of sight. The capabilities of current cellular systems are restricted to enabling only terrestrial operations. The existing system, which proposes 6G-enabled UAV positions and relay paths based on IoT networks, does not include UAV-Traffic Management (UAV-TM). Therefore, the proposed method uses Deep Learning Methods to investigate the appropriate communication technology for advanced UAV-TM systems. This research presents a graph problem formulation for optimizing UAV positions and relay pathways in UAV-relayed IoT networks. Afterward, the encoder-decoder LSTM framework and one-dimensional convolutional neural network combined the inherent difficulty measurements with air traffic flow prediction. To handle the complicated issue of UAV traffic management on an abstract level, this study suggests a novel manner of arranging the uncontrolled, low-altitude airspace. Simulation findings demonstrate that, when the network is comparatively tiny, the suggested UAV-TM technique can achieve comparable results to brute-force searching with much less time complexity. The suggested model outperforms other methods in all cases having minimum RMSE value. The prediction error of the suggested model is specifically lower on average than that of shallow neural networks and other models.

AB Plant diseases pose a major threat to agricultural production and the food supply chain, as they expose plants to potentially disruptive pathogens that can affect the lives of those who are associated with it. Deep learning has been applied in a range of fields such as object detection, autonomous vehicles, fraud detection etc. Several researchers have tried to implement deep learning techniques in precision agriculture. However, there are pros and cons to the approaches they have opted for disease detection and identification. In this survey, we have made an attempt to capture the significant advancements in machine-learning based disease detection. We have discussed prevalent datasets and techniques that have been employed as well as highlighted emerging approaches being used for plant disease detection. By exploring these advancements, we aim to present a comprehensive overview of the prominent approaches in precision agriculture, along with their associated challenges and potential improvements. This paper delves into the challenges associated with the implementation and briefly discusses the future trends. Overall, this paper presents a bird's eye view of plant disease datasets, deep learning techniques, their accuracies and the challenges associated with them. Our insights will serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field. We hope that this survey will inform and inspire future research efforts, ultimately leading to improved precision agriculture practices and enhanced crop health management.

AB Recently, as the short life cycle of technology entails the introduction of various new technologies, the importance of technological evolution has been emphasized. Although many researchers have tried to study technological evolution, their works have some limitations because they must consider not only technology evolution but also social evolution in a social system, such as social institutions, markets, and customer acceptance. In addition, previous techno-socio co-evolution studies mostly focused on case analyses based on a theoretical research framework. Thus, in this study, we propose a framework for analyzing co-evolution in terms of the technological-social aspect using topic modeling to analyze the evolutionary patterns of social and technological topics and performing time-series analysis of co-evolution using the HMM model based on the contents of technology and society. In this study, we collected technology-specialized news articles for 20 years for autonomous vehicles, which have been the biggest issue in technology and society in recent years. Using the HMMbased on the derived technological-social anchored topic, we derived the techno-socio co-evolution sequence and analyzed the evolutionary pattern of technological development after the emergence of new technology and the techno-socio co-evolution pattern leading to policy establishment. The techno-socio co-evolution pattern derived from this study will contribute to technology planning and policy establishment.

AB An MIAPP-NALT system is an order picking system in which cases are picked at multiple in-the-aisle pick positions (MIAPP) and storage and retrieval operations are performed by a narrow aisle lift truck (NALT). In this paper, the operation of such a system involving three classes of stock keeping units with random demands for storage and retrieval operations is modeled as an M/G/1 queue, where "customers" are storage and retrieval requests, the "server" is the NALT, and retrieval requests have non-preemptive priority over storage requests. Our goal is to explore a methodology and solution method to obtain the optimal layout design of a class-based MIAPP-NALT system with stochastic demands and priority service. To this end, an operation time model of the system is developed and the first two moments for the operation time are derived. To overcome the challenge in finding the desired optimal layout, a near-optimal layout obtained via a heuristic approach is obtained at first and is improved afterwards. Based on the optimal layout, some valuable queueing results demonstrate the benefit of using a priority-based discipline. Moreover, some useful insights regarding the selection of dedicated versus random storage policies are obtained.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a new coronavirus, has affected economic and social standards as governments and healthcare regulatory agencies throughout the world expressed worry and explored harsh preventative measures to counteract the disease's spread and intensity. Several academics and experts are primarily concerned with halting the continuous spread of the unique virus. Social separation, the closing of borders, the avoidance of big gatherings, contactless transit, and quarantine are important methods. Multiple nations employ autonomous, digital, wireless, and other promising technologies to tackle this coronary pneumonia. This research examines a number of potential technologies, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, deep learning (DL), the Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing, and virtual reality (VR), in an effort to mitigate the danger of COVID-19. Due to their ability to transport food and medical supplies to a specific location, UAVs are currently being utilized as an innovative method to combat this illness. This research intends to examine the possibilities of UAVs in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic from several angles. UAVs offer intriguing options for delivering medical supplies, spraying disinfectants, broadcasting communications, conducting surveillance, inspecting, and screening patients for infection. This article examines the use of drones in healthcare as well as the advantages and disadvantages of strict adoption. Finally, challenges, opportunities, and future work are discussed to assist in adopting drone technology to tackle COVID-19-like diseases.

AB The four-wheel-steering mobile robot (FMR) is widely applied in the manufacturing industry, where accurate and stable lateral motion control is a prerequisite for ensuring manufacturing quality and efficiency. However, serious time-varying perturbations such as system uncertainties and external disturbances usually lead to unsatisfactory control performance. By designing constrained prediction and sliding mode mechanisms, a novel adaptive fractional robust finite time controller is proposed to achieve a system with required control accuracy and stability under serious time-varying perturbations. Compared with existing FMR solutions, the proposed method has the following attractive properties: (1) Without requiring the derivatives of time-varying perturbations, the proposed method utilizes a modified fractional super-twisting sliding mode switching law to guarantee the system robustness of dynamical tracking and disturbance rejection; (2) The differences between the nominal predicted states and the feedback ones can be well accommodated despite unmodeled dynamics and external disturbance; (3) By designing continuous control inputs, the "chattering phenomenon" in conventional control laws is carefully handled. Moreover, sufficient conditions are derived for the variable control gains to ensure the input-to-state practical stability and finite time convergence. Under harsh working conditions, two comparative experiments implemented on a real-life FRM are performed for demonstrative purposes.

AB Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is the task of matching current visual imagery from a camera to images stored in a reference map of the environment. While initial VPR systems used simple direct image methods or hand-crafted visual features, recent work has focused on learning more powerful visual features and further improving performance through either some form of sequential matcher / filter or a hierarchical matching process. In both cases the performance of the initial single-image based system is still far from perfect, putting significant pressure on the sequence matching or (in the case of hierarchical systems) pose refinement stages. In this paper we present a novel hybrid system that creates a high performance initial match hypothesis generator using short learnt sequential descriptors, which enable selective control sequential score aggregation using single image learnt descriptors. Sequential descriptors are generated using a temporal convolutional network dubbed SeqNet, encoding short image sequences using 1-D convolutions, which are then matched against the corresponding temporal descriptors from the reference dataset to provide an ordered list of place match hypotheses. We then perform selective sequential score aggregation using shortlisted single image learnt descriptors from a separate pipeline to produce an overall place match hypothesis. Comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate the proposed method outperforming recent state-of-the-art methods using the same amount of sequential information.

AB Maneuver recognition for unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) is a necessary technique for autonomous air combat. As a spatiotemporal alignment problem of multidimensional time series, the flight maneuver recognition is solved by a novel alignment measure, multi-strategy affine canonical time warping approach (MACTW) and its derivative form, which are extensions of affine canonical time warping (ACTW). MACTW makes several contributions: (1) it proposes multi-strategy success-history based adaptive differential evolution algorithm with linear population size reduction (MLSHADE) to accelerate the search of warping path of dynamic time warping (DTW); (2) it introduces affine strategy to address offset and scaling of canonical time warping (CTW), which is a combination of DTW and canonical correlation analysis (CCA); and (3) it extends ACTW based on MLSHADE to align multidimensional time series In addition, MLSHADE is a novel optimization technique that employs weighted mutation, inferior solution search, and eigen Gaussian walk strategies to improve the optimization efficiency. The experimental results on the CEC 2018 test suite illustrate the superior benefits of MLSHADE. UCAV flight maneuver recognition system which includes segmentation, preprocessing and recognition modules is modeled. The experimental results on UCR datasets and UCAV maneuver datasets including action units and long maneuver datasets illustrate the superiority of MACTW and its derivative form compared with other state-of-the-art alignment measures.

AB In this article, an infinite-horizon optimal regulation problem is considered for a control-affine nonlinear autonomous agent subject to input constraints in the presence of dynamic avoidance regions. A local model-based approximate dynamic programming method is implemented to approximate the value function in a local neighborhood of the agent. By performing local approximations, prior knowledge of the locations of avoidance regions is not required. To alleviate the a priori knowledge of the number of avoidance regions in the operating domain, an extension is provided that modifies the value function approximation. The developed feedback-based motion planning strategy guarantees uniformly ultimately bounded convergence of the approximated control policy to the optimal policy while also ensuring the agent remains outside avoidance regions. Simulations are included to demonstrate the preliminary development for a kinematic unicycle and generic nonlinear system. Results from three experiments are also presented to illustrate the performance of the developed method, where a quadcopter achieves approximate optimal regulation while avoiding three mobile obstacles. To demonstrate the developed method, known avoidance regions are used in the first experiment, unknown avoidance regions are used in the second experiment, and an unknown time-varying obstacle directed by a remote pilot is included in the third experiment.

AB Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer many advantages over traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) such as biological plausibility, fast information processing, and energy efficiency. Although SNNs have been used to solve a variety of control tasks using the Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) learning rule, existing solutions usually involve hard-coded network architectures solving specific tasks rather than solving different kinds of tasks generally. This results in neglecting one of the biggest advantages of ANNs, i.e., being general-purpose and easy-to-use due to their simple network architecture, which usually consists of an input layer, one or multiple hidden layers and an output layer. This paper addresses the problem by introducing an end-to-end learning approach of spiking neural networks constructed with one hidden layer and reward-modulated Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (R-STDP) synapses in an all-to-all fashion. We use the supervised reward-modulated Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity learning rule to train two different SNN-based sub-controllers to replicate a desired obstacle avoiding and goal approaching behavior, provided by pre-generated datasets. Together they make up a target-reaching controller, which is used to control a simulated mobile robot to reach a target area while avoiding obstacles in its path. We demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of our trained SNNs to achieve target reaching tasks in different unknown scenarios.

AB Cooperation between autonomous robot vehicles holds several promising advantages like robustness, adaptability, configurability, and scalability. Coordination between the different robots and the individual relative motion represent both the main challenges especially when dealing with formation control and maintenance. Cluster space control provides a simple concept for controlling multi-agent formation. In the classical approach, formation control is the unique task for the multi-agent system. In this paper, the development and application of a novel Behavioral Adaptive Fuzzy-based Cluster Space Control (BAFC) to non-holonomic robots is presented. By applying a fuzzy priority control approach, BAFC deals with two conflicting tasks: formation maintenance and target following. Using priority rules, the fuzzy approach is used to adapt the controller and therefore the behavior of the system, taking into accounts the errors in the formation states and the target following states. The control approach is easy to implement and has been implemented in this paper using SIMULINK real-time platform. The communication between the different agents and the controller is established through Wi-Fi link. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate the behavioral response where the robot performs the higher priority tasks first. This new approach shows a great performance with a lower control signal when benchmarked with previously known results in the literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Observations beneath Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica and
   implications for its retreat
SO NATURE GEOSCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID ICE-SHEET; AMUNDSEN SEA; STABILITY
AB Thinning ice in West Antarctica, resulting from acceleration in the flow of outlet glaciers, is at present contributing about 10% of the observed rise in global sea level(1). Pine Island Glacier in particular has shown nearly continuous acceleration(2,3) and thinning(4,5), throughout the short observational record. The floating ice shelf that forms where the glacier reaches the coast has been thinning rapidly(6), driven by changes in ocean heat transport beneath it. As a result, the line that separates grounded and floating ice has retreated inland(7). These events have been postulated as the cause for the inland thinning and acceleration(8,9). Here we report evidence gathered by an autonomous underwater vehicle operating beneath the ice shelf that Pine Island Glacier was recently grounded on a transverse ridge in the sea floor. Warm sea water now flows through a widening gap above the submarine ridge, rapidly melting the thick ice of the newly formed upstream half of the ice shelf. The present evolution of Pine Island Glacier is thus part of a longer-term trend that has moved the downstream limit of grounded ice inland by 30 km, into water that is 300 m deeper than over the ridge crest. The pace and ultimate extent of such potentially unstable retreat(10) are central to the debate over the possibility of widespread ice-sheet collapse triggered by climate change(11,12).

DT Article
DE Driver's attention prediction; Attention mechanism; Traffic driving;
   Temporal and spatial information
AB The traffic driving scenario is dynamically varying and experienced drivers can allocate visual attention effectively in brief time intervals, focusing on prominent targets and areas in advance, thus ensuring safe driving. Therefore, it is significant to research the behavior of driver's visual attention allocation in the development of driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. Recently, inspired by top-down and bottom-up attention mechanisms, most visual attention models based on neural networks have been proposed. However, these models tend to yield highly distributed predictions for the specific driving scenario, and have relatively low prediction accuracy, making them unfeasible for being used in practice. Hence, to overcome these challenges, we propose a driver's visual attention model (DVAM) built on the encoder-decoder architecture with the utilization of the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the recurrent neural networks (RNN). Specifically, the model leverages the temporal and spatial dimension information to better mimic realistic dynamic driving, and extract abundant feature information, thus ensuring that the final predictions are authentic and effective. Then, extensive experiments demonstrate that our suggested DVAM achieves better robustness and precision in predicting driver attention to areas or targets compared to state-of-the-art methods on the DR(eye)VE dataset. Finally, our model is deployed on the TDV dataset to validate its generalization capabilities, which prove the potential for field adaptation.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The high-pressure environment of deep-sea challenges the miniaturization of underwater robots due to the assembly of antihydropressure devices for protecting the electromagnetic motor. Here, inspired by the motion principle of jellyfish, a novel piezoelectric pulsed-jet actuator (PJA) was proposed as the power source. Six PJAs were arranged crosswise to form an antihydropressure miniature cross-shaped underwater robot (CSUR) with dimensions of f10.9 x 6.3 cm(3). The numerical simulation method was adopted to analyze the propulsion mechanism, optimize the structure, and find the optimal frequency. A robot prototype was fabricated, and its motion performances were tested. The CSUR achieved floating, sinking, and hovering motions in the vertical direction and linear, rotary, and turning motions in the horizontal direction. The maximum linear velocity reached up to 47.8 mm/s (0.43 BL/s). The robot could move in a high-pressure environment of 10 MPa, and the average velocity deviations under different water pressures were less than 10%. Besides, the CSUR could move along an S-shaped path to navigate around obstacles. The proposed robot performed merits of miniature structure, good adaptability of a high-pressure environment, high agility, and maneuverability. It is potential for the CSUR to be applied in exploring, mapping, and sampling narrow areas of the deep sea.

AB In road networks, mobile users (including vehicles and pedestrians) need to know the proximity relationship with other users in real time, referred to as the problem of proximity detection which is very significant for autonomous driving. However, due to limited computing and storage resources of mobile users and real-time changes of road network status, it becomes a difficult task to calculate and update the proximity relationship between users in real time. Therefore, in this paper, we first propose a computation offloading scheme and a dynamic road network state update model for proximity detection in dynamic road networks based on Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), and formulate the latency optimization problem for proximity detection in the dynamic road network as a nonlinear optimization problem. Then we use the Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) algorithm to solve the latency optimization problem. In addition, to reduce the running time, we also use the deep reinforcement learning approach, i.e., the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, to address the latency optimization problem. Simulation results show that, compared with the SLSQP algorithm, the DDPG algorithm can effectively and efficiently reduce the computational time of the optimal latency each time by continuously adjusting the task allocation strategy, and the computational time of the DDPG algorithm is two orders of magnitude lower than the SLSQP algorithm.

AB The recent advances in precision agriculture are due to the emergence of modern robotics systems. For instance, unmanned aerial systems (UASs) give new possibilities that advance the solution of existing problems in this area in many different aspects. The reason is due to these platforms' ability to perform activities at varying levels of complexity. Therefore, this research presents a multiple-cooperative robot solution for UAS and unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) systems for their joint inspection of olive grove inspect traps. This work evaluated the UAS and UGV vision-based navigation based on a yellow fly trap fixed in the trees to provide visual position data using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithms. The experimental setup evaluated the fuzzy control algorithm applied to the UAS to make it reach the trap efficiently. Experimental tests were conducted in a realistic simulation environment using a robot operating system (ROS) and CoppeliaSim platforms to verify the methodology's performance, and all tests considered specific real-world environmental conditions. A search and landing algorithm based on augmented reality tag (AR-Tag) visual processing was evaluated to allow for the return and landing of the UAS to the UGV base. The outcomes obtained in this work demonstrate the robustness and feasibility of the multiple-cooperative robot architecture for UGVs and UASs applied in the olive inspection scenario.

AB Human activities are the principal contributors to oil pollution in marine ecosystems, thereby causing severe ecological damage. The high volume of vessel traffic operating in these areas contributes to the rapid contamination of the marine ecosystem, leading to frequent oil spill events, particularly near ports where congestion is prevalent. Addressing this issue today necessitates the involvement of numerous skilled personnel committed to the task. This team undertakes the repetitive and tedious work of surveying the area, detecting spills, and employing various techniques to address each oil slick. The emergence of Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) technology has introduced a promising alternative capable of alleviating the process of continuous monitoring and cleaning operations in proximal shoreline areas. This paper addresses the problem of USV cleaning operations near the port. The proposed method synthesizes a hierarchical architecture that integrates traditional global path planning for multi-destination oil spills, along with coverage path planning based on reinforcement learning, to adapt to dynamically changing oil spills. This combined architecture results in a comprehensive solution, allowing navigation within the port's vicinity to address each occurrence of oil pollution. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we conducted an elaborate simulation designed to replicate port activities. The findings of this paper indicate a significant reduction in pollution levels due to USV operation and underscore the ability to acquire complex policies for dynamic coverage planning through the use of a reinforcement learning framework.

AB Navigation in varied and dynamic indoor environments remains a complex task for autonomous mobile platforms. Especially when conditions worsen, typical sensor modalities may fail to operate optimally and subsequently provide inapt input for safe navigation control. In this study, we present an approach for the navigation of a dynamic indoor environment with a mobile platform with a single or several sonar sensors using a layered control system. These sensors can operate in conditions such as rain, fog, dust, or dirt. The different control layers, such as collision avoidance and corridor following behavior, are activated based on acoustic flow queues in the fusion of the sonar images. The novelty of this work is allowing these sensors to be freely positioned on the mobile platform and providing the framework for designing the optimal navigational outcome based on a zoning system around the mobile platform. Presented in this paper is the acoustic flow model used, as well as the design of the layered controller. Next to validation in simulation, an implementation is presented and validated in a real office environment using a real mobile platform with one, two, or three sonar sensors in real time with 2D navigation. Multiple sensor layouts were validated in both the simulation and real experiments to demonstrate that the modular approach for the controller and sensor fusion works optimally. The results of this work show stable and safe navigation of indoor environments with dynamic objects.

AB With the popularization of active safety systems, autonomous driving, and Steer-by-Wire (SBW) technology, steering wheel angle sensors (SAS) have begun to play a key role in these systems. It is responsible for measuring the angle and angular velocity of the steering wheel and sending these data via a bus to the cooperating devices. For this reason, automakers are making increasingly demanding requirements that are difficult for sensor suppliers to meet. These requirements describe the metrological properties of the sensor, but their influence on the quality of car control is not clear. It is impossible to directly determine whether systems that use these sensors work properly and efficiently. Therefore, the question that needs to be asked is whether and to what extent sensor parameters such as accuracy and data transmission period affect the Steer-by-Wire car's trajectory and behavior during actual driving? For this purpose, a test bench was built based on the CarMaker and CANoe software using virtual test drives. It was used to perform a series of tests for different combinations of sensor accuracies and CAN frame periods, based on which errors were determined, and their influence on the number of knocked down cones during slalom performance.

AB Practical time-varying formation tracking problems for second-order nonlinear multiagent systems with multiple leaders are investigated using adaptive neural networks (NNs), where the time-varying formation tracking error caused by time-varying external disturbances can be arbitrarily small. Different from the previous work, there exists a predefined time-varying formation formed by the states of the followers and the formation tracks the convex combination of the states of the leaders with unknown control inputs. Besides, the dynamics of each agent has both matched/mismatched heterogeneous nonlinearities and disturbances simultaneously. First, a practical time-varying formation tracking protocol using adaptive NNs is proposed, which is constructed using only local neighboring information. The proposed control protocol can process not only the matched/mismatched heterogeneous nonlinearities and disturbances, but also the unknown control inputs of the leaders. Second, an algorithm with three steps is introduced to design the practical formation tracking protocol, where the parameters of the protocol are determined, and the practical time-varying formation tracking feasibility condition is given. Third, the stability of the closed-loop multiagent system is proven by using the Lyapunov theory. Finally, a simulation example is showed to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.

AB The vertical lift module is an automated storage and retrieval system widely used in warehouses. The performance of a warehouse with vertical lift modules is highly correlated with the efficiency of the order picking. Order batching, namely regrouping customers' orders into batches to be collected from the module, constitutes a critical decision impacting the picking efficiency. In this paper, we provide optimization models for order batching, with the objective of minimizing total completion time, that is, the time required to collect a given set of customers' orders. We first consider the case of one vertical lift module and then extend our approach to study a warehouse with several modules. We use real data from two companies operating in different sectors in order to test and validate our models. Numerical experiments show that our models perform much better than the batching method currently used by these companies. For complex cases that cannot be solved within a reasonable timeframe with Cplex, we develop a metaheuristic approach, which generally yields very good solutions in less than one minute. This paper investigates problems that are firmly grounded in practice. Our batching models and metaheuristic approach have been implemented in practice and are currently used by some companies.

TI Obstacle avoidance USV in multi-static obstacle environments based on a

DE USV; TD3; obstacle avoidance; random walk policy
AB Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are intelligent platforms for unmanned surface navigation based on artificial intelligence, motion control, environmental awareness, and other professional technologies. Obstacle avoidance is an important part of its autonomous navigation. Although the USV works in the water environment (e.g. monitoring and tracking, search and rescue scenarios), the dynamic and complex operating environment makes the traditional methods not suitable for solving the obstacle avoidance problem of the USV. In this paper, to address the issue of poor convergence of the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in an unstructured environment and wave current interference, random walk policy is proposed to deposit the pre-exploration policy of the algorithm into the experience pool to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm and thus achieve USV obstacle avoidance, which can achieve collision-free navigation from any start point to a given end point in a dynamic and complex environment without offline trajectory and track point generation. We design a pre-exploration policy for the environment and a virtual simulation environment for training and testing the algorithm and give the reward function and training method. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithm is more manageable to converge than the original algorithm and can perform better in complex environments in terms of obstacle avoidance behavior, reflecting the algorithm's feasibility and effectiveness.

AB Due to the harsh marine environment, the communication cost of multi-ship formation is expensive, but it is often ignored in the existing research. On this basis, this paper proposes a novel distributed anti-windup neural network (NN)-sliding mode formation controller of multi-ships with minimum cost. Firstly, distributed control is applied to devise the formation controller of multi-ships because it is a promising solution for the problem of single point failure. Secondly, the Dijkstra algorithm is introduced to optimize the communication topology, and then an optimized communication topology with minimum cost is used in the distributed formation controller design. Thirdly, to alleviate the influence of input saturation, an anti-windup mechanism is devised by combining an auxiliary design system with sliding mode control and radial basis function neural network method; and then a novel distributed anti-windup neural network-sliding mode formation controller of multi-ships is obtained, which can also handle the problem of nonlinearity, model uncertainty, and time-varying disturbances of ship motion. On the strength of Lyapunov theory, the closed-loop signals are proved to be stable. Multiple comparative simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed distributed formation controller. & COPY; 2023 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The paper presents a mapping study of safety and cybersecurity assessment techniques used in critical industries such as nuclear power plants, the oil and gas sector, autonomous vehicles, railways, etc., with particular emphasis on instrumentation and control systems (I & C). Modern I & Cs are complex electronic systems comprising thousands of components, therefore their reliability and safety when employed in critical application domains are challenging. With the development and integration of Industry 4.0 technologies such systems become more open for communication and flexible usage due to gradual interconnection with public networks and the Internet, but new cybersecurity and safety challenges are introduced. This paper states research questions and provides analysis results of recent relevant sources. Initially, 320 records (acquired between 2018 and 2022 inclusive) were identified. Later on, 187 studies were processed to check eligibility criteria. Overall, this mapping study includes 49 papers, after examining the pre-defined criteria and guidelines. The results of the analysis performed allow to systemize techniques being utilized in practice right now, as well as to identify trends of further techniques development. In fact, although the techniques used are not novel and most of them have been used for decades, our study shows that there are still some new trends in this field. In particular, the unified safety and cybersecurity assessment technique is a promising research direction, worth further investigation.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Most existing traffic sign detection models suffer from high computational complexity and superior performance but cannot be deployed on edge devices with limited computational capacity, which cannot meet the direct needs of autonomous vehicles for detection model performance and efficiency. To address the above concerns, this paper proposes an improved SEDG-Yolov5 traffic sign detection method based on knowledge distillation. Firstly, the Slicing Aided Hyper Inference method is used as a local offline data augmentation method for the model training. Secondly, to solve the problems of high-dimensional feature information loss and high model complexity, the inverted residual structure ESGBlock with a fused attention mechanism is proposed, and a lightweight feature extraction backbone network is constructed based on it, while we introduce the GSConv in the feature fusion layer to reduce the computational complexity of the model further. Eventually, an improved response-based objectness scaled knowledge distillation method is proposed to retrain the traffic sign detection model to compensate for the degradation of detection accuracy due to light-weighting. Extensive experiments on two challenging traffic sign datasets show that our proposed method has a good balance on detection precision and detection speed with 2.77M parametric quantities. Furthermore, the inference speed of our method achieves 370 FPS with TensorRT and 35.6 FPS with ONNX at FP16-precision, which satisfies the requirements for real-time sign detection and edge deployment.

AB Industry 4.0 represents a new industrial paradigm ignited by disruptive technologies that can transform manufacturing into a cyber-physical system that integrates products, people and processes. However, there is little guidance concerning how to implement and integrate Industry 4.0 technologies by existing lean manufacturing (LM) systems. We select autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) and internet of things (IoT) to develop an action plan that helps managers integrate Industry 4.0 technologies into their manufacturing systems and achieve lean automation. We conducted a case study of a large manufacturing company that introduced AGVs and IoT to automate its lean operations. We used socio-technical systems (STSs) design logic to integrate the two distinct domains (lean and automation) into an action plan that successfully meets six lean automation objectives. The findings demonstrate that AGVs implementation should include three phases: design, integration and continuous improvement. The lean automation objectives are: cost, reusability, reliability, simplicity, compactness, fit, engage and culture. The lean automation plan successfully manages the interactions and interplay between social factors (people and culture), technical factors (infrastructure and technology) and operational factors (routines and processes). The lean automation plan has significant managerial implications helping companies integrate lean philosophy, which is people-centric, with Industry 4.0 technologies, which promote efficiency via automation.

AB This paper proposes a novel dynamic path planning and path following control method for collision avoidance, which works based on an improved piecewise affine tire model. The main contribution of this work is the design of a dynamic path planning method based on model predictive control, where it replans a maneuverable path to avoid moving obstacle in real time. A hierarchical control framework contains a high-level path replanning model predictive control and a low-level path following model predictive control. A collision avoidance cost function in the high hierarchies was designed to calculate the relative dynamic distance, which copes with the sudden obstacle. Moreover, the replanning path is the optimized output according to reference trajectory, obstacle, and handling stability. The control objective of the low hierarchies is to accurately track the replanning path, especially for the increased nonlinearity of large tire sideslip angle. For this reason, an improved piecewise affine tire model is designed and used for model predictive control to improve the path following performance and reduce calculated burden. The main improvement of the piecewise affine tire model is that the varied lateral stiffness coefficients adapt to the change of the tire sideslip angle in different tire regions. Based on the CarSim and Simulink platform, the dynamic path planning and path following simulations are designed to test the proposed method. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This article asks how cycling, a sustainable form of urban mobility, is discussed in the context of smart cities and the Internet of Things in European Commission (EC) policy documents, and how this compares to discussions around cars. Sustainable forms of transport, such as cycling, are a key issue for cities across the globe, including smart cities, while transport is increasingly becoming part of the Internet of Things (IoT). This article contributes to an understanding of how cars and bicycles are discussed in this context. To do so, 39 relevant EC policy documents (2014-2018) were identified and examined through keyword searches and rigorous document analysis. The results show how the vast majority of policy discussions in this area revolve around cars (including autonomous cars and smart vehicles), while cycling is hardly considered, with a strong affinity between IoT and cars. In addition, recent EC policy debates take place more around IoT than around Smart Cities, while sustainability is not considered much in the IoT context. The conclusion highlights the implications of sustainable urban modes of transport such as cycling being absent from IoT/smart debates, including lack of policy visibility and funding opportunities, underlining the significance of this research, and it also makes policy suggestions for addressing these issues and for future research.

DT Article

ID NETWORKS; SYSTEMS
AB Neighbor discovery is a significant communication primitive for adjacent unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to construct a flying ad hoc network (FANET). The multi-channel nature of FANETs makes channel hopping (CH) a feasible rendezvous method for UAVs to hop to the same available channel simultaneously and initiate a connection. However, due to the intrinsic uncoordinated constraints of dispersed UAVs (e.g., lack of clock synchronization, heterogeneous local channels, symmetric roles, and oblivious identifiers), it is challenging to design a performant CH algorithm that can achieve fast neighbor discovery in dynamic FANETs. In this paper, we present a fully uncoordinated matrix-based CH algorithm termed ABIO, which consists of one fixed Anchor column and several variable Binary (i.e., I/O-bit) extended columns in each CH period. The deterministic overlaps as well as the co-primality property of channel numbers among different kinds of columns provide the rendezvous guarantee. Furthermore, for the case with frequently varying channel status, we present a probability-based dynamic discovery (PDD) algorithm. By virtue of the cumulative probability estimation and selection of the qualified channels, the PDD algorithm can achieve timely rendezvous in the unstable environment with high probability. We rigorously analyze the theoretical neighbor discovery latency. We also validate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithms through extensive simulations. Evaluation results demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms in both stable and unstable communication environments.

TI Even good bots fight: The case of Wikipedia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB In recent years, there has been a huge increase in the number of bots online, varying from Web crawlers for search engines, to chatbots for online customer service, spambots on social media, and content-editing bots in online collaboration communities. The online world has turned into an ecosystem of bots. However, our knowledge of how these automated agents are interacting with each other is rather poor. Bots are predictable automatons that do not have the capacity for emotions, meaning-making, creativity, and sociality and it is hence natural to expect interactions between bots to be relatively predictable and uneventful. In this article, we analyze the interactions between bots that edit articles on Wikipedia. We track the extent to which bots undid each other's edits over the period 2001-2010, model how pairs of bots interact over time, and identify different types of interaction trajectories. We find that, although Wikipedia bots are intended to support the encyclopedia, they often undo each other's edits and these sterile "fights" may sometimes continue for years. Unlike humans on Wikipedia, bots' interactions tend to occur over longer periods of time and to be more reciprocated. Yet, just like humans, bots in different cultural environments may behave differently. Our research suggests that even relatively "dumb" bots may give rise to complex interactions, and this carries important implications for Artificial Intelligence research. Understanding what affects bot-bot interactions is crucial for managing social media well, providing adequate cyber-security, and designing well functioning autonomous vehicles.

AB The Moresby Seamount detachment in the Woodlark Basin (east of Papua New Guinea) is arguably the best exposed active detachment fault in the world. We present the results of a high-resolution autonomous underwater vehicle survey of bathymetry, bottom water temperature, and turbidity. In combination with dredging and existing drillhole data, a synthesis of the tectonic geomorphology, kinematics, and mechanics of the detachment is provided. The detachment surface, which has a 30 northward dip and similar to 8 km post-Pliocene displacement, is well preserved. Two major smooth areas are tectonically created, and megascopic (kilometer scale) slickensides indicate downdip direction of movement. The detachment is transected by a major sinistral strike-slip fault, suggesting deformation partitioning in the detachment zone in response to the 500 k.y. change in plate kinematics. The mainly gabbroic protoliths and cataclasites from the fault show pervasive syntectonic alteration, leading to large increases in abundance of quartz and, more important, calcite. Resulting quartz-rich and calcite-rich mylonites play a crucial role, as weak fault rocks and ductile microstructures point to detachment operation at low differential stress. A kilometer-sized anomaly in bottom water temperature and turbidity is found at the downdip end of the detachment zone, indicating that it hosts an active hydrothermal system, probably fed by overpressured fluids from a deep crustal source.

AB The ultra-short baseline (USBL) positioning system has been widely used for autonomous and remotely operated vehicle (ARV) positioning in marine resource surveying and ocean engineering fields due to its flexible installation and portable operation. Errors related to the sound speed are a critical factor limiting the positioning performance. The conventional strategy adopts a fixed sound velocity profile (SVP) to correct the spatial variation, especially in the vertical direction. However, SVP is actually time-varying, and ignoring this kind of variation will lead to a worse estimation of ARVs'coordinates. In this contribution, we propose a two-step sound speed correction method, where, firstly, the deviation due to the acoustic ray bending effect is corrected by the depth-based ray-tracing policy with the fixed SVP. Then, the temporal variation of SVP is considered, and the fixed SVP is adaptively adjusted according to the in situ sound velocity (SV) measurements provided by the conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sensor equipped at the ARV. The proposed method is verified by semi-physical simulation and sea-trail dataset in the South China Sea. When compared to the fixed-SVP method, average positioning accuracy with the resilient SVP be improved by 8%, 21%, and 26% in the east, north, and up directions, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently improve the adaptability of sound speed observations and deliver better performance in USBL real-time positioning.

AB Mapping and localization using surface features is prone to failure due to environment changes such as inclement weather. Recently, Localizing Ground Penetrating Radar (LGPR) has been proposed as an alternative means of localizing using underground features that are stable over time and less affected by surface conditions. However, due to the lack of commercially available LGPR sensors, the wider research community has been largely unable to replicate this work or build new and innovative solutions. We present GROUNDED, an open dataset of LGPR scans collected in a variety of environments and weather conditions. By labeling these data with ground truth localization from an RTK-GPS/Inertial Navigation System, and carefully calibrating and time-synchronizing the radar scans with ground truth positions, camera imagery, and lidar data, we enable researchers to build novel localization solutions that are resilient to changing surface conditions. We include 108 individual runs totaling 450 km of driving with LGPR, GPS, odometry, camera, and lidar measurements. We also present two new evaluation benchmarks for 1) localizing in weather and 2) multi-lane localization, to enable comparisons of future work supported by the dataset. Additionally, we present a first application of the new dataset in the form of LGPRNet: an inception-based CNN architecture for learning localization that is resilient to changing weather conditions. The dataset can be accessed at http://lgprdata.com.

AB Magnetically coupled resonant wireless power transmission technology (WPT) based on high-temperature superconducting (HTS) coils has gained wide popularity due to its low impedance and high-quality factor Q value characteristics. This technology has greatly improved the energy transfer performance of wireless power transmission (WPT) systems. However, practical applications of conventional WPT, such as wireless charging of autonomous underwater vehicles at mooring points, often encounter spatial misalignment issues due to the complex ocean environment and ocean currents. Nonetheless, few studies have investigated the spatial misalignment of HTS WPT systems, particularly the angular misalignment. This paper presents a solution to address this problem by constructing magnetically coupled resonant wireless energy transmission systems based on HTS coils and copper coils. The study analyzes the relationship between the transmission efficiency of the WPT system and the received power of the load with respect to the spatial orientation of the coil. The performance of the superconducting coil and copper coil WPT systems is compared. The experimental results demonstrate that, under the same spatially misaligned conditions, the WPT system using HTS coils can significantly improve the transmission efficiency and load power compared to the conventional copper WPT system. Moreover, simultaneous adjustment of the lateral misalignment distance and different orientation deflection angles can improve the transmission efficiency and smooth load output power of the high-temperature superconducting WPT system.

AB Data transmission of familiar sensor data sources like video and audio is well explored. However, data acquired from the sensor emitting voluminous data cannot easily be transmitted due to a lack of bandwidth, which causes bottlenecks in the transmission. One valuable sensor in autonomous vehicles is light detection and ranging (LiDAR). In this article, a novel framework has been proposed, which is capable of efficiently streaming LiDAR data over the Internet. The proposed framework consists of various subsystems that handle data in multiple stages. On the sender side, the stages include data acquisition from the sensor, compression, encryption, and encoding of data, followed by transmission of encoded data over the Internet. On the receiver side, decoding, decryption, decompression, and data visualization are performed. The end-to-end framework runs over the robot operating system (ROS) platform. The data is acquired via ROS topics on the sender side and again published on ROS topics from the browser on the receiver side. This allows the users to apply any processing algorithm online with tolerable latency. The challenge of Clock Synchronization was addressed during the testing process. A detailed analysis to validate the quality of decompressed data has also been performed for which cloud distance was used as a metric. The implemented model was able to perform data transmission with an average latency of 160.62 ms for low-resolution compression mode.

AB The flexibility offered by reconfigurable wireless networks, provide new opportunities for various applications such as online AR/VR gaming, high-quality video streaming and autonomous vehicles, that desire high-bandwidth, reliable and low-latency communications. These applications come with very stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and increase the burden over mobile networks. Currently, there is a huge spectrum scarcity due to the massive data explosion and this problem can be solved by helps of Reconfigurable Wireless Networks (RWNs) where nodes have reconfiguration and perception capabilities. Therefore, a necessity of AI-assisted algorithms for resource block allocation is observed. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose an actor-critic learning-based scheduler for allocating resource blocks in a RWN. Various traffic types with different QoS levels are assigned to our agents to provide more realistic results. We also include mobility in our simulations to increase the dynamicity of networks. The proposed model is compared with another actor-critic model and with other traditional schedulers; proportional fair (PF) and Channel and QoS Aware (CQA) techniques. The proposed models are evaluated by considering the delay experienced by user equipment (UEs), successful transmissions and head-of-the-line delays. The results show that the proposed model noticeably outperforms other techniques in different aspects.

AB Business-to-consumer platforms (e.g., Tmall.com and JD.com) demand the efficient retrieval handling of storage systems. The amount of a certain item to be retrieved is often less than a pallet load; thus, dynamically re-assigning the storage locations of nonempty pallets after each retrieval may improve retrieval operational efficiency. We call such a dynamic decision on the location for the returned pallets relocation. We treat the relocation of each non-empty pallet as an operational decision rather than a tactical decision. Due to its dynamic nature, we formulate relocation as a dynamic program that minimizes the total crane traveYl time. To overcome the computational curse of dimensionality, we propose several heuristic relocation policies that are inspired by conventional storage location assignment policies. Based on the findings from preliminary numerical experiments, we design an approximate dynamic programming-based relocation policy that achieves a greater operational efficiency improvement than the aforementioned heuristics. Through a more extensive set of numerical experiments, we find that random relocation is generally no better than no relocation, and that closest-open relocation is effective across different rack shapes, crane velocity configurations, and retrieval characteristics. Our experiments also show that the approximate dynamic programming-based relocation policy consistently yields further improvement over closest-open relocation, at the expense of higher (but still affordable) computational complexity.

AB It is great significant for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to obtain its position in real time. Great developments in low-cost inertial navigation system (INS) have been made due to outstanding merits in micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) technologies. The navigation errors of the MEMS grade inertial measurement unit (IMU) increase greatly over time because of the complex and changeable marine environment. The measurement noise plays an important role in state estimation with high accuracy. However, the accuracy of measurement noise will be degraded due to larger MEMS sensors' errors. To solve the problem above, a novel algorithm which fuses variational Bayesians into nonlinear filtering is proposed. Firstly, the position in-formation is augmented to the measurement vector. The measurement functions are divided into linear and nonlinear. Secondly, the variational Bayesian (VB) method is used to estimate the probability density function of the state vector, predicted error covariance matrix and measure-ment noise matrix. In the case of calculating the second order moment estimation, the cubature transformation is used to determine nonlinear integral equations, and the linear integral equa-tions are derived by the Kalman filter. Finally, the accurate state vector and error covariance matrix are obtained. The real underwater experiments are performed and experiment results show that the proposed algorithm has better performance in aspect of positioning accuracy of AUV and robustness than the traditional algorithms.

DE CIREN; abdomen injuries; seat belt
AB Objective The objective is to report sex-related variation in 3-point belt-related abdominal injuries in Crash Injury Research Engineering Network (CIREN) cases. Methods A query of CIREN cases was made for those with the highest ranked Collision Deformation Classification (CDC) to the front plane, a principal direction of force (PDOF) +/- 20 degrees from 0 degrees, and Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) 2+ abdomen injuries attributed to the seat belt. Patterns of injury were categorized as above the crest of the ilium, injuries below the crest of the ilium, and injuries above and below the ilium. This was done in the context of autonomous vehicle occupant kinematics testing results. Twelve 5th and 95th percentile 3-point belt-restrained postmortem human subjects were subjects; test speeds and recline angles varied. Abdomen injuries were anticipated; none were observed. Results Thirty-five occupants with belt-related abdominal injuries were identified. Seventeen case occupants sustained an injury only within the pelvic contents: 5 women and 12 men. Nine of the 17 were at or above the 81st percentile for height, 13 were between the 62nd and 80th percentile for height, and 4 were less than the 50th percentile for height. Conclusions The stature component of the body mass index (BMI) appears to be a plausible candidate for an independent variable that is a contributing factor explaining the incidence of pelvic contents injuries when a 3-point belt-restrained occupant is involved in a frontal impact.

AB The lane keeping assistance system, a representative advanced driver assistance system, comprises a shared control that cooperates with the driver to achieve a common goal. The steering experience of the driver may vary significantly depending on the auto-steering control strategy of the system. In this study, we examined the driving experience with various steering control strategies. Nine control strategies (three torque amounts x three deviations in starting control) were established as prototypes. Eighteen drivers participated in the evaluation of each strategy in a highway environment on a driving simulator. A two-way repeated measure ANOVA was used to assess the effects of the system. Both the objective measures (standard deviation of lane position, steering reversal rate, and root mean square of lateral speed) and subjective measures (pleasure and arousal of emotion, trust, disturbance, and satisfaction) were evaluated and analyzed. The results showed that a torque amount of 3 Nm evoked feelings of high disturbance and negative emotional responses. A deviation in starting control (DEV) of 0.80 m yielded unstable lane keeping performances and evoked negative effects on pleasure, trust, and satisfaction. A regression model for the driver satisfaction recommended a torque of 2.32 Nm and a DEV of 0.27 m as the optimal design parameters. This proposed strategy is expected to improve the experience design of lateral semi-autonomous vehicles.

AB Autonomous tracking of suspicious unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by legitimate monitoring UAVs (or monitors) can be crucial to public safety and security. It is non-trivial to optimize the trajectory of a monitor while conceiving its monitoring intention, due to typically non-convex propulsion and thrust power functions. This article presents a novel framework to jointly optimize the propulsion and thrust powers, as well as the 3D trajectory of a solar-powered monitor which conducts covert, video-based, UAV-on-UAV tracking and surveillance. A multi-objective problem is formulated to minimize the energy consumption of the monitor and maximize a weighted sum of distance keeping and altitude changing, which measures the disguising of the monitor. Based on the practical power models of the UAV propulsion, thrust and hovering, and the model of the harvested solar power, the problem is non-convex and intangible for existing solvers. We convexify the propulsion power by variable substitution, and linearize the solar power. With successive convex approximation, the resultant problem is then transformed with tightened constraints and efficiently solved by the proximal difference-of-convex algorithm with extrapolation in polynomial time. The proposed scheme can be also applied online. Extensive simulations corroborate the merits of the scheme, as compared to baseline schemes with partial or no disguising.

AB Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have facilitated high-end applications, including holistic scene understanding (HSU), in which many tasks run in parallel with the same visual input. Following this trend, various methods have been proposed to use DNNs to perform multiple vision tasks. However, these methods are task-specific and less effective when considering multiple HSU tasks. End-to-end demonstrations of adversarial examples, which generate one-to-many heterogeneous adversarial examples in parallel from the same input, are scarce. Additionally, one-to-many mapping of adversarial examples for HSU usually requires joint representation learning and flexible constraints on magnitude, which can render the prevalent attack methods ineffective. In this paper, we propose PSAT-GAN, an end-to-end framework that follows the pipeline of HSU. It is based on a mixture of generative models and an adversarial classifier that employs partial weight sharing to learn a one-to-many mapping of adversarial examples in parallel, each of which is effective for its corresponding task in HSU attacks. PSAT-GAN is further enhanced by applying novel adversarial and soft-constraint losses to generate effective perturbations and avoid studying transferability. Experimental results indicate that our method is efficient in generating both universal and image-dependent adversarial examples to fool HSU tasks under either targeted or non-targeted settings.

AB We demonstrate the use of a road-capable piezoelectric harvester (RCPH) with improved maintenance and power-generation characteristics. The RCPH obtained its ingress and moisture protection system rating (IP 66) through a new housing system used to evaluate its waterproof performance. Finite element simulations were performed to identify the proper depth (1, 3, or 5 cm) under an actual road for its placement to achieve increased output power. The highest von Mises stress value was measured by the 1 cm landfilled module (1LFM). The RCPH was installed under a test road and was tested with the use of the exposed and landfilled method to compare output power levels. Correspondingly, the output voltage and output power of the 1LFM were higher the exposed module. When a minivan drove over the 1LFM at 90 km/h, an output voltage of 18 V-max and an output power of 1150 mW(max) (power density: 1.15 mW/cm(2)) were measured at a load resistance level of 910 Omega. In a test road environment, the electrical energy generated by the 1LFM was sufficient to illuminate four delineators for 40 s. This system could be used on actual roads by connecting the piezoelectric modules to an emergency lighting that can be powered by the electricity generated by the module.

AB Fish can sense their surrounding environment by their lateral line system (LLS). In order to understand the extent to which information can be derived via LLS and to improve the adaptive ability of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), a novel strategy is presented, which directly uses the information of the flow field to distinguish the object obstacle. The flow fields around different targets are obtained by the numerical method, and the pressure signal on the virtual lateral line is studied based on the chaos theory and fast Fourier transform (FFT). The compounded parametric features, including the chaotic features (CF) and the power spectrum density (PSD), which is named CF-PSD, are used to recognize the kinds of obstacles. During the research of CF, the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), saturated correlation dimension (SCD), and Kolmogorov entropy (KE) are taken into account, and PSD features include the number, amplitude, and position of wave crests. A two-step support vector machine (SVM) is built and used to classify the shapes and incidence angles based on the CF-PSD. It is demonstrated that the flow fields around triangular and square targets are chaotic systems, and the new findings indicate that the object obstacle can be recognized directly based on the information of the flow field, and the consideration of a parametric feature extraction method (CF-PSD) results in considerably higher classification success.

AB To model the optimal control problem of path planning for unmanned ground systems (UGSs), the motion and boundary constraints are described first by using the mathematical model proposed in this paper, and the time-energy performance indicators are described by the Bolza cost function. Since the traditional symplectic algorithm hardly solves the problem with uncertain time, the pseudospectral method, almost the only way to solve the optimal control problem of path planning while the rapid path planning is difficult to achieve, is prone to the phenomenon named "Curse of Dimensionality" with increasing the number of discrete points. The symplectic pseudospectral method for improving the efficiency and the precision of the calculation, based on the symplectic theory, third kind of generation function and pseudospectral method is first proposed in this paper. Furthermore, the one-sided approximation is designed, and the one-sided symplectic pseudospectral (OSSP) algorithm is established to solve the model introduced in this paper. Finally, the experiments are conducted using the OSSP method and the pseudospectral method, respectively, to verify the feasibility and the efficiency of the method. The results show that the OSSP is the method with the highest accuracy, efficiency, and good stability to solve the optimal control problem of path planning for UGS, and it has great maneuverability and feasibility for practical application.

SO MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL

DT Article
ID COMMUNICATION; CHANNELS
AB An underwater acoustic modem-capable of point-to-point transmission of data at high bit rates is presented in this-article. The high data-rate acoustic uplink operates between 262 kHz and 375 kHz in three sub-bands. The lower sub-band (262.5 kHz to 337.5 kHz) carries the binary information. The middle sub-band (347-373 kHz) is for detection purposes. The higher sub-band carries a narrow-band, 375-kHz tone designed to improve the Doppler-tracking capability of the high bit-rate acoustic uplink. The acoustic uplink uses I phase-modulated symbols of adjustable bandwidth (25 kHz, 50 kHz or 75 kHz). The peak data rate is 87,768 bits-per-second at a maximum range of 180 m using an omni-directional source and an omni-directional receiver. The source level required,to achieve this range is 185.8 dB re 1 mu Pa at 1 m. This modem is also equipped-with an acoustic downlink designed for command-and-control in a lower frequency band (62-76 kHz) and at a lower data rate. The focus of this paper is on the high bit-rate uplink. A series of experimental results demonstrate that this underwater acoustic modem can operate reliably in difficult environments such As ports and very shallow waters. High-resolution sonar images are transmitted in real-time from various types of autonomous underwater vehicles during the inspection of ship hulls, walls and sea bottom.

AB To enable efficient transportation in semiconductor fabrication bays, it is necessary to generate route planning of multiple automated guided vehicles (AGVs) efficiently to minimize the total transportation time without collision among AGVs. In this paper, we propose a distributed route-planning method for multiple mobile robots using an augmented Lagrangian decomposition and coordination technique. The proposed method features a characteristic that each AGV individually creates a near-optimal routing plan through repetitive data exchange among the AGVs and local optimization for each AGV. Dijkstra's algorithm is used for local optimization. The optimality of the solution generated by the proposed method is evaluated by comparing the solution with an optimal solution derived by solving integer linear programming problems. A near-optimal solution, within 3% of the average gap from the optimal solution for an example transportation system consisting of 143 nodes and 14 AGVs, can be derived in less than 5 s of computation lime for 100 types of requests. The proposed method is implemented in an experimental system with three AGVs, and the routing plan is derived in the configuration space, taking the motion of the robot into account. It is experimentally demonstrated that the proposed method is effective for various problems, despite the fact that each route for an AGV is created without minimizing the entire objective function.

SO JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS

DT Article
ID CONCENTRATION FLUCTUATIONS; SHELF CIRCULATION; TURBULENCE; LAKE
AB The transport of scalars in the coastal ocean is considered through the analysis of a vertically constrained plume which disperses laterally. Observations of the plume are made using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) operating in two modes: (i) repeated transects of the plume at a fixed distance from the source; and (it) a large-scale mapping of the plume development. Together, these measurements define both the variability in the plume centreline (i.e. the meandering) and the growth of the plume around the centreline (i.e. the relative dispersion). The analysis of the measurements suggests that the meandering is well-described by a spatially uniform but temporally variable velocity field, indicating that large-scale flow structures dominate the centreline variability. The growth of the plume downstream is seen to follow a scale-dependent dispersion law, most likely of a compound structure: a 4/3-law in the near field, and a scale-squared law in the far field. This transition between dispersion laws is consistent with the transition from three-dimensional turbulence structures to two-dimensional eddies, which is due to the constraints imposed on the vertical dimension at the site. Comparing the two dispersion processes, the effective dispersion created by meandering is found to be comparable with or larger than the relative dispersion in the near field; but in the far field, the relative dispersion is found to dominate considerations of overall dispersion.

AB While the gene delivery vehicle is critical for the efficacy of human factor VIII gene therapy optimization of the potency and duration of the factor VIII gene that is delivered is equally important in light of the poor transcription and translation characteristics of this gene. We discuss here a systematic approach to optimization of factor VIII complementary DNA expression by analysis of specific elements engineered into the transcription unit and other positions in the expression plasmid. Within the transcription unit we have engineered different 5' and 3' sequence modifications and tested them for factor VIII expression in human liver cells. These changes incorporate liver-specific promoter and enhancer sequences and regulatory elements affecting RNA export. Specifically the thyroid hormone-binding globulin promoter and alpha(1) microglobulin/ bikunin enhancer were tested and a synthetic 5' intron was compared to a 3' post-transcriptional regulatory element on factor VIII expression levels. For translation optimization, a leader sequence was designed to be of optimum length, have no RNA secondary structure and contain the optimal translation initiation sequence. Finally, we discuss areas for plasmid optimization, which include removal of near-consensus splicing sequences, the inclusion of strong transcription termination elements and the use of autonomous replicating plasmid sequences for episomal maintenance and enhanced plasmid retention for duration of gene expression.

AB The proliferation of reusable space vehicles has fundamentally changed how assets are injected into the low earth orbit and beyond, increasing both the reliability and frequency of launches. Consequently, it has led to the rapid development and adoption of new technologies in the aerospace sector, including computer vision (CV), machine learning (ML)/artificial intelligence (AI), and distributed networking. All these technologies are necessary to enable truly autonomous "Human-out-of-the-loop" mission tasking for spaceborne applications as spacecrafts travel further into the solar system and our missions become more ambitious. This paper proposes a novel approach for space-based computer vision sensing and machine learning simulation and validation using synthetically trained models to generate the large amounts of space-based imagery needed to train computer vision models. We also introduce a method of image data augmentation known as domain randomization to enhance machine learning performance in the dynamic domain of spaceborne computer vision to tackle unique space-based challenges such as orientation and lighting variations. These synthetically trained computer vision models then apply that capability for hardware-in-the-loop testing and evaluation via free-flying robotic platforms, thus enabling sensor-based orbital vehicle control, onboard decision making, and mobile manipulation similar to air-bearing table methods. Given the current energy constraints of space vehicles using solar-based power plants, cameras provide an energy-efficient means of situational awareness when compared to active sensing instruments. When coupled with computationally efficient machine learning algorithms and methods, it can enable space systems proficient in classifying, tracking, capturing, and ultimately manipulating objects for orbital/planetary assembly and maintenance (tasks commonly referred to as In-Space Assembly and On-Orbit Servicing). Given the inherent dangers of manned spaceflight/extravehicular activities (EVAs) currently employed to perform spacecraft maintenance and the current limitation of long-duration human spaceflight outside the low earth orbit, space robotics armed with generalized sensing and control and machine learning architecture have a unique automation potential. However, the tools and methodologies required for hardware-in-the-loop simulation, testing, and validation at a large scale and at an affordable price point are in developmental stages. By leveraging a drone's free-flight maneuvering capability, theater projection technology, synthetically generated orbital and celestial environments, and machine learning, this work strives to build a robust hardware-in-the-loop testing suite. While the focus of the specific computer vision models in this paper is narrowed down to solving visual sensing problems in orbit, this work can very well be extended to solve any problem set that requires a robust onboard computer vision, robotic manipulation, and free-flight capabilities.

AB With the rapid increase in the development of deep learning methodologies, deep neural networks (DNNs) are now being commonly deployed in smart systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles) and high-end security applications (e.g., face recognition, biometric authentication, etc.). The training of such DNN models often requires exclusive valuable training datasets, enormous computational resources, and expert fine-tuning skills. Hence, a trained DNN model can be regarded as valuable proprietary intellectual property (IP). Piracy of such DNN IPs has emerged as a major concern, with increasing trends of illegal copying and redistribution. A number of mitigation approaches targeting DNN IP protection have been proposed in recent years. In this work, we target two recently proposed DNN IP protection schemes: 1) chaotic map theory-based encryption of the weight parameters and 2) traditional block cipher-based encryption of the weights. We demonstrate attacks on two recent DNN IP protection techniques, with one technique each belonging to the above-mentioned schemes, under a pragmatic attack model. We also propose a novel DNN IP protection technique based on selective encryption of the weight parameters, termed limited encryption of weights for IP protection (LEWIP) to mitigate the exposed weaknesses, while having low implementation and performance overheads. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the LEWIP technique against state-of-the-art DNN implementations.

AB This paper studies a Deep Q-Learning (DQL) method for transaction sequencing problems in an automated warehousing system, Shuttle-based Storage and Retrieval System (SBSRS), in which shuttles can move between tiers flexibly. Here, the system is referred to as tier-to-tier SBSRS (t-SBSRS), developed as an alternative design to tier-captive SBSRS (c-SBSRS). By the flexible travel of shuttles between tiers in t-SBSRS, the number of shuttles in the system may be reduced compared to its simulant c-SBSRS design. The flexible travel of shuttles makes the operation decisions more complex in that system, motivating us to explore whether integration of a machine learning approach would help to improve the system performance. We apply the DQL method for the transaction selection of shuttles in the system to attain process time advantage. The outcomes of the DQN are confronted with the well-applied heuristic approaches: first-come-first-serve (FIFO) and shortest process time (SPT) rules under different racking and numbers of shuttles scenarios. The results show that DQL outperforms the FIFO and SPT rules promising for the future of smart industry applications. Especially, compared to the well-applied SPT rule in industries, DQL improves the average cycle time per transaction by roughly 43% on average.

AB The micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) vibratory gyroscope has been widely used in many fields, such as aerospace, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. The major affecting factor of the final accuracy of this type of gyroscope is random noise error. The MEMS vibratory gyroscope has been a hot research topic in the vibratory gyroscope field. This paper considers the vibratory gyroscopes, such as metal resonant and tuning forks. In the process of research and analysis, the MEMS gyroscopes are mainly used. Aiming at suppressing the random noise of the MEMS gyroscopes effectively, a nonlinear suppression method based on the Cubature Kalman Filter-Phase Space Reconstruction (CKF-PSR) is proposed. After fully analyzing the data flow and processing timing of the MEMS gyroscope, the chaotic attractor PSR is used to complete the data modeling of the gyroscope output. Combining the established model with the nonlinear factors of the gyroscope output, a nonlinear filter is proposed for comprehensive filtering. The algorithm complexity and running dynamics are systematically analyzed and verified. Finally, it was applied to a self-developed inertial integrated navigation device. The results show that compared to the traditional filtering methods, the Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and the Kalman Filter Phase Space Reconstruction (KF-PSR), the proposed method has significant advantages, laying a theoretical foundation for the application of vibratory gyroscopes in high-precision applications.

DT Article
DE LiDAR-camera calibration; deep learning; calibration flow
ID OPTIMIZATION
AB As an essential procedure of data fusion, LiDAR-camera calibration is critical for autonomous vehicles and robot navigation. Most calibration methods require laborious manual work, complicated environmental settings, and specific calibration targets. The targetless methods are based on some complex optimization workflow, which is time-consuming and requires prior information. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can regress the six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) extrinsic parameters from raw LiDAR and image data. However, these CNN-based methods just learn the representations of the projected LiDAR and image and ignore the correspondences at different locations. The performances of these CNN-based methods are unsatisfactory and worse than those of non-CNN methods. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN-based LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration algorithm named CFNet. We first decided that a correlation layer should be used to provide matching capabilities explicitly. Then, we innovatively defined calibration flow to illustrate the deviation of the initial projection from the ground truth. Instead of directly predicting the extrinsic parameters, we utilize CFNet to predict the calibration flow. The efficient Perspective-n-Point (EPnP) algorithm within the RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) scheme is applied to estimate the extrinsic parameters with 2D-3D correspondences constructed by the calibration flow. Due to its consideration of the geometric information, our proposed method performed better than the state-of-the-art CNN-based methods on the KITTI datasets. Furthermore, we also tested the flexibility of our approach on the KITTI360 datasets.

AB Although numerous road segmentation studies have utilized vision data, obtaining robust classification is still challenging due to vision sensor noise and target object deformation. Long-distance images are still problematic because of blur and low resolution, and these features make distinguishing roads from objects difficult. This study utilizes light detection and ranging (LiDAR), which generates information that camera images lack, such as distance, height, and intensity, as a reliable supplement to address this problem. In contrast to conventional approaches, additional domain transformation to a bird's eye view space is executed to obtain long-range data with resolutions comparable to those of short-range data. This study proposes a convolutional neural network architecture that processes data transformed to a bird's eye view plane. The network's pathways are split into two parts to resolve calibration errors in the transformed image and point cloud. The network, which has modules that operate sequentially at various scaled dilated convolution rates, is designed to quickly and accurately handle a wide range of data. Comprehensive empirical studies using the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute's (KITTI's) road detection benchmarks demonstrate that this study's approach takes advantage of camera and LiDAR information, achieving robust road detection with short runtimes. Our result ranks 22nd in the KITTI's leaderboard and shows real-time performance.

AB Taxing consumption in the digital economy poses unique challenges for fiscal authorities. Recent institutional reforms, such as states changing remittance rules for the sales and use tax following the Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, were enacted to increase tax revenue collections and create a more neutral tax system. Although these reforms induced more remote vendors to remit taxes on a destination basis, the revenue gains were modest, consistent with most large online vendors remitting taxes prior to the reforms. Instead, following the recent large shock to online shopping from the COVID-19 pandemic, the shift to destination-based taxation has redistributed revenues between large and small local jurisdictions. Increased online shopping raises revenue growth in small jurisdictions while contracting revenues in large jurisdictions. But Wayfair is not the end of the story: technological changes that induce new consumption patterns promise new challenges for fiscal authorities. Critical challenges for the next decades include limiting administrative and compliance costs of enforcing taxes in a digital world, determining filing thresholds, dealing with online marketplaces and facilitators, and taxing the consumption of digital services from two-sided platforms. With respect to digital services, we discuss whether consumption taxes should be imposed on both monetized platforms and nonmonetized platforms, such as social media, and the mechanisms for doing so.

ID SYSTEM
AB High-precision global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is a crucial geolocalization feature enabling a wide range of applications, from mobile Internet-of-Things devices to autonomous drones and self-driving vehicles. Real-time kinematic (RTK) is a GNSS technology that attracting increased interest due to the centimeter precision achievable when wireless communication is present on the devices. On the other hand, sending continuously wireless data increases the energy consumption and the cost of the solution, especially when communication is carried over the 4G network. Due to those drawbacks, RTK is not much exploited in the localization of battery-operated devices. This work combines RTK with low-power long-range communication to achieve submeter precision in an energy-efficient RTK-based system. The proposed system exploits a state-of-the-art RTK-GNSS module combined with a long range (LoRa) to achieve geolocalization with minimal wireless radio infrastructure requirements. An energy-efficient algorithm is proposed and implemented in a microcontroller to have a quick startup and high accuracy. We evaluate three different GNSS modules and compare their performance in terms of power and accuracy. Experimental results, with in-field measurements, show that an average geolocalization precision of tens of centimeters is achievable on a battery-operated wireless end node connected to a single base station used as a geostationary reference anchor placed at kilometers of distance. The peak precision measured is below 10 cm.

AB The Internet of Things (IoTs) is attracting the attention of scientists worldwide. With its explosive growth along with applications that require real-time computing power, a new technology called edge computing has emerged. As a result, edge computing has changed the way data are processed and handled back and forth for millions of devices worldwide, such as autonomous vehicles and electric cars. The confinement of cloud computing technology, such as a content delivery network (CDN), contributed significantly to edge computing development. Currently, this technology can meet the demands of ever-growing mobile devices and the IoTs. This paper describes a novel secure framework consisting of a hybrid storage architecture consisting of CDN, edge computing, and centralized storage. Centralized storage consists of multilevel storage systems that comprise solid-state drivers (SSDs) and hard disk drivers (HDDs), which provide optimal data storage solution for a wide variety of real-time data processing applications. Transforming the data back and forth between SSDs and HDDs is crucial for achieving high performance while meeting the edge device request deadline. Additionally, a new dynamic solid-state disk partitioning mechanism is introduced to optimize security for the proposed framework among hard disk drives. A partition from the solid-state disks to hard disk drives is assigned based on hard disk drive workloads.

AB Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) require highly reliable navigation information. Generally, navigation systems with the inertial navigation system (INS) and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) have been widely used. However, the GNSS is vulnerable to jamming and spoofing. The terrain referenced navigation (TRN) technique can be used to solve this problem. In this study, to obtain reliable navigation information even if a GNSS is not available or the degree of terrain roughness is not determined, we propose a federated filter based INS/GNSS/TRN integrated navigation system. We also introduce a TRN system that combines batch processing and an auxiliary particle filter to ensure stable flight of UAVs even in a long-term GNSS-denied environment. As an altimeter sensor for the TRN system, an interferometric radar altimeter (IRA) is used to obtain reliable navigation accuracy in high altitude flight. In addition, a parallel computing technique with general purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU) is applied to process a high resolution terrain database and a nonlinear filter in real-time on board. Finally, the performance of the proposed system is verified through software-in-the-loop (SIL) tests and captive flight tests in a GNSS unavailable environment.

TI Image-Based Estimation, Planning, and Control of a Cable-Suspended
   Payload for Package Delivery
SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Unmanned autonomous vehicles; Robot vision systems
AB This letter presents an image-based approach that enables an aerial robot with a cable-suspended mechanism to find a payload with unknown mass, pick it up, transport it, and then put it down at a new location. The pick and place task is performed with minimum cable-swing angle. A new process is presented for state estimation, trajectory planning, and dynamic control using a single onboard camera and inertia measurement unit (IMU). Specifically, a new nonlinear observer, which does not require localization information from external sensors (such as a motion capture system), is created for controlling the robot's velocity. The outer position-control loop is designed in terms of the invariant image feature which is decoupled from the robot's attitude and is proved to be the flat outputs of the system. The combined estimation and control scheme is shown to be asymptotically stable in the Lyapunov sense, where damping due to air contributes to stabilizing the rates of the swing angle. The optimal trajectory of the Euclidean homography is efficiently generated to obtain dynamically-feasible trajectories for the image features. A least-square identification technique is employed to estimate the mass of each payload, and the input shaping technique is implemented to reduce payload swing motion. Finally, a practical package-delivery task is performed to validate the process, where it is shown that the robot can effectively pick up and deliver payloads on command with minimum cable-swing angle.

AB Nowadays, research in autonomous underwater manipulation has demonstrated simple applications like picking an object from the sea floor, turning a valve or plugging and unplugging a connector. These are fairly simple tasks compared with those already demonstrated by the mobile robotics community, which include, among others, safe arm motion within areas populated with a priori unknown obstacles or the recognition and location of objects based on their 3D model to grasp them. Kinect-like 3D sensors have contributed significantly to the advance of mobile manipulation providing 3D sensing capabilities in real-time at low cost. Unfortunately, the underwater robotics community is lacking a 3D sensor with similar capabilities to provide rich 3D information of the work space. In this paper, we present a new underwater 3D laser scanner and demonstrate its capabilities for underwater manipulation. In order to use this sensor in conjunction with manipulators, a calibration method to find the relative position between the manipulator and the 3D laser scanner is presented. Then, two different advanced underwater manipulation tasks beyond the state of the art are demonstrated using two different manipulation systems. First, an eight Degrees of Freedom (DoF) fixed-base manipulator system is used to demonstrate arm motion within a work space populated with a priori unknown fixed obstacles. Next, an eight DoF free floating Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System (UVMS) is used to autonomously grasp an object from the bottom of a water tank.

TI Measurement of seawater average velocity using water bottom multiples
   from vertical seismic profile surveys
SO INTERPRETATION-A JOURNAL OF SUBSURFACE CHARACTERIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Previous diagnoses of surface seismic velocity models with vertical seismic profile (VSP) data in the Gulf of Mexico have indicated that shallow velocities were poorly constrained by VSP due to ringing caused by multiple casing strings. This ringing also hampered direct measurement of the seawater average velocity (SWAV) at a rig site with direct arrivals of a zero-offset VSP (ZVSP). We have directly measured the SWAV at a rig site with a known water depth by using differential times between primary water bottom multiples (WBMs) and direct first arrivals acquired in a marine VSP survey. We developed a procedure to process ZVSP-WBM signals for SWAV measurement. This WBM method is successfully applied to VSP data recorded at 27 rig sites in the deep-water environments of North and South America. Our results suggest that VSP processors should implement this method and add the SWAV measurement in their future velocity survey reports. We have estimated water bottom depths using differential times. We found that the estimated water depths are comparable with those acquired from sonar measurements by autonomous underwater vehicles, but with large uncertainties. The WBM method is extended by using data from a vertical incidence VSP to measure a profile of the SWAV along the path of a deviated well and evaluate possible lateral variations of SWAV. This method can potentially be applied to a time-lapse VSP to monitor temporal variations of SWAV. We also evaluated the application scope and limitations of the WBM method.

AB Submarine volcanic eruptions and intrusions construct new oceanic crust and build long chains of volcanic islands and vast submarine plateaus. Magmatic events are a primary agent for the transfer of heat, chemicals, and even microbes from the crust to the ocean, but the processes that control these transfers are poorly understood. The 1980s discovery that mid-ocean ridge eruptions are often associated with brief releases of immense volumes of hot fluids ("event plumes") spurred interest in methods for detecting the onset of eruptions or intrusions and for rapidly organizing seagoing response efforts. Since then, some 35 magmatic events have been recognized and responded to on mid-ocean ridges and at seamounts in both volcanic arc and intraplate settings. Field responses at mid-ocean ridges have found that event plumes occur over a wide range of eruption styles and sizes, and thus may be a common consequence of ridge eruptions. The source(s) of event plume fluids are still debated. Eruptions detected at ridges generally have high effusion rates and short durations (hours to days), whereas field responses at arc volcanic cones have found eruptions with very low effusion rates and durations on the scale of years. New approaches to the study of submarine magmatic events include the development of autonomous vehicles for detection and response, and the establishment of permanent seafloor observatories at likely future eruption sites.

AB High-resolution (1.5 m) mapping from the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) D. Allan B. of West Mata Volcano in the northern Lau Basin is used to identify the processes that construct and modify the volcano. The surface consists largely of volcaniclastic debris that forms smooth slopes to the NW and SE, with smaller lava flows forming gently sloping plateaus concentrated along the ENE and WSW rift zones, and more elongate flows radiating from the summit. Two active volcanic vents, Prometheus and Hades, are located similar to 50 and similar to 150 m WSW of the 1159 m summit, respectively, and are slightly NW of the ridgeline so the most abundant clastic deposits are emplaced on the NW flank. This eruptive activity and the location of vents appears to have been persistent for more than a decade, based on comparison of ship-based bathymetric surveys in 1996 and 2008-2010, which show positive depth changes up to 96 m on the summit and north flank of the volcano. The widespread distribution of clastic deposits downslope from the rift zones, as well as from the current vents, suggests that pyroclastic activity occurs at least as deep as 2200 m. The similar morphology of additional nearby volcanoes suggests that they too have abundant pyroclastic deposits.

AB Lane detection is one of the most fundamental problems in the rapidly developing field of autonomous vehicles. With the dramatic growth of deep learning in recent years, many models have achieved a high accuracy for this task. However, most existing deep-learning methods for lane detection face two main problems. First, most early studies usually follow a segmentation approach, which requires much post-processing to extract the necessary geometric information about the lane lines. Second, many models fail to reach real-time speed due to the high complexity of model architecture. To offer a solution to these problems, this paper proposes a lightweight convolutional neural network that requires only two small arrays for minimum post-processing, instead of segmentation maps for the task of lane detection. This proposed network utilizes a simple lane representation format for its output. The proposed model can achieve 93.53% accuracy on the TuSimple dataset. A hardware accelerator is proposed and implemented on the Virtex-7 VC707 FPGA platform to optimize processing time and power consumption. Several techniques, including data quantization to reduce data width down to 8-bit, exploring various loop-unrolling strategies for different convolution layers, and pipelined computation across layers, are optimized in the proposed hardware accelerator architecture. This implementation can process at 640 FPS while consuming only 10.309 W, equating to a computation throughput of 345.6 GOPS and energy efficiency of 33.52 GOPS/W.

AB The ability to form reconstructions beyond line-of-sight view could be transformative in a variety of fields, including search and rescue, autonomous vehicle navigation, and reconnaissance. Most existing active non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging methods use data collection steps in which a pulsed laser is directed at several points on a relay surface, one at a time. The prevailing approaches include raster scanning of a rectangular grid on a vertical wall opposite the volume of interest to generate a collection of confocal measurements. These and a recent method that uses a horizontal relay surface are inherently limited by the need for laser scanning. Methods that avoid laser scanning to operate in a snapshot mode are limited to treating the hidden scene of interest as one or two point targets. In this work, based on more complete optical response modeling yet still without multiple illumination positions, we demonstrate accurate reconstructions of foreground objects while also introducing the capability of mapping the stationary scenery behind moving objects. The ability to count, localize, and characterize the sizes of hidden objects, combined with mapping of the stationary hidden scene, could greatly improve indoor situational awareness in a variety of applications.
   Most non-line-of-sight imaging requires scanned illumination, limiting applicability for dynamic scenes. Here the authors exploit occlusion and a sensor array to estimate locations and sizes of moving foreground objects and a static background map.

AB While existing methods can disrupt drone invasions in a protected airspace, none of them is able to accurately guide a drone to a desired location for safe handling. To address this issue, the Drone Position Manipulation (DPM) attack is proposed in this article to explore weaknesses in common navigation algorithms of consumer drones. The main advantage of DPM is that it can accurately redirect an invading drone to a desired location, by carefully crafting the spoofed guidance inputs of the drone to exploit the adjustment of path-following navigation algorithms. Compared with existing methods, this is the first work to achieve such accurate quantitative control. Another main contribution of this work is that it explores three fundamental components (i.e., guidance sensing, state estimation, and navigation control) together to enable the quantitative manipulation of flight paths, different from all existing methods. Furthermore, a formal analysis of the attack range is presented for investigating where a drone can be redirected from its target under given constraints. The evaluation on the Software-in-the-loop (SITL) module of ArduPilot system shows that the proposed attack is able to not only accurately lead a drone to a redirected destination but also make it fairly far away from its target. Lastly, the proposed attack can be applied to many autopiloted systems, because it exploits common weaknesses in these systems.

AB In this paper, an observer-based proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is proposed for an autonomous tractor with n-trailer units with prescribed transient and steady-state performances by compensating the negative effect of the path curvature during the turning of the trailers. The control objective is to place the position of the last trailer on a desired trajectory without any deviation in the course of its turning. Since the curvature of the trajectory causes a remarkable unwanted deviation of the trailers' positions from the path, an input-output model is derived for the tractor with n-trailers based on the extended look-ahead control concept which employs a corrective angle to compensate the path curvature. A nonlinear transformation is employed to transform constrained errors into unconstrained ones and to obtain an open-loop error dynamic model in terms of the unconstrained errors. Then, a neural network adaptive PID output-feedback linearization-based controller is proposed to force the tracking errors to the zero neighbourhood with a guaranteed prescribed performance with preferable overshoot/undershoot, convergence speed and final tracking accuracy. The Kalman-Yakobovich (KY) lemma is employed to prove the closed-loop stability of the observer-controller system strongly. Numerical simulations are given to show the controller's effectiveness in practice.

AB This study examines the spatial and temporal variability of eddy kinetic energy over the Northeast Shelf using observations of surface currents from a unique array of six high frequency radar systems. Collected during summer and winter conditions over three consecutive years, the horizontal scales present were examined in the context of local wind and hydrographic variability, which were sampled concurrently from moorings and autonomous surface vehicles. While area-averaged mean kinetic energy at the surface was tightly coupled to wind forcing, eddy kinetic energy was not, and was lower in magnitude in winter than summer in all areas. Kinetic energy wavenumber spectral slopes were generally near k(-5/3), but varied seasonally, spatially, and between years. In contrast, wavenumber spectra of surface temperature and salinity along repeat transect lines had sharp k(-3) spectral slopes with little seasonal or inter-annual variability. Radar-based estimates of spectral kinetic energy fluxes revealed a mean transition scale of energy near 18 km during stratified months, but suggested much longer scales during winter. Overall, eddy kinetic energy was unrelated to local winds, but the up- or down-scale flux of kinetic energy was tied to wind events and, more weakly, to local density gradients.

AB Do people personally witness artificial intelligence (AI) committing moral wrongs? If so, what kinds of moral wrong and what situations produce these? To address these questions, respondents selected one of six prompt questions, each based on a moral foundation violation, asking about a personally-witnessed interaction with an AI resulting in a moral victim (victim prompts) or where the AI seemed to engage in immoral actions (action prompt). Respondents then answered their selected question in an open-ended response. In conjunction with liberty/privacy and purity moral foundations and across both victim and action prompts, respondents most frequently reported moral violations as two types of exposure by AIs: their personal information being exposed (31%) and people's exposure to undesirable content (20%). AIs expose people's personal information to their colleagues, close relations, and online due to information sharing across devices, people in proximity of audio devices, and simple accidents. AIs expose people, often children, to undesirable content such as nudity, pornography, violence, and profanity due to their proximity to audio devices and to seemly purposeful action. We argue that the prominence in reporting these types of exposure may be due to their frequent occurrence on personal and home devices. This suggests that research on AI ethics should not only focus on the prototypically harmful moral dilemmas (e.g., autonomous vehicle deciding whom to sacrifice) but everyday interactions with personal technology.

AB The incorporation of macro-actions (temporally extended actions) into multi-agent decision problems has the potential to address the curse of dimensionality associated with such decision problems. Since macro-actions last for stochastic durations, multiple agents executing decentralized policies in cooperative environments must act asynchronously. We present an algorithm that modifies generalized advantage estimation for temporally extended actions, allowing a state-of-the-art policy optimization algorithm to optimize policies in Dec-POMDPs in which agents act asynchronously. We show that our algorithm is capable of learning optimal policies in two cooperative domains, one involving real-time bus holding control and one involving wildfire fighting with unmanned aircraft. Our algorithm works by framing problems as "event-driven decision processes," which are scenarios in which the sequence and timing of actions and events are random and governed by an underlying stochastic process. In addition to optimizing policies with continuous state and action spaces, our algorithm also facilitates the use of event-driven simulators, which do not require time to be discretized into time-steps. We demonstrate the benefit of using event-driven simulation in the context of multiple agents taking asynchronous actions. We show that fixed time-step simulation risks obfuscating the sequence in which closely separated events occur, adversely affecting the policies learned. In addition, we show that arbitrarily shrinking the time-step scales poorly with the number of agents.

AB Shuttle based storage and retrieval systems (SBS/RS) attract continuous research attention because of their ability to achieve a high throughput. In an SBS/RS system, lifts are regarded as the bottleneck that hinder reaching higher throughput and therefore require subtle control polices. In this paper, the scheduling of two non passing lifts on a common rail SBS/RS has been studied with consideration of the acceleration and deceleration of the lifts. Lift scheduling includes storage and retrieval requests sequencing, assignment of lifts, and collision avoidance. The main objective of the lift scheduling is minimizing the makespan of the moves. Different with the traditional constant velocity lift scheduling approach is that new collisions emerge when the acceleration/deceleration of the lifts are taken into consideration. This makes the scheduling different. In this paper a collision free lifts trajectory predicting approach with acceleration/deceleration is presented. Combined with the collision-free method, request sequencing and assignment are carried out by a proposed genetic algorithm. Experimental results with several SBS/RS practical working scenarios provide evidence that the proposed scheduling approach achieved on average 12.2% and 6.4% improvement in makespan compared with the constant velocity approach when the maximum velocity of the lifts is 1.5 m/s and 2 m/s respectively.

AB 3D urban maps with semantic labels and metric information are not only essential for the next generation robots such autonomous vehicles and city drones, but also help to visualize and augment local environment in mobile user applications. The machine vision challenge is to generate accurate urban maps from existing data with minimal manual annotation. In this work, we propose a novel methodology that takes GPS registered LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) point clouds and street view images as inputs and creates semantic labels for the 3D points clouds using a hybrid of rule-based parsing and learning-based labelling that combine point cloud and photometric features. The rule-based parsing boosts segmentation of simple and large structures such as street surfaces and building facades that span almost 75% of the point cloud data. For more complex structures, such as cars, trees and pedestrians, we adopt boosted decision trees that exploit both structure (LiDAR) and photometric (street view) features. We provide qualitative examples of our methodology in 3D visualization where we construct parametric graphical models from labelled data and in 2D image segmentation where 3D labels are back projected to the street view images. In quantitative evaluation we report classification accuracy and computing times and compare results to competing methods with three popular databases: NAVTEQ True, Paris-Rue-Madame and TLS (terrestrial laser scanned) Velodyne.

AB Modal pulses are broadband contributions to an acoustic wave field with fixed mode number. Stable weakly dispersive modal pulses (SWDMPs) are special modal pulses that are characterized by weak dispersion and weak scattering-induced broadening and are thus suitable for communications applications. This paper investigates, using numerical simulations, receiver array requirements for recovering information carried by SWDMPs under various signal-to-noise ratio conditions without performing channel equalization. Two groups of weakly dispersive modal pulses are common in typical mid-latitude deep ocean environments: the lowest order modes (typically modes 1-3 at 75 Hz), and intermediate order modes whose waveguide invariant is near-zero (often around mode 20 at 75 Hz). Information loss is quantified by the bit error rate (BER) of a recovered binary phase-coded signal. With fixed receiver depths, low BERs (less than 1%) are achieved at ranges up to 400 km with three hydrophones for model with 90% probability and with 34 hydrophones for mode 20 with 80% probability. With optimal receiver depths, depending on propagation range, only a few, sometimes only two, hydrophones are often sufficient for low BERs, even with intermediate mode numbers. Full modal resolution is unnecessary to achieve low BERs. Thus, a flexible receiver array of autonomous vehicles can outperform a cabled array. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a new approach is proposed for detection of an underwater cable, which makes an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) capable for automatic tracking. In this approach instead of traditional image segmentation, first, edges of the images are extracted. Then they are classified using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network and Support Vector Machine (SVM) using texture information. Then the edge points belonged to the background information are removed and the remaining ones are used for the next processes. Finally, the filtered edges are repaired by morphological operators and are fed into the Hough transform for cable detection. Some texture information methods are used for feature extraction but the results confirm that the 2D Fourier transform in combination with MLP network is the best method for edge classification in this environment. Hough transform, is used in two strategies, which in the first one, the whole information of the edges in the image, are used for line detection, and in the second approach because of curve like shape of the cable, a center part of the image, is used for line detection. In the experiments, many different scenes was used for testing the cable detection algorithm, which first method, resulted to good accuracy but the second one, provided better recognition rate for the cable detection task.

TI Bridging the sense-reasoning gap: DyKnow - Stream-based middleware for
   knowledge processing
SO ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Engineering autonomous agents that display rational and goal-directed behavior in dynamic physical environments requires a steady flow of information from sensors to high-level reasoning components. However, while sensors tend to generate noisy and incomplete quantitative data, reasoning often requires crisp symbolic knowledge. The gap between sensing and reasoning is quite wide, and cannot in general be bridged in a single step. Instead, this task requires a more general approach to integrating and organizing multiple forms of information and knowledge processing on different levels of abstraction in a structured and principled manner.
   We propose knowledge processing middleware as a systematic approach to organizing such processing. Desirable properties are presented and motivated. We argue that a declarative stream-based system is appropriate for the required functionality and present DyKnow, a concrete implemented instantiation of stream-based knowledge processing middleware with a formal semantics. Several types of knowledge processes are defined and motivated in the context of a UAV traffic monitoring application.
   In the implemented application, DyKnow is used to incrementally bridge the sense-reasoning gap and generate partial logical models of the environment over which metric temporal logical formulas are evaluated. Using such formulas, hypotheses are formed and validated about the type of vehicles being observed. DyKnow is also used to generate event streams representing for example changes in qualitative spatial relations, which are used to detect traffic violations expressed as declarative chronicles.

AB Our aim is to provide an autonomous vehicle moving into an indoor environment with a visual system to perform a qualitative 3D structure reconstruction of the surrounding environment by recovering the different planar surfaces present in the observed scene.
   The method is based on qualitative detection of planar surfaces by using projective invariant constraints without the use of depth estimates. The goal is achieved by analyzing two images acquired by observing the scene from two different points of view. The method can be applied to both stereo images and motion images.
   Our method recovers planar surfaces by clustering high variance interest points whose cross ratio measurements are preserved in two different perspective projections. Once interest points are extracted from each image, the clustering process requires to grouping corresponding points by preserving the cross ratio measurements.
   We solve the twofold problem of finding corresponding points and grouping the coplanar ones through a global optimization approach based on matching of high relational graphs and clustering on the corresponding association graph through a relaxation labeling algorithm.
   Through our experimental tests, we found the method to be very fast to converge to a solution, showing how higher order interactions, instead to giving rise to a more complex problem, help to speed-up the optimization process and to reach at same time good results.

ID PROTOCOL; DEPTH; DEPLOYMENT; NETWORKS; DBR
AB The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) has attracted a lot of attention because of its promising applications in underwater environmental monitoring; however, the characteristics of acoustic communication, e.g., long propagation delay and high attenuation, pose great challenges for efficient and reliable underwater data transmission. Currently, opportunistic routing is regarded as a key technology to improve the packet delivery ratio, because it can dynamically choose several forwarding nodes and leverage their cooperative forwarding to increase network throughput. However, choosing an excessive number of forwarding nodes may result in energy waste and lengthy communication delays. Therefore, an opportunistic routing based on directional transmission (ORDT) is studied to improve packet delivery timeliness and reliability and lower energy consumption. ORDT mainly contains three phases: 1) forwarding area division; 2) candidate forwarder selection; and 3) candidate forwarder coordination. The forwarding region is first established based on directional transmission. Only neighbors located in the forwarding region can forward packets. Following that, candidate forwarders in the forwarding region are chosen depending on their forwarding capability. Additionally, the chosen candidate's time of holding packets is specified so that they might collaborate to reduce redundant data transmission and transmit packets to gateway nodes. Then, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is employed to gather packets from gateway nodes. Simulation findings demonstrate that ORDT performs better than existing opportunistic routing in terms of packet delivery success rate, transmission latency, and energy usage.

AB Recognizing wet surfaces and their degrees of wetness is essential for many computer vision applications. Surface wetness can inform us slippery spots on a road to autonomous vehicles, muddy areas of a trail to humanoid robots, and the freshness of groceries to us. The fact that surfaces darken when wet, i.e., monochromatic appearance change, has been modeled to recognize wet surfaces in the past. In this paper, we show that color change, particularly in its spectral behavior, carries rich information about surface wetness. We first derive an analytical spectral appearance model of wet surfaces that expresses the characteristic spectral sharpening due to multiple scattering and absorption in the surface. We present a novel method for estimating key parameters of this spectral appearance model, which enables the recovery of the original surface color and the degree of wetness from a single multispectral image. Applied to a multispectral image, the method estimates the spatial map of wetness together with the dry spectral distribution of the surface. To our knowledge, this is the first work to model and leverage the spectral characteristics of wet surfaces to decipher its appearance. We conduct comprehensive experimental validation with a number of wet real surfaces. The results demonstrate the accuracy of our model and the effectiveness of our method for surface wetness and color estimation.

ID PRIVACY
AB The rapid growth of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) shows an urgent demand for driving and transportation-related data, which gives rise to vehicular crowdsensing systems (VCSs). Nevertheless, the existing centralized VCS framework mainly faces the system reliability problem while the decentralized one cannot satisfy the management flexibility. In addition, when the privacy preservation scheme that prevents information leakage encounters the user selection scheme that desires detailed information of participants, how to balance this seemingly irreconcilable contradiction is inevitable for VCS. To remedy that, we take the first research attempt and explore the balance point between the system management, privacy preservation, and quality of experience (QoE) of participants. By fully exploiting the characters of participating entities, a blockchain-enabled conditional decentralized VCS is proposed in this paper. Firstly, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme where the zk-SNARK proof combines with the mixed-task smart contract to guarantee the interaction process will not reveal any private information of participants. Secondly, we propose an efficient reputation management mechanism that renders certain the participants can get a satisfactory QoE even under the condition that the private information of users is secured. And also, the malicious operations in the system will be effectively supervised. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate the security and efficiency properties of privacy preservation and indicate the effectiveness of reputation management.

AB A major challenges of deep learning (DL) is the necessity to collect huge amounts of training data. Often, the lack of a sufficiently large dataset discourages the use of DL in certain applications. Typically, acquiring the required amounts of data costs considerable time, material and effort. To mitigate this problem, the use of synthetic images combined with real data is a popular approach, widely adopted in the scientific community to effectively train various detectors. In this study, we examined the potential of synthetic data-based training in the field of intelligent transportation systems. Our focus is on camera-based traffic sign recognition applications for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. The proposed augmentation pipeline of synthetic datasets includes novel augmentation processes such as structured shadows and gaussian specular highlights. A well-known DL model was trained with different datasets to compare the performance of synthetic and real image-based trained models. Additionally, a new, detailed method to objectively compare these models is proposed. Synthetic images are generated using a semi-supervised errors-guide method which is also described. Our experiments showed that a synthetic image-based approach outperforms in most cases real image-based training when applied to cross-domain test datasets (+10% precision for GTSRB dataset) and consequently, the generalization of the model is improved decreasing the cost of acquiring images.

ID PLACEMENT; OPTIMIZATION
AB A wide variety of novel services have been envisioned lately due to wearable gadgets, autonomous vehicles, and IoT applications. These services cannot directly be implemented using centralized cloud computing infrastructure due to large Wide Area Network (WAN) delays. Recently, edge computing is proposed to comply with the requirements of these services, where resilient local servers are accessed through fast wireless links. With this approach, real-time service access can be achieved by handling the user requests at the edge computing infrastructure. Since edge and cloud servers may potentially cooperate, operators can maximize their revenues by optimally deploying the computational resources, distributing the services within the network, and assigning the tasks generated by the end-users. These decisions, each of which is a difficult task on its own, are integrated in this study and formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to optimally design a multi-tier computation structure. Because of the scalability issue, a heuristic algorithm based on the Lagrangian relaxation of the MILP formulation is proposed to solve larger instances. Additionally, in order to provide an opportunity for the operators to find a feasible solution in a very short time, a greedy heuristic approach is presented. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, computational experiments are conducted on a broad suite of randomly generated topologies. The results indicate that the proposed approaches can obtain high-quality solutions within the given time limit.

AB In this paper, we address a problem of vision-based 3D robotic navigation using deep reinforcement learning for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). Our research offers conclusions from the experimental study based on one of the RoboSub 2018 competition tasks. However, it can be generalized to any navigation task consisting of movement from a starting point to the front of the next station. The presented reinforcement learning-based model predicts the robot's steering settings using the data acquired from the robot's sensors. Its Vision Module may be based on a built-in convolutional network or a pre-trained TinyYOLO network so that a comparison of various levels of features' complexity is possible. To enable evaluation of the proposed solution, we prepared a test environment imitating the real conditions. It provides the ability to steer the agent simulating the AUV and calculate values of rewards, used for training the model by evaluating its decisions. We study the solution in terms of the reward function form, the model's hyperparameters and the exploited camera images processing method, and provide an analysis of the correctness and speed of the model's functioning. As a result, we obtain a valid model able to steer the robot from the starting point to the destination based on visual cues and inputs from other sensors. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID COLLISION-AVOIDANCE
AB The usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) has increased in recent years and new application scenarios have emerged. Some of them involve tasks that require a high degree of autonomy, leading to increasingly complex systems. In order for a robot to be autonomous, it requires appropriate perception sensors that interpret the environment and enable the correct execution of the main task of mobile robotics: navigation. In the case of UAVs, flying at low altitude greatly increases the probability of encountering obstacles, so they need a fast, simple, and robust method of collision avoidance. This work covers the problem of navigation in unknown scenarios by implementing a simple, yet robust, environment-reactive approach. The implementation is done with both CPU and GPU map representations to allow wider coverage of possible applications. This method searches for obstacles that cross a cylindrical safety volume, and selects an escape point from a spiral for avoiding the obstacle. The algorithm is able to successfully navigate in complex scenarios, using both a high and low-power computer, typically found aboard UAVs, relying only on a depth camera with a limited FOV and range. Depending on the configuration, the algorithm can process point clouds at nearly 40 Hz in Jetson Nano, while checking for threats at 10 kHz. Some preliminary tests were conducted with real-world scenarios, showing both the advantages and limitations of CPU and GPU-based methodologies.

AB In order to obtain the asphalt pavement texture information in real time and accurately monitor the anti-skid performance of the road pavement, an automatic close-range photogrammetry system (ACRP System) was proposed and established based on the three cameras close-range photogrammetry (CRP) technology. Automatic image acquisition and 3D reconstruction were achieved by the ACRP system. Firstly, the collected pavement texture images were digitized. Secondly, a 3D model of asphalt pavement with surface texture was established in the 3D reconstruction software module based on MATLAB and Python joint programming, then the surface elevation data of asphalt pavement were extracted. Finally, the calculation of the road surface texture index parameters were performed in 3D reconstruction software module. Sand patch testing method and laser scanning method (ZGScan) were used to collect the on-site data as comparison test of the asphalt pavement texture. The mean texture depth (MTD) and the root mean square roughness (RMSR) were chosen as the statistical indicators of pavement surface texture. The results show that the texture data obtained by the ACRP system has relatively higher accuracy and efficiency, and the recognition accuracy is close to 0.02 mm. The ACRP system improves the efficiency and accuracy of traditional close-range photogrammetry and provides real-time and effective road surface anti-skid information for subsequent safety braking of autonomous vehicle.

AB This research is presented as a safety analysis of a cognitive architecture with an intelligent decision support model (IDSM) that is embedded into an autonomous non-deterministic safety-critical system.
   Cognitive technology is currently simulated within safety-critical systems in order to highlight variables of interest, interface with intelligent technologies, and provide an environment that improves the system's cognitive performance. In this research, the safety of the architecture was analyzed on an actual safety-critical system, an unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The safety analysis was conducted in both a simulated and a real world nautical based environment. The objective was to define the safety design of a cognitive architecture. The input to the safety design was provided through an approach that identified and mitigated hazards associated with a USV controlled by a cognitive architecture. This analysis provided a structured, task-oriented approach for the dissemination of information concerning safety requirements. This approach was necessary to achieve a safe execution of the USV's capabilities through a design that reduces the potential for injury to personnel and damage to equipment.
   Other real time applications that would benefit from advancing the safety of cognitive technologies are un-manned platforms, transportation technologies, and service robotics. The results will provide cognitive science researchers with a reference for safety engineering of artificially intelligent safety-critical systems.

AB Industry 4.0 is an important trend in factory automation nowadays. Among the Automated-Storage-and-Retrieval-System (ASRS) is one of the most important issues for industry. It is widely used in a variety of industries for a variety of storage applications in factories and warehouses. However, the cost of constructing an ASRS is so high that most small/medium enterprises cannot afford it. A forklift system is a cheaper alternative to a complicated ASRS. In this work, a new pallet detection method that uses an Adaptive Structure Feature (ASF) and Direction Weighted Overlapping (DWO) ratio to allow forklifts to pick up a pallet is proposed, using a monocular vision system on the forklift. Combining the ASF and DWO ratio for pallet detection, the proposed method removes most of the non-stationary (dynamic) background and significantly increases the processing efficiency. A Haar like-based Adaboost scheme uses an AS for pallets algorithm to detect pallets. It detects the pallet in a dark environment. Finally, by calculating the DWO ratio between the detected pallets and tracking records, it avoids erroneous candidates during object tracking. Therefore, this work improves the pallet detection to solve the problem with an effective design. As results show that the hybrid algorithms that are proposed in this work increase the average pallet detection rate by 95 %.

AB To improve the ability of autonomous navigation for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs), multi-sensor integrated navigation based on Inertial Navigation System (INS), Celestial Navigation System (CNS) and Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) is proposed. The CNS position and the DVL velocity are introduced as the reference information to correct the INS divergence error. The autonomy of the integrated system based on INS/CNS/DVL is much better compared with the integration based on INS/GNSS alone. However, the accuracy of DVL velocity and CNS position are decreased by the measurement noise of DVL and bad weather, respectively. Hence, the INS divergence error cannot be estimated and corrected by the reference information. To resolve the problem, the Adaptive Information Sharing Factor Federated Filter (AISFF) is introduced to fuse data. The information sharing factor of the Federated Filter is adaptively adjusted to maintaining multiple component solutions usable as back-ups, which can improve the reliability of overall system. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by simulation and experiment, the results show that for the INS/CNS/DVL integrated system, when the DVL velocity accuracy is decreased and the CNS cannot work under bad weather conditions, the INS/CNS/DVL integrated system can operate stably based on the AISFF method.

During the procedure of candidate points estimation, a multi-ROls is constructed, which integrates the features of multi-rows based on a geometry constraint that inter-row space is approximately equal into a single processing of optimization. This strategy ensures the center points of crop rows could be detected in a high weedy field or in a large barren patch of the field. For the fourth step, we used the clustering method to confirm the real center points indicating crop rows. And lastly, the linear regression method was employed to fit the crop rows. Three image data sets, taken from a wheat, corn and soybean under different natural and field conditions, were used to evaluate the detection rate, detection accuracy and processing time of the algorithm. Thorough an experimental comparison with the standard Hough transform (SHT), it demonstrates the proposed method outperforms SHT either in detection rate, detection accuracy or computation time. The algorithm requires about 61 ms to recognize crop rows for a 640 x 480 pixels image while the detection rate reaches 93%, detection accuracy reaches 0.0023 degrees. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background/Aims: In rodents, retinoic acid (RA) treatment favors loss of body fat mass and the acquisition of brown fat features in white fat depots. In this work, we sought to examine to what extent these RA effects are cell autonomous or dependent on systemic factors. Methods: Parameters of lipid metabolism and related gene expression were analyzed in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes after exposure to RA or vehicle. Results: Treatment with RA resulted in decreased cellular triacylglycerol content and increased basal lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation rate. At the mRNA level, RA treatment led to a reduced expression of adipogenic/lipogenic transcription factors (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha, rexinoid receptor alpha) and two purported suppressors of lipolysis and oxidative metabolism (CIDEA and receptor-interacting protein 140), and to an increased expression of proteins favoring fat oxidation (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha, uncoupling protein 2, fasting-induced adipose factor, enzymes of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation). These changes paralleled inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein and were preceded by an early RA-induced phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. UCP1 expression was not induced. Conclusion: The results indicate that RA directly favors remodeling of mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes in culture toward increased oxidative metabolism.

AB In the current context of climate change and demographic expansion, one of the phenomena that humanity faces are the suburban wildfires. To prevent the occurrence of suburban forest fires, fire risk assessment and early fire detection approaches need to be applied. Forest fire risk mapping depends on various factors and contributes to the identification and monitoring of vulnerable zones where risk factors are most severe. Therefore, watchtowers, sensors, and base stations of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles need to be placed carefully in order to ensure adequate visibility or battery autonomy. In this study, fire risk assessment of an urban forest was performed and the recently introduced 360-degree data were used for early fire detection. Furthermore, a single-step approach that integrates a multiscale vision transformer was introduced for accurate fire detection. The study area includes the suburban pine forest of Thessaloniki city (Greece) named Seich Sou, which is prone to wildfires. For the evaluation of the performance of the proposed workflow, real and synthetic 360-degree images were used. Experimental results demonstrate the great potential of the proposed system, which achieved an F-score for real fire event detection rate equal to 91.6%. This indicates that the proposed method could significantly contribute to the monitoring, protection, and early fire detection of the suburban forest of Thessaloniki.

TI Leveraging cross-view geo-localization with ensemble learning and
   temporal awareness
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is unreliable in some situations. To mend the poor GNSS signal, an autonomous vehicle can self-localize by matching a ground image against a database of geotagged aerial images. However, this approach has challenges because of the dramatic differences in the viewpoint between aerial and ground views, harsh weather and lighting conditions, and the lack of orientation information in training and deployment environments. In this paper, it is shown that previous models in this area are complementary, not competitive, and that each model solves a different aspect of the problem. There was a need for a holistic approach. An ensemble model is proposed to aggregate the predictions of multiple independently trained state-of-the-art models. Previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) temporal-aware models used heavy-weight network to fuse the temporal information into the query process. The effect of making the query process temporal-aware is explored and exploited by an efficient meta block: naive history. But none of the existing benchmark datasets was suitable for extensive temporal awareness experiments, a new derivative dataset based on the BDD100K dataset is generated. The proposed ensemble model achieves a recall accuracy R@1 (Recall@1: the top most prediction) of 97.74% on the CVUSA dataset and 91.43% on the CVACT dataset (surpassing the current SOTA). The temporal awareness algorithm converges to R@1 of 100% by looking at a few steps back in the trip history.

AB The images captured in the underwater scene frequently suffer from blur effects due to the insufficient light and the relative motion between the captured scenes and the imaging system, which severely hinders the visual-based exploration and investigation of the ocean. In this article, we propose a feature pyramid attention network (FPAN) to remove the motion blur and restore the blurry underwater images. FPAN incorporates the cascaded attention modules into the feature pyramid network, enabling it to learn more discriminative information. To facilitate the training of FPAN, we construct a weighted loss function, which consists of a content loss, an adversarial loss, and a perceptual loss. The cascaded attention module and the weighted loss function enable our proposed FPAN to generate more realistic high-quality images from the blurry underwater images. In addition, to deal with the lack of publicly available datasets in underwater image deblurring, we built two specific underwater deblurring datasets, namely Underwater Convolutional Deblurring Dataset and Underwater Multiframe Averaging Deblurring Dataset, to train and examine different deep learning-based networks. Finally, we conduct sea trial experiments on our autonomous underwater vehicle. Experimental results on two underwater deblurring datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves satisfactory results, which validates the potential practical values of our proposed method in real-world applications.

AB Globally, there is an urgent need for solutions that can support our aging populations to live well and reduce the associated economic, social and health burdens. Implementing smart technologies within homes and communities may assist people to live well and 'age in place'. To date, there has been little consultation with older Australians addressing either the perceived benefits, or the potential social and ethical challenges associated with smart technology use. To address this, we conducted five World Cafes in two Australian states, aiming to capture citizen knowledge about the possibilities and challenges of smart technologies. The participants (n = 84) were aged 55 years and over, English-speaking, and living independently. Grounding our analysis in values-based social science and biomedical ethical principles, we identified the themes reflecting the participants' understanding, resistance, and acceptance of smart technologies, and the ethical principles, including beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, privacy, confidentiality, and justice. Similar to other studies, many of the participants demonstrated cautious and conditional acceptance of smart technologies, while identifying concerns about social isolation, breaches of privacy and confidentiality, surveillance, and stigmatization. Attention to understanding and incorporating the values of older citizens will be important for the acceptance and effectiveness of smart technologies for supporting independent and full lives for older citizens.

AB This paper presents a review of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) electrical tomography (ET) hardware accelerators for real-time applications. While many recent review papers have discussed various algorithms for image reconstruction or acquisition systems, none of them has considered state-of-the-art hardware implementations of the associated image reconstruction algorithms to achieve real-time performance, especially for 3D ET where the computation requirement is excessively high. A 3D ET is useful in various applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and process control, but it is computationally very expensive with respect to its 2D counterpart. Most implementations are based on single or multi-core CPUs and, to a lesser extent, on either graphics processing units (GPUs) or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). However, there is a clear gap between the currently available processors, whose computation power exceeds hundreds of teraflops per second (TOPS) at a reasonable low power consumption, and the ones recently used in ET systems. This gives great potential for next-generation ET systems to achieve real-time 2D and 3D ET reconstruction within a small form factor. The paper summarizes the most recent ET hardware systems with respect to their performance in terms of quality and processing frame rate, reconstruction methods, along with optimization and future directions.

AB Bio-inspired solutions have been deeply investigated in the last two decades as a source of propulsive improvement for autonomous underwater vehicles. Despite the efforts made to pursue the substantial potential payoffs of marine animals' locomotion, the performance of biological swimmers is still far to reach. The possibility to design a machine capable of propelling itself like a marine animal strongly depends on the understanding of the mechanics principles underlying biological swimming. Therefore, the adoption of advanced simulation and measurement techniques is fundamental to investigate the fluid-structure interaction phenomena of aquatic animals' locomotion. Among those, computational fluid dynamics represents an invaluable tool to assess the propulsive loads due to swimming. However, the numerical predictions must be validated before they can be applied to the design of a bio-inspired robot. To this end, this paper presents the experimental setup devised to validate the fluid dynamics analysis performed on an oscillating foil. The numerical predictions led to the design of a strain gages-based sensor, which exploits the deflection and twisting of the foil shaft to indirectly measure the propulsive loads and obtain a complete dynamic characterization of the oscillating foil. The results obtained from the experiments showed a good agreement between the numerical predictions and the measured loads; the test equipment also allowed to investigate the potential benefits of a slender fish-like body placed before the spinning fin. Therefore, in future work, the system will be employed to validate the analysis performed on more sophisticated modes of locomotion.

AB We present a method for synthesizing high-performance controllers for the autonomous execution of aerobatic quadrotor maneuvers that are defined by rapid variations of the flyer's angular velocity, such as multi-flips or the Pugachev's cobra. In the proposed approach, we employ Lyapunov theory to find the sets of control parameters that make the unique fixed point of the closed-loop angular-velocity error dynamics exponentially stable during an aerobatic maneuver, provided that the angular-velocity reference satisfies a set of conditions. Then, we show that the resulting closed-loop attitude error dynamics remain bounded. The proposed controller synthesis method allows for the minimization of a parameterized performance figure of merit (PFM), which is employed to measure the angular-velocity control error accumulated during a maneuver. The approach adopted here is to show that a primal optimization problem can be reformulated as a series of quasiconvex sub-problems; then, we introduce a technique to find a solution and prove that this optimum is global. By design, the resulting controllers have a simple linear time-invariant (LTI) structure that depends on a small number of coefficients, which makes the experimental implementation of the control schemes extremely efficient and the associated real-time computational cost very low. The effectiveness of the introduced methods for controller design and performance optimization is compellingly demonstrated through theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments in which high-speed multi-flip aerobatic maneuvers are executed.

AB Object segmentation and object tracking are fundamental research areas in the computer vision community. These two topics are difficult to handle some common challenges, such as occlusion, deformation, motion blur, scale variation, and more. The former contains heterogeneous object, interacting object, edge ambiguity, and shape complexity; the latter suffers from difficulties in handling fast motion, out-of-view, and real-time processing. Combining the two problems of Video Object Segmentation and Tracking (VOST) can overcome their respective difficulties and improve their performance. VOST can be widely applied to many practical applications such as video summarization, high definition video compression, human computer interaction, and autonomous vehicles. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art VOST methods, classify these methods into different categories, and identify new trends. First, we broadly categorize VOST methods into Video Object Segmentation (VOS) and Segmentation-based Object Tracking (SOT). Each category is further classified into various types based on the segmentation and tracking mechanism. Moreover, we present some representative VOS and SOT methods of each time node. Second, we provide a detailed discussion and overview of the technical characteristics of the different methods. Third, we summarize the characteristics of the related video dataset and provide a variety of evaluation metrics. Finally, we point out a set of interesting future works and draw our own conclusions.

AB Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) systems are generally designed and analyzed for a fixed and exogenous demand, but such frameworks fail to answer questions about the impact of these services on the urban transportation system, such as the effect of induced demand and the implications for transit ridership. In this study, we propose a unified framework to design, optimize and analyze MoD operations within a multimodal transportation system where the demand for a travel mode is a function of its level of service. An application of Bayesian optimization (BO) to derive the optimal supply-side MoD parameters (e.g., fleet size and fare) is also illustrated. The proposed framework is calibrated using the taxi demand data in Manhattan, New York. Travel demand is served by public transit and MoD services of varying passenger capacities (1, 4 and 10), and passengers are predicted to choose travel modes according to a mode choice model. This choice model is estimated using stated preference data collected in New York City. The convergence of the multimodal supply-demand system and the superiority of the BO-based optimization method over earlier approaches are established through numerical experiments. We finally consider a policy intervention where the government imposes a tax on the ride-hailing service and illustrate how the proposed framework can quantify the pros and cons of such policies for different stakeholders.

AB Background. While occupational therapy's inception was from the Arts and Crafts movement and the moral treatment movement with war veterans, the profession has evolved to requiring a professional entry-level master's degree to practice, and involves complex relationships with clients across the life span. Throughout history, a consistent impact of each industrial revolution has been the loss of jobs to automation. This consequence is even more profound today with the exponential growth of innovations and automation. Purpose. The objectives of this article are to (a) set the context by reviewing the evolution, or five eras, of occupational therapy in Canada; (b) present what is meant by the "Fourth Industrial Revolution"; and (c) examine the technological innovations faced by occupational therapists and our clients as we enter the "sixth" era of occupational therapy in Canada. Key Issues. Although occupational therapy, as a profession, has low risk for automation, a great number of our clients will not be able to reskill fast enough to keep up with job market requirements. Telerehabilitation, the Internet of Things, virtual reality, 3-D printing, robotics, artificial intelligence, and autonomous vehicles are challenging ways occupational therapists provide services to clients. Implications. It is recommended that occupational therapists engage with disciplines beyond current typical connections, as our expertise is called upon to advocate for ourselves and our clients who are end users of these technologies.

AB Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) often carry video cameras as part of their payload. Outdoor video captured by such cameras can be used to estimate the attitude and altitude of the UAV by detecting the location of the horizon in the video frames. This paper presents a video frame processing algorithm for estimating the pitch and roll of a UAV, as well as its altitude. The frames are obtained from a downward pointing video camera equipped with a fisheye lens. These open-loop estimates can serve as redundant data used to implement graceful-degradation in the event that the main closed-loop control sensors fail, or for fault-tolerance purposes to augment inertial sensors for increased accuracy. The estimated values had a mean error of +/- 0.7 angular degrees for roll and +/- 0.9 angular degrees for pitch, while the altitude estimation from the video had a mean error of +/- 0.9 meters. The results are presented and compared to actual attitude and altitude values obtained from a traditional inertial measurement unit and, in the case of altitude comparison, an absolute air pressure sensor. The algorithm was developed on a personal computer to work at 10 frames per second and uses only simple image processing functions that can be deployed using open source libraries on lightweight computing boards capable of image processing.

AB This paper describes a framework used to develop and run automotive applications both on board of vehicles and in laboratory. It includes the recording system designed and implemented in the GOLD framework. The system can record data from different sensors, such as cameras, laserscanners, radars, GPS, IMU, IO boards. The system can easily be expanded adding new device drivers. An in-RAM prerecording functionality is available to let the user record events started in the past. An index file collects essential information on each recorded event, such as timestamp, source identifier, and other sourcespecific data. Different file formats can be used to store data on disks; standard file formats are available for images and audio, small data such as CAN messages or GPS data are recorded directly into the index file. In order to have a faster lookup of a particular scene, the system is also equipped with a user interface that allows to insert tags during the recording. This system has been under development and successfully employed in the last 15 years to acquiring data for several VisLab projects. The description of two case studies is included in this paper. BRAiVE is an advanced prototype used as mobile laboratory to acquire data for different purposes. VIAC is a trip from Parma, Italy, to Shanghai, China, performed to test the robustness of VisLab driving assistance systems; the autonomous driving sessions have been recorded generating a unique database suitable to study and possibly improve the algorithm performance.

AB We investigated the 2005 spring phytoplankton bloom in the Labrador Sea using Seaglider, an autonomous underwater vehicle equipped with hydrographic, bio-optical and oxygen sensors. The Labrador Sea blooms in distinct phases, two of which were observed by Seaglider: the north bloom and the central Labrador Sea bloom. The dominant north bloom and subsequent zooplankton growth are enabled by the advection of low-salinity water from West Greenland in the strong and eddy-rich separation of the boundary current. The glider observed high fluorescence and oxygen supersaturation within haline-stratified eddy-like features; higher fluorescence was observed at the edges than centers of the eddies. In the central Labrador Sea, the bloom occurred in thermally stratified water. Two regions with elevated subsurface chlorophyll were also observed: a 5 m thin-layer in the southwest Labrador Current, and in the Labrador shelf-break front. The thin layer observations were consistent with vertical shearing of an initially thicker chlorophyll patch. Observations at the front showed high fluorescence down to 100 m depth and aligned with the isopycnals defining the front. The high-resolution Seaglider sampling across the entire Labrador Sea provides first estimates of the scale dependence of coincident biological and physical variables. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The latest advances in car automation present new challenges in vehicle-driver interactions. Indeed, acceptance and adoption of high levels of automation (when full control of the driving task is given to the automated system) are conditioned by human factors such as user trust. In this work, we study the impact of anthropomorphic design on user trust in the context of a highly automated car. A virtual assistant was designed using two levels of anthropomorphic design: "voice-only" and "voice with visual appearance". The visual appearance was a three-dimensional model, integrated as a hologram in the cockpit of a driving simulator. In a driving simulator study, we compared the three interfaces: two versions of the virtual assistant interface and the baseline interface with no anthropomorphic attributes. We measured trust versus perceived anthropomorphism. We also studied the evolution of trust throughout a range of driving scenarios. We finally analyzed participants' reaction time to takeover request events. We found a significant correlation between perceived anthropomorphism and trust. However, the three interfaces tested did not significantly differentiate in terms of perceived anthropomorphism while trust converged over time across all our measurements. Finally, we found that the anthropomorphic assistant positively impacts reaction time for one takeover request scenario. We discuss methodological issues and implication for design and further research.

AB In smart farming, information and communication technologies such as IoT are driving the agricultural industry towards improved efficiency and productivity while reducing human intervention. As agricultural systems become increasingly connected to the Internet, they provide many new opportunities but also introduce new challenges. Connecting such systems to a network exposes them to cyberattacks and vulnerabilities; therefore, security and privacy are important challenges that should be addressed. Specifically, because of the distinct characteristics of smart farming such as environmental and farm conditions, security solutions suitable for smart farming are indispensable. In this paper, we propose a location verification (LV) protocol as a security solution for autonomous and intelligent moving devices such as drones and robots deployed in smart farming. Moreover, as an application of the proposed LV protocol, we propose a blockchain-based secure drone rental mechanism for smart farming. We present a security analysis in which the proposed LV protocol and rental mechanism are secure against man-in-the-middle, impersonation, modification, replay, and relay attacks, with the rental mechanism providing mutual authentication. Through a performance evaluation of the LV protocol in terms of the communication overhead, computation cost, and storage cost and a performance evaluation of the blockchain for drone rental with regard to throughput and latency, we confirm the feasibility and efficiency of the LV protocol and drone rental mechanism in the smart farming.

AB Real-time 3D reconstruction combined with MAVs has garnered significant attention in a variety of fields, including building maintenance, geological exploration, emergency rescue, and cultural heritage protection. While MAVs possess the advantages of speed and lightness, they also exhibit strong image blur and limited computational resources. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel approach for onboard, depth-only, real-time 3D reconstruction capable of accommodating fast-moving MAVs. Our primary contribution is a dense SLAM system that combines surface hierarchical sparse representation and particle swarm pose optimization. Our system enables the robust tracking of high-speed camera motion and facilitates scaling to large scenes without being constrained by GPU memory resources. Our robust camera tracking framework is capable of accommodating fast camera motions and varying environments solely by relying on depth images. Furthermore, by integrating path planning methods, we explore the capabilities of MAV autonomous mapping in unknown environments with restricted lighting. Our efficient reconstruction system is capable of generating highly dense point clouds with resolutions ranging from 2 mm to 8 mm on surfaces of different complexities at rates approaching 30 Hz, fully onboard a MAV. We evaluate the performance of our method on both datasets and real-world platforms and demonstrate its superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

AB Owing to imaging equipment's environment and limitations, the images obtained in industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs) are degraded and available in various visual appearances. The process of highlighting the hidden contents in night-time contrast-distorted images is complex. Earlier approaches have solved this problem from a different perspective and achieved remarkable results that are generally unsatisfactory for images with diverse illumination distortions in ICPSs. Hence, an effective visibility enhancement model is proposed to eliminate inconsistent color casts while highlighting more hidden content for improved inspection, safety in large spaces, and monitoring of large systems. Our proposed model has four steps: 1) removal of the unnatural color cast via a white balance technique, 2) use of probability density and softplus functions to process the images with the actual color cast, 3) using an optimization algorithm to estimate the illumination and adjusting it using a nonlinear function, and 4) blending by multiscale fusion to obtain the most effective visual result. Evaluation of ten benchmark datasets using 14 quality metrics for 22 conventional and modern algorithms shows that our approach is robust, flexible, and applicable to numerous vision-based applications, such as ICPSs, autonomous vehicles, smart cameras, smart mobility, and transportation, especially in low-light environments.

AB Tram operations are often blocked by traffic lights, leading to frequent decelerations and re-accelerations that increase operational energy consumption. This paper focuses on tram energy-efficient control problem incorporating time constraints from traffic lights that have multiple feasible green time windows (GTWs). We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), where binary variables are assigned to model disjunctive time constraints of the GTWs. To address computational challenge of solving the MINLP, we reformulate it as a tractable nonlinear program (NLP). Specifically, an equivalent NLP is first presented by replacing the integrality constraint with nonlinear constraints, and then the nonlinear constraints are relaxed and penalized into cost functions. To recover a solution of the MINLP, we propose a computationally efficient sequential quadratic programming algorithm in a shrinking horizon model predictive control framework, which updates the penalty parameter and quadratic programming subproblems in parallel. The solution obtained from the subproblem is feasible in each iteration, and convergence of the feasibility iterations can be enforced by the updated penalty. The performance of the proposed approach is investigated on different scenarios using real-life tram data. Results show that the method is able to generate energy-efficient driving trajectories in a dynamic environment, while crossing traffic lights in effective GTWs without unnecessary decelerations and re-accelerations.

DE Index Terms-3D object detection; monocular image; memory network; deep

AB Monocular 3D object detection has drawn increasing attention in various human-related applications, such as autonomous vehicles, due to its cost-effective property. On the other hand, a monocular image alone inherently contains insufficient information to infer the 3D information. In this paper, we propose a new monocular 3D object detector that can recall the stereoscopic visual information about an object, given a left-view monocular image. Here, we devise a location embedding module to handle each object by being aware of its location. Next, given the object appearance of the left-view monocular image, we devise Monocular-to-Stereoscopic (M2S) memory that can recall the object appearance of the right-view and depth information. For this purpose, we introduce a stereoscopic vision memorizing loss that guides the M2S memory to store the stereoscopic visual information. Furthermore, we propose a binocular vision association loss to guide the M2S memory that can associate the information of the left-right view about the object when estimating the depth. As a result, our monocular 3D object detector with the M2S memory can effectively exploit the recalled stereoscopic visual information in the inference phase. The comprehensive experimental results on two public datasets, KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark and Waymo Open Dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We claim that our method is a step-forward method that follows the behaviors of humans that can recall the stereoscopic visual information even when one eye is closed.

AB Loop closure detection (LCD) can effectively eliminate the cumulative errors in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) by detecting the position of a revisit and building interframe pose constraint relations. However, in real-world natural scenes, driverless ground vehicles or robots usually revisit the same place from a different position, meaning that the descriptor cannot give a uniform description of similar scenes, failing LCD. Against this problem, this paper proposes a 3D point cloud descriptor with Twice Projection (3PCD-TP) for the calculation of the similarities between scenes. First, we redefined the origin and primary direction of point clouds according to their distribution and unified their coordinate system, thereby reducing the interference in position recognition due to the rotation and translation of sensors. Next, using the semantic and altitudinal information of point clouds, we generated the 3D descriptor 3PCD-TP with multidimensional features to enhance its ability to describe similar scenes. Following this, we designed a weighting similarity calculation method to reduce the false detection rate of LCD by taking advantage of the property that 3PCD-TP can be projected from multiple angles. Finally, we validated our method using KITTI and the Jilin University (JLU) campus dataset. The experimental results show that our method demonstrated a high level of precision and recall and exhibited greater performance in the face of scenes with reverse loop closure, such as opposite lanes.

AB The exponentially growing literature on Industry 4.0 technologies and their implications for supply chains exhibits valuable insights alongside considerable fragmentation. While prior systematic literature reviews (SLRs) started to consolidate the literature, an SLR that simultaneously (a) covers several core technologies of the Industry 4.0, (b) synthesizes their positive and negative implications for supply chain performance in a broad sense, and (c) accounts for the critical success factors that foster or impede these implications is still missing. We contribute to establishing a cumulative body of knowledge by conducting such an SLR. We synthesize 221 articles published on 11 Industry 4.0 technologies between 2005 and 2021. Rather than aggregate implications, our SLR presents the benefits, challenges, and critical success factors of each core technology vis-a-vis supply chain performance individually. We integrate our findings into a framework of Industry 4.0 supply chain performance and derive promising avenues for future research. Specifically, we call for more research on (a) the challenges and critical success factors of Industry 4.0 technologies; (b) hitherto underexplored core technologies of the Industry 4.0; (c) the interaction of multiple core technologies (are they complements or substitutes?); as well as for (d) further consolidation and interdisciplinary dissemination efforts.

AB With the rapid growth of data traffic in cellular networks, edge caching has become an emerging technology for traffic offloading. We investigate the caching placement and content delivery in cache-enabling cellular networks. To cope with the time-varying content popularity and user location in practical scenarios, we formulate a long-term joint dynamic optimization problem of caching placement and user association for minimizing the content delivery delay which considers both content transmission delay and content update delay. To solve this challenging problem, we decompose the optimization problem into two sub-problems, the user association sub-problem in a short time scale and the caching placement in a long time scale. Specifically, we propose a low complexity user association algorithm for a given caching placement in the short time scale. Then we develop a deep deterministic policy gradient based caching placement algorithm which involves the short time-scale user association decisions in the long time scale. Finally, we propose a joint user association and caching placement algorithm to obtain a sub-optimal solution for the proposed problem. We illustrate the convergence and performance of the proposed algorithm by simulation results. Simulation results show that compared with the benchmark algorithms, the proposed algorithm reduces the long-term content delivery delay in dynamic networks effectively.

ID MONOLAYER MOS2; VISION
AB Two-dimensional (2D) MoS2 is regarded as one of the most promising channel materials for field-effect transistors (FETs) due to its thickness-dependent bandgap and high air-stability. However, current MoS2 FETs generally exhibit high power dissipation and low switching speed because of the general low field-effect mobility (mu approximate to 0.1-20 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)). Here, a facile and effective strategy to significantly enhance the mu over 400 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) is proposed by capping the water molecules on the 2D MoS2 surface of the FET. The device exhibits an ultralow operation voltage of 0.6 V as well as dual ultrahigh mobility behaviors from 409.1 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) to 773.4 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), which can be attributed to the ion-contributed quasi-electric-double-layer effect. More importantly, some intriguing synapse behaviors, such as excitatory/inhibitory postsynaptic current and controllable memory behavior, are successfully realized in our water-induced MoS2 synapse transistors. This artificial synapse can also decode Morse-coded external electrical signals. Most importantly, the light-dependent accuracy of handwritten digit recognition can be found to be as high as 97.2% based on the proposed artificial visual recognition system. These results can open new avenues for the fascinating applications of high-performance photoelectric perception systems in future, such as autonomous vehicles, man-machine interfaces, etc.

TI A Maximum Independent Set Method for Scheduling Earth-Observing
   Satellite Constellations
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB Operating Earth-observing satellites requires efficient planning methods that coordinate activities of multiple spacecraft. The satellite task-planning problem entails selecting actions that best satisfy mission objectives for autonomous execution. Task scheduling is often performed by human operators assisted by heuristic or rule-based planning tools. This approach does not efficiently scale to multiple assets as heuristics frequently fail to properly coordinate actions of multiple vehicles over long horizons. Additionally, the problem becomes more difficult to solve for large constellations as the complexity of the problem scales exponentially in the number of requested observations and linearly in the number of spacecraft. It is expected that new commercial optical- and radar-imaging constellations will require automated planning methods to meet stated responsiveness and throughput objectives. This paper introduces a new approach for solving the satellite-scheduling problem by generating an infeasibility-based graph representation of the problem and finding a maximal independent set of vertices for the graph. The approach is tested on a scenario of up to 10,000 requested imaging locations for the SkySat constellation of optical satellites as well as simulated constellations of up to 24 satellites. Performance is compared with contemporary graph-traversal and mixed-integer linear programming approaches. Empirical results demonstrate improvements in the solution time along with the number of scheduled collections beyond baseline methods. For large problems, the maximum independent set approach is able to find a feasible schedule with 8% more collections in 75% less time.

AB Today, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones are increasingly used to enable and support multi-access edge computing (MEC). However, transferring data between nodes in such dynamic networks implies considerable latency and energy consumption, which are significant issues for practical real-time applications. In this paper, we consider an autonomous swarm of heterogeneous drones. This is a general architecture that can be used for applications that need in-field computation, e.g. real-time object detection in video streams. Collaborative computing in a swarm of drones has the potential to improve resource utilization in a real-time application i.e., each drone can execute computations locally or offload them to other drones. In such an approach, drones need to compete for using each other's resources; therefore, efficient orchestration of the communication and offloading at the swarm level is essential. The main problem investigated in this work is computation offloading between drones in a swarm. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel federated learning (FL)-based fast and fair offloading strategy with a rating method. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy over other existing methods and architectures with average improvements of -23% in energy consumption, -15% in latency, +18% in throughput, and +9% in fairness.

AB The evolution of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) towards the ultimate goal of autonomous driving relies on a conspicuous number of sensors, to perform a wide range of operations, from parking assistance to emergency braking and environment mapping for target recognition/classification. Low-cost Mass-Market Radars (MMRs) are today widely used for object detection at various ranges (up to 250 meters) but they might not be suited for high-precision environment mapping. In this context, vehicular Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is emerging as a promising technique to augment radar imaging capability by exploiting the vehicle motion to provide two-dimensional (2D), or even three-dimensional (3D), images of the surroundings. SAR has a higher resolution compared to standard automotive radars, provided that motion is precisely known. In this regard, one of the most attractive solutions to increase the positioning accuracy is to fuse the information from multiple on-board sensors, such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), odometers and steering angle sensors. This paper proposes a multi-sensor fusion technique to support automotive SAR systems, experimentally validating the approach and demonstrating its advantages compared to standard navigation solutions. The results show that multi-sensor-aided SAR images the surrounding with centimeter-level accuracy over typical urban trajectories, confirming its potential for practical applications and leaving room for further improvements.

TI Illuminant-invariant stereo matching using cost volume and

SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA A-OPTICS IMAGE SCIENCE AND
   VISION
LA English
DT Article
AB In stereo-matching techniques for three-dimensional (3D) vision, illumination change is a major problem that degrades matching accuracy. When large intensity differences are observed between a pair of stereos, it is difficult to find the similarity in the matching process. In addition, inaccurately estimated disparities are obtained in textureless regions, since there are no distinguishable features in the region. To solve these problems, this paper presents a robust stereo-matching method using illuminant-invariant cost volume and confidence-based disparity refinement. In the step of matching a stereo pair, the proposed method combines two cost volumes using an invariant image and Weber local descriptor (WLD), which was originally motivated by human visual characteristics. The invariant image used in the matching step is insensitive to sudden brightness changes by shadow or light sources, and WLD reflects structural features of the invariant image with consideration of a gradual illumination change. After aggregating the cost using a guided filter, we refine the initially estimated disparity map based on the confidence map computed by the combined cost volume. Experimental results verify that the matching computation of the proposed method improves the accuracy of the disparity map under a radiometrically dynamic environment. Since the proposed disparity refinement method can also reduce the error of the initial disparity map in textureless areas, it can be applied to various 3D vision systems such as industrial robots and autonomous vehicles.

AB This paper presents the integration of a cognitive architecture with an intelligent decision support model (IDSM) that is embedded into an autonomous non-deterministic safety critical system. The IDSM will integrate multi criteria decision making via intelligent technologies like expert systems, fuzzy logic, machine learning and genetic algorithms.
   Cognitive technology is currently simulated in safety critical systems to highlight variables of interest, interface with intelligent technologies, and provide an environment that improves a system's cognitive performance. In this study, the IDSM is being applied to an actual safety critical system, an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) software. The USV's safety performance is being researched in a simulated and a real world nautical based environment. The objective is to build a dynamically changing model to evaluate a cognitive architecture's ability to ensure safe performance of an intelligent safety critical system. The IDSM does this by finding a set of key safety performance parameters that can be critiqued via safety measurements, mechanisms and methodologies. The uniqueness of this research will be on bounding the decision making associated with the cognitive architecture's key safety parameters (KSP).
   Other real-time applications that could benefit from advancing the safety of cognitive technologies are unmanned platforms, transportation technologies, and service robotics. The results will provide cognitive science researchers a reference for safety engineering artificially intelligent safety critical systems.

ID 3D OBJECT DETECTION
AB As autonomous vehicle technology advances, high-definition (HD) maps have become essential for ensuring safety and navigation accuracy. However, creating HD maps with accurate annotations demands substantial human effort, leading to a time-consuming and costly process. Although artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) algorithms have been developed for prelabeling HD maps, a significant gap remains in accuracy and robustness between AI-based methods and traditional manual pipelines. Additionally, building large-scale annotated datasets and advanced machine learning algorithms for AI-based HD map labeling systems can be resource-intensive. In this paper, we present and summarize the Tencent HD Map AI (THMA) system, an innovative end-to-end, AI-based, active learning HD map labeling system designed to produce HD map labels for hundreds of thousands of kilometers while employing active learning to enhance product iteration. Utilizing a combination of supervised, self-supervised, and weakly supervised learning, THMA is trained directly on massive HD map datasets to achieve the high accuracy and efficiency required by downstream users. Deployed by the Tencent Map team, THMA serves over 1000 labeling workers and generates more than 30,000 km of HD map data per day at its peak. With over 90% of Tencent Map's HD map data labeled automatically by THMA, the system accelerates traditional HD map labeling processes by more than tenfold, significantly reducing manual annotation burdens and paving the way for more efficient HD map production.

AB Isotropic covariance structures can be unreasonable for phe-nomena in three-dimensional spaces. In the ocean, the vari-ability of a response may vary with depth, and ocean currents may lead to spatially varying anisotropy. We construct a class of non-stationary anisotropic Gaussian random fields (GRFs) in three dimensions through stochastic partial differential equa-tions (SPDEs), where computations are done efficiently using Gaussian Markov random field approximations. A key novelty is the parametrization of the spatially varying anisotropy through vector fields.In a simulation study, we find that simple stationary models obtain reasonable parameter estimates with a moderate num-ber of observations and a single realization, whereas the most complex non-stationary anisotropic model requires dense ob-servations and multiple realizations. Further, we construct a stationary and a non-stationary GRF prior for salinity in an ocean mass outside Trondheim, Norway, based on simulations from the complex numerical ocean model SINMOD. These GRF priors are then evaluated using in-situ measurements collected with an autonomous underwater vehicle. We find that the new model outperforms the stationary anisotropic GRF prior for real-time prediction of unobserved locations both in terms of root mean square error and continuous rank probability score.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) encompasses a wide range of applications and service domains, from smart cities, autonomous vehicles, surveillance, medical devices, to crop control. Virtualization in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is widely regarded as the most revolutionary technological technique used in these areas. Due to node failure or communication latency and the regular identification of nodes in WSNs, virtualization in WSNs presents additional hurdles. Previous research on virtual WSNs has focused on issues such as resource maximization, node failure, and link-failure-based survivability, but has neglected to account for the impact of communication latency. Communication connection latency in WSNs has an effect on various virtual networks providing IoT services. There is a lack of research in this field at the present time. In this study, we utilize the Evolutionary Multi-Objective Crowding Algorithm (EMOCA) to maximize fault tolerance and minimize communication delay for virtual network embedding in WSN environments for service-oriented applications focusing on heterogeneous virtual networks in the IoT. Unlike the current wireless virtualization approach, which uses the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II), EMOCA uses both domination and diversity criteria in the evolving population for optimization problems. The analysis of the results demonstrates that the proposed framework successfully optimizes fault tolerance and communication delay for virtualization in WSNs.

ID SOURCE SEEKING; STRATEGY
AB Locating multiple sources in an unknown environment based on their signal strength is called a multi-source location problem. In recent years, there has been great interest in deploying autonomous devices to solve it. A particle swarm optimizer (PSO) is a widely employed source location method. Yet most work in this field focuses on a flat search space while ignoring height information. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has a coarser but wider view as it flies higher. Inspired by such facts, this paper focuses on improving the efficiency of locating sources by utilizing height information through UAVs. A novel source location model is designed where their sensing range gradually increases as their flying height rises, but their obtained signal strength fades away. It can be directly deployed to existing PSO-based multi-source location methods and improve their performance, especially in a large-scale environment with sparse sources. UAVs can spontaneously switch their search schemes between a rough search at a higher height and a fine one at a lower height. Experimental results of three PSO-based methods show their significant improvement after deploying our model. Given the same computation resources, its deployment leads to over 30% hike in both location accuracy and speed. This represents a great advance to the field of source location.

AB The ultra-low latency transmission, high speed broadband and ubiquitous access points in modern cities have greatly alleviated the last mile problem of live streaming services. Yet, the sophisticated video compression of high definition videos is still inevitable before transmission, which leads to overwhelming workloads in the light-weighted video collectors. In this paper, we are motivated to explore the computation offloading of live streaming video compression for UAVs, which are featured by limited capacity and fixed trajectory. In particular, the global motion model is utilized for inter frame residual coding instead of motion vector estimation, which usually takes more than 50% computation complexity in traditional H.264/265. We propose an edge-based Joint Video Coding (eJVC) scheme, which can save up to 84.04% encoding complexity of UAV video collector. Specifically, the attention network is used to distinguish foreground blocks and background blocks in the frame. LSTM neural network is used on the edge server to predict the auxiliary data needed by UAV video collector for video coding. In addition, our proposed solution can also accommodate the movement direction change when the control signal is notified in advance. Finally, the prototype system is implemented with the real world data set, and the experiment results show that our proposed solution can significantly save the computation time with little bitrate distortion performance loss.

AB In autonomous vehicle technology, environmental perception is a very important part of the whole system. The robustness and accuracy of the perception determine the performance of the whole system. Compared with the camera, lidar can generate point cloud data which can provide accurate 3D information better. At present, more researches focus on environmental perception through point cloud. However, the point cloud has the characteristics of sparsity, unordered and non-uniform distribution, its processing method is also different from the general image-based method. In this paper, we proposed a method of semantic segmentation of point cloud which is realized by convolutional neural network. Through spherical mapping, the scattered point cloud is transformed into 2D spherical map with dense and uniform distribution, which is convenient for the processing of the network. To reduce the loss of point information, the spatial position, reflection intensity information and angle value of point are preserved during spherical mapping. Our work includes a lightweight convolutional neural network that fuses point cloud and image information. In addition, a spatial module is added to supplement the loss of spatial information and improve the performance of segmentation. Finally, a series of comparative experiments and performance evaluation are carried out, which show that the proposed method is not only much better than the original structure, but also better than another image and lidar fusion network in the segmentation of each category.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB With the ability to provide long range, highly accurate 3D surrounding measurements, while lowering the device cost, non-repetitive scanning Livox lidars have attracted considerable interest in the last few years. They have seen a huge growth in use in the fields of robotics and autonomous vehicles. In virtue of their restricted FoV, they are prone to degeneration in feature-poor scenes and have difficulty detecting the loop. In this paper, we present a robust multi-lidar fusion framework for self-localization and mapping problems, allowing different numbers of Livox lidars and suitable for various platforms. First, an automatic calibration procedure is introduced for multiple lidars. Based on the assumption of rigidity of geometric structure, the transformation between two lidars can be configured through map alignment. Second, the raw data from different lidars are time-synchronized and sent to respective feature extraction processes. Instead of sending all the feature candidates for estimating lidar odometry, only the most informative features are selected to perform scan registration. The dynamic objects are removed in the meantime, and a novel place descriptor is integrated for enhanced loop detection. The results show that our proposed system achieved better results than single Livox lidar methods. In addition, our method outperformed novel mechanical lidar methods in challenging scenarios. Moreover, the performance in feature-less and large motion scenarios has also been verified, both with approvable accuracy.

AB Underwater 3D laser scanners are an essential type of sensor used by unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) for operations such as navigation, inspection and object recognition and manipulation. These sensors need to be able to provide highly accurate 3D data at fast refresh rates in order to accomplish these tasks. Usually, these scanners rely on a rotating mirror actuated by a galvanometer. However, the light planes steered by this type of mirrors are typically deformed into cones due to refraction. In order to produce accurate results, this distortion needs to be taken into account, which increases the computational cost of the 3D reconstruction. A novel approach consisting in using a biaxial MEMS mirror is proposed in this paper. The second rotational degree of freedom of the mirror can be used to project optimally curved light shapes, so that the refraction process transforms them into planes. Being able to model the light surfaces as planes rather than cones can significantly reduce the computation time of the 3D reconstruction. In order to do so, an exhaustive model of the complete light trajectories is presented. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper constitutes the first attempt to model and counteract the distortion in the scanning pattern introduced by a biaxial mirror and a double refraction process in the context of underwater robotics.

AB New technologies based on artificial agents promise to change the next generation of autonomous systems and therefore our interaction with them. Systems based on artificial agents such as self-driving cars and social robots are examples of this technology that is seeking to improve the quality of people's life. Cognitive architectures aim to create some of the most challenging artificial agents commonly known as bio-inspired cognitive agents. This type of artificial agent seeks to embody human-like intelligence in order to operate and solve problems in the real world as humans do. Moreover, some cognitive architectures such as Soar, LIDA, ACT-R, and iCub try to be fundamental architectures for the Artificial General Intelligence model of human cognition. Therefore, researchers in the machine ethics field face ethical questions related to what mechanisms an artificial agent must have for making moral decisions in order to ensure that their actions are always ethically right. This paper aims to identify some challenges that researchers need to solve in order to create ethical cognitive architectures. These cognitive architectures are characterized by the capacity to endow artificial agents with appropriate mechanisms to exhibit explicit ethical behavior. Additionally, we offer some reasons to develop ethical cognitive architectures. We hope that this study can be useful to guide future research on ethical cognitive architectures.

AB We study a recently introduced smart compact automated parking system (CAPS), deploying straddle carriers, which require little footprint area. The straddle carriers can elevate and move a car over other cars in the horizontal direction in deep storage lanes, thereby considerably increasing the car storage capacity. Customers can reserve a parking space with a mobile application, or just drive in. Customers with booking by mobile application receive priority over the drive-in customers. We build priority queueing network models to evaluate the performance of a CAPS with priority booking under two storage policies. We then develop approximation methods to solve the analytical models and validate them through simulation. Numerical experiments show that the waiting time of a customer with booking can be reduced by 9.2% and 3.4%, respectively, for the dedicated and shared storage policies, compared with systems without priority booking. Then we compare the dedicated and shared storage policies and conduct a sensitivity analysis on the arrival rates of two types of cars. To minimise the expected retrieval time, the optimal ratio of width to height should be around 1.3. Finally, we calculate the investment cost of a CAPS and compare it with a competitive cylindrical automated parking tower.

AB In many warehouses shuttle-based technologies have replaced the traditional AS/R system based storage technologies. The impact these systems have on downstream order picking performance is largely unknown. To study the interactions between upstream storage and downstream picking systems, we develop a novel analytical model for integrated storage and order picking systems. The resulting semi-open queuing model is solved using the matrix-geometric method. Using the queuing network model, we are able to study the effect of storage system technology on order throughput times, and the effect of the picking station input buffer size on order picking performance. Further, we analyze the effect of a constant work-in-process (CONWIP) control for orders on system performance. Our results indicate that using SBS/R instead of AS/R-based storage systems yields investment cost savings (i.e., fewer aisles in the storage area and fewer picking stations), paired with a lower total throughput time at a given order arrival rate. Numerical studies show how the total throughput time, first, benefits and then becomes stable by increasing the input buffer size at the picking stations. Retrieving item tote at the storage system in advance with respect to the picker availability is also advantageous, especially in the SBS/R system. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB Locating the position of a remote node on a wireless network is becoming more relevant, as we move forward in the Internet of things and in autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes a new system to implement the location of remote nodes. A new prototype Android application has been developed to collect real measurements and to study the performance of several smartphone's sensors and location algorithms, including an innovative one, based on the second order cone programming (SOCP) relaxation. The application collects the WiFi access points information and the terminal location. An internal odometry module developed for the prototype is used when Android's service is unavailable. This paper compares the performance of existing location estimators given in closed form, an existing SOCP one, and the new SOCP location estimator proposed, which has reduced complexity. An algorithm to merge measurements from non-identical terminals is also proposed. Cooperative and terminal stand-alone operations are compared, showing a higher performance for SOCP-based ones, that are capable of estimating the path loss exponent and the transmission power. The heterogeneous terminals were also used in the tests. Our results show that the accurate positioning of static remote entities can be achieved using a single smartphone. On the other hand, the accurate real-time positioning of the mobile terminal is provided when three or more scattered terminal nodes cooperate sharing the samples taken synchronously.

AB The hydrodynamic characteristics and body shape of catfish, Hypostomus, are used to design and develop an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) named ZRAUV for subsea pipeline and cable inspection. Among the hydrodynamic characteristics, stability of this bio-inspired AUV, which may be adversely affected by disturbances such as marine currents during inspection process, is taken into consideration and evaluated both numerically and experimentally. Concerning numerical investigation, computational fluid dynamics based on Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations are applied to compute the hydrodynamic damping derivatives needed for stability analysis. In order to verify the numerical predictions, computations are also performed for the well-known submarine body with a typical axisymmetric hull shape, SUBOFF. Experiments are also carried out for both proposed AUV and a conventional axisymmetric one using self-propulsion tests. Measurements of turning rate in turning circle maneuver are in reasonably good agreement with those of numerical estimations and indicate that the turning rate of conventional bodies like SUBOFF is approximately 3.8 times as great as that of bio-inspired AUV. In other words, the findings reveal that in comparison with common axisymmetric bodies, the proposed AUV with biological hull shape is more stable by about 99%, thus, it is highly suitable for subsea pipeline and cable inspection.

AB For a target search of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in a completely unknown three-dimensional (3D) underwater environment, a multi-AUV collaborative target search algorithm based on adaptive prediction is proposed in this paper. The environmental information sensed by the forward-looking sonar is used to judge the current state of view, and the AUV system uses this environmental information to perform the target search task. If there is no target in the field of view, the AUV system will judge whether all sub-regions of the current layer have been searched or not. The next sub-region for searching is determined by the evaluation function and the task assignment strategy. If there are targets in the field of view, the evaluation function and the estimation function of the adaptive predictive optimization algorithm is used to estimate the location of the unknown target. At the same time, the algorithm also can reduce the positioning error caused by the noise of the sonar sensor. In this paper, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can not only deal with static targets and random dynamic interference target search tasks, but it can also perform target search tasks under some random AUV failure conditions. In this process, the underwater communication limits are also considered. Finally, simulation experiments indicate the high efficiency and great adaptability of the proposed algorithm.

AB In this paper, we consider domain search tasks using a human-agent collaborative team. An automated Bayesian sequential decision-making strategy is first proposed for the optimal allocation of manual and autonomous sensing modes in the presence of sensing uncertainty. An agent will generate a request for human intervention whenever the manual mode is deemed optimal. However, this type of optimal strategy is not always the style of human decision making under uncertainty. In particular, regret has been shown to play a critical role in human's rational decision making. Humans experience regret when they perceive that they are better off with another option and tend to make choices to avoid such experience. Furthermore, it has been shown that team members who share the same mental model perform better than teams with a more accurate but less similar mental model. Therefore, to enable more effective humanagent collaboration (HAC) and improve joint performance, we embed regret analysis into the proposed decision-making framework to provide suboptimal but more humanlike automated decision aids. We will reconcile the dominant Bayesian methods with the analysis of human behaviors during decision making. We provide the simulation results to compare the decision-making strategies with and without regret analysis and show that regret-based decision making can integrate human tendency in risk averse and risk seeking for better HAC.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the impacts of the communication time-delays to the distributed containment control of the second-order multi-agent systems with directed topology.
   Design/methodology/approach - A basic theoretical analysis is first carried out for the containment control of the second-order multi-agent systems under directed topology without communication time-delay and a sufficient condition is proposed for the achievement of containment control. Based on the above result and frequency-domain analysis method, a sufficient condition is also derived for the achievement of containment control of the second-order multi-agent systems under directed topology with communication time-delays. Finally, simulation results are presented to support the effectiveness of the theoretical results.
   Findings - For the achievement of containment control of the second-order multi-agent systems under directed topology with communication time-delay, the control gain in the control protocols is completely dependent on the communication topology structure and the maximum of time-delay in the control protocols is dependent on the given control gain and communication topology structure.
   Originality/value - The paper investigates the containment control of the second-order multi-agent systems under directed topology with communication time-delays and presents a sufficient conditions for the achievement of containment control. The results and approach proposed in the paper may benefit interesting researchers.

AB The objective of this research is to propose and investigate a new design of the Cylindrical Automated Storage and Retrieval System (C-AS/RS) and provide a performance comparison of the two types of Storage/Retrieval Mechanisms (SRM I and SRM II) for the system configurations with different input/output location numbers and positions. Although the better performance is expected from of the system with SRM II, because it contains the vertically independent moving load handling devices (LHDs) compared to the interconnected LHDs used in SRM I, the vertically independent movement requires more sophisticated equipment which should be considered by the system designers. Hence, the performance investigation is required to identify the differences between the two types of the SRMs for different C-AS/RS configurations. For this purpose, the detailed simulation model of the C-AS/RS was developed, investigated for various combinations of system parameters and the multiple regression models for predicting system performance measures were developed (adjusted R-square greater than 0.83 for all models). The differences of the performance measures were evaluated and showed that SRM II achieved 7 divided by 20% higher load retrieval rates compared to SRM I for all investigated parameter combinations. The investigation also showed that the number and position of the input/output locations had a significant impact on the system performance.

TI Model-based approach to the detection and classification of mines in

ID SHAFER EVIDENCE THEORY; SEGMENTATION; IMAGES; FUSION
AB This paper presents a model-based approach to mine detection and classification by use of sidescan sonar. Advances in autonomous underwater vehicle technology have increased the interest in automatic target recognition systems in an effort to automate a process that is currently carried out by a human operator. Current automated systems generally require training and thus produce poor results when the test data set is different from the training set. This has led to research into unsupervised systems, which are able to cope with the large variability in conditions and terrains seen in sidescan imagery. The system presented in this paper first detects possible minelike objects using a Markov random field model, which operates well on noisy images, such as sidescan, and allows a priori information to be included through the use of priors. The highlight and shadow regions of the object are then extracted with a cooperating statistical snake, which assumes these regions are statistically separate from the background. Finally, a classification decision is made using Dempster-Shafer theory, where the extracted features are compared with synthetic realizations generated with a sidescan sonar simulator model. Results for the entire process are shown on real sidescan sonar data. Similarities between the sidescan sonar and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging processes ensure that the approach outlined here could be made applied to SAR image analysis.

AB We overview our recent research on planetary mobility. Products of this effort include the Field Integrated Design & Operations rover (FIDO), Sample Return Rover (SRR), reconfigurable rover units that function as an All Terrain Explorer (ATE), and a multi-Robot Work Crew of closely cooperating rovers (RWC). FIDO rover is an advanced technology prototype; its design and field testing support NASA's development of long range, in situ Mars surface science missions. Complementing this, SRR implements autonomous visual recognition, navigation, rendezvous, and manipulation functions enabling small object pick-up, handling, and precision terminal docking to a Mars ascent vehicle for future Mars Sample Return. ATE implements on-board reconfiguration of rover geometry and control for adaptive response to adverse and changing terrain, e.g., traversal of steep, sandy slopes. RWC implements coordinated control of two rovers under closed loop kinematics and force constraints, e.g., transport of large payloads, as would occur in robotic colonies at future Mars outposts. RWC is based in a new extensible architecture for decentralized control of, and collective state estimation by multiple heterogeneous robotic platforms-CAMPOUT; we overview the key architectural features. We have conducted experiments with all these new rover system concepts over variable natural terrain. For each of the above developments, we summarize our approach, some of our key experimental results to date, and our future directions of planned development.

AB In emergency rescue missions, rescue teams can use UAVs and efficient path planning strategies to provide flexible rescue services for trapped people, which can improve rescue efficiency and reduce personnel risks. However, since the task environment of UAVs is usually complex, uncertain, and communication-limited, traditional path planning methods may not be able to meet practical needs. In this paper, we introduce a whale optimization algorithm into a deep Q-network and propose a path planning algorithm based on a whale-inspired deep Q-network, which enables UAVs to search for targets faster and safer in uncertain and complex environments. In particular, we first transform the UAV path planning problem into a Markov decision process. Then, we design a comprehensive reward function considering the three factors of path length, obstacle avoidance, and energy consumption. Next, we use the main framework of the deep Q-network to approximate the Q-value function by training a deep neural network. During the training phase, the whale optimization algorithm is introduced for path exploration to generate a richer action decision experience. Finally, experiments show that the proposed algorithm can enable the UAV to autonomously plan a collision-free feasible path in an uncertain environment. And compared with classic reinforcement learning algorithms, the proposed algorithm has a better performance in learning efficiency, path planning success rate, and path length.

AB The underwater environment is a harmful environment, yet one of the richest and least exploited. For these reasons the idea of a robotic companion with the task of supporting and monitoring divers during their activities and operations has been proposed. However, the idea of a platoon of robots at the diver's disposal has never been fully addressed in these proposals due to the high cost of implementation and the usability, weight and bulk of the robots. Nevertheless, recent advancements in swarm robotics, materials engineering, deep learning, and the decreasing cost of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), have rendered this concept increasingly viable. Therefore, this paper introduces, in the first part, a novel framework that integrates a revised version of a gesture-based language for underwater human-robot interaction (Caddian) based on insights gained from extensive field trials. The newly introduced objective of this framework is to enable the cooperation and coordination of an AUV team by one or more human operators, while allowing a human operator to delegate a robot leader to instruct the other robotic team members. The work, in the second part, provides an evaluation of the new language proposed thanks to a fifty million sentence corpus and describes a comparison framework, which is used to estimate it with respect to other existing underwater human-robot interaction languages.

AB In this contribution, a novel framework for joint broadcast-unicast downlink transmissions using dual-polarized aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is proposed. The objective is to maximize the energy efficiency by jointly designing the active beamforming at the base station and the passive beamforming at the RIS. The optimization problem to maximize the system's energy efficiency is formulated and solved using a two-stage algorithm. To tackle the non-convex nature of the problem, an alternating technique, where the optimization is decomposed into two sub-problems, is proposed. In the first stage, the passive beamforming matrix of the dual-polarized aerial RIS is designed based on the Gaussian randomization method, which relaxes the inhomogeneous non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) into a semi-definite program. In the second stage, the active beamforming at the base station is designed based on a dual-structured beamforming approach, in which the interior point method is used to obtain the prebeamforming matrix, and the beamforming matrices pertaining to the unicasting and broadcasting are obtained based on low-complexity zero-forcing and successive convex approximation, respectively. Numerical results and comparisons are provided. In particular, it is shown that the polarization-based communication system yields higher energy efficiency gains as compared to a system implementing layered division multiplexing.

AB Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a critical research area with numerous domains, e.g., blind navigation, autonomous driving systems, and service robots. There exist two challenges in this research field: spatio-temporal interaction modeling among pedestrians and the uncertainty of pedestrian trajectories. To tackle these challenges, we propose a spatio-temporal interaction aware and trajectory distribution aware graph convolution network. First, we propose a spatio-temporal interaction aware module that integrates a graph convolutional network and self-attention mechanism to model spatio-temporal interactions among pedestrians. Second, we design a trajectory distribution aware module to learn latent trajectory distribution information from the measured trajectories at observed and future times. This can provide knowledge-rich trajectory distribution information for the multimodality of the predicted trajectories. Finally, to address the problem of the propagation and accumulation of prediction errors, we design a trajectory decoder to generate the multimodal future trajectories. The proposed model is evaluated utilizing videos recorded by a camera sensor in crowded areas and can be applied to predict multiple pedestrians' future trajectories from in-vehicle cameras. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve superior results on the average displacement error (ADE) and final displacement error (FDE) metrics to state-of-the-art approaches and can predict socially acceptable future trajectories.

AB As a promising sequential decision-making algorithm, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied in many fields. However, the related methods often demand a large amount of time before they can achieve acceptable performance. While learning from demonstration has greatly improved reinforcement learning efficiency, it poses some challenges. In the past, it has required collecting demonstration data from controllers (either human or controller). However, demonstration data are not always available in some sparse reward tasks. Most importantly, there exist unknown differences between agents and human experts in observing the environment. This means that not all of the human expert's demonstration data conform to a Markov decision process (MDP). In this paper, a method of reinforcement learning from generated data (RLfGD) is presented, and consists of a generative model and a learning model. The generative model introduces a method to generate the demonstration data with a one-dimensional deep convolutional generative adversarial network. The learning model applies the demonstration data to the reinforcement learning process to greatly improve the effectiveness of training. Two complex traffic scenarios were tested to evaluate the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that RLfGD is capable of obtaining higher scores more quickly than DDQN in both of two complex traffic scenarios. The performance of reinforcement learning algorithms can be greatly improved with this approach to sparse reward problems.

AB Many distributed frameworks use a message-oriented middleware to interchange information among several independent distributed modules. Those modules make up complex systems implementing basic actions and reporting events about their state. This paper introduces the Message Interpreted Petri Net (MIPN) model to design, analyze, and execute the central control of these middleware systems. The MIPN is a new Petri net extension that adds message-based high-level information communications and hierarchic capabilities. It also contributes to the definition and study of new properties such as terminability for the hierarchy-wide analysis of a system. Special attention is given to the analyzability of the model. Useful relations between the individual properties of each MIPN and the global properties of a hierarchic MIPNs system are extracted through a mathematical analysis of the model. The goal is to analyze each net separately and then build up the properties of the whole system. This results in a great aid for the programmer and optimizes the development process. This paper also shows the actual integration of this new MIPN model in different robot control frameworks to design, analyze, execute, monitor, log, and debug tasks in such heterogeneous systems. Finally, some applications created with this framework in the fields of robotics, autonomous vehicles, and logistics are also presented.

ID SIMULATION
AB In this paper, we consider an underwater linear network, where an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) gathers data from a set of underwater devices. The AUV monitors a set of physical processes, where the status of each process can be sensed by one or more devices and each device is capable of sensing one or more processes. The AUV needs to maintain freshness of its information status about the monitored processes. To quantify the freshness of the information at the AUV, we consider the concept of the age of information (AoI), which represents the amount of time elapsed since the most recently delivered update information was generated. A framework is proposed to optimize the AUV's linear movement trajectory and scheduling of process status updates with the objective of minimizing the normalized weighted sum of the average AoI of the monitored physical processes. The formulated optimization problem is a non-convex mixed integer problem, which cannot be solved by the standard optimization techniques. We develop a solution approach based on the technique of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Specifically, we leverage an actor-critic DRL approach to find the optimum locations and stopping time of the data gathering points. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed framework maintains robustness under different scenarios and provides better performance when compared with baseline and K-means clustering approaches.

AB Automotive imaging radars require high angular resolution which can be achieved by a large antenna aperture. In order to obey Nyquist spatial sampling rate, a large number of array elements and receive channels is required. In practice, this solution results in a prohibitively high cost and complexity. This work proposes a new cognitive receiver configuration, in which a large number of sensor array elements is connected to a small number of receive channels via a switching matrix. The state of the switching matrix is sequentially updated using information from previous observations and prior information. According to the proposed scheme, denoted as cognitive antenna selection (CASE), the state of the switching matrix is obtained by the minimization of conditional Bayesian bounds on the mean-squared-error of the direction-of-arrival estimate. We show that the Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound (BCRB) is an inappropriate optimization criterion since it ignores the effect of ambiguity. This work proposes the Bobrovski-Zakai bound (BZB), which accounts for the effect of ambiguity, as a criterion for cognitive antenna selection. The performance of the proposed CASE-BZB approach is evaluated via simulations in single and multiple target scenarios. It is shown that the CASE-BZB outperforms random and linear switching algorithms both asymptotically and in the threshold region.

AB Radars are expected to become the main sensors in various civilian applications, ranging from health-care monitoring to autonomous driving. Their success is mainly due to the availability of both low cost integrated devices, equipped with compact antenna arrays, and computationally efficient signal processing techniques. An increasingly important role in the field of radar signal processing is played by machine learning and deep learning techniques. Their use has been first taken into consideration in human gesture and motion recognition, and in various healthcare applications. More recently, their exploitation in object detection and localization has been also investigated. The research work accomplished in these areas has raised various technical problems that need to be carefully addressed before adopting the above mentioned techniques in real world radar systems. In this manuscript, a comprehensive overview of the machine learning and deep learning techniques currently being considered for their use in radar systems is provided. Moreover, some relevant open problems and current trends in this research area are analysed. Finally, various numerical results, based on both synthetically generated and experimental datasets, and referring to two different applications are illustrated. These allow readers to assess the efficacy of specific methods and to compare them in terms of accuracy and computational effort.

It has been applied to many fields of production and life, medical information, industrial manufacturing, and service industries. Heterogeneous binocular vision typically uses a camera to simulate the sensory acquisition process of humans. To process the target information, multiple viewpoints observe the same motion scene. Finally, multiple pairs of images are obtained from different viewpoints. Three-dimensional reconstruction has long been one of the important research fields of computer vision. It has great application value in robot autonomous navigation vision, self-driving vehicle, and automatic detection field and freedom degree mechanical device control. In the robot application of visual positioning technology, with the development needs, the level of intelligence of the robot is also gradually increasing. The three-dimensional reconstruction technology combined with the principle of heterogeneous binocular vision has important practical significance for completing the technique of the dribble track of soccer robots. Based on the RoboCup soccer robot competition, this paper uses the heterogeneous binocular vision technology to analyze the kinematics of the soccer robot in detail. By analyzing the basic motion characteristics of soccer robots, a three-dimensional reconstruction technology model of its dribble trajectory is established, and the reliability, practicability and rationality of the design are verified.

AB The advance of digital agriculture combined with computational tools and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has enabled the collection of data for reliably extracting vegetation indices and biophysical parameters derived from the Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm. This work aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the photogrammetry technique using an SfM point cloud for the estimation of the height (h) and crown diameter (d) of coffee trees from aerial images obtained by UAV with an RGB (Red, Green, Blue) camera and compared the results with data measured in situ for 12 months. The experiment was carried out in a coffee plantation, Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil. A rotary-wing UAV was used in autonomous flight mode and coupled to a conventional camera, flying at a height of 30 m with an image overlap of 80% and a speed of 3 m/s. The images were processed using PhotoScan software, and the analyses were performed in Qgis. A correlation of 87% was obtained between the h values in the field and h values obtained by the UAV, and there was a 95% correlation between the d values obtained in the field and the values obtained by the UAV. It was possible to obtain significant estimates of the attributes, such as the h and d of coffee trees, using UAV-SfM images acquired with an RGB digital camera.

ID BRANCH
AB Safety-related vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication plays an essential role in road safety and requires stringent high reliability and low latency. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of joint power control and resource allocation mode selection to solve the resource allocation problem of the mixed centralized/distributed V2X communication system under different network load conditions. Two major resource allocation modes are considered for V2X communication: scheduled resource allocation (centralized system) and UE autonomous resource selection mode (distributed system). In order to meet the specific quality-of-service-related demands of safety-related V2X communication, we aim to maximize overall information value of V2X communication by considering both ProSe Per-Packet Priority and communication link quality of V2X messages while meeting the requirements of minimum SINR and maximum transmit power limitation for both pedestrian user equipments (PUEs) and vehicular user equipments (VUEs). In particular, scenarios where the network is lightly loaded we propose Vacant Resource Blocks and Power Allocation algorithm while for scenarios where in the network is heavily loaded we propose Occupied Resource Blocks and Power Allocation algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can achieve a stable matching between VUEs and their reuse PUEs partners. Extensive simulation results show that both the information value of VUEs as well as the spectral efficiency of PUEs can be improved efficiently by the proposed approach.

AB 3D CPS (Cyber Physical System) data has been widely generated and utilized for multiple applications, e.g. autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicle and so on. For large-scale 3D CPS data analysis, 3D object retrieval plays a significant role for urban perception. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end domain adaptation framework for cross-domain 3D objects retrieval (C3DOR-Net), which learns a joint embedding space for 3D objects from different domains in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we focus on the unsupervised case when 3D objects in the target domain are unlabeled. To better encode a 3D object, the proposed method learns multi-view visual features in a data-driven manner for 3D object representation. Then, the domain adaptation strategy is implemented to benefit both domain alignment and final classification. Specifically, an center-based discriminative feature learning method enables the domain invariant features with better intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. C3DOR-Net can achieve remarkable retrieval performances by maximizing the inter-class divergence and minimizing the intra-class divergence. We evaluate our method on two cross-domain protocols: 1) CAD-to-CAD object retrieval on two popular 3D datasets (NTU and PSB) in three designed cross-domain scenarios; 2) SHREC' 19 monocular image based 3D object retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly boost the cross-domain retrieval performances.

AB A 2003 high-resolution magnetic survey conducted by the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle ABE over the low-temperature, ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal field Lost City reveals a weak positive magnetic anomaly. This observation is in direct contrast to recent observations of strong positive magnetic anomalies documented over the high-temperature ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal vents fields Rainbow and Ashadze, which indicates that temperature may control the production of magnetization at these sites. The Lost City survey provides a unique opportunity to study a field that is, to date, one of a kind, and is an end member of ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal systems. Our results highlight the key contribution of temperature on magnetite production resulting from serpentinization reactions. Whereas high temperature promotes significant production and partitioning of iron into magnetite, low temperature favors iron partitioning into various alteration phases, resulting in a magnetite-poor rock. Moreover, the distribution of magnetic anomalies confirms results of a previous geological survey indicating the progressive migration of hydrothermal activity upslope. These discoveries contribute to the results of 25 yrs of magnetic exploration of a wide range of hydrothermal sites, from low- to high temperature and from basalt- to ultramafic-hosted, and thereby validate using high-resolution magnetics as a crucial parameter for locating and characterizing hydrothermal sites hosting unique chemosynthetic-based ecosystems and potentially mineral-rich deposits.

AB Observations of a cyclonic gyre in an ice-covered, midsize (< 5 km(2)), temperate lake are presented. Horizontal and vertical measurements of temperature and electrical conductivity measurements were collected using a conductivity-temperature-depth logger mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle and additional instrumentation. These measurements revealed a cylindrical density anomaly with a radius of similar to 110 m extending from the surface to similar to 14 m depth. The observed radius is smaller than the internal Rossby radius of deformation (similar to 200 m), which suggests a cyclogeostrophic balance between centripetal, Coriolis, and pressure forces. The maximum azimuthal velocity, calculated assuming this balance, was similar to 2.1 cm s(-1) at 6-8 m depth. The Rossby number associated with this velocity was 1.7; this is consistent with the cyclogeostrophic assumption (i.e., Rossby number > 1) and nearly twice that of similar under-ice eddies in the Arctic Ocean. The estimated Ekman spin-down timescale is 1.5-15 d, but despite this, the gyre appeared to be relatively unchanged over 6 d of field observations. This persistence implies the gyre was forced over the course of the field study; however, the source of the forcing is unknown. Horizontal temperature transects at and below the bottom of the gyre revealed coherent temperature fluctuations suggestive of vertical transport associated with the gyre.

AB A field program was implemented on a fringing reef located on Oahu, Hawaii, to investigate the dispersion characteristics of near-bed dye plumes, tracked using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with an onboard fluorometer. The combination of moored and AUV-based measurements collected synchronously in this study allowed us not only to observe the dispersion characteristics of individual plumes, but importantly to isolate the flow structures directly responsible for dispersion under a variety of forcing conditions. The evolution of several plumes was observed, each influenced by different wave (surface and internal), current, and stratification conditions. The observed dispersion was caused by both turbulent dispersion and plume meandering. Lateral turbulent dispersion coefficients were roughly an order of magnitude greater than previous observations on sandy beach sites, which is likely attributable to the enhanced surface wave-induced mixing and the large physical roughness of the reef. For a large portion of the 2-week experiment the effects of meandering dominated over turbulent dispersion (on average 1.5 times greater). The meandering was the result of large-scale cross-reef current variability. Moored thermistor chain data on the forereef suggest that the source of this cross-reef flow variability were packets of solitary waves that accompanied the propagation of baroclinic bores up the reef slope. Baroclinic bores dissipated before they reached the inner reef when surface wave conditions were large, resulting in the reduction of plume meandering during this period.

AB The adverse weather conditions have brought considerable difficulties in vision-based applications, which are closely related to the driving safety of autonomous vehicles. However, to date, the greater part of the existing environmental perception studies are under ordinary conditions, and the method to deal with the adverse weather conditions was ignored. Hence, this paper proposes an all-in-one gated adversarial network (AIO-GAN) to improve the performance of vision-based environment perception algorithms under adverse weather conditions, including in rain, haze, lack of light, etc. Three key technical contributions are made. At first, the deep learning based gated transformer module was proposed to classify the input mixed images to different collections by passing them through different branches. Second, the multi-branch based variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network was proposed to solve the ill-pose problem of the solution. Third, high-level weight sharing encoders was given out to guarantee the stability and the high quality of the training process. In this way, the unified clean-style images can be achieved, even if the mixed multi-modal images are transferred from the source domain of complex weather scenes. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method has achieved better performance than state-of-the-arts and improved the accuracy of target detection.

AB In this paper, the adaptive clustering quasi-line search path planning algorithm (ACPP) is proposed from the viewpoint of non-convex optimization in an artificial potential field (APF). In ACPP, the initial path is the trajectory of the optimization process from the initial point to the target one. In a complex environment, the drivable area is divided by the edges into many relatively isolated regions, which leads to a non-convex path planning problem. Therefore, the clustering based on path nodes is set adaptively to make the potential function of each isolated region convex in the potential field. In each isolated region, the environment can be perceived by updating the parameters with sampling based on probability distribution functions, and these functions have similar influence to the cost function in optimization. Inspired by convex optimization, the quasi-line search algorithm is proposed for sampling points. Therefore, ACPP reduces the number of samples, dramatically, and has advantages of both sampling-based and APF-based algorithms in path planning. Based on the line segment based map which can be obtained from sensors readily, a gridding strategy is used to further reduce the time complexity. A series of simulation and experiential results validate the effectiveness of ACPP in virtual and real-world environments, respectively.

AB Demand responsive transit (DRT) echoes the new requirements of modern travel on flexibility and carbon reduction, as well as achieving a better match between demand and supply. However, many DRTs still failed. An important step named adaptability analysis helps to understand the context, desirability, and feasibility of introducing DRT. An adaptability analysis includes three sub-questions. Question 1 focuses on policy, regulation, funding, and technologies. Question 2 looks at the interactions of travel demand with operation parameters such as fare and fleet size. Question 3 tries to figure out the impacts of DRT on mobility, society, and the environment. To answer Question 1, macro-level methods collect information and generalise from empirical knowledge, including experience and barriers from real-world operation cases. To answer Question 2, meso-level methods determine the operation mode of DRT by quantifying related factors and establishing evaluation models or boundary condition decision models. To answer Question 3, micro-level methods use microscopic models for simulating the interaction between passengers and vehicles under different scenarios. This paper further discusses the advantages, disadvantages, and future directions of adaptability analysis methods of DRT. Overall, DRT presents great potential and future adaptability analysis should be developed by considering new trends in DRT and more complex and practical-oriented scenarios.

AB There is great interest in automatically detecting road weather and understanding its impacts on the overall safety of the transport network. This can, for example, support road condition-based maintenance or even serve as detection systems that assist safe driving during adverse climate conditions. In computer vision, previous work has demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning in predicting weather conditions from outdoor images. However, training deep learning models to accurately predict weather conditions using real-world road-facing images is difficult due to: (1) the simultaneous occurrence of multiple weather conditions; (2) imbalanced occurrence of weather conditions throughout the year; and (3) road idiosyncrasies, such as road layouts, illumination, and road objects, etc. In this paper, we explore the use of a focal loss function to force the learning process to focus on weather instances that are hard to learn with the objective of helping address data imbalances. In addition, we explore the attention mechanism for pixel-based dynamic weight adjustment to handle road idiosyncrasies using state-of-the-art vision transformer models. Experiments with a novel multi-label road weather dataset show that focal loss significantly increases the accuracy of computer vision approaches for imbalanced weather conditions. Furthermore, vision transformers outperform current state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks in predicting weather conditions with a validation accuracy of 92% and an F1-score of 81.22%, which is impressive considering the imbalanced nature of the dataset.

AB Attitude control of a novel regional truss-braced wing (TBW) aircraft with low stability characteristics is addressed in this paper using Reinforcement Learning (RL). In recent years, RL has been increasingly employed in challenging applications, particularly, autonomous flight control. However, a significant predicament confronting discrete RL algorithms is the dimension limitation of the state-action table and difficulties in defining the elements of the RL environment. To address these issues, in this paper, a detailed mathematical model of the mentioned aircraft is first developed to shape an RL environment. Subsequently, Q-learning, the most prevalent discrete RL algorithm, will be implemented in both the Markov Decision Process (MDP) and Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) frameworks to control the longitudinal mode of the proposed aircraft. In order to eliminate residual fluctuations that are a consequence of discrete action selection, and simultaneously track variable pitch angles, a Fuzzy Action Assignment (FAA) method is proposed to generate continuous control commands using the trained optimal Q-table. Accordingly, it will be proved that by defining a comprehensive reward function based on dynamic behavior considerations, along with observing all crucial states (equivalent to satisfying the Markov Property), the air vehicle would be capable of tracking the desired attitude in the presence of different uncertain dynamics including measurement noises, atmospheric disturbances, actuator faults, and model uncertainties where the performance of the introduced control system surpasses a well-tuned Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller.

AB Forecasting pedestrian trajectories in complex dynamic environments is highly critical for the application of autonomous vehicles and robots. Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel pedestrian trajectory prediction model called CTSGI, which, utilizes self-attention mechanism to construct an interactive graph between pedestrians and their neighbors based on their spatial relationship, to model the crowd's interaction. At the same time, it uses self-attention to extract the temporal dependence for a single pedestrian. In order to effectively model the interaction between the pedestrian and the context, such as where a pedestrian can walk or approach, the semantic segmentation of background image is utilized. CTSGI estimates the goal points of pedestrian and their neighbors to assist in predicting the future trajectory. In addition, the causal structure model is used to analyze the confounding factors existing in the encoding stage, and Do-calculus is introduced for eliminating the confounding impact to improve the prediction performance. Moreover, extensive experiments are conducted for the proposed model on ETH and UCY datasets, and clearly, the experimental results reveal that the model reported herein outperforms the comparative state-of-the-art methods by 27.59% in Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 8.33% in Final Displacement Error (FDE). Furthermore, visualization of attention indicates that our model can capture the interaction between some specific pedestrian and their neighbors better.

AB Short response time for order processing is important for modern warehouses, which can be potentially achieved by adopting appropriate storage policy. This paper models and analyses shuttle-based compact storage systems under random and class-based storage policies using a probability and queueing based approach. The ABC curve and the basic Economic Order Quantity model are used to determine the assignment of storage locations under class-based storage policy. The performance measures are obtained by using an iterative approach based on parametric-decomposition. The analytical model is validated against simulations and the results show our model can accurately estimate the system performance. Numerical experiments based on a real case are carried out. The results show that the best performance is likely to be provided by a class-based storage policy with a steep ABC curve and a skewed demand rate distribution. Multiple system configurations in terms of number of tiers, depth/width ratio, size of storage positions and velocity of system resources are also analyzed. The results suggest benefits of class-based storage policy regardless of the number of tiers. Moreover, the class-based storage policy outperforms the random storage policy in the system with a small depth/with ratio. However, the random storage policy is recommended for the system with deep storage lanes.

AB Cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as collaborative robots, smart cities, and autonomous vehicles, are seen as decisive contributions to addressing many societal challenges. These systems have the power to provide solutions to cope with an aging population, address climate change, and improve issues of health, public safety and mobility. As a product of the fourth industrial revolution, these systems are currently inviting much interest. However, there are barriers that need to be considered and understood to be able to optimise the potential of these systems to support a more sustainable future. To this end, transdisciplinary skills and a combination of different mindsets are needed to be able to ask the right questions at the right time.There are several approaches that can help us to initiate constructing innovative, transformative, future-oriented and systematic ideas and questions. The three important approaches that are suggested in this article are systems mindset, design mindset and futuristic mindset. These mindsets combined with the transdisciplinary perspective - where different disciplines work jointly to create sustainable solutions not only for today but also for tomorrow - have the power to change the world. This article underlines the importance of transdisciplinarity, presents the three mindsets and illustrates a hypothetical use case on how to blend these three mindsets to enable creative work in the future's transdisciplinary world for human-centred and sustainable future.

AB The use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) has increased in a wide range of sectors, including the oil and gas industry, military, and marine research. The AUV capabilities to operate without a direct human operator and untethered to a support vessel are features that have aroused interest in the marine environment. The localization of AUV is significantly affected by the initial alignment and the calibration of the navigation sensors. In this sense, this paper proposes a thorough observability analysis applied to the latter problem. The observability analysis is carried out considering three types of sensor fusion integration and a set of maneuvers, and the results are validated through numerical simulations. As main contribution of this paper, it is shown how the addition of position errors in the observation vector can decouple some gyro and accelerometer biases from the latitude and altitude errors, particularly in the stationary observability analysis. The influence of oscillations in the diving plane and typical AUV maneuvers are analyzed, showing their relative impacts on the degree of observability of the inertial measurement unit (IMU)/Doppler velocity log (DVL) misalignment and DVL scale factor error. Finally, the state's estimation accuracy is also analyzed, showing the limitation of the degree of observability as an assessment tool for the estimability of the states.

AB A large part of oil spills happen near busy marine fairways. Presently, oil spill detection and monitoring are mostly done with satellite remote sensing algorithms, or with remote sensors or visual surveillance from aerial vehicles or ships. These techniques have their drawbacks and limitations. We evaluated the feasibility of using fluorometric sensors in flow-through systems for real-time detection of oil spills. The sensors were capable of detecting diesel oil for at least 20 days in laboratory conditions, but the presence of CDOM, turbidity and algae-derived substances substantially affected the detection capabilities. Algae extract was observed to have the strongest effect on the fluorescence signal, enhancing the signal in all combinations of sensors and solutions. The sensors were then integrated to a FerryBox system and a moored SmartBuoy. The field tests support the results of the laboratory experiments, namely that the primary source of the measured variation was the presence of interference compounds. The 2 month experiments data did not reveal peaks indicative of oil spills. Both autonomous systems worked well, providing real-time data. The main uncertainty is how the sensors' calibration and specificity to oil, and the measurement depth, affects oil detection. We recommend exploring mathematical approaches and more advanced sensors to correct for natural interferences.

AB Drone usage is increasing and drone-wildlife interactions are likely to increase in frequency and occurrence. These interactions can have adverse consequences for drones (e.g., damage or loss due to aggressive wildlife behaviour) and/or for wildlife (e.g., injury, disturbance). This study aims to understand how drone pilots perceive the acceptability of candidate management solutions, which could form possible codes of conduct. Commercial, conservation and recreational pilots (n = 285) were surveyed. Pilots considered 11 of 13 candidate management solutions to manage drone-wildlife interactions as acceptable (83.3% of all responses reflected greater acceptability than unacceptability), however, this support was associated with underlying values and beliefs, indexed by the Wildlife Value Orientations (WVO) and Inclusion of Nature in Self (INS) scales. Specifically, the higher a pilot scored on the social affiliation dimension of WVO, the more they supported a range of measures to avoid deleterious impacts on wildlife. Pilots with stronger Appropriate Use beliefs were less supportive of "planning and operational protocols" to reduce impacts. Pilots reporting no connection to nature (INS scale), were less supportive of planning and operational protocols to accommodate wildlife compared with pilots reporting some connection to nature, but the analysis was unbalanced. The broad level of support for most management among most pilots suggests pilots in our sample may be amenable to codes of conduct which minimise deleterious drone-wildlife interactions.

AB The formation of a reliable joint between a large number of aluminum strands for battery applications is crucial in automotive industry, especially in the technology of autonomous vehicles. Therefore, in this study, mechanical deformations and diffusion patterns of the mating interface in ultrasonic welding of aluminum were investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, microscopic observations of the joints between aluminum strands from ultrasonic welding illustrating the influence of two process parameters were done. To study the nanomechanics of the joint formation, two aluminum crystallites of different orientations were built. The impact of the sliding velocity and the compression rate of the upper crystal block on the diffusion pattern at the interface of the two crystallites were quantified via the diffusion coefficient. Tensile deformations of several joint configurations were performed to investigate the load-bearing capacity of the solid state bond, taking into account the compression rate, the sliding velocity and the crystallite orientation. The atomic scale simulations revealed that the orientations of the crystallites govern the interface diffusion and the tensile strength of the joint significantly. Furthermore, interface atom diffusion increased with increasing the sliding velocity. Additionally, it was observed that a higher sliding velocity enhances the friction heat generation between the crystallites and significantly increases the interface temperature.

AB As the research and development of autonomous vehicles has become more active, lane detection technologies for providing road information have become key elements. There are limits to detecting lanes in dynamic driving environments in conventional machine vision research, as the approaches are generally dependent on expert scenarios and fine-tuned heuristics. Deep learning has shown good performance in classifying target information with this distribution of nonlinear data; thus, many studies have actively applied deep learning to lane detection. However, most of these studies have focused on improving the accuracy, rather than on the operating speed. For the work reported herein, a benchmarking deep-learning framework for lane detection was applied with lightened feature extraction modules and decoder modules. These were used to compare performances and to present an indicator for selecting a model for optimizing real-time performance and accuracy. The VGG-16, MobileNet, and ShuffleNet networks were used for the encoder module, whereas frontend dilation and UNet were used for the decoder module. The limitations of the benchmarking framework were analyzed, and perspective loss concepts were applied to the processing of the network using front-view images to ensure improvements in the accuracy and operating speed. All of the candidate networks obtained objective performance indicators based on a large-scale benchmark dataset (TuSimple) and network training with a dataset collected and verified via performance on public roads in Singapore.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; MANEUVER GENERATION
AB Model predictive control (MPC) is a multi-objective control technique that can handle system constraints. However, the performance of an MPC controller highly relies on a proper prioritization weight for each objective, which highlights the need for a precise weight tuning technique. In this paper, we propose an analytical tuning technique by matching the MPC controller performance with the performance of a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller. The proposed methodology derives the transformation of a LQR weighting matrix with a fixed weighting factor using a discrete algebraic Riccati equation (DARE) and designs an MPC controller using the idea of a discrete time linear quadratic tracking problem (LQT) in the presence of constraints. The proposed methodology ensures optimal performance between unconstrained MPC and LQR controllers and provides a sub-optimal solution while the constraints are active during transient operations. The resulting MPC behaves as the discrete time LQR by selecting an appropriate weighting matrix in the MPC control problem and ensures the asymptotic stability of the system. In this paper, the effectiveness of the proposed technique is investigated in the application of a novel vehicle collision avoidance system that is designed in the form of linear inequality constraints within MPC. The simulation results confirm the potency of the proposed MPC control technique in performing a safe, feasible and collision-free path while respecting the inputs, states and collision avoidance constraints.

AB This paper addresses a dual closed-loop fast integral terminal sliding mode control method of a multi-underactuated AUV formation system with uncertain model parameters and environmental disturbances. Different from the traditional sliding mode control method, this technique can not only keep the formation stable, but also significantly overcomes the problem that the formation tracking errors of the traditional method may not converge to zero in finite time. Then, an adaptive radial basis function (RBF) neural network controller is incorporated with a conditional integrator to deal with the uncertain model parameters, approximation errors and environmental disturbances in practical multi-AUV systems. And also the proposed controller is continuous with the property of chattering restraining. A virtual leader is adopted on the basis of the leader-following strategy to improve the robustness of the formation system and prevent the problem of formation collapse caused by the failure of the leader AUV. Moreover, the rigorous stability analysis based on Lyapunov method and numerical simulations demonstrate tracking errors converge to 0 in finite time. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation controller: the AUV formation can track the desired trajectory accurately with +/- 10% model parameter perturbation.

AB Liquid-handling robots are designed to dispense sub-microliter quantities of fluids for applications including laboratory tests. When larger amounts of liquids are involved, sloshing must be considered as a parameter affecting stability, which is of significance for autonomous vehicles. The measurement and quantification of slosh in enclosed volumes poses a challenge to researchers who have traditionally resorted to tracking the air-liquid interface for two-phase flow analysis. There is a need for a simpler method to predict rollover in these applications. In this work, a novel solution to address this problem is proposed in the form of the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) of a dynamic liquid region. Computational experiments of a partially filled, two-dimensional liquid vessel were carried out using the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method in a finite volume based open-source computational fluid dynamics solver. The movement of the air-liquid interface was tracked, while the Center of Mass and the resulting Zero Moment Point were determined from the numerical simulations at each time step. The computational model was validated by comparing the wall pressure and movement of the liquid-free surface to experimentally obtained values. It was concluded that for a dynamic liquid domain, the Zero Moment Point can be instrumental in determining the stability of partially filled containers subjected to sloshing.

AB Risk management is a well-known method to face technological challenges through a win-win combination of protective and proactive approaches, fostering the collaboration of operators, researchers, regulators, and industries for the exploitation of new markets. In the field of autonomous and unmanned aerial systems, or UAS, a considerable amount of work has been devoted to risk analysis, the generation of ground risk maps, and ground risk assessment by estimating the fatality rate. The paper aims to expand this approach with a tool for managing data protection risks raised by drones through the design of flight maps. The tool should allow UAS operators choosing the best air corridor for their drones based on the so-called privacy by design principle pursuant to Article 25 of the EU data protection regulation, the GDPR. Among the manifold applications of this approach, the design of fly zones for drones can be tailored for public authorities in the phase of authorization of new operations, much as for national Data Protection authorities that have to control the lawfulness of personal data processing by UAS operations. The overall aim is to present the first win-win approach to data protection issues, aerospace engineering challenges, and risk management methods for the threats posed by this technology.

AB Despite an abundant use of the term Out of the loop (OOTL) in the context of automated driving and human factors research, there is currently a lack of consensus on its precise definition, how it can be measured, and the practical implications of being in or out of the loop during automated driving. The main objective of this paper is to consider the above issues, with the goal of achieving a shared understanding of the OOTL concept between academics and practitioners. To this end, the paper reviews existing definitions of OOTL and outlines a set of concepts, which, based on the human factors and driver behaviour literature, could serve as the basis for a commonly-agreed definition. Following a series of working group meetings between representatives from academia, research institutions and industrial partners across Europe, North America, and Japan, we suggest a precise definition of being in, out, and on the loop in the driving context. These definitions are linked directly to whether or not the driver is in physical control of the vehicle, and also the degree of situation monitoring required and afforded by the driver. A consideration of how this definition can be operationalized and measured in empirical studies is then provided, and the paper concludes with a short overview of the implications of this definition for the development of automated driving functions.

AB The harmonic potential field of an incompressible nonviscous fluid governed by the Laplace's Equation has shown its potential for being beneficial to autonomous unmanned vehicles to generate smooth, natural-looking, and predictable paths for obstacle avoidance. The streamlines generated by the boundary value problem of the Laplace's Equation have explicit, easily computable, or analytic vector fields as the path tangent or robot heading specification without the waypoints and higher order path characteristics. We implemented an obstacle avoidance approach with a focus on curvature constraint for a non-holonomic mobile robot regarded as a particle using curvature-constrained streamlines and streamline changing via pure pursuit. First, we use the potential flow field around a circle to derive three primitive curvature-constrained paths to avoid single obstacles. Furthermore, the pure pursuit controller is implemented to achieve a smooth transition between the streamline paths in the environment with multiple obstacles. In addition to comparative simulations, a proof of concept experiment implemented on a two-wheel driving mobile robot with range sensors validates the practical usefulness of the integrated system that is able to navigate smoothly and safely among multiple cylinder obstacles. The computational requirement of the obstacle avoidance system takes advantage of an a priori selection of fast computing primitive streamline paths, thus, making the system able to generate online a feasible path with a lower maximum curvature that does not violate the curvature constraint.

AB This study proposes a new method for detecting curved and straight crop rows in images captured in maize fields during the initial growth stages of crop and weed plants. The images were obtained under perspective projection with a camera installed onboard and conveniently arranged at the front of a tractor. The final goal was the identification of the crop rows which are crucial for precise autonomous guidance and site-specific treatments, including weed removal based on the identification of plants outside the crop rows. Image quality is affected by uncontrolled lighting conditions in outdoor agricultural environments and by gaps in the crop rows (due to lack of germination or defects during planting). Also, different plants heights and volumes occur due to different growth stages affecting the crop row detection process. The proposed method was designed with the required robustness to cope with the above undesirable situations and it consists of three sequentially linked phases: (i) image segmentation, (ii) identification of starting points and (iii) crop row detection. The main contribution is the ability of the method to detect curved crop rows as well as straights rows even with irregular inter-row spaces. The method performance has been tested in terms of accuracy and time processing.

AB Predicting water column integrated phytoplankton biomass from near-surface measurements has been an important effort in marine ecological research, particularly since the advent of satellite remote sensing of ocean color. Quantitative relationships between chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a) at the surface and its depth-integrated magnitude have thus far only been developed for open-ocean waters. Here we develop and test for the first time an extension of open-ocean relationships into ocean-margin waters, specifically the highly productive and variable eastern boundary upwelling ecosystem off the central California coast. This region was chosen because of the unique availability of a 30-year record of ship-based Chl-a profiles measured using consistent methods. The extended relationship allows accurate prediction of integrated biomass from surface measurements. Further, we develop a new set of relationships for predicting the depth-integrated Chl-a from Chl-a measured over a range of discrete depths (i.e., as measured by fluorometers on moorings). The newly developed relationships are tested against 15,000 fluorometric Chl-a profiles obtained from an autonomous underwater vehicle. Surprisingly, the relationship between surface Chl-a and depth-integrated Chl-a holds for profiles with high concentrations of Chl-a in persistent subsurface thin phytoplankton layers (layers <3 m thick and located below the first optical depth). The results have implications for monitoring of algal blooms and for quantifying ocean primary productivity from satellite observations of ocean color.

AB Along with reducing traffic congestion, electric car-sharing (ECS) can also solve travel demand, utilize idle resources, and enhance forms of transportation. Accordingly, university students are identified in Guangzhou, China as a promising customer group for ECS companies. Although university students in Guangzhou, China are unique in the context of ECS, few researchers have studied the factors that influence their willingness to use such services. Hence, this paper investigates the key determinants that affect university students' behavioral intention (BI) to use ECS in Guangzhou, China. Based on an extension of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), this paper examines the effects of the constructs on BI to use ECS and the moderating role of trust in ECS. Based on results from a questionnaire of 486 university students in Guangzhou, China, conditional value (CV) was the most critical driver of BI, followed by personal attitude (PA) and sustainability (SUST). The moderating analysis showed that taking gender, education, and driving experience of university students as control variables, trust was found to have a significant positive moderating impact on the relationship between PA and BI to use ECS, and a significant negative moderating effect of trust on the relationship between CV and BI to use ECS. The implications of these findings are discussed.

AB Robust and accurate localization is a mandatory task for autonomous driving. Global positioning method such as global positioning system (GPS) frequently faces signal blocking or city canyon effects in urban area. Dead reckoning sensors such as wheel/visual odometry (VO) or IMU suffer from cumulative drift and require frequent corrections from external sensors. We believe a topological map that is easily available nowadays can be a cheap and effective global sensor for this task. In this article, a flexible topological-map-based probabilistic filtering framework is proposed to tackle the cumulative error problem. Rather than matching the entire trajectory to the map, we prefer extracting sparse anchor points (APs) on the trajectory and producing correcting results for them during filtering. Considering the large uncertainty the trajectory observation contains, our framework is capable of adaptively correcting multiple positions jointly and updating their states only in situations with low uncertainty. This special mechanism explicitly avoids erroneous determination of the position at large uncertain situations such as dense road crossings or roads with small curvature. The experiments carried out on KITTI and our own datasets with both naive single-lane and more advanced multilane topological maps demonstrate that our method can greatly improve the localization accuracy and effectively constrain the cumulative error within a small bound.

AB Underwater bionic robots are very similar to real underwater creatures in appearance and features. This makes it difficult for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to distinguish their appearance features. Moreover, the existing underwater target detection methods have large model sizes and many parameters. This leads to difficulty in practical application of such UAV methods. To solve this, we propose an underwater camouflaged target recognition algorithm based on an adversarial graph structure. First, the salient features and environmental features of underwater images are fully explored by a custom salient feature extraction network and a related environmental feature extraction network. Second, the camouflaged target graph structure and the natural target graph structure of the fusion environment feature are constructed to obtain the dependency between the target and environment features. Finally, an adaptive frame regression camouflaged target detection network is constructed based on adversarial learning to recognize camouflaged targets and natural targets. In contrast to the existing target recognition model in the simulation of the four datasets of concealed target detection, quantitative underwater image dataset, underwater image enhancement benchmark dataset, and underwater image dataset, the proposed model gets higher average recognition accuracy of 0.820, which is an improvement of 3.4%, and the number of parameters is only 1.2 m. Proved by the experiments, the proposed target recognition algorithm is more effective and superior to the existing algorithms.

AB With respect to navigation practices and real-ship applications, this study provided a stable and reliable technical program for automatic ship navigation. First, an improved route-plan-guided artificial potential field (APF) method was presented by balancing the attractive and repulsive forces, resolving the irrationality and swaying of the collision avoidance (CA) strategy, and extending the applicability of the International Regulations for Pre-venting Collisions at Sea (COLREGS). Second, a fast local path planning (FLPP) method was proposed based on the high-precision ship motion model to obtain the expected CA results in advance, and to promote its acceptance and application by the navigators. Third, a dynamic goal-guided APF method was proposed to navigate a ship to return to its route plan upon completing the CA procedure. A series of CA experiments for different ships and encountering situations were conduct in a simulated environment. Although the varying maneuverability influenced the CA procedure and results, the CA processes and trends were identical, and the track zone width was within 0.10 nm in restricted waters. The real-time CA track sufficiently aligned with the FLPP results, and the ship was able to rapidly return to its route plan and remained within the cross track limit (XTL) according to the set return parameters.

AB This study aims to make sense of the autonomous system and the railway environment for railway vehicles. For this purpose, by determining the railway line, information about the general condition of the line can be obtained along the way. In addition, objects such as pedestrian crossings, people, cars, and traffic signs on the line will be extracted. The rails and the rail environment in the images will be segmented with a semantic segmentation network. In order to ensure the safety of rail transport, computer vision, and deep learning-based methods are increasingly used to inspect railway tracks and surrounding objects. In particular, the extraction of objects around the railway line has become an important task. The dataset contains images of the railway line and its surroundings, which were obtained in changing environmental conditions, at different times of the day, and under poor lighting conditions. In this study, a new method is proposed for the extraction of objects in and around the railway line. The proposed approach first applied Unet-based segmentation methods on the dataset. Then, a method that improves Unet performance based on the ensemble model is proposed. ResNet34, MobileNetV2, and VGG16 backbones were used to improve segmentation performance. The proposed model is based on the ensemble decision-making process, significantly contributing to the semantic segmentation task. Experimental results of the developed model show that it gives 85% accuracy rate and 54% average IoU results.

AB Outdoor point-cloud object localization is an essential processing step for urban scene analysis and modeling in numerous applications, especially in land surveying and site analysis. Given the increasingly use of Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and LiDAR 3D data acquisition, numerous annotated point-cloud datasets are available and can be used to evaluate computer vision and machine learning based algorithms. Nevertheless, current point-cloud datasets mainly focus on object detection and classification in autonomous driving or urban planning type of applications, and share redundant object classes, e.g., trees, vehicles and pedestrians, which limit their usefulness for land surveying and site analysis. This paper introduces a novel 3D benchmark dataset LiSurveying, which is a large-scale point-cloud dataset with over a billion points and uncommon urban object categories in complex outdoor environments. Our dataset incorporates more urban object classes than existing datasets. Its instances have diverse point densities, shapes and dimensions, which also impose a challenge for point -cloud detection and classification algorithms. We conducted baselines experiments for point-cloud classification using machine learning classifiers and deep learning methods on different subsets of the LiSurveying dataset, and we are able to demonstrate that the various types of object classes, number of instances per class, distribution of object points, and variety of complex scenes, make this LiSurveying benchmark dataset suitable for evaluating 3D point-cloud classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection algorithms.

AB The detection and description of feature points are important components of many computer vision systems. For example, in the field of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), these methods form the basis of so-called Visual Odometry (VO) and Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms. In this paper, we present a hardware feature points detection system able to process a 4K video stream in real-time. We use the ORB algorithm-Oriented FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test) and Rotated BRIEF (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features)-to detect and describe feature points in the images. We make numerous modifications to the original ORB algorithm (among others, we use the RS-BRIEF instead of classic R-BRIEF) to adapt it to the high video resolution, make it computationally efficient, reduce the resource utilisation and achieve lower power consumption. Our hardware implementation supports a 4 ppc (pixels per clock) format (with simple adaptation to 2 ppc, 8 ppc, and more) and real-time processing of a 4K video stream (UHD-Ultra High Definition, 3840 x 2160 pixels) @ 60 frames per second (150 MHz clock). We verify our system using simulations in the Vivado IDE and implement it in hardware on the ZCU 104 evaluation board with the AMD Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC device. The proposed design consumes only 5 watts.

AB The Qilian-Haiyuan fault zone in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau has been the source of strong earthquakes in the region. In its middle segment, the Jinqianghe fault is an important active fault within the Tianzhu seismic gap; however, little is known about its slip behavior. To present a new horizontal displacement distribution along this fault, we used WorldView-2 stereo pairs and unmanned aerial vehicle-based photogrammetry to construct digital elevation models to obtain a detailed tectono-geomorphic interpretation and geomorphic offsets. The offset marker measurements yielded 135 geomorphic displacements and 8 offset clusters. Radiocarbon dating was used to establish the regional age sequence of the geomorphic units in offset fluvial terraces at four study sites. The displacements and ages linked the offset clusters with the geomorphic unit sequence; the Holocene strike-slip rate of the Jinqianghe fault was estimated to 4.8-5.6 mm/a at similar to 4-12 ka and 2.9-4.7 mm/a from similar to 4 ka. Three recent earthquakes (with a recurrence interval of similar to 1000 years) represent an active seismic period, revealing the potential seismic hazard along this fault because it has not ruptured in the last 1500 years.

AB Sustainable cities are envisioned to have economic and industrial steps toward reducing pollution. Many real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, traffic signals, and industrial automation can now be trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. These applications are designed to take benefit of DRL in order to improve the monitoring as well as measurements in industrial internet of things for automation identification system. The complexity of these environments means that it is more appropriate to use multi-agent systems rather than a single-agent. However, in non-stationary environments multi-agent systems can suffer from increased number of observations, limiting the scalability of algorithms. This study proposes a model to tackle the problem of scalability in DRL algorithms in transportation domain. A partition-based approach is used in the proposed model to reduce the complexity of the environment. This partition-based approach helps agents to stay in their working area. This reduces the complexity of the learning environment and the number of observations for each agent. The proposed model uses generative adversarial imitation learning and behavior cloning, combined with a proximal policy optimization algorithm, for training multiple agents in a dynamic environment. We present a comparison of PPO, soft actor-critic, and our model in reward gathering. Our simulation results show that our model outperforms SAC and PPO in cumulative reward gathering and dramatically improved training multiple agents.

AB This article provides a survey overview of the techniques, mechanisms, algorithms, and test and validation strategies required for the design of robotic grappling vehicles intended to approach and grapple free-flying client satellites. We concentrate on using a robotic arm to grapple a free-floating spacecraft, as distinct from spacecraft docking and berthing, where two spacecraft directly mate with each other. Robotic grappling of client spacecraft is a deceptively complex problem: It entails designing a robotic system that functions robustly in the visually stark, thermally extreme orbital environment, operating near massive and extremely expensive yet fragile client hardware, using relatively slow flight computers with limited and laggy communications. Spaceflight robotic systems are challenging to test and validate prior to deployment and extremely expensive to launch, which significantly limits opportunities to experiment with new techniques. These factors make the design and operation of orbital robotic systems significantly different from those of their terrestrial counterparts, and as a result, only a relative handful of systems have been demonstrated on orbit. Nevertheless, there is increasing interest in on-orbit robotic servicing and assembly missions, and grappling is the core requirement for these systems. Although existing systems such as the Space Station Remote Manipulator System have demonstrated extremely reliable operation, upcoming missions will attempt to expand the types of spacecraft that can be safely and dependably grappled and berthed.

AB Recent studies highlighted the benefits of a support infrastructure located in Cislunar environment, which would ease the design of forthcoming space missions with a favorable access from and to the lunar surface, the Earth and many interplanetary destinations. Multi-body orbits rose a peculiar interest and were selected to stage a human-robotic exploration outpost; the family of Near Rectilinear Halo Orbits (NRHO), in particular, appears specifically suitable in these regards. Among the different capabilities that such outpost will tend to, the docking with other crewed or autonomous vehicles is a key feature that shall be present. Although low Earth orbit (LEO) rendezvous and docking is well assessed, no mission has performed such task in a multi-body gravitational environment. The paper presents a guidance, navigation and control (GNC) framework for 6 degrees of freedom (6DOF) coupled Cislunar rendezvous and docking. A feasible operational rendezvous scenario is detailed and exploited to define open-loop and closed-loop GNC functions for far-range and close-range. Then, the final approach is analyzed, proposing a closed-loop GNC that encompasses coupled translational-rotational dynamics. Vision-based only relative navigation techniques are applied to Cislunar multi-body dynamics to guarantee a coupled state estimation with a simple suite of sensors and a broad applicability range, ranging from passively cooperative to non-cooperative or unknown target spacecraft.

ID MODEL; ATTENTION
AB Edge agents, represented by socially-aware robots and autonomous vehicles, have gradually been integrated into human society. The safety navigation system in interactive scenes is of great importance to them. The key of this system is that the edge agent has the ability to predict the pedestrian trajectory in the dynamic scene, so as to avoid collision. However, predicting pedestrian trajectories in dynamic scenes is not an easy task, because it is necessary to comprehensively consider the spatial-temporal structure of human-environment interaction, visual attention, and the multi-modal behavior of human walking. In this paper, a scalable spatial-temporal graph generation adversarial network architecture (STG-GAN) is introduced, which can comprehensively consider the influence of human-environment interaction and generate a reasonable multi-modal prediction trajectory. First, we use LSTM nodes to flexibly transform the spatial-temporal graph of human-environment interactions into feed-forward differentiable feature coding, and innovatively propose the global node to integrate scene context information. Then, we capture the relative importance of global interactions on pedestrian trajectories through scaled dot product attention, and use recurrent sequence modeling and generative adversarial network architecture for common training, so as to generate reasonable pedestrian future trajectory distributions based on rich mixed features. Experiments on public data sets show that STG-GAN is superior to previous work in terms of accuracy, reasoning speed and rationality of trajectory prediction.

AB A team of autonomous decision-making robots can be employed for some critical tasks, such as disaster detection, plant protection, and military reconnaissance. The use of such team of robots to perform well is a challenging problem. To address the challenge, a decentralized multi-robot patrolling problem in uncertain environments without prior knowledge is investigated in this paper. First, the patrolling environment is modeled as an undirected graph, and information is attached to the vertex, that follows an unknown discrete Markov chain. Each robot patrols independently within a particular area, where these areas may intersect each other. Robots coordinate their actions periodically to gather as much valuable information as possible. Then, the patrolling problem is cast as a Bayes-adaptive transition-decoupled partially observable Markov decision process formulation. However, it is intractable to solve the multi-robot patrolling problem with complex interactions. To solve the problem, a scalable decentralized online learning and planning algorithm is proposed by extending the Monte Carlo tree search method, which computes patrols that are bounded optimal. In the proposed algorithm, each local look-ahead tree has a low branching factor and the coordinated manner is not complicated. In addition, we benchmark the proposed algorithm against some state-of-the-art online solvers to empirically assess the performance. The results show that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve high performance in typical decentralized patrolling scenarios.

AB Understanding the potential prosperity of municipal economies, the welfare and the role of trade of these economies is an important issue in a world in which more than 50% of the population lives in urban centers. ABC Paulista groups three cities which act as production centers combining the abundance of labor and knowledge with the proximity to big consumer centers. The emergy approach recognizes the existence of deterministic principles in economic systems but emphasizes the role of resources, energy and environment. This approach was applied to ABC Paulista to evaluate municipal potential prosperity in the context of the energy resource constraints and showed that ABC municipalities are not autonomous and depend almost entirely on external resources. Indices for assess the human carrying capacity and the standards of living showed that only 2% of the population could be sustained indefinitely by the local emergy. The results lead to the idea that ABC can be seen as an "industry", which holds the know-how and assets transforming raw materials into vehicles and chemicals that are feedback to the surrounding system. However, the analysis of ABC trade shows that both the Brazilian and the foreign markets take advantage when buying from ABC suggesting that the search for the chances of the prolongation of this specific urban settlement may require different policies and management designs.

AB Ice-penetrating radar profiles across the grounding line of a small ice-rise promontory located within the Roi Baudouin Ice Shelf in the Dronning Maud Land sector of East Antarctica show downward dipping englacial radar-detected reflectors. Model results indicate that this reflector pattern is best fit by including basal melting of at least 15 cm a(-1). This rate of melting is low compared with rates observed on larger ice shelves in both West and East Antarctica. Ice cores extracted from a rift system close to the ice-rise promontory show several meters of marine ice accreted beneath the shelf. These observations of low rates of basal melting, and limited distribution of accreted marine ice suggest that either Antarctic surface water may reach the ice shelf base or that circulation beneath the shelf is likely dominated by the production of high salinity shelf water rather than the incursion of circumpolar deep water, implying a weak sub-shelf circulation system here. Many of the ice shelves located along the coast of Dronning Maud Land are, like Roi Baudouin Ice Shelf, characterized by frequent ice rises and promontories. Therefore, it is highly likely that these are also of shallow bathymetry and are subject to similarly weak side-shelf basal melting and refreezing.

TI GPS-free directional localization via dual wireless radios

   sensor networks
AB Location discovery, especially in mobile environments, has recently become the key component of many applications. Accurate location discovery, particularly in safety critical applications using autonomous robots or unmanned vehicles, however, is still an open problem. Existing popular methods either heavily rely on the use of global positioning systems (GPS) which do not readily lend themselves for use for the majority of applications where precision is of primary concern or are not suitable for ad-hoc deployments. In this paper, we propose a novel directional localization algorithm, called dual wireless radio localization (DWRL), which performs accurate node localizations in the plane using only distances between nodes, without the use of a GPS or nodes with known positions (anchors). The main novelty of DWRL is the use of an additional radio per node to support directional localization in static networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time dual radios are employed in a localization setting. Existence of the dual radios on board enables DWRL algorithm to perform directional localization, which is not possible with existing single radio systems in static networks. We present the practical and theoretical benefits of the use of an additional radio per node in detail, test our algorithm under excessive synthetic and real-world noise scenarios, and show that DWRL algorithm is robust enough to perform directional localization even in high noise environments.

AB A morphobathymetric survey has been carried out of a coastal lagoon south of the modern Po delta (Valle Fattibello, Comacchio). Acquisition of bathymetric data in such an extremely shallow water environment (more than 80% of the area lies between 0 and -1 m) faces technical difficulties that led to the development of 'ad hoc' solutions. Methods to obtain morphobathymetric and reflectivity maps of the lagoon are presented, including descriptions of data acquisition and processing. 'Ground-truthing' of the reflectivity data, provided by analysis of sediment samples, allowed description of the sediment distribution within the lagoon, and the imaging of sedimentary features. Combined analysis of morphobathymetry and reflectivity maps identified arcuate, sand-rich features not in equilibrium with the present-day 'low energy' regime of the lagoon. These features might constitute the substratum over which the lagoon system has been formed, not completely overprinted by anthropogenic and biogeochemical processes at the lagoon bottom. The system we have developed could be used on board remote-controlled or autonomous vehicles that could perform rapid, low-cost surveys and collect data useful for quantitative estimates of sedimentary dynamics. Rapidity and low-cost are important conditions for carrying out periodical surveys, and taking a series of 'snapshots' of the lagoon bottom. This would allow predictive geological models on sediment budgets of these complex environments, characterized by multiple sediment sources and sinks that are difficult to quantify.

AB Pedestrian detection is crucial for crowd surveillance applications and cyber-physical systems that can deliver timely and sophisticated solutions, especially with applications like person identification, person count, and tracking as the number of people rises. Even though the number of cutting-edge neural network-based frameworks for object detection models and pedestrian detection in images has steadily increased, object detection and image classification have made progress in terms of accuracy levels greater than 99% and level of granularity. A powerful object detector, specifically designed for high-end surveillance applications, is needed to position the bounding box, label it and return its relative positions. The size of these bounding boxes can vary depending on the object and its interaction with the physical world. To overcome these limitations and requirements, an extensive evaluation of the state-of-the-art algorithms has been presented in this paper. The work presented in this paper performs object detections on the MOT20 dataset using various algorithms and testing on a custom dataset recorded in our organization premises using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The main contribution of the paper is to tune the hyperparameters of the Yolov5 object detection algorithm to develop a new efficient, simple, and reliable object detector in Surveillance. The modified Yolov5 model outperforms the existing Faster-RCNN, SSD, and YOLO algorithms, according to real-world data experiments, and ensures better object detection with a 61% precision and 44% F measure value.

AB In this article, we aim to design a task scheduling scheme for the underwater multiobjective task of target hunting and environmental search. A distributed autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) network is deployed to perform the task, where AUVs equipped with sensors can cooperatively search the environment and hunt the target by sharing local information. To achieve efficient exploration of the overall environment by the AUV network, we design an intranetwork cooperative searching approach based on the Age of Information (AoI). Besides, it is critical to conceive an energy-efficient mechanism due to the energy constraints of AUVs and the difficulty of sustainable energy supply. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose an energy-efficient distributed multiagent proximal policy optimization (DMAPPO) scheme to perform real-time AUV target hunting and environment searching in underwater turbulent fields. The proposed scheme can adjust the number of AUVs assigned to each objective according to practical requirement and residual energy. Distributed AUVs can make decisions autonomously and cooperatively complete the task efficiently through limited information interaction. In addition, we derive a lower bound on the policy improvement of MAPPO. Moreover, our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the standard algorithms in terms of hunting efficiency, degree of searching, and network energy efficiency.

AB High-Altitude Long-Endurance (HALE) solar-powered Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs) can utilize solar energy as power source and maintain extremely long cruise endurance, which has attracted extensive attentions from researchers. Trajectory optimization is a promising way to achieve superior flight time because of the finite solar energy absorbed in a day. In this work, a method of trajectory optimization and guidance for HALE solar-powered aircraft based on a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework is introduced. According to flight and environment infor-mation, a neural network controller outputs commands of thrust, attack angle, and bank angle to realize an autonomous flight based on energy maximization. The validity of the proposed method was evaluated in a 5-km radius area in simulation, and results have shown that after one day-night cycle, the battery energy of the RL-controller was improved by 31% and 17% compared with those of a Steady-State (SS) strategy with a constant speed and a constant altitude and a kind of state -machine strategy, respectively. In addition, results of an uninterrupted flight test have shown that the endurance of the RL controller was longer than those of the control cases.(c) 2021 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

AB Asynchronous evolutionary algorithms are becoming increasingly popular as a means of making full use of many processors while solving computationally expensive search and optimization problems. These algorithms excel at keeping large clusters fully utilized, but may sometimes inefficiently sample an excess of fast-evaluating solutions at the expense of higher-quality, slow-evaluating ones. We have previously introduced a steady-state parent selection strategy, SWEET ("Selection whilE EvaluaTing"), that sometimes selects individuals that are still being evaluated and allows them to reproduce early. We perform a takeover-time analysis that confirms that this strategy gives slow-evaluating individuals that have higher fitnesses an increased ability to multiply in the population. We also find that SWEET appears effective at improving optimization performance on problems in which solution quality is positively correlated with evaluation time. We evaluate our approach on six simulated real-valued optimization problems and three real-world applications: an autonomous vehicle controller problem that involves tuning a spiking neural network and two adversarial EA problems. We further evaluate SWEET versus a basic asynchronous process in a simulated setting. We present evidence that SWEET outperforms basic asynchronous processes in a use-case in which performance is positively correlated with evaluation time, and performs comparably (and often better) than basic asynchronous processes in several use-cases where performance is negatively correlated with evaluation time. That said, in the cases where performance and evaluation time are negatively correlated the variance of outcomes for SWEET is notably high.

AB The implementation of vehicle electrification and autonomous driving technologies has recently emphasized the importance of abrasion resistance and fuel efficiency of truck bus radial (TBR) tire treads that undergo high loads and long driving times. In this study, a functionalized liquid butadiene rubber (F-LqBR) was introduced to replace the treated distillate aromatic extracted (TDAE) oil as a way to improve abrasion resistance and fuel efficiency in the TBR tire tread compound and to solve the oil migration. First, radical polymerization was used to synthesize nonfunctionalized LqBR (N-LqBR) and amino-LqBR with an amine group at the chain ends. The synthesized LqBRs were then substituted in place of TDAE oil to manufacture carbon-black-filled natural rubber (NR) compounds and to evaluate their physical properties. The results show that LqBRs improved the migration resistance and enhanced the abrasion resistance by lowering the glass transition temperature (T-g) of the compound. In particular, amino-LqBR improved carbon black dispersion in the rubber matrix through a chemical bond between the functional group of the carbon black surface and the base rubber. In conclusion, amino-LqBR successfully served as a processing aid in a carbon black-filled NR compound while simultaneously enhancing its fuel efficiency and abrasion resistance.

AB Accurate positioning of autonomous underwater vehicles is a major challenge. The long-term drift is problematic if global position updates are not available, and for applications such as repeat-pass interferometry and coherent change detection, millimeter accuracy is needed. Repeat-pass synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) micronavigation is one potential technique for countering both challenges. While single-pass SAS micronavigation enabled successful coherent processing within one track, the potential is that repeat-pass SAS micronavigation can support coherent processing between passes. Both techniques are based on recognizing the speckle pattern in the seafloor return, but repeat-pass SAS micronavigation has additional challenges with the larger temporal and spatial separations between the observations. In this study, we investigate the spatial correlation of speckle as observed from SAS systems. We divide the different contributions to spatial decorrelation into three groups: 1) speckle decorrelation; 2) footprint mismatch; and 3) stretching. We examine each contribution separately and develop simplified formulas for their decorrelation baselines. When correlating synthetic aperture images, decorrelation from stretching dominates. When correlating single-element data recorded at low grazing angles common to SAS, speckle decorrelation dominates. We validate our findings on experimental data, and by combining elements into larger effective elements, we demonstrate increasing the across-track baseline for repeat-pass SAS micronavigation updates from less than 1 to 10 m.

AB Knowledge and monitoring of invasive species are fundamental measures to determine the short- and long-term effect on invaded ecosystems, in addition to developing strategies to control the problem or its specific solution. In this context, the lionfish is an invasive species that worries managers and scientists of fisheries and marine conservation, this is due to the affected area that spread starting from the east coast of the United States to the coasts of Brazil and it is recently extending to include the Mediterranean Sea. The diet of the invasive fish is small species of fish, crustaceans and invertebrates; the consequent damage is the decrease of food for species at the next level of the food chain and the lack of species to keep coral reefs healthy. In this paper, we propose a lionfish detection system that will be installed in an autonomous underwater vehicle, as part of a monitoring strategy that will allow real-time determination of the number of Lionfish, their location and without human intervention. We compared two detection systems, namely YOLOv4 and SSD-Mobilenet-v2, by training with cross-validation and evaluation with the test set we obtained the best model with 63.66% recall, 89.79% precision, and 79.15% mAP with images in the natural environment, implemented on NVIDIA's Jetson Nano embedded system.

AB The importance of road characteristics has been highlighted, as road characteristics are fundamental structures established to support many transportation-relevant services. However, there is still huge room for improvement in terms of types and performance of road characteristics detection. With the advantage of geographically tiled maps with high update rates, remarkable accessibility, and increasing availability, this paper proposes a novel simple deep-learning-based approach, namely joint convolutional neural networks (CNNs) adopting adaptive squares with combination rules to detect road characteristics from roadmap tiles. The proposed joint CNNs are responsible for the foreground and background image classification and various types of road characteristics classification from previous foreground images, raising detection accuracy. The adaptive squares with combination rules help efficiently focus road characteristics, augmenting the ability to detect them and provide optimal detection results. Five types of road characteristics-crossroads, T-junctions, Y-junctions, corners, and curves-are exploited, and experimental results demonstrate successful outcomes with outstanding performance in reality. The information of exploited road characteristics with location and type is, thus, converted from human-readable to machine-readable, the results will benefit many applications like feature point reminders, road condition reports, or alert detection for users, drivers, and even autonomous vehicles. We believe this approach will also enable a new path for object detection and geospatial information extraction from valuable map tiles.

AB With recent advances in non-contact sensing technology such as cameras, unmanned aerial and ground vehicles, the structural health monitoring (SHM) community has witnessed a prominent growth in deep learning-based condition assessment techniques of structural systems. These deep learning methods rely primarily on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The CNN networks are trained using a large number of datasets for various types of damage and anomaly detection and post-disaster reconnaissance. The trained networks are then utilized to analyze newer data to detect the type and severity of the damage, enhancing the capabilities of non-contact sensors in developing autonomous SHM systems. In recent years, a broad range of CNN architectures has been developed by researchers to accommodate the extent of lighting and weather conditions, the quality of images, the amount of background and foreground noise, and multiclass damage in the structures. This paper presents a detailed literature review of existing CNN-based techniques in the context of infrastructure monitoring and maintenance. The review is categorized into multiple classes depending on the specific application and development of CNNs applied to data obtained from a wide range of structures. The challenges and limitations of the existing literature are discussed in detail at the end, followed by a brief conclusion on potential future research directions of CNN in structural condition assessment.

AB An algorithm to smooth a sequence of noisy data in R-d with cubic polynomials is herein presented. The data points are assumed to be sequentially ordered, with the idea that they are sampled in time/space and represent an unknown curve to be reconstructed. An example is the reconstruction of left and right borders of a road from GPS and/or lidars data, that is a common problem encountered in applications for autonomous vehicles or for the generation of high definition digital maps. The result is a sequence of denoised points, that ideally, belong to the original unknown curve, which is the basis for an interpolation process that aims at building the best approximating curve. The problem is solved employing a least squares approach, with quasi-orthogonal projections. The possibility to weight the samples is provided, as well as a Tikhonov regularisation term to penalise the magnitude of the derivative of the cubic curve used to smooth the data. The Tikhonov term is weighted with a parameter that is determined applying the Generalised Cross-Validation (GCV), which, in particular cases, can be written in closed form. We show and validate the algorithm on a real application example reconstructing the road borders of the circuit track of Doha, Qatar.

AB The welding deformation considerably plays a vital role in the production accuracy and efficiency of marine structures. In this study, welding deformation due to three outside corner joints (with angles of 60, 70 and 1401 used in an aluminum catamaran hull is evaluated by considering the length and welding speed parameters. The deformation is predicted via two numerical procedures based on finite element computations. Thermal-Elastic-Plastic (TEP) analysis is applied on local 3D solid models for each of the three outside corner joints to calculate inherent strain for global shell model of an aluminum catamaran to obtain deformation elastically based on inherent deformation theory. Validations of numerical results were performed by using metallographic observations and welding distortion. For more accuracy the softening effect was investigated by Vickers Microhardness test. The results from both TEP and FE elastic analyses indicate reasonably good agreement with experimental results. Besides, in the global shell model of the catamaran, out-of-plane welding deformation will occur significantly near the maximum angle of outside corner joint (140-degree) where the maximum welding distortion is obtained. Along with the welding speed parameter has considerable influence on decreasing distortion which results in reducing time-consuming and cost in the catamaran production stage.

TI Reinforcement Learning for Position Control Problem of a Mobile Robot

AB Due to the increase in complexity in autonomous vehicles, most of the existing control systems are proving to be inadequate. Reinforcement Learning is gaining traction as it is posed to overcome these difficulties in a natural way. This approach allows an agent that interacts with the environment to get rewards for appropriate actions, learning to improve its performance continuously. The article describes the design and development of an algorithm to control the position of a wheeled mobile robot using Reinforcement Learning. One main advantage of this approach concerning traditional control algorithms is that the learning process is carried out automatically with a recursive procedure forward in time. Moreover, given the fidelity of the model for the particular implementation described in this work, the whole learning process can be carried out in simulation. This fact avoids damages to the actual robot during the learning stage. It shows that the position control of the robot (or similar specific tasks) can be done without the need to know the dynamic model of the system explicitly. Its main drawback is that the learning stage can take a long time to finish and that it depends on the complexity of the task and the availability of adequate hardware resources. This work provides a comparison between the proposed approach and traditional existing control laws in simulation and real environments. The article also discusses the main effects of using different controlled variables in the performance of the developed control law.

AB The article discusses the application of methods and means of general and satellite oceanology for the high-precision acoustic positioning of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) at distances of hundreds of kilometers from control stations. The authors present the results of analyzing their long-term acoustic ranging studies, which revealed the specific features of low-frequency pulsed signal propagation in different hydrological-acoustic conditions in which underwater sound channels (USCs) of different origin form. Special attention is devoted to the possibility and efficiency of using long-term oceanological observation databases to form the spatiotemporal characteristics of USCs in areas for long-range navigation support to AUVs. Additionally, the authors consider the possibilities of sea surface observation by means of satellites to provide the unit that computes the AUV coordinates with data on the integral (effective) sound speed in the near-surface sound channel (NSSC), which forms in winter. The experimental testing results on applying oceanographic technical tools in the Sea of Japan have shown that they improve the accuracy and reliability of AUV navigation support at distances of hundreds of kilometers from coastal control stations. It is been shown that in summer-autumn and winter hydrological conditions, it is possible to determine the AUV coordinates with errors not exceeding hundredths of a percent at distances of hundreds of kilometers.

TI Real-Time Global Registration for Globally Consistent RGB-D SLAM

DE Simultaneous localization and mapping; Image reconstruction; Autonomous
   vehicles
AB Real-time globally consistent camera localization is critical for visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) applications. Regardless the popularity of high efficient pose graph optimization as a backend in SLAM, its deficiency in accuracy can hardly benefit the reconstruction application. An alternative solution for the sake of high accuracy would be global registration, which minimizes the alignment error of all the corresponding observations, yet suffers from high complexity due to the tremendous observations that need to be considered. In this paper, we start by analyzing the complexity bottleneck of global point cloud registration problem, i.e., each observation (three-dimensional point feature) has to be linearized based on its local coordinate (camera poses), which however is nonlinear and dynamically changing, resulting in extensive computation during optimization. We further prove that such nonlinearity can be decoupled into linear component (feature position) and nonlinear components (camera poses), where the former linear one can be effectively represented by its compact second-order statistics, while the latter nonlinear one merely requires six degrees of freedom for each camera pose. Benefiting from the decoupled representation, the complexity can be significantly reduced without sacrifice in accuracy. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieves globally consistent pose estimation in real-time via CPU computing, and owns comparable accuracy as state-of-the-art that use GPU computing, enabling the practical usage of globally consistent RGB-D SLAM on highly computationally constrained devices.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) networks are used for coordinated missions such as area mapping and remote surveillance. AUVs are typically deployed by a central platform such as a ship or a submarine, and they operate in an unattended environment. Although there is no need for continuous monitoring of AUV nodes, the central platform may occasionally need to send messages, route updates, or mission commands to the AUV fleet Nodes in an AUV network are mobile and self-powered. Moreover, periodic exchange of neighborhood messages is not practical due to large propagation delays. Therefore, reliable, low-latency, and energy-efficient solutions are needed to meet the performance requirements of ad hoc AUV networks. We propose P-AUV as a routing and medium access protocol, which depends on location estimation at each node. Data required for packet relaying decision is carried in the header of each data packet. Loop-free routes are generated, where relay candidates closer to the sink nodes are prioritized. In order to control medium access and to avoid collisions, each node selects a backoff interval according to its own position. We analyze the performance of our solution and we compare P-AUV with probabilistic broadcast in terms of several network parameters. Our results indicate that P-AUV improves packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay along with lifetime of AUV networks.

DT Article
DE multimodal sensor fusion; object detection; feature enhancement
AB In object detection systems for autonomous driving, LIDAR sensors provide very useful information. However, problems occur because the object representation is greatly distorted by changes in distance. To solve this problem, we propose a LIDAR shape set that reconstructs the shape surrounding the object more clearly by using the LIDAR point information projected on the object. The LIDAR shape set restores object shape edges from a bird's eye view by filtering LIDAR points projected on a 2D pixel-based front view. In this study, we use this shape set for two purposes. The first is to supplement the shape set with a LIDAR Feature map, and the second is to divide the entire shape set according to the gradient of the depth and density to create a 2D and 3D bounding box proposal for each object. We present a multimodal fusion framework that classifies objects and restores the 3D pose of each object using enhanced feature maps and shape-based proposals. The network structure consists of a VGG - based object classifier that receives multiple inputs and a LIDAR-based Region Proposal Networks (RPN) that identifies object poses. It works in a very intuitive and efficient manner and can be extended to other classes other than vehicles. Our research has outperformed object classification accuracy (Average Precision, AP) and 3D pose restoration accuracy (3D bounding box recall rate) based on the latest studies conducted with KITTI data sets.

AB In multi-autonomous underwater vehicle (multi-AUV) systems, the convergence rate is characterized by the pace of consistency of the key state information for each member. The topology with leader-follower architecture is designed as a combination of an undirected graph between followers and a digraph between leaders and followers. An overview of influences on convergence rate of the secondorder consensus algorithm is elaborated in three aspects, along with the main contributions in this paper. Specifically, the explicit expression of the maximum convergence rate is established based on the root locus method, and then, the effects of control parameters on the convergence rate are analyzed. Moreover, the in influences of network topologies on the convergence rate are investigated from the view of adjusting the existing connectivity, changing the weights on links, and utilizing hierarchical structure. The combination of consensus and filtering algorithm is also an approach to enhance the capacity of multi-AUV systems. In order to eliminate the accumulated errors in the process of dead reckoning, a collaborative navigation model is presented, and then, a localization approach based on consensus-unscented particle filter algorithm is proposed. Simulations results are provided to verify location performance under the assumption of Gaussian white noise in the systems. In addition, the influences of the topologies on positioning accuracy are explored.

TI Concurrent Performance of Military and Robotics Tasks and Effects of
   Cueing in a Simulated Multi-Tasking Environment
SO PRESENCE-TELEOPERATORS AND VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS
LA English
DT Article
AB We simulated a military mounted crewstation environment and conducted two experiments to examine the workload and performance of the combined position of gunner and robotics operator. The robotics tasks involved managing a semi-autonomous ground robot or teleoperating a ground robot to conduct reconnaissance tasks. We also evaluated whether aided target recognition (AiTR) capabilities (delivered either through tactile or tactile + visual cueing) for the gunnery task might benefit the concurrent robotics and communication tasks. Results showed that participants' gunnery task performance degraded significantly when they had to concurrently monitor, manage, or teleoperate an unmanned ground vehicle compared to the gunnery-single task condition. When there was AiTR to assist them with their gunnery task, operators' concurrent performance of robotics and communication tasks improved significantly. However, there was a tendency for participants to over-rely on automation when task load was heavy, and performance degradations were observed in instances where automation failed to be entirely reliable. Participants' spatial ability was found to be a reliable predictor of robotics task performance, although the performance gap between those with higher and lower spatial ability appeared to be narrower when the AiTR was available to assist the gunnery task. Participants' perceived workload increased consistently as the concurrent task conditions became more challenging and when their gunnery task was unassisted. Individual difference factors such as spatial ability and perceived attentional control were found to correlate significantly with some of the performance measures. Implications for military personnel selection were discussed.

AB This paper investigates the AUV region-tracking control problem with measurement noise and transient and steady-state constraints. To achieve the fluctuation of AUV tracking error within an expected region while satisfying the transient and steady-state performance constraints, this paper proposes an improved nonlinear tracking error transformation method. This method converts the tracking error into a new virtual error variable through nonlinear conversion, thus transforming the above performance requirements for the tracking error into boundedness requirements for the new virtual error variable. In addition, aiming at the problem of measurement noise causing strong fluctuation of the control signal, this paper proposes a finite-time AUV control method based on a two-stage command filter. This method utilizes a finite-time sliding mode differentiator to filter the virtual control signal during the derivation of the control law using the backstepping technique. In light of the signal loss incurred by two-stage filtering and its potential impact on system stability, a finite-time compensator is designed to compensate the signal loss and achieve finite-time stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, simulations conducted using ODIN AUV demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits smooth control signal and low energy consumption characteristics. Furthermore, the tracking error meets the requirements for both transient and steady-state performance, as well as regional tracking.

AB Advances in the versatile design and synthesis of nanomaterials have imparted diverse functionalities to Janus micromotors as autonomous vehicles. However, a significant challenge remains in maneuvering Janus micromotors by following desired trajectories for on-demand motility and intelligent control due to the inherent rotational Brownian motion. Here, we present the enhanced and robust directional propulsion of light-activated Fe3O4@TiO2/Pt Janus micromotors by magnetic spinning and the Magnus effect. Once exposed to a low-intensity rotating magnetic field, the micromotors become physically actuated, and their rotational Brownian diffusion is quenched by the magnetic rotation. Photocatalytic propulsion can be triggered by unidirectional irradiation based on a self-electrophoretic mechanism. Thus, a transverse Magnus force can be generated due to the rotational motion and ballistic motion (photocatalytic propulsion) of the micromotors. Both the self-electrophoretic propulsion and the Magnus force are periodically changed due to the magnetic rotation, which results in an overall directed motion moving toward a trajectory with a deflection angle from the direction of incident light with enhanced speed, maneuverability, and steering robustness. Our study illustrates the admirable directional motion capabilities of light-driven Janus micromotors based on magnetic spinning and the Magnus effect, which unfolds a new paradigm for addressing the limitations of directionality control in the current asymmetric micromotors.

AB The introduction of digital currency electronic payment (DCEP) by the Central Bank of China is conducive to the central bank's timely grasp of macroeconomic dynamics and the internationalization of RMB. As DCEP is one of the first digital currencies issued by the central bank to be used on a large scale internationally, it is necessary to conduct research on its user adoption. Therefore, this research extends the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) to explore factors affecting the adoption of DCEP. The researchers cooperated with city banks that have started to use DCEP, and distributed questionnaires to users in the lobbies of these banks. A total of 295 valid questionnaires were empirically examined with Smart-PLS. The results indicate that perceived fairness, habits, social influence and national identity have significant effects on usage, with p values less than 0.05. National identity is shown to be a significant moderator of the relationships between perceived fairness, habit, perceived risk and usage, with p values less than 0.05. National identity is shown to have no moderating effect between social influence and usage, with a p value greater than 0.05. This research provides the central bank and the government with suggestions to increase user enthusiasm and reduce user perceived risks, thereby promoting the widespread use of DCEP.

AB Recent advances in fifth-generation wireless networks demand quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees to support real-time services such as high-speed mobile networks, autonomous vehicles, and internet-of-things under delay constraints. Since the conventional ergodic capacity proposed by Shannon cannot account for QoS guarantees requirements, a new potential notion was presented to assess the performance of the wireless network in recent studies, which is called the effective capacity (EC). This paper conducts the performance analysis for EC over double shadowed Rician fading channels. To achieve this, the expression for the EC is derived in the closed-form. A truncation error of the expression for the corresponding EC is also derived, which is considerably tight. Furthermore, the consequences of channel and system parameters on the QoS performance of the wireless network are revealed by conducting an asymptotic EC analysis under the sovereignty of high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It is found that asymptotic bound for EC is notably tight and asymptotic EC matches with the analytical EC, when SNR is large (e.g. gamma over bar Additionally, the expressions for the EC of shadowed Rician and Nakagami-q fading channels are deduced as special cases of double shadowed Rician fading. The results for these special cases show similar behaviour of EC as in case of double shadowed Rician fading channels.

ID YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK; GROUP CHASE; ESCAPE; TARGET; STRATEGY;

AB In this paper, we propose and formulate a k-capture game, where a single intruder tries to reach a stationary target that is protected by a swarm of defenders, and the defenders try to intercept (capture) the intruder by a synchronous defense with k-capture (at least k defenders have to synchronously reach the intruder's location to capture it). Assume that the defenders have no explicit task collaboration, no spatio-temporal memory and no speed advantage. Three general collective motions with simple attraction-repulsion interaction between defender pairs are introduced to investigate the dynamics and motion patterns of the k-capture game. The results suggest that such system with merely local spacial attraction-repulsion interaction of defenders already shows very rich and even unexpected motion patterns, including the boundary defense motion pattern, the intruder-follower-and-rounded-up motion pattern, the periodic motion pattern, and the multiple small cohesive groups motion pattern. The results also show that the multiple small cohesive groups motion pattern seems to be the most effective defense motion since the power of the collective is better used. The study of k-capture game provides an insight into the defense-intrusion interaction in nature. This approach can also provide elegant insights for artificial systems, such as escort mission for aircraft, defense mission for military base or territorial boundaries by a swarm of autonomous vehicles.

AB In order to provide a cost-effective indoor positioning and tracking service for autonomous ground vehicles and other important assets in smart factories, we report the theory and experiments for a real-time indoor positioning system using commercially available LED lamps. Inspired by the fundamental theory of the global navigation satellite system, the proposed system uses the phase difference of arrival (PDOA) approach to obtain the time difference of arrival of each carrier transmitted from individual modified LED lamps so as to estimate the receiver position. A prototype of the atto-cellular positioning system covering an area of 2.2 x 1.8 m(2) with a height of 2 m was designed and experimentally demonstrated. For the design, we performed a simulation based on the Cramer-Rao bound to achieve optimal LED lamp arrangement, RF power, and other parameters. Furthermore, a virtual local oscillator for the PDOA scheme was applied to reduce the hardware complexity and to ensure the processing speed. In the experiment, the receiver was mounted on a movable material buffer station in a smart workshop, and the positioning performance was validated by tracking the trajectory of the material buffer station moving within the positioning coverage area. The experimental results show that an average positioning accuracy of similar to 7 cm was achieved. (C) 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

With the rapid development of information technology, the development of three-dimensional underwater acoustic sensor networks (3D UASNs) provides a novel strategy to acquire marine environment information conveniently, efficiently and accurately. However, the specific propagation effects of acoustic communication channel lead to decreased successful information delivery probability with increased distance. Therefore, we investigate two probabilistic neighborhood-based data collection algorithms for 3D UASNs which are based on a probabilistic acoustic communication model instead of the traditional deterministic acoustic communication model. An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is employed to traverse along the designed path to collect data from neighborhoods. For 3D UASNs without prior deployment knowledge, partitioning the network into grids can allow the AUV to visit the central location of each grid for data collection. For 3D UASNs in which the deployment knowledge is known in advance, the AUV only needs to visit several selected locations by constructing a minimum probabilistic neighborhood covering set to reduce data latency. Otherwise, by increasing the transmission rounds, our proposed algorithms can provide a tradeoff between data collection latency and information gain. These algorithms are compared with basic Nearest-neighbor Heuristic algorithm via simulations. Simulation analyses show that our proposed algorithms can efficiently reduce the average data collection completion time, corresponding to a decrease of data latency.

AB Pathogens (and other contaminants) associated with urban storm water runoff plumes have long been recognized as adversely affecting the water quality of the coastal ocean. An understanding of the temporal and spatial characteristics of stormwater plumes is a critical first step in protecting the health of people who recreate in coastal waters. Until recently, characterization of stormwater plumes was limited to expensive vessel-based sampling and satellites, which cannot always provide imagery of the nearshore areas, particularly during storms. With the advent of coastal ocean observing systems with their fixed sensor platforms and autonomous underwater vehicles, we have begun to better understand the temporal and spatial characteristics of stormwater plumes in the coastal ocean. The Pacific Islands Ocean Observing System (PacIOOS) provides continuous environmental monitoring of island coastal waters throughout the Pacific Ocean. This network of new ocean-based monitoring stations enabled the authors to study the effects of two storms on coastal water quality. We find that storm runoff from even a relatively small, partially urbanized watershed can profoundly affect the surface waters of the coastal ocean for days to weeks, both inshore and up to hundreds of meters offshore. Even in these coastal waters exposed to the open ocean, the lower salinities and higher turbidity values indicative of stormwater plumes lingered for nearly two days along the southern coast of O'ahu, Hawai'i.

AB In urban dynamic environment, most of the existing works on LiDAR simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) are based on static scene assumption and are greatly affected by dynamic obstacles. In order to solve this problem, this article is based on fast LiDAR odometry and mapping (F-LOAM) and adopts the FA-RANSAC algorithm, improved ScanContext algorithm, and global optimization to propose a robust and fast LiDAR odometry and mapping (RF-LOAM). First, the region-growing algorithm is used to cluster the fan-shaped grids. Then, we propose the FA-RANSAC algorithm based on feature information and adaptive threshold for dynamic object removal and extract the static edge and planar feature points for the first distortion compensation. Afterward, the estimated pose is calculated by the static feature points and is used to perform the second distortion compensation. Then, the height difference and adaptive distance threshold are used to improve the accuracy of ScanContext, and the efficiency of ScanContext is improved by deleting the loop closure historical matching frames and simplifying the feature matching. Finally, global optimization is used for keyframe. The experimental tests are carried out on the KITTI datasets, Urbanloco datasets, and our Extracted dataset. The results show that compared with the state-of-the-art SLAM methods, our method can not only accurately complete dynamic object removal and loop closure detection but also achieve more robust and faster localization and mapping in urban dynamic scenes.

TI SGFNet: Segmentation Guided Fusion Network for 3D Object Detection

DE Autonomous vehicle navigation; sensor fusion; deep learning for visual

AB The self-driving application requires accurate 3D object detection as it is essential in several tasks, such as path and motion planning. However, up until this point, fusion-based detectors with cameras and LiDAR sensors have always been inferior to LiDAR-only detectors. This can be attributed to the dual scene representation problem caused by the differentiated modality of LiDAR points and images. Moreover, the projection of the image pixels is not guaranteed to reach its point cloud counterparts due to the sparsity of the points, losing image content in the fusion process. Bearing these in mind, we propose Segmentation Guided Fusion Network (SGFNet), an efficient multi-sensor fusion-based 3D object detector. It first separates feature extractions of images and points with unified high-dimensional feature representation through the novel-proposed auxiliary foreground segmentation head, and then projects hierarchical feature maps instead of the raw image pixels onto points to obtain the unified feature map, achieving consistent data modality. Such image feature maps are with several spatial resolutions to keep more image content during the projection process. Finally, the unified feature map is fed into a fusion-based region proposal module and bounding box regression head to generate accurate 3D bounding boxes. Extensive experiments conducted on KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that SGFNet achieves competitive performance on fusion-based 3D object detection tasks and reports a novel state-of-the-art in terms of 3D average precision metric.

AB In this article, we study the problem of minimizing the resource capacity of autonomous agents that cooperate to achieve a shared task. More specifically, we consider high-level planning for a team of homogeneous agents that operate under resource constraints in stochastic environments and share a common goal: given a set of target locations, ensure that each location is visited infinitely often by some agents almost surely. We formalize the dynamics of agents by the so-called consumption Markov decision processes. In a consumption Markov decision process, the agent has a resource of limited capacity. Each action of the agent may consume some amount of the resource. To avoid exhaustion, the agent can replenish its resource to full capacity in designated reload states. The resource capacity restricts the capabilities of the agent. The objective is to assign target locations to agents, and each agent is only responsible for visiting the assigned subset of target locations repeatedly. Moreover, the assignment must ensure that the agents can carry out their tasks with minimal resource capacity. We reduce the problem to an equivalent graph-theoretical problem. We develop an algorithm that solves this graph problem in time that is polynomial in the number of agents, target locations, and size of the consumption Markov decision process. We demonstrate the applicability and scalability of the algorithm in a scenario where hundreds of unmanned underwater vehicles monitor hundreds of locations in environments with stochastic ocean currents.

AB Integrating terrestrial networks with burgeoning high-altitude platform stations (HAPSs) will be a disruptive challenge for beyond-5G systems provisioning large-scale three-dimensional connectivity. Here, we study the problem of forwarding packets between terrestrial terminals and backhaul through multi-HAPS relaying. Considering the limited wireless backhaul, which is the practical constraint of HAPS relaying, dual-hop mixed radiofrequency/free-space optical (RF/FSO) networks are investigated, where backhaul-to-relay and relay-to-user communications employ FSO and RF links, respectively. To maximize the end-to-end network throughput, including downlink and uplink rate, we formulate the optimization problem for variables; the association between aerial and terrestrial terminals, transmit power, and deployment of multiple HAPSs, respectively. We tackle this problem using an iterative algorithm with proposed surrogate functions to efficiently obtain the locally optimal solution. Simulation results corroborate that our proposed optimal method achieves up to 11.3% spectral efficiency compared to the conventional heuristic method. Furthermore, we answer three questions; 1) what the wireless backhaul requirements are, 2) how the number of HAPSs and terrestrial terminals impact the network, and 3) what if a certain user terminal has a particular demand on data rate.

AB Mobile stereo-matching systems have become an important part of many applications, such as automated-driving vehicles and autonomous robots. Accurate stereo-matching methods usually lead to high computational complexity; however, mobile platforms have only limited hardware resources to keep their power consumption low; this makes it difficult to maintain both an acceptable processing speed and accuracy on mobile platforms. To resolve this trade-off, we herein propose a novel acceleration approach for the well-known zero-means normalized cross correlation (ZNCC) matching cost calculation algorithm on a Jetson Tx2 embedded GPU. In our method for accelerating ZNCC, target images are scanned in a zigzag fashion to efficiently reuse one pixel's computation for its neighboring pixels; this reduces the amount of data transmission and increases the utilization of on-chip registers, thus increasing the processing speed. As a result, our method is 2X faster than the traditional image scanning method, and 26% faster than the latest NCC method. By combining this technique with the domain transformation (DT) algorithm, our system show real-time processing speed of 32 fps, on a Jetson Tx2 GPU for 1280x384 pixel images with a maximum disparity of 128. Additionally, the evaluation results on the KITTI 2015 benchmark show that our combined system is more accurate than the same algorithm combined with census by 7.26%, while maintaining almost the same processing speed.

AB Recently, 3D object detection models have achieved very good performance under normal weather conditions, with the SE-SSD model having produced the highest performance by exchanging features between the teacher and student models. However, the performance of this model is significantly reduced by adverse weather conditions. Therefore, instead of training the teacher and student models simultaneously, we applied the knowledge distillation algorithm. In this algorithm, the teacher model is trained first by normal input, and the student model is then trained with distillation and student loss by adverse weather condition input. Although recent research has focused on combining different types of sensor inputs to enhance the original model's performance in inclement weather, there are no studies that directly address the problem of missing points for point clouds. Accordingly, we applied a probability estimation, which includes a Deep Mixture of Factor Analyzers (DMFA) network and loss-convolution layer, to recover lost points. We conducted a model evaluation in both fog and snow environments at three levels of density - light, medium, and heavy - and compared the proposed model's performance with that of two state-of-the-art models: one with normal weather condition, and the other with harsh weather conditions. Consequently, our proposed method was shown to significantly outperform the two existing models.

AB Employing machine learning into 6G vehicular networks to support vehicular application services is being widely studied and a hot topic for the latest research works in the literature. This article provides a comprehensive review of research works that integrated reinforcement and deep reinforcement learning algorithms for vehicular networks management with an emphasis on vehicular telecommunications issues. Vehicular networks have become an important research area due to their specific features and applications such as standardization, efficient traffic management, road safety, and infotainment. In such networks, network entities need to make decisions to maximize network performance under uncertainty. To achieve this goal, Reinforcement Learning (RL) can effectively solve decision-making problems. However, the state and action spaces are massive and complex in large-scale wireless networks. Hence, RL may not be able to find the best strategy in a reasonable time. Therefore, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been developed to combine RL with Deep Learning (DL) to overcome this issue. In this survey, we first present vehicular networks and give a brief overview of RL and DRL concepts. Then we review RL and especially DRL approaches to address emerging issues in 6G vehicular networks. We finally discuss and highlight some unresolved challenges for further study.

AB With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G technologies, more and more applications, such as autonomous vehicles and tele-medicine, become more sensitive to network latency and accuracy, which require routing schemes to be more flexible and efficient. In order to meet such urgent need, learning-based routing strategies are emerging as strong candidate solutions, with the advantages of high flexibility and accuracy. These strategies can be divided into two categories, centralized and distributed, enjoying the advantages of high precision and high efficiency, respectively. However, routing becomes more complex in dynamic IoT network, where the link connections and access states are time-varying, hence these learning-based routing mechanisms are required to have the capability to adapt to network changes in real time. In this paper, we designed and implemented both centralized and distributed Reinforcement Learning-based Routing schemes combined with Multi-optimality routing criteria (RLR-M). By conducing a series of experiments, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the results and arrived at the conclusion that the centralized is better suited to cope with dynamic networks due to its faster reconvergence (2.2 x over distributed), while the distributed is better positioned to handle with large-scale networks through its high scalability (1.6 x over centralized). Moreover, the multi-optimality routing scheme is implemented through model fusion, which is more flexible than traditional strategies and as such is better placed to meet the needs of IoT.

AB We investigated a mud volcano (MV) in a fault zone located at the southern edge of the Kumano Basin, the largest forearc basin along the Nankai Trough. Existing seismic sections show a truncated bottom-simulating reflection by a conduit below a topographic high, indicating the presence of an MV. New shipboard acoustic observations show that the fluid may be seeping through the seafloor, which in turn indicates that there are sufficient fluids for larger scale fluid migration in this area. Autonomous underwater vehicle-based high resolution acoustic observations and pH measurements indicate that soft sediment covers most of the MV and surrounding seafloor and that mud and small amounts of "high-backscattered materials" are sprinkled within the crater and around the MV. The MV type is different from those in the landward part of the Kumano Basin: the southern MV is smaller in size, has a steeper slope angle than the those in the northern Kumano Basin, and is located in a fault zone. The characteristics of this 14th Kumano Basin MV suggest that it is an expression of the larger scale fluid and sediment migration along the southern edge of the Kumano Basin, which may provide information regarding fluid and sediment migration along fault systems in the Nankai Trough accretionary prism.

AB Mapping and localization of mobile robots in an unknown environment are essential for most high-level operations like autonomous navigation or exploration. This paper presents a novel approach for combining estimated trajectories, namely curvefusion. The robot used in the experiments is equipped with a horizontally mounted 2D profiler, a constantly spinning 3D laser scanner and a GPS module. The proposed algorithm first combines trajectories from different sensors to optimize poses of the planar three degrees of freedom (DoF) trajectory, which is then fed into continuous-time simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) to further improve the trajectory. While state-of-the-art multi-sensor fusion methods mainly focus on probabilistic methods, our approach instead adopts a deformation-based method to optimize poses. To this end, a similarity metric for curved shapes is introduced into the robotics community to fuse the estimated trajectories. Additionally, a shape-based point correspondence estimation method is applied to the multi-sensor time calibration. Experiments show that the proposed fusion method can achieve relatively better accuracy, even if the error of the trajectory before fusion is large, which demonstrates that our method can still maintain a certain degree of accuracy in an environment where typical pose estimation methods have poor performance. In addition, the proposed time-calibration method also achieves high accuracy in estimating point correspondences.

AB Modality style -defined as a set of frequent travel modes characterizing the travelers' habits, routines, and predispositions- is a key player in forming dynamics of travelers' mode choice behavior. This study aims to uncover the dynamics of modal preferences while the Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) services operate in the market. Using the 2017 National Household Travel Survey data, a Multiple Discrete Continuous Extreme Value model is developed to analyze the dynamics of individuals' modality style. This model enables us to take into consideration marginal rates of substitutions between different transportation modes. Variables of interest in this analysis include the frequency of use of mobility-on-demand (MoD) services as well as the frequency of walking, biking, transit, and auto trips over the course of a month. The results of this study offer city planners and policymakers an opportunity to better understand the factors underlying modality styles, and which priorities to focus on when designing a sustainable development plan for resident-centric Smart Cities. According to the results, age, work status, education, auto availability, and the built environments are among the significant contributors to the modality styles. The results also indicate that the extent of the substitution relationship between transit and MoD services is highly context dependent.

AB Autonomous navigation on the open sea involving automatic collision avoidance and route planning helps to ensure navigational safety. To judge whether all target ships (TSs) will pass safely and find the optimal route under multi-ship encounter situations, the relationship between the variations in the own ship (OS) velocity vector after nonlinear course altering motion and the collision avoidance result, which is defined as the collision avoidance mechanism, was analyzed. Methods producing the optimal route were also proposed. First, the static collision avoidance mechanism based on the ship domain and velocity obstacle (VO) was introduced. On that basis, the collision-free course alteration range of the OS, without consideration of the real manoeuvring process, was presented. Second, the ship motion equations and fuzzy adaptive proportion integral derivative (PID) control method were combined to develop a course control system. This system was then used to predict OS motions during the course-altering process. Based on this prediction, TS positions were calculated. Subsequently, the dynamic collision-free course altering ranges for the OS were obtained. Third, a model to compute the optimal route was introduced. Finally, simulations were performed under a situation including six TSs and two static objects, and the shortest collision-free route that satisfies both regulations for preventing collisions and good seamanship was found.

ID MANEUVERING TARGET TRACKING; MOTION; ALGORITHM
AB We study the problem of optimally choosing bearing measurement locations for localizing a stationary target in minimum time. The targets are transmitting radio tags, and bearing measurements are acquired from radio signal strength by a robot carrying a direction-sensitive radio antenna. Actively localizing radio tags has many applications in surveillance, search and rescue, and environmental monitoring. Our work is motivated by the task of monitoring radio-tagged invasive fish using autonomous vehicles. An active localization algorithm is provided in order to locate a target up to the desired uncertainty. The time required to locate the target includes time spent traveling as well as taking measurements. Since bearing measurements inferred from radio signals have an inherent ambiguity associated with them, the proposed algorithm chooses measurements to minimize the effect of ambiguous measurements on the target estimate. We present a closed-form bound on the time required to locate a target using the presented active localization strategy. We also present the first known lower bound on the time required by any active localization algorithm (including the unknown optimal). Finally, we bound the ratio of the upper and lower bounds, showing that the expected cost of our algorithm is within a constant factor of the expected cost of the optimal solution. Robust initialization strategies that are motivated by practical sensing limitations are also provided. Our algorithm is shown to reliably locate radio tags to a desired uncertainty in simulations and multiple field experiments.

AB An integrated ocean observatory has been developed and operated in the coastal waters off the central coast of New Jersey, USA. One major goal for the Long-term Ecosystem Observatory (LEO) is to develop a real-time capability for rapid environmental assessment and physical/biological forecasting in coastal waters. To this end, observational data are collected from satellites, aircrafts, ships, fixed/relocatable moorings and autonomous underwater vehicles. The majority of the data are available in real-time allowing for adaptive sampling of episodic events and are assimilated into ocean forecast models. In this observationally rich environment, model forecast errors are dominated by uncertainties in the model physics or future boundary conditions rather than initial conditions. Therefore, ensemble forecasts with differing model parameterizations provide a unique opportunity for model refinement and validation. The system has been operated during three annual coastal predictive skill experiments from 1998 through 2000. To illustrate the capabilities of the system, case studies on coastal upwelling and small-scale biological slicks will be discussed. This observatory is one part of the expanding network of ocean observatories that will form the basis of a national observation network. These regional efforts should be linked through satellite remote sensing and surface current radar systems. Data on the ocean interior will be provided from subsurface AUVs and moorings. The combined data should be available through a network of virtual labs capable of rapid data visualization and dissemination.

AB The vessel trajectory prediction plays a vital role in guaranteeing traffic safety for unmanned surface vehicles and autonomous surface vessels. By leveraging advanced satellite communication technology, AIS provides massive vessel trajectories, significantly enhancing maritime safety and decision-making. This research proposes a spatio-temporal multi-graph transformer network (ST-MGT), aiming to predict multiple vessel trajectories simultaneously. This innovative model amalgamates the capabilities of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and transformer models to proficiently address the spatial and temporal interactions amongst vessels. The ST-MGT is comprised of three crucial layers. The temporal transformer layer employs sophisticated temporal transformer and memory mechanisms to discern the intricate temporal correlations between vessel movements. The spatial multi-graph transformer layer constructs a comprehensive multi-graph representation to illuminate spatial correlations between vessels. It incorporates a spatial graph convolutional network and transformer to meticulously understand and interpret the diverse and complex spatial interactions amongst varying vessels. Lastly, the xi-Regularized LSTM (RegLSTM) layer is implemented for predicting vessel trajectories accurately, based on the unraveled spatio-temporal patterns. Extensive and meticulous experiments reveal that our proposed ST-MGT method transcends other state-of-the-art prediction models in robustness and accuracy. The model's capability to facilitate multi-vessel and multi-step prediction showcases its immense potential and adaptability in intricate and multifaceted navigation environments, underscoring its practical applicability and significance in enhancing maritime navigational safety.

AB The new generation of wireless networks is strengthening ocean development capabilities. The deep-sea detection ability of the offshore platform is being improved by Ocean Internet of Everything (OIoE) system formed by various equipment. This paper studies the application of a new generation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) wireless communication technology in marine monitoring platforms. The purpose is to solve the problem of high data redundancy and high energy consumption in multi-Automatic Underwater Glider (AUG) monitoring. In response to these problems, this paper proposes a matrix completion-based Sampling Points Selection joint Multi-AUG Path Planning (SPS-MAPP) scheme, which includes AUGs path planning and collection information matrix completion. In parts of AUGs path planning, the SPS-MAPP designed a multi-AUG trajectory optimization method using intermittent satellite communication. It proposes a reinforcement learning reward rule based on the idea of artificial potential field, which can effectively increase the coverage of AUGs trajectory. In parts of information processing, the SPS-MAPP proposes a 3-D matrix completion method, which searches for key nodes and edge nodes by designing regular sample points and operators to recover the entire space information. The experimental results show that the proposed SPS-MAPP scheme can effectively improve the subsea monitoring capability of multi-AUG.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are essential assets for ocean exploration requiring reliable underwater positioning technology. Aiming to improve the latter technology in a low SNR and reverberation environment, the Chan-Taylor hybrid positioning algorithm establishes a long-baseline system (LBL) based on the time difference of arrival (TDOA) by reducing the number of sensors required while preserving the positioning accuracy. However, the traditional LBL algorithm's accuracy is reduced due to the critical time delay estimation under such environmental conditions. Hence, this paper suggests a new LBL positioning technology relying on an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to construct a filter function combined with the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation method. MATLAB/Simulink is applied to establish the simulation environment of LBL localization system, simulating the AUV motion under 5-30 dB SNR. This paper analyzes the accuracy of TDOA by generalizing the cross-correlation method (GCC), phase transform (PHAT), ML, and EMD-ML. Based on the TDOA value obtained by the EMD-ML filtering algorithm, the positioning errors of the Chan-Taylor hybrid positioning algorithm and the Chan algorithm are compared. The results show that comparative synthetic evaluations against the traditional GCC demonstrate that the proposed method has a higher time delay estimation accuracy within a reverberation environment with SNR less than 15 dB. The Chan-Taylor hybrid positioning algorithm limits the errors of the CHAN algorithm and improves the overall positioning system accuracy.

AB Line detection is the fundamental image processing technique which has various applications in the field of computer vision. For example, lane keeping required to realize autonomous vehicles can be implemented based on line detection technique. For such purposes, however, low detection latency and power consumption are essential. Using hardware-based stream processing is considered as an effective way to achieve such properties since it eliminates the need of storing the whole frame into energy-consuming external memory. In addition, adopting FPGAs enables us to keep flexibility of software processing. The line segment detector (LSD) is the algorithm based on intensity gradient, and performs better than the well-known Hough transform in terms of processing speed and accuracy. However, implementing the original LSD on FPGAs as a pipeline structure is difficult mainly because of its iterative region growing approach. Therefore, we propose a simple and stream-friendly line segment detection algorithm based on the concept of LSD. The whole system is implemented on a Xilinx Zynq-7000 XC7Z020-1CLG400C FPGA without any external memory. Evaluation results reveal that the implemented system is able to detect line segments successfully and is compact with 7.5% of Block RAM and less than 7.0% of the other resources used, while maintaining 60 fps throughput for VGA videos. It is also shown that the system is power-efficient compared to software processing on CPUs.

AB The emergence of autonomous vehicles with high needs for accuracy in location has hardened the requirements of the positioning systems used for navigation. Local Positioning Systems (LPS) have shown an excellent adaptation to these conditions, thanks to stability and reduction in the levels of positioning uncertainty. The accuracy achieved by methodologies based on temporal measurements depends mainly on the uncertainties in the measurements of these systems. In this aspect, the presence of noise and the existence of temporary instabilities in measurement clocks, depending on the distribution of sensors in the environment, acquire great relevance. In this article, we introduce for the first time in the authors & x2019; best knowledge a Cram & x00E9;r-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) model for the quantification of the global uncertainty in positioning systems caused by both noise and temporary instabilities in the measurement devices. Additionally, this technique is applied to the optimization of sensor distributions for Time of Arrival (TOA), Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and Asynchronous TDOA (A-TDOA) architectures using a Genetic Algorithm in a non-uniform 3D environment. Results show that A-TDOA methodology significantly overcomes synchronous architectures in terms of global accuracy and stability when noise and clock errors are considered in time measurements of LPS applications.

AB Many scholars and policymakers are concerned that the emergence of drone warfarea first step toward the robotics agewill promote instability and conflict at the international level. This view depends on the widely shared assumption among International Relations scholars that military hardware spreads easily, especially in the age of globalization and real-time communications. In this article, we question this consensus. Drawing from the literature in management, we advance a new theory of diffusion of military innovations and test its two underlying causal mechanisms. First, we argue that designing, developing, and manufacturing advanced weapon systems require laboratories, and testing and production facilities, as well as know-how and experience that cannot be easily borrowed from other fields. Second, we argue that the adoption of military innovations requires both organizational and infrastructural support. We test our two claims on three types of combat-effective drones: loitering attack munitions (LAMs), intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance drones (ISR), and unmanned combat autonomous vehicles (UCAVs). We find that even wealthy, advanced, and militarily capable countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France have struggled to produce or adopt such platforms. We conclude that concerns about the diffusion of drone warfare appear significantly exaggerated, as do claims that globalization redistributes military power at the global level. More generally, our analysis sheds light on how the interaction between platform and adoption challenges affects the rate and speed of diffusion of different military innovations.

AB Fully autonomous trajectory planning for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is significant for building the next generation of the logistics industry without human control. This paper presents a method to enable multiple UAVs to fly in the same trajectory without collision. It benefits several applications, such as smart cities and transfer goods, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Different types of nonlinear state estimation are deployed to test the position estimation of drones by treating the information from AirSim as offline dynamic data. The obtained global positioning system sensor data and magnetometer sensor data are determined as the measurement model. The experiment in the simulation is separated into (1) the localization state, (2) the rendezvous state, in which the proposed rendezvous strategy is presented by using the relation between velocity and displacement through the setting area, and (3) the full mission state, which combines both the localization and rendezvous states. The localization state results show the best RMSE in the case of full GPS available at 0.21477 m and 0.25842 m in the case of a GPS outage during a period of time by implementing the ensemble Kalman filter. Similarly, the ensemble Kalman filter performs well with an RMSE of 0.5112414 m in the rendezvous state and demonstrates exceptional performance in the full mission state. Moreover, the experiment is implemented in a real-world situation with some basic drone kits as proof that the proposed rendezvous strategy can truly operate.

AB In remote and harsh sea areas, ocean robots are practical tools to replace humans to execute ocean operations. However, limited power supply constrains the performance of ocean robots, especially in terms of duration time and operation range. Inspired by flying fish, a foldable-wing wave energy converter (FW-WEC) is proposed for ocean robots to extract energy from wave. Equipped with the wave-energy wing, the FW-WEC is capable of switching from the WEC mode that possesses large energy capturing surface to the robot mode with the characteristic of compact structure, which allows for the installation on robots. To satisfy the requirements of the wave-energy wing, several foldable structures are considered and evaluated based on the defined performance index. With the serial four-bar linkage selected and adopted, a prototype of FW-WEC is designed, constructed and tested. The hydrodynamic model is established to analysis the motion response of the prototype under regular wave, of which the accuracy is verified compared with experimental results. According to the wave tank experiment carried out under different wave conditions, the maximum power output of FW-WEC reaches up to 2.6 W and the corresponding capture width ratio is calculated to be 8.0 %. The proposed FW-WEC offers a promising solution for the enhancement of endurance capability of ocean robots.

AB Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection recognizes how persons interact with objects, which is advantageous in autonomous systems such as self-driving vehicles and collaborative robots. However, current HOI detectors are often plagued by model inefficiency and unreliability when making a prediction, which consequently limits its potential for real-world scenarios. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing ERNet, an end-to-end trainable convolutional-transformer network for HOI detection. The proposed model employs an efficient multi-scale deformable attention to effectively capture vital HOI features. We also put forward a novel detection attention module to adaptively generate semantically rich instance and interaction tokens. These tokens undergo pre-emptive detections to produce initial region and vector proposals that also serve as queries which enhances the feature refinement process in the transformer decoders. Several impactful enhancements are also applied to improve the HOI representation learning. Additionally, we utilize a predictive uncertainty estimation framework in the instance and interaction classification heads to quantify the uncertainty behind each prediction. By doing so, we can accurately and reliably predict HOIs even under challenging scenarios. Experiment results on the HICO-Det, V-COCO, and HOI-A datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in detection accuracy and training efficiency.

AB Energy-harvesting-powered sensors are increasingly deployed beyond the reach of terrestrial gateways, where there is often no persistent power supply. Making use of the internet of drones (IoD) for data aggregation in such environments is a promising paradigm to enhance network scalability and connectivity. The flexibility of IoD and favorable line-of-sight connections between the drones and ground nodes are exploited to improve data reception at the drones. In this article, we discuss the challenges of online flight control of IoD, where data-driven neural networks can be tailored to design the trajectories and patrol speeds of the drones and their communication schedules, preventing buffer overflows at the ground nodes. In a small-scale IoD, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning can be developed with long short-term memory to train the continuous flight control of IoD and data aggregation scheduling, where a joint action is generated for IoD via sharing the flight control decisions among the drones. In a large-scale IoD, sharing the flight cont rol decisions in real-time can result in communication overheads and interference. In this case, deep reinforcement learning can be trained with the second-hand visiting experiences, where the drones learn the actions of each other based on historical scheduling records maintained at the ground nodes.

AB Moving Objects Segmentation (MOS) is a crucial step in various computer vision applications, such as visual object tracking, autonomous vehicles, human activity analysis, surveillance, and security. Existing MOS approaches suffer from performance degradation due to extreme challenging conditions in real world complex environments such as varying illumination conditions, camouflage objects, dynamic backgrounds, shadows, bad weathers and camera jitters. To address these problems we pro-posed a novel generative adversarial based framework for moving objects segmentation. Our framework works with one classifier discriminator, one representation learning network and one generator jointly trained to perform MOS in various challenging scenarios. During training the discriminator network acts as a decision maker between real and fake training samples using conditional least squares loss. While the representation learning network provides the difference between the deep features of real and fake training samples using content loss formulation. Another loss term we have exploited to train our gen-erator network is the reconstruction loss that minimizes the difference between the spatial information of real and fake training samples. Moreover, we also propose a novel modified U-net architecture for our generator network showing improved performance over Vanilla U-net model. Experimental evaluations of our proposed method on four benchmark datasets in comparison with thirty-two existing methods has demonstrated the strength of our proposed model.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper considers satellite eavesdroppers in uplink satellite communication systems where the eavesdroppers are randomly distributed at arbitrary altitudes according to homogeneous binomial point processes and attempt to overhear signals that a ground terminal transmits to a serving satellite. Non-colluding eavesdropping satellites are assumed, i.e., they do not cooperate with each other, so that their received signals are not combined but are decoded individually. Directional beamforming with two types of antennas: fixed- and steerable-beam antennas, is adopted at the eavesdropping satellites. The possible distribution cases for the eavesdropping satellites and the distributions of the distances between the terminal and the satellites are analyzed. The distributions of the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at both the serving satellite and the most detrimental eavesdropping satellite are derived as closed-form expressions. The ergodic and outage secrecy capacities of the systems are derived with the secrecy outage probability using the SNR distributions. Simpler approximate expressions for the secrecy performance are obtained based on the Poisson limit theorem, and asymptotic analyses are also carried out in the high-SNR regime. Monte-Carlo simulations verify the analytical results for the secrecy performance. The analytical results are expected to be used to evaluate the secrecy performance and design secure satellite constellations by considering the impact of potential threats from malicious satellite eavesdroppers.

AB The trend to replace internal combustion engines with electric zero-emission drives, visible in the automotive industry, also exists in the shipbuilding industry. In contrary to land vehicles, the requirements for the electric propulsion system of tugs are much greater, which combined with the limited space and energy on board, makes any amount of energy valuable. Strategic changes in the policy of many countries, such as the "Fit for 55" package, introduce plans to significantly reduce CO2 emissions, which favors the development of alternative drives and their introduction to new areas of operation. This article presents that it is possible to reduce the amount of energy an electric tug spends for movement by applying the Particle Swarm Optimization method to modify the shape of its hull. A statistical analysis of public data was performed to determine the speed profiles of actual port tugs. The Van Oortmerssen method was used to determine the hull resistances of the proposed tug and the impact of the hull shape modification sets on reducing these resistances. Based on the six obtained speed profiles, it was determined that one of the tested variants of modifications made it possible to reduce energy consumption on average by 2.12%, to even 3.87% for one of the profiles, and that some modifications increase energy consumption by even 6.59%.

AB Customized path-based speed prediction is an eventful tool for congestion avoidance, route optimization and travel time prediction for navigation apps, cab-hailing companies and autonomous vehicles. Traditionally, the speed prediction algorithms are based on road segments and can only support several main roads. Path-based speed prediction is very challenging since the speed is always changing in different path locations and is jointly affected by lots of complicated factors. This article presents a novel deep learning framework for customized path-based speed prediction. A Path-based Speed Prediction Neural Network (PSPNN) is designed to achieve speed predictions for a given path and attributes information. A hierarchical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and deep Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) structure for different kinds of feature extraction are applied for multiple levels: the path cell, sub-path and the whole path. The method narrows down the prediction unit from road segments to customized path cells (mean length: 59.52m) and achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.94 m/s and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 18.14%, showing the potential of serving rigorous data-driven applications. So far, PSPNN is the first made-to-order path-based speed prediction algorithm and can help both travelers and managers to obtain large-scale bespoke paths speed information in advance.

TI Joint Impact of Rain and Incidents on Traffic Stream Speeds
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; MIXTURES; WEATHER; ROAD
AB Unpredictable and heterogeneous weather conditions and road incidents are common factors that impact highway traffic speeds. A better understanding of the interplay of different factors that affect roadway traffic speeds is essential for policymakers to mitigate congestion and improve road safety. This study investigates the effect of precipitation and incidents on the speed of traffic in the eastbound direction of I-64 in Virginia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that studies the relationship between precipitation and incidents as factors that would have a combined effect on traffic stream speeds. Furthermore, using a mixture model of two linear regressions, we were able to model the two different regimes that the traffic speed could be classified into, namely, free-flow and congested. Using INRIX traffic data from 2013 through 2016 along a 25.6-mi section of Interstate 64 in Virginia, results show that the reduction of traffic speed only due to incidents ranges from 41% to 75% if the road is already congested. In this case, precipitation was found to be statistically insignificant. However, regardless of the incident impact, the effect of light rain in free-flow conditions ranges from insignificant to a 4% speed reduction while the effect of heavy rain ranges from a 0.6% to a 6.5% speed reduction when the incident severity is low but has a roughly double effect when the incident severity is high.

AB In the US, parking is oversupplied in both residential and commercial settings, a consequence of the widespread application of minimum parking standards, which typically supply excess parking for peak-hour demand. Yet the evidence base for specific parking reforms is thin, and alternatives to the peak-hour metric still under-explored. In this illustrative case study, I study time-of-day parking occupancy in a 146-unit apartment complex in Davis, CA to obtain preliminary results, demonstrate new data collection and analysis methods that can be applied at a wider scale, and explore policy analyses that are facilitated by this novel, detailed parking behavior information. First, I systematically observe parking occupancy in the apartment complex to understand hourly variation. I find that the peak and off-peak occupancy rates in the apartment complex are 55% and 34%. I calculate that the 45% of spaces left unused across a day could be converted to roughly 32 new townhouses. I also estimate a multilevel latent class analysis to identify distinct patterns of household parking use and find that 54% of households could be likely candidates for carshare adoption. I conclude by noting implications for housing availability, shared parking standards, the rise of shared and autonomous vehicles, and future research.

AB Upcoming disruptive technologies around autonomous driving of connected cars have not yet been matched with appropriate security by design principles and lack approaches to incorporate proactive preventative measures in the wake of increased cyber-threats against such systems. In this paper, we introduce proactive anomaly detection to a use-case of hijacked connected cars to improve cyber-resilience. First, we manifest the opportunity of behavioral profiling for connected cars from recent literature covering related underpinning technologies. Then, we design and utilize a new data set file for connected cars influenced by the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast surveillance technology used in the aerospace industry to facilitate data collection and sharing. Finally, we simulate the analysis of travel routes in real time to predict anomalies using predictive modeling. Simulations show the applicability of a Bayesian estimation technique, namely, Kalman filter. With the analysis of future state predictions based on the previous behavior, cyber-threats can be addressed with a vastly increased time window for a reaction when encountering anomalies. We discuss that detecting real-time deviations for malicious intent with the predictive profiling and behavioral algorithms can be superior in effectiveness than the retrospective comparison of known-good/known-bad behavior. When quicker action can be taken while connected cars encounter cyber-attacks, more effective engagement or interception of command and control will be achieved.

AB Lane marking detection and localization are crucial for autonomous driving and lane-based pavement surveys. Numerous studies have been done to detect and locate lane markings with the purpose of advanced driver assistance systems, in which image data are usually captured by vision-based cameras. However, a limited number of studies have been done to identify lane markings using high-resolution laser images for road condition evaluation. In this study, the laser images are acquired with a digital highway data vehicle (DHDV). Subsequently, a novel methodology is presented for the automated lane marking identification and reconstruction, and is implemented in four phases: (1) binarization of the laser images with a new threshold method (multi-box segmentation based threshold method); (2) determination of candidate lane markings with closing operations and a marching square algorithm; (3) identification of true lane marking by eliminating false positives (FPs) using a linear support vector machine method; and (4) reconstruction of the damaged and dash lane marking segments to form a continuous lane marking based on the geometry features such as adjacent lane marking location and lane width. Finally, a case study is given to validate effects of the novel methodology. The findings indicate the new strategy is robust in image binarization and lane marking localization. This study would be beneficial in road lane-based pavement condition evaluation such as lane-based rutting measurement and crack classification.

AB The Allan variance is a method to characterize stochastic random processes. The technique was originally developed to characterize the stability of atomic clocks and has also been successfully applied to the characterization of inertial sensors. Inertial navigation systems (INS) can provide accurate results in a short time, which tend to rapidly degrade in longer time intervals. During the last decade, the performance of inertial sensors has significantly improved, particularly in terms of signal stability, mechanical robustness, and power consumption. The mass and volume of inertial sensors have also been significantly reduced, offering system-level design and accommodation advantages. This paper presents a complete methodology for the characterization and modeling of inertial sensors using the Allan variance, with direct application to navigation systems. Although the concept of sensor fusion is relatively straightforward, accurate characterization and sensor-information filtering is not a trivial task, yet they are essential for good performance. A complete and reproducible methodology utilizing the Allan variance, including all the intermediate steps, is described. An end-to-end (E2E) process for sensor-error characterization and modeling up to the final integration in the sensor-fusion scheme is explained in detail. The strength of this approach is demonstrated with representative tests on novel, high-grade inertial sensors. Experimental navigation results are presented from two distinct robotic applications: a planetary exploration rover prototype and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV).

DT Article
AB The EU-funded project UAN (Underwater Acoustic Network) was aimed at conceiving, developing, and testing at sea an innovative and operational concept for integrating underwater and above-water sensors in a unique communication system to protect offshore and coastline critical infrastructures. This work gives details on the underwater part of the project. It introduces a set of original security features and gives details on the integration of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) as mobile nodes of the network and as surveillance assets, acoustically controlled by the command and control center to respond against intrusions. Field results are given of the final UAN project sea trial, UAN11, held in May 2011 in Norway. During the experimental activities, a UAN composed of four fixed nodes, two AUVs, and one mobile node mounted on the supporting research vessel was operated continuously and integrated into a global protection system. In this article, the communication performance of the network is reported in terms of round-trip time, packet loss, and average delivery ratio. The major results of the experiment can be thus summarized: the implemented network structure was successful in continuously operating over five days with nodes seamlessly entering and exiting the network; the performance of the network varied greatly with fluctuations in the acoustic channel; the addition of security features induced a minor degradation in network performance with respect to channel variation; the AUVs were successfully controlled from a remote station through acoustic signals routed by the network.

DT Article

AB A widely applied strategy for workload sharing is to equalize the workload assigned to each resource. In mobile multiagent systems, this principle directly leads to equitable partitioning policies whereby: 1) the environment is equitably divided into subregions of equal measure; 2) one agent is assigned to each subregion; and 3) each agent is responsible for service requests originating within its own subregion. The current lack of distributed algorithms for the computation of equitable partitions limits the applicability of equitable partitioning policies to limited-size multiagent systems operating in known, static environments. In this paper, first we design provably correct and spatially distributed algorithms that allow a team of agents to compute a convex and equitable partition of a convex environment. Second, we discuss how these algorithms can be extended so that a team of agents can compute, in a spatially distributed fashion, convex and equitable partitions with additional features, e.g., equitable and median Voronoi diagrams. Finally, we discuss two application domains for our algorithms, namely dynamic vehicle routing for mobile robotic networks and wireless ad hoc networks. Through these examples, we show how one can couple the algorithms presented in this paper with equitable partitioning policies to make these amenable to distributed implementation. More in general, we illustrate a systematic approach to devise spatially distributed control policies for a large variety of multiagent coordination problems. Our approach is related to the classic Lloyd algorithm and exploits the unique features of power diagrams.

AB This paper presents a framework for onboard trajectory planning and guidance for a large class of autonomously guided parafoils. The problem is for the parafoil to reach a given location at a specified altitude with a specified final heading. Through appropriate change of the independent variable, the trajectory planning problem is converted from a three-dimensional free-final-time problem to a two-dimensional fixed-final-time problem. Using the well-known Dubins path synthesis and known parafoil performance parameters, a concept of altitude margin is developed as a quantitative measure of the available maneuvering energy for use in trajectory planning. A hybrid strategy using two methods to generate kinematically feasible fixed-time trajectories is presented, each targeting a different range of initial values of the altitude margin. The trajectory can be replanned onboard in every guidance cycle, making the guidance effectively closed-loop, or replanned whenever the actual deviation of the actual condition from the reference trajectory exceeds a threshold. The proposed planning and guidance algorithm applies to a large class of parafoil canopies and payloads, which encompasses wide variations in the lift-to-drag ratio, wing loading, and maximum turn rate. The guidance logic has the potential of requiring little or no tuning to accommodate variations in canopy performance. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm with dispersions in canopy performance, loading, wind profile errors, navigation uncertainty, using lateral control only, and using both longitudinal and lateral control.

TI Distributional and hierarchical reinforcement learning for physical

DE Hierarchical reinforcement learning; Distributional reinforcement
   learning; Noisy state observation; Exogenous perturbation
AB Reinforcement learning has shown remarkable success in various applications, and in some cases, even out-performs human performance. However, despite the potential of reinforcement learning, numerous challenges still exist. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that exploits the synergies between hierarchical reinforcement learning and distributional reinforcement learning to address complex sparse-reward tasks, where noisy state observations or non-stationary exogenous perturbations are present. Our proposed method has a hierarchical policy structure, where random rewards are modeled as random variables that follow a value distribution. This approach enables the handling of complex tasks and increases robustness to uncertainties arising from measurement noise or exogenous perturbations, such as wind. To achieve this, we extend the distributional soft Bellman operator and temporal difference error to include the hierarchical structure, and we use quantile regression to approximate the reward distribution. We evaluate our method using a bipedal robot in the OpenAI Gym environment and an electric autonomous vehicle in the SUMO traffic simulator. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in solving complex tasks with the aforementioned uncertainties when compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach demonstrates promising results in handling uncertainties caused by noise and perturbations for challenging sparse-reward tasks, and could potentially pave the way for the development of more robust and effective reinforcement learning algorithms in real physical systems.

AB The distributions of phytoplankton, zooplankton and hydrographic features off the coast of northern Norway were assessed in late April - early May 2019 using ship-based observations (CTD casts and Moving Vessel Profilers) and autonomous vehicles. A satellite chlorophyll climatology was generated to place our in-situ ob-servations within a longer temporal sequence. Substantial spatial and temporal variability on all scales was observed in both the observations and climatology. Spring phytoplankton accumulation usually is initiated in the south on the continental shelf, and advanced in a northerly direction through time. Accumulations in the surface layer of deeper waters off the continental shelf occurred 2-3 weeks later than those on the shelf. During our survey, primary productivity was greatest in offshore waters where nutrients were not depleted and exceeded 2 g C m-2 d-1. The greatest Calanus finmarchicus abundances were associated with low chlorophyll concentrations, suggesting a major impact of grazing on phytoplankton biomass, but estimates of phytoplankton growth and zooplankton removal suggested that Calanus was responsible for a variable fraction (3-69%) of the daily chlo-rophyll changes. Vertical changes in chlorophyll were related to physical features during some transects, but to grazing and sinking in others. Understanding the spatial and temporal variations of the coupling of phyto-plankton to zooplankton is essential to effective management of this important commercial species in Norwegian waters.

AB Architectural tactics enable stakeholders to achieve cyber-resilience requirements. They permit systems to react, resist, detect, and recover from cyber incidents. This paper presents an approach to generate source code for architectural tactics typically used in safety and mission-critical systems. Our approach extensively relies on the use of the EVENT-B formal method and the EVENTB2JAVA code generation plugin of the Rodin platform. It leverages the modeling of architectural tactics in the EVENT-B formal language and uses a set of EVENTB2JAVA transformation rules to generate certified code implementations for the said tactics. Since resilience requirements are statements about a system over time, and because of the fact that the EVENT-B language does not provide (native) support for the writing of temporal specifications, we have implemented a novel Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) extension for EVENT-B. We support several architectural tactics for availability, performance, and security. The generated code is certified in the following sense: discharging proof obligations in Rodin - the platform we use for writing the EVENT-B models - attests to the soundness of the architectural tactics modelled in EVENT-B, and the soundness of the translation encoded by the EVENTB2JAVA tool attests to the code correctness. Finally, we demonstrate the usability of our resilience validation approach with the aid of an Autonomous Vehicle System. It further helped us increase our confidence in the soundness of our Event-B LTL extension.

ID VELOCIMETRY; SIGNAL; FIELD
AB Light detection and ranging (lidar) is widely accepted as an indispensable sensor for autonomous vehicles. There are two fundamental challenges in a lidar system: optical beam steering technique and ranging method. Optical phased array (OPA) is considered as one of the most promising beam steering schemes due to its solid state, compact size, and high reliability. As for ranging method, time-of-flight and frequency-modulate continuous-wave (FMCW) are commonly utilized in numerous research. However, they are impractical to commercial OPA lidar due to either requiring excessive optical power or the poor stability, high complexity, and high insertion loss of the FMCW source. As a result, the development of OPA lidars is significantly hindered by the lack of a feasible ranging method. In this paper, we present a phase-modulated continuous-wave (PhMCW) ranging method with excellent ranging accuracy and precision. Ranging error as low as 0.1 cm and precision on the order of 3.5 cm are achieved. In addition, theoretical and experimental study on simultaneous velocity measurement is carried out and velocity error as low as 0.15 cm/s is obtained. Finally, we develop a proof-of-concept OPA-PhMCW lidar and obtain a point cloud with excellent fidelity. Our work paves a novel approach to solid-state, cost-effective and high-performance OPA lidars.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

AB The data freshness at decision epochs of time-sensitive applications, e.g., auto-driving vehicles and autonomous underwater robots, is jointly affected by the statistics of update process and decision process. This work considers an update-and-decision system with a Poisson-arrival bufferless queue, where updates are delivered and processed for making decisions with exponential or periodic intervals. We use age-upon-decisions (AuD) to characterize timeliness of updates at decision moments, and the missing probability to specify whether updates are useful for decision-making. Our theoretical analyses 1) present the average AuDs and the missing probabilities for bufferless systems with exponential or deterministic decision intervals under different service time distributions; 2) show that for service scheduling, the deterministic service time achieves a lower average AuD and a smaller missing probability than the uniformly distributed and the negative exponentially distributed service time; 3) prove that the average AuD of periodical decision system is larger than and will eventually drop to that of Poisson decision system along with the increase of decision rate; however, the missing probability in periodical decision system is smaller than that of Poisson decision system. The numerical results and simulations verify the correctness of our analyses, and demonstrate that the bufferless systems outperform the systems applying infinite buffer size.

AB Altitude information is one of the most important data pieces to realize unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomous flight. At present, the barometers equipped in the UAVs were used to measure the atmospheric pressure and convert the data to the altitude of UAVs. But the pressure will change drastically when the propeller of the UAV rotate and lead to inaccurate measurement values. In this paper, a UAV height information acquisition method based on the information fusion of monocular vision and a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) is designed, which can obtain accurate height information in the indoor environment and low-altitude outdoor environment. The parallax is obtained by using two images taken in a short time during UAV flight in this method, and the acceleration data measured by the MEMS are used to compute the displacements of the UAV in this time as the baseline. The angle information measured by the MEMS is used to calibrate the images taken by the monocular camera of the UAV. Finally, the altitude information of the UAV is obtained with the theory of binocular stereo vision. Experiments have proven that the altitude information errors obtained by this method at 2 m is approximately 4%, which is less than barometer errors. A new image crop method was proposed to reduce computation, which meets the steady, fast and accurate requirements for practical application. The experiments show that our proposed method can obtain satisfactory results with respect to the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Streptococcus suis is a zoonotic pathogen suspected to be a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. The genomes of 214 strains of 27 serotypes were screened for AMR genes and chromosomal Mobile Genetic Elements (MGEs), in particular Integrative Conjugative Elements (ICEs) and Integrative Mobilizable Elements (IMEs). The functionality of two ICEs that host IMEs carrying AMR genes was investigated by excision tests and conjugation experiments. In silico search revealed 416 ICE-related and 457 IME-related elements. These MGEs exhibit an impressive diversity and plasticity with tandem accretions, integration of ICEs or IMEs inside ICEs and recombination between the elements. All of the detected 393 AMR genes are carried by MGEs. As previously described, ICEs are major vehicles of AMR genes in S. suis. Tn5252-related ICEs also appear to carry bacteriocin clusters. Furthermore, whereas the association of IME-AMR genes has never been described in S. suis, we found that most AMR genes are actually carried by IMEs. The autonomous transfer of an ICE to another bacterial species (Streptococcus thermophilus)-leading to the cis-mobilization of an IME carrying tet(O)-was obtained. These results show that besides ICEs, IMEs likely play a major role in the dissemination of AMR genes in S. suis.

AB The ability to precisely classify different types of terrain is extremely important for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). There are multiple situations in which terrain classification is fundamental for achieving a UAV's mission success, such as emergency landing, aerial mapping, decision making, and cooperation between UAVs in autonomous navigation. Previous research works describe different terrain classification approaches mainly using static features from RGB images taken onboard UAVs. In these works, the terrain is classified from each image taken as a whole, not divided into blocks; this approach has an obvious drawback when applied to images with multiple terrain types. This paper proposes a robust computer vision system to classify terrain types using three main algorithms, which extract features from UAV's downwash effect: Static textures-Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Gray-Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM) and Dynamic textures-Optical Flow method. This system has been fully implemented using the OpenCV library, and the GLCM algorithm has also been partially specified in a Hardware Description Language (VHDL) and implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based platform. In addition to these feature extraction algorithms, a neural network was designed with the aim of classifying the terrain into one of four classes. Lastly, in order to store and access all the classified terrain information, a dynamic map, with this information was generated. The system was validated using videos acquired onboard a UAV with an RGB camera.

AB Low latency applications, such as multimedia communications, autonomous vehicles, and Tactile Internet are the emerging applications for next-generation wireless networks, such as 5th generation (5G) mobile networks. Existing physical-layer channel models, however, do not explicitly consider quality-of-service (QoS) aware related parameters under specific delay constraints. To investigate the performance of low-latency applications in future networks, a new mathematical framework is needed. Effective capacity (EC), which is a link-layer channel model with QoS-awareness, can be used to investigate the performance of wireless networks under certain statistical delay constraints. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on existing works, that use the EC model in various wireless networks. We summarize the work related to EC for different networks, such as cognitive radio networks (CRNs), cellular networks, relay networks, adhoc networks, and mesh networks. We explore five case studies encompassing EC operation with different design and architectural requirements. We survey various delay-sensitive applications, such as voice and video with their EC analysis under certain delay constraints. We finally present the future research directions with open issues covering EC maximization.

ID GEOMETRY
AB Traditionally, the indirect visual motion estimation and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems were based on point features. In recent years, several SLAM systems that use lines as primitives were suggested. Despite the extra robustness and accuracy brought by the line segment matching, the line segment descriptors used in such systems were hand-crafted, and therefore sub-optimal. In this paper, we suggest applying descriptor learning to construct line segment descriptors optimized for matching tasks. We show how such descriptors can be constructed on top of a deep yet lightweight fully-convolutional neural network. The coefficients of this network are trained using an automatically collected dataset of matching and non-matching line segments. The use of the fully-convolutional network ensures that the bulk of the computations needed to compute descriptors is shared among the multiple line segments in the same image, enabling efficient implementation. We show that the learned line segment descriptors outperform the previously suggested hand-crafted line segment descriptors both in isolation (i.e., for the subtask of distinguishing matching and non-matching line segments), but also when built into the SLAM system. We construct a new line based SLAM pipeline built upon a state-of-the-art point-only system. We demonstrate generalization of the learned parameters of the descriptor network between two well-known datasets for autonomous driving and indoor micro aerial vehicle navigation.

AB Wind is considered a strong disturbance for quadrotor aircrafts (UAV) when an outdoor task at a fixed point is carried out. The effect of wind produces a distortion on the attitude of the vehicle which is reflected on undesired longitudinal movements. This paper addresses a real-time implementation and design of a robust embedded control-observer based on a type high-gain observer algorithm for on-line estimation and compensation of external disturbances produced by wind gusts on an autonomous quadrotor aircraft. A real-time experimental implementation of embedded Residual High Gain algorithm control is proposed in order to eliminate the effects of real perturbations in the hover position of the UAV. A Lyapunov function was used to practical stability analysis the system. Also numerical simulations were carried out to estimate wind behavior by the use of Drydel mathematical wind model. The main contribution of this work is the implementation of a Residual High Gain Observer in an outdoor real-time experiment in presence of real wind gusts perturbations. The proposed embedded algorithm control improves the stabilization of an UAV in the presence of real wind gusts with average of 8 m/s. The proposed algorithm improved the UAV behavior as shown by the GPS position experimental results, decreasing the wind effect on the translational movement of the aircraft.

ID BINARY
AB Real-time object tracking on a drone under a dynamic environment has been a challenging issue for many years, with existing approaches using off-line calculation or powerful computation units on board. This paper presents a new lightweight real-time onboard object tracking approach with multi-inertial sensing data, wherein a highly energy-efficient drone is built based on the Snapdragon flight board of Qualcomm. The flight board uses a digital signal processor core of the Snapdragon 801 processor to realize PX4 autopilot, an open-source autopilot system oriented toward inexpensive autonomous aircraft. It also uses an ARM core to realize Linux, robot operating systems, open-source computer vision library, and related algorithms. A lightweight moving object detection algorithm is proposed that extracts feature points in the video frame using the oriented FAST and rotated binary robust independent elementary features algorithm and adapts a local difference binary algorithm to construct the image binary descriptors. The K-nearest neighbor method is then used to match the image descriptors. Finally, an object tracking method is proposed that fuses inertial measurement unit data, global positioning system data, and the moving object detection results to calculate the relative position between coordinate systems of the object and the drone. All the algorithms are run on the Qualcomm platform in real time. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method over the state-of-the-art visual tracking method.

AB The Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) comprises rules to prevent collisions at sea and is based on the qualitative rules and ordinary practice of seamen. However, because the criteria of the sailing rule interpretation are different, the problem of misunderstanding occurs owing to the difference in the interpretation between navigators and collision-avoidance algorithm designers. Therefore, this study aims to clarify the collision situations by understanding in the sailing rule interpretation of COLREGs. To identify the understanding of collision situations, we surveyed the navigators' understanding of collision situations and reviewed the collision-avoidance algorithms used in recent studies. The survey results were analyzed based on head-on and crossing (HC) and crossing and overtaking (OC) situations. Results showed that navigators were unsure about whether the HC situation sailing rule should be applied to incoming vessels from the 008 degrees and whether the overtaking or crossing situation should be applied to coming vessels at 160 degrees. In OC situations, as the angle increased from 130 degrees, it became difficult for navigators to interpret the navigation rules. A notable disparity emerged between the navigators' understanding and the automated collision-avoidance algorithms. Moreover, it was confirmed that practical navigators exhibited divergent interpretations of these regulations. This study contributes to provide an understanding of COLREGs sailing rules based on the understanding of navigators and researchers.

ID ACTION RECOGNITION
AB Imitation filming has been applied to autonomous filming by mimicking human operators. To imitate the operation of cameramen when filming multiple human actions, existing methods plan the camera motion through time series prediction or train multiple models to handle a particular style in a specific situation. As a result, these methods require various settings to adapt to different scenarios. In this work, we overcome such limitations and propose an end-to-end imitation learning framework for drone cinematography systems. The framework consists of two main components: (1) an efficient motion feature extraction module for generating a compact motion feature space, (2) a path-analysis-based reinforcement learning (PABRL) algorithm for imitating multiple filming styles from demonstrations and incorporating aesthetical features for improved perspective shots. Our PABRL method is based on the actor-critic network, which regards multiple human motion variables, camera translations, and image composition as inputs and then outputs an aesthetical filming strategy related to the subject motion. In addition, we propose an attention mechanism and a long-short-term rewarding function to enhance the motion feature space and the integrity of the generated trajectory, respectively. Extensive experimental results in simulated and real outdoor environments demonstrate that compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method can achieve 69.8% higher performance in terms of trajectory planning accuracy while successfully incorporating aesthetical features into the captured videos.

AB In order to acquire precise depth maps, depth completion is a fundamental method for autonomous vehicles and robotics. Recent methods mainly focus on fusing multi-model information from sparse depth maps and color images to recover dense depth maps. Previous researches have made remarkable contributions in predicting depth values, but how to better fuse multi-model features, and how to better restore details are still two main issues. Aiming at these two issues, we propose a fusion net composed of two-branch backbone and depth refinement module. The backbone aims to extract and combine the features of sparse depths and color images, in which we adopt the strategies of symmetric gated fusion and pixel-shuffle for cross-branch and branch-wise fusion respectively. Then, we designed a new module named dilation-pyramid convolution spatial propagation network (DP-CSPN) for depth refinement which enlarges the propagation neighborhoods and obtains more local affinities than CSPN. Finally, to better process details, we designed loss functions to achieve clearer edges as well as to be aware of tiny structures. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance in NYU-Depth-v2 Dataset and KITTI Depth Completion Dataset, and we got the achievement of top 5 in mobile intelligent photography and imaging (MIPI) challenge held by European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) 2022.

AB AUV docking devices have the ability to achieve homing of the AUV, supply the AUV with energy, and exchange data with it, thus improving the endurance and ensuring the continuous long-term and large-scale operation of the AUV. To improve the successful docking rate of the AUV, a funnel-shaped underwater docking device with multi-degree freedom based on a deep-sea platform was designed in this paper. The heading angle, pitch angle, and roller angle of the docking device could be adjusted in a timely manner according to the current flow direction and the position of the AUV. In order to realize the timely adjustment of the heading angle, pitch angle, and roll angle of the docking device, a set of underwater hydraulic systems was developed as the power source to drive the corresponding hydraulic cylinders, hydraulic motors, and other executive components. The model of the heading angle adjustment circuit of the hydraulic system was established and the open-loop transfer function of the heading angle adjustment circuit was derived. The dynamic response performance of the hydraulic circuit was simulated and the optimized PID algorithm was used to improve the dynamic response performance. Finally, the accuracy of the heading angle adjustment circuit model and the effectiveness of the control algorithm were validated by experiment of the docking device in a water pool.

ID ROBUSTNESS
AB Motivated by the fragility of neural network (NN) controllers in safety-critical applications, we present a data-driven framework for verifying the risk of stochastic dynamical systems with NN controllers. Given a stochastic control system, an NN controller, and a specification equipped with a notion of trace robustness (e.g., constraint functions or signal temporal logic), we collect trajectories from the system that may or may not satisfy the specification. In particular, each of the trajectories produces a robustness value that indicates how well (severely) the specification is satisfied (violated). We then compute risk metrics over these robustness values to estimate the risk that the NN controller will not satisfy the specification. We are further interested in quantifying the difference in risk between two systems, and we show how the risk estimated from a nominal system can provide an upper bound the risk of a perturbed version of the system. In particular, the tightness of this bound depends on the closeness of the systems in terms of the closeness of their system trajectories. For Lipschitz continuous and incrementally input-to-state stable systems, we show how to exactly quantify system closeness with varying degrees of conservatism, while we estimate system closeness for more general systems from data in our experiments. We demonstrate our risk verification approach on two case studies, an underwater vehicle and an F1/10 autonomous car.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With the development of radar technology, the automotive millimeter wave radar is widely applied in the fields including internet of vehicles, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based autonomous driving, health monitoring, etc. Eye blink, as one of the most common human activities, can effectively reflect the person's consciousness and fatigue. The contacted eye blink detection often leads to uncomfortable experience and the camera-based eye blink detection has privacy issues. As an alternative, the non-contacted eye blink detection based on automotive millimeter wave radar resolves the aforementioned issues and has been received much attention. This paper proposes an eye blink detection method using the frequency modulated continuous wave radar. Firstly, the position of the person's head is estimated by carrying out fast Fourier transform on the intermediate frequency signal, and the signals of the range bins at the head are extracted. Then, the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise algorithm is applied to decompose the eye signals into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), and the singular value decomposition is adopted to constrain the selection and reconstruction of the useful IMFs related to the eye blink signal. Finally, the short-time Fourier transformation and cell average constant false alarm rate are applied to detect the eye blink behavior. Experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed eye blink detection method.

ID PERCEPTION
AB Accurately estimating the current state of local traffic scenes is one of the key problems in the development of software components for automated vehicles. In addition to details on free space and drivability, static and dynamic traffic participants and information on the semantics may also be included in the desired representation. Multi-layer grid maps allow the inclusion of all of this information in a common representation. However, most existing grid mapping approaches only process range sensor measurements such as Lidar and Radar and solely model occupancy without semantic states. In order to add sensor redundancy and diversity, it is desired to add vision-based sensor setups in a common grid map representation. In this work, we present a semantic evidential grid mapping pipeline, including estimates for eight semantic classes, that is designed for straightforward fusion with range sensor data. Unlike other publications, our representation explicitly models uncertainties in the evidential model. We present results of our grid mapping pipeline based on a monocular vision setup and a stereo vision setup. Our mapping results are accurate and dense mapping due to the incorporation of a disparity- or depth-based ground surface estimation in the inverse perspective mapping. We conclude this paper by providing a detailed quantitative evaluation based on real traffic scenarios in the KITTI odometry benchmark dataset and demonstrating the advantages compared to other semantic grid mapping approaches.

AB This article presents a full course for autonomous aerial robotics inside the RoboticsAcademy framework. This "drone programming" course is open-access and ready-to-use for any teacher/student to teach/learn drone programming with it for free. The students may program diverse drones on their computers without a physical presence in this course. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) applications are essentially practical, as their intelligence resides in the software part. Therefore, the proposed course emphasizes drone programming through practical learning. It comprises a collection of exercises resembling drone applications in real life, such as following a road, visual landing, and people search and rescue, including their corresponding background theory. The course has been successfully taught for five years to students from several university engineering degrees. Some exercises from the course have also been validated in three aerial robotics competitions, including an international one. RoboticsAcademy is also briefly presented in the paper. It is an open framework for distance robotics learning in engineering degrees. It has been designed as a practical complement to the typical online videos of massive open online courses (MOOCs). Its educational contents are built upon robot operating system (ROS) middleware (de facto standard in robot programming), the powerful 3D Gazebo simulator, and the widely used Python programming language. Additionally, RoboticsAcademy is a suitable tool for gamified learning and online robotics competitions, as it includes several competitive exercises and automatic assessment tools.

AB Technologies for pedestrian safety are increasingly emphasized by Automakers in advance of autonomous driving vehicles. A Night Vision System attached behind the front grille can reduce fatal accidents, especially during the nighttime, however, consumers may hesitate to adopt such systems on account of their high price. High-cost Germanium is used in commercial Night Vision System windows, and therefore replacing it with a cheaper infrared window material can lead to a more affordable system. To achieve this, Zinc Sulfide (ZnS), which has about 70% transmittance in the Long-Wavelength Infrared region of 8 similar to 12 mu m, was selected for the window substrate material. In this study, we designed, fabricated and characterized a single layer cost-effective anti-reflection coating on a ZnS window substrate using Calcium Fluoride (CaF2). The CaF2 coating was fabricated by E-beam evaporation technique, with Quarter wavelength anti-reflection thickness (QAR). It was characterized by FT-IR, SEM and a thermal camera test module. We found that CaF2 both side coated the ZnS window and exhibited about 10 similar to 15% higher transmittance than the ZnS window substrate. In addition the CaF2 coating stably bonded to the ZnS substrate without any internal defects. A thermal camera based window test also showed better detection performance with the CaF2 Coating than a bare ZnS substrate window, which was calculated using the output voltage of the microbolometer thermal sensor.

AB Insects are able to freely navigate through ever-changing environments using predominantly visual inputs, while possessing very minimal processing power compared to humans. Not only are they able to move at high velocities and accelerations, but they are also able to achieve extraordinary levels of obstacle avoidance. We begin to emulate this biological behaviour in a robotic application by first modelling how these visual pathways react to separable degrees of freedom within the motion field, specifically rotation in this case. We have developed upon an existing biologically-inspired algorithm based on the visual pathway of the hoverfly, and statistically compare results to current state-of-the-art algorithms, all the while performing this on computationally-constrained embedded hardware. We have shown that, using a complex, highly-elaborated representation of the hoverfly visual pathway, rotation optical flow estimations can be achieved with a high level of accuracy, at a level of consistency previously unseen in dense-flow algorithms, and they can be achieved at 100 frames per second on an embedded system. This work forms a fundamental basis to understanding one of the two separable components of insect egomotion (rotation and translation), allowing for consistently accurate rotational velocity estimation, providing a building block towards understanding the translational component of insect vision and the application of biologically-inspired egomotion estimation in autonomous vehicles.

AB CHUK/IKK alpha contributes to collagenase-driven extracellular matrix remodeling and chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation in vitro, in a kinase-independent manner. These processes contribute to osteoarthritis (OA), where chondrocytes experience a phenotypic shift towards hypertrophy concomitant with abnormal matrix remodeling. Here we investigated the contribution of IKK alpha to OA in vivo. To this end, we induced specific IKK alpha knockout in adult chondrocytes in AcanCreER(T2/+); IKK alpha(f/f )mice treated with tamoxifen (cKO). Vehicle-treated littermates were used as wild type controls (WT). At 12 weeks of age, WT and cKO mice were subjected to the destabilization of medial meniscus (DMM) model of post-traumatic OA. The cKO mice showed reduced cartilage degradation and collagenase activity and fewer hypertrophy-like features at 12 weeks after DMM. Interestingly, in spite of the protection from structural articular cartilage damage, the postnatal growth plates of IKK alpha cKO mice after DMM displayed abnormal architecture and composition associated with increased chondrocyte apoptosis, which were not as evident in the articular chondrocytes of the same animals. Together, our results provide evidence of a novel in vivo functional role for IKK alpha in cartilage degradation in post-traumatic OA, and also suggest intrinsic, cell-autonomous effects of IKK alpha in chondrocytes that control chondrocyte phenotype and impact on cell survival, matrix homeostasis, and remodeling.

TI Remote Sensing of the Surface Wind Field over the Coastal Ocean via
   Direct Calibration of HF Radar Backscatter Power
SO JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID SEA ECHO; INVERSION; WAVES
AB The calibration and validation of a novel approach to remotely sense surface winds using land-based high-frequency (HF) radar systems are described. Potentially available on time scales of tens of minutes and spatial scales of 2-3 km for wide swaths of the coastal ocean, HF radar-based surface wind observations would greatly aid coastal ocean planners, researchers, and operational stakeholders by providing detailed real-time estimates and climatologies of coastal winds, as well as enabling higher-quality short-term forecasts of the spatially dependent wind field. Such observations are particularly critical for the developing offshore wind energy community. An autonomous surface vehicle was deployed within the Massachusetts Wind Energy Area, located south of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, for one month, collecting wind observations that were used to test models of wind-wave spreading and HF radar energy loss, thereby empirically relating radar-measured power to surface winds. HF radar-based extractions of the remote wind speed had accuracies of 1.4 m s(-1) for winds less than 7 m s(-1), within the optimal range of the radar frequency used. Accuracies degraded at higher winds due to low signal-to-noise ratios in the returned power and poor resolution of the model. Pairing radar systems with a range of transmit frequencies with adjustments of the extraction model for additional power and environmental factors would resolve many of the errors observed.

TI Dynamically reconfigurable systolic array accelerators: a case study
   with extended Kalman filter and discrete wavelet transform algorithms
SO IET COMPUTERS AND DIGITAL TECHNIQUES
LA English
DT Article
AB Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are increasingly being adopted as the primary on-board computing system for autonomous deep space vehicles. There is a need to support several complex applications for navigation and image processing in a rapidly responsive on-board FPGA-based computer. Developing such a computer requires the designer to explore and combine several design concepts such as systolic array (SA) design, hardware-software partitioning and partial dynamic reconfiguration (PDR). In this study a microprocessor/co-processor design that can simultaneously accelerate multiple single precision floating-point algorithms is proposed. Two such algorithms are extended Kalman filter (EKF) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Key contributions include (i) polymorphic systolic array (PolySA), comprising partial reconfigurable regions that can accelerate algorithms amenable to being mapped onto linear SAs and (ii) performance model to predict the overall execution time of EKF algorithm on the proposed PolySA architecture. When implemented on a low-end Xilinx Virtex4 SX35 FPGA, the design provides a speed-up of at least 4.18x and 6.61x over a state-of-the-art microprocessor used in spacecraft systems for the EKF and DWT algorithms, respectively. The performance of EKF algorithm on the proposed PolySA architecture was compared against the performance on two types of conventional (non-polymorphic) hardware architectures and the results showed that the proposed architecture outperformed the other two architectures in most of the test cases.

AB In order to identify the riding feeling in an autonomous vehicle through electroencephalogram (EEG), a recognition model based on multidimensional feature extraction and recurrent neural network (RNN) is proposed. After the effective training of the dataset, the system can realize the recognition of passengers' riding feelings through real-time acquisition of passengers' EEG signals and sending them into this recognition model. After preprocessing the collected raw EEG signals, we conducted an in- depth study of the preprocessed EEG data and proposed an algorithm to identify riding feeling from EEG signals. In order to improve the classification ability of RNN, a feature extraction method based on time segments is designed. Applying this method, multidimensional features with spatial, temporal, and frequency-domain features are obtained. The experimental results show that this feature extraction method can effectively suppress the overfitting of the RNN and improve the recognition ability of the network. Finally, the recognition of riding feeling is recognized through the RNN. Through the verification of the a dataset for emotion analysis using EEG, physiological and video signals (DEAP) dataset and the self-built dataset, the average recognition accuracy rate of 89.22% and 94.27% was obtained, respectively, which provides a feasible solution for the recognition of riding feeling based on physiological signals such as EEG.

AB P-3-LINS, a navigation system tightly coupling precise point positioning (PPP)-global navigation satellite system (GNSS)/inertial navigation system (INS)/light detection and ranging (LiDAR) with the DRANSAC-receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) and the doppler iterative closet point algorithm (DICP) as its initialization procedure is established for accurate and reliable positioning in urban environments. The position initialization of P-3-LINS is completed by the static PPP with the DRANSAC-RAIM algorithm. The yaw is initialized through the proposed DICP algorithm which relies on the quadratic constraint least-squares problem built by Doppler speed, LiDAR-simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) poses, and GNSS positions. After dealing with the initialization issue, the fusion framework of P-3-LINS is constructed to handle the heterogeneous sensor data spatial-temporal consistency problem with the three-phase extended Kalman Filter (EKF)-based estimator. The experiments show that the initialization of P-3-LINS achieves decimeter-level positioning error in minutes when keeping static and tenths of a degree-level yaw error after the vehicle moves a few seconds on the UrbanLoco. Moreover, P-3-LINS outperforms the compared state-of-the-art methods in terms of positioning accuracy and reliability on both the public datasets and self-collected datasets.

ID FRAMEWORK; PARADIGM; ERROR
AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in many applications due to, among other features, their versatility, reduced operation cost, and reduced size. These applications increasingly require that features related to autonomous navigation be employed, such as mapping. However, the reduced capacity of resources such as battery life and hardware (memory and processing capacity) can hinder the development of these applications in UAVs. Thus, the collaborative use of multi-UAVs for mapping can be used as an alternative to solve this problem, creating a cooperative navigation system. This system requires that individual local maps will be merged into a global map in a distributed way. In this context, this work proposes a system for merging three-dimensional occupancy grid maps for use in UAVs that compose a cooperative navigation system. The proposed solution consists of a keypoint detector, a keypoint descriptor, and filters for keypoints and correspondences. The keypoint properties, such as orientation, are acquired from potential field gradients. Image processing techniques are applied to remove the map noise and better calculate the transformation parameters. The proposed system is validated by a set of simulation experiments performed in six different environments (indoor and outdoor). First, each component of the proposed system is individually evaluated. Then, the complete pairwise map merging system is evaluated. Finally, the appropriate functioning of the proposed system is validated through a visual evaluation.

AB With the vast expansion of data loads across numerous safety and infotainment applications, the software defined paradigm has become a critical component for 5G-enabled and intelligent vehicular networks. By transforming the network's rigid hardware devices into programmable units, SDVN offers a broad view of the entire network status and a standard interface between heterogeneous wireless access technologies. However, deploying a centralized control unit carries several problems, such as bottleneck issues and densification issues. A distributed control plane is a potential alternative to a centralized control plane. Still, it poses many questions about the optimal location of local control units and the number of control units required for a given network structure. In this article, we propose an efficient proactive controller deployment and assignment strategy for distributed 5G-enabled software-defined Vehicular Networks based on predictive vehicles' traffic flow information and communication delays between switch-enabled roadside units. A thorough performance evaluation is conducted under different vehicular network's mobility scenarios. We assess the performance of the proposed method in terms of communication latency and load on the subsequent control units and their assigned set of switches. The proposed proactive clustering method is compared to different forms of controller placement methods. The results showed that the proposed approach reduced the network's communication delays while maintaining a balanced distributed load among controllers over the simulation time.

AB This research explores the sustainability drivers of the Chinese road transportation system in terms of its cargo and environmental productivity levels. A novel Fuzzy Double-Frontier Network Data Envelopment Analysis (FDFNDEA) model is proposed to investigate the relationship between desirable (freight and passenger turnovers) and undesirable (CO2 and NOx emission levels) outputs against the respective power consumed in each one of the 29 Chinese provinces (municipalities and autonomous regions) between 1985 and 2017. The power consumption emerges spatially and temporally as a consequence of the evolution of the road system's productive resources (employees, highway length, number of vehicles, and fuel consumed) at the province level over the course of time. Shannon's entropy is used as the cornerstone to quantify input and output vagueness of this evolution in terms of triangular fuzzy numbers (TFN), thus allowing the building of alternative optimistic and pessimistic double efficiency frontiers. Respective Malmquist Productivity Indexes (MPI) for overall and each stage productivity are regressed against contextual variables related to demography, economic activity, competitor infrastructure, and highway quality using bootstrapped Cauchy regressions. Results confirm the disruptive evolution of the Chinese road transport system over the course of the years and different expansion strategies at the regions. The energy and environmental efficiency of the Chinese road transportation system is affected by these contextual variables. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a computationally efficient robust predictive control method is proposed for continuous-time under-actuated SISO systems in the presence of actuator saturation and state-dependent uncertainties. The proposition of this research is to employ the idea of model prediction together with the Adaptive Fuzzy Sliding-Mode Control (AFSMC) for tuning the sliding surface parameters by predicting the anticipated effects of uncertainties. In the proposed scheme, only after the trigger conditions are met, the coefficients of the sliding surface are updated and the AFSMC is applied. Hence, computational complexity can be controlled by adjusting the switching rule. In the AFSMC, a fuzzy system is used to approximate a nonlinear function, and a robust term to compensate for any possible mismatches. An adaptively tuned gain is also applied to the control signal to prevent instability caused by the actuator saturation. Based on the updating sliding surface, fuzzy singletons, the upper bound of the fuzzy approximation error, and the saturation gain are adaptively tuned. Closed-loop stability is shown to be guaranteed using the multiple Lyapunov functions theorem and the Barbalat's lemma. Finally, the method is applied for the depth control of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), depicting the excellent performance of the proposed method.

ID STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS
AB In this paper, we present a novel method incorporating convolutional neural networks (CNN) into Markov random field (MRF) to automatically segment side scan sonar (SSS) images into object-highlight, object-shadow and sea-bottom reverberation areas. As a widely used ocean survey sensor, SSS provides high-resolution maps of the seafloor. Automatically segmenting SSS in real time can assist the navigation and path-planning of autonomous underwater vehicles. However, for the speckle noise and intensity inhomogeneity in the SSS images, it is difficult to find a robust SSS segmentation method. These facts motivate us to explore efficient CNN architectures to solve these problems. For pixel-level SSS segmentation, to use the context information and the details around a central pixel simultaneously, the CNN with multi-scale inputs (MSCNN) is employed. Besides, to mitigate the impact of the class imbalance problem, two MSCNN training strategies are introduced, which are based on data augmentation and ensemble learning. Furthermore, to take into account the local dependencies of class labels, the results of MSCNN are used to initialize MRF to get the final segmentation maps. Experimental results on real SSS images reveal that the proposed segmentation method outperforms MRF, CNN and semantic segmentation methods such as fully convolutional network and Segnet in segmentation accuracy and generalization performance. Moreover, the efficiency of the proposed method is proved on retinal image dataset.

AB Machine learning has become ubiquitous in applications including object detection, image/video classification, and natural language processing. While machine learning algorithms have been successfully used in many practical applications, accurate, fast, and low-power hardware implementations of such algorithms is still a challenging task, especially for mobile systems such as Internet of Things (IoT), autonomous vehicles, and smart drones. This paper presents an energy-efficient programmable ASIC accelerator for object detection. Our ASIC accelerator supports multi-class (e.g., face, traffic sign, car license plate, and pedestrian) that are programmable, many-object (up to 50) in one image with different sizes (17-scale support with 6 down-/11 up-scaling), and high accuracy (AP of 0.87/0.81/0.72/0.76 for FDDB/AFW/BTSD/ Caltech datasets). We designed an integral channel detector with 2,000 classifiers for rigid boosted templates, where the number of stages used for classification can be adaptively controlled depending on the content of the search window. This can be implemented with a more modular hardware, compared to support vector machine (SVM) and deformable parts model (DPM) designs. By jointly optimizing the algorithm and the efficient hardware architecture, the prototype chip implemented in 65nm CMOS demonstrates real-time object detection of 20-50 frames/s with low power consumption of 22.5-181.7 mW (0.54-1.75 nJ/pixel) at 0.58-1.1 V supply.

DE Adaptive background superposition initialization; channel attention
   module; object tracking; Siamese network
AB Object tracking has become widespread in many fields, such as autonomous vehicles, video surveillance and robotics. However, it is far from the requirements for real-world applications. Recently, Siamese network based trackers have attracted high attention by balancing accuracy and speed. Because these trackers only learn a similarity measurement model via off-line training, the exemplar branch has insufficient discriminant information to adapt to the constantly changing appearance of the target in subsequent frames. We propose a Siamese network based tracker that improves upon tracking performance as follows. First, an adaptive background superposition initialization is proposed and used in the exemplar branch to make full use of the limited prior information in the first frame. Second, a light-weight convolutional neural network is proposed and applied as the tracker's backbone; it compresses the dimensions of the feature to ensure speed and accuracy. Third, the channel attention module is introduced into our tracker and integrated with adaptive background superposition initialization. The feature map of the original exemplar image and its background changed image are adjusted by a channel attention model and fused to enhance the representation of the exemplar image. The GOT-10k dataset is applied to train our tracker. Finally, experiments on the object tracking benchmark (OTB) and visual object tracking (VOT) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared with state-of-the-art trackers.

AB A two dimensional (2D) laser scanner was mounted at the front part of a small 4-wheel autonomous robot with differential steering, at an angle of 30 degrees pointing downwards. The machine was able to drive between maize rows and collect concurrent time-stamped data. A robotic total station tracked the position of a prism mounted on the vehicle. The total station and laser scanner data were fused to generate a three dimensional (3D) point cloud. This 3D representation was used to detect individual plant positions, which are of particular interest for applications such as phenotyping, individual plant treatment and precision weeding. Two different methodologies were applied to the 3D point cloud to estimate the position of the individual plants. The first methodology used the Euclidian Clustering on the entire point cloud. The second methodology utilised the position of an initial plant and the fixed plant spacing to search iteratively for the best clusters. The two algorithms were applied at three different plant growth stages. For the first method, results indicated a detection rate up to 73.7% with a root mean square error of 3.6 cm. The second method was able to detect all plants (100% detection rate) with an accuracy of 2.7-3.0 cm, taking the plant spacing of 13 cm into account.

AB How to image objects that are hidden from a camera's view is a problem of fundamental importance to many fields of research(1-20), with applications in robotic vision, defence, remote sensing, medical imaging and autonomous vehicles. Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging at macroscopic scales has been demonstrated by scanning a visible surface with a pulsed laser and a time-resolved detector(14-19). Whereas light detection and ranging (LIDAR) systems use such measurements to recover the shape of visible objects from direct reflections(21-24), NLOS imaging reconstructs the shape and albedo of hidden objects from multiply scattered light. Despite recent advances, NLOS imaging has remained impractical owing to the prohibitive memory and processing requirements of existing reconstruction algorithms, and the extremely weak signal of multiply scattered light. Here we show that a confocal scanning procedure can address these challenges by facilitating the derivation of the light-cone transform to solve the NLOS reconstruction problem. This method requires much smaller computational and memory resources than previous reconstruction methods do and images hidden objects at unprecedented resolution. Confocal scanning also provides a sizeable increase in signal and range when imaging retroreflective objects. We quantify the resolution bounds of NLOS imaging, demonstrate its potential for real-time tracking and derive efficient algorithms that incorporate image priors and a physically accurate noise model. Additionally, we describe successful outdoor experiments of NLOS imaging under indirect sunlight.

ID ALGORITHMS
AB In many applications such as video surveillance or autonomous vehicles, people detection is a key element, often based on feature extraction and combined with supervised classification. Usually, output of these methods is in the form of a bounding-box containing an extracted people along with the background. But in specific application contexts, this bounding box information is not sufficient and a precise segmentation of people silhouette is needed inside the bounding box. For videos, this is actually solved by using background subtraction strategies. However, this cannot be considered for the case of still images that also occur in many video surveillance applications. To that aim, we propose to consider that issue in this paper. The principle is to devise a complete scheme for people segmentation inside people detection bounding boxes. Such a scheme relies on several steps: pre-processing, feature extraction and probability map computation to approximately locate people silhouette, and graph cut clustering to refine the silhouette from the map prior. Since many different methods can be considered, along with their associated parameters, tuning, we use a systematic approach towards determining the best combination scheme to conceive a segmentation scheme. The F-measure is used as a benchmark for evaluation. Experimental results show the benefit of the proposed approach that goes beyond the actual state-of-the-art. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The upper oceanic crust is produced by magmatism at mid-ocean ridges, a process thought to be characterized by cyclic bouts of intense magmatic activity, separated by periods when faulting accommodates most or even all of the plate motion. It is not known whether there is a distinct periodicity to such magmatic-tectonic cycles. Here we present high-resolution sidescan sonar data from the neovolcanic zone of the North Kolbeinsey Ridge, a shallow slow-spreading ridge where high glacial and steady post-glacial sedimentation rates allow relative flow ages to be determined with a resolution of around 2 kyr using backscatter amplitude as a proxy for sediment thickness and hence age. We identify 18 lava flow fields covering 40% of the area surveyed. A group of 7 flow fields showing the highest (and similar) backscatter intensity are scattered along 75 km of axial valley surveyed, suggesting that at least this length of the segment was magmatically active within a 1.2 kyr time window. Based on conservative age estimates for all datable flows and estimated eruption volumes, the post-glacial volcanic activity imaged is insufficient to maintain crustal thickness, implying that episode(s) of enhanced activity must have preceded the volcanism we image.

AB This study presents an Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) with a network of gliders in a realistic mesoscale field of eddies and filaments. The main objective is to demonstrate that the analysis skill evaluation, performed with different statistics, determines the optimal number of gliders needed to survey a glider observatory with a given simple topology of the glider array, in the shape of a double comb. Metrics, based on a spatial interpolation of the sampled data with a multiscale objective analysis method, are elaborated to evaluate the reconstruction of the three-dimensional temperature field with several glider networks, at a weekly time scale. The mesoscale structures obtained by the optimal network (front, eddies, eddies detachment) are also compared with the structures of the original simulation. This comparison demonstrates the efficiency of a glider fleet to sample a well-defined area at a given spatiotemporal scale. In this particular situation (midlatitude region, domain of 400 km x 600 km, reconstruction of weekly snapshots), the optimum network is composed of 10 gliders. A relationship is highlighted between the spatial scales of the sampled area, the physical characteristics of the studied region, the reconstruction time scale, and the optimum number of gliders. The results presented here can be applied to design an actual in situ experiment.

ID OPTICAL-FLOW
AB This article presents some experiments of a real-time navigation system driven by two cameras pointing laterally to the navigation direction (Divergent Stereo). Similarly to what has been proposed in (Franceschini et al. 1991; Coombs and Roberts 1992), our approach (Sandini et al. 1992; Santos-Victor et al. 1993) assumes that, for navigation purposes, the driving information is not distance (as it is obtainable by a stereo setup) but motion and, more precisely, by the use of qualitative optical-flow information computed over nonoverlapping areas of the visual field of two cameras.
   Following this idea, a mobile vehicle has been equipped with a pair of cameras looking laterally (much like honeybees) and a controller based on fast, real-time computation of optical flow has been implemented. The control of the mobile robot (Robee) is based on the comparison between the apparent image velocity of the left and the right cameras. The solution adopted is derived from recent studies (Srinivasan 1991) describing the behavior of freely flying honeybees and the mechanisms they use to perceive range.
   This qualitative information (no explicit measure of depth is performed) is used in many experiments to show the robustness of the approach, and a detailed description of the control structure is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach in driving the mobile robot within a cluttered environment.
   A discussion about the potentialities of the approach and the implications in terms of sensor structure is also presented.

AB In the field of autonomous driving, highly accurate representations of the environment are essential for trajectory planning as well as for estimating the vehicle's location. Today, this can be achieved with the help of chirp-sequence radar sensors or radar sensor networks. The possibilities for environmental mapping cover simple point clouds, target-list-based grid maps, and raw data-based high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) maps. While for target-list-based grid maps, it has already been shown that a probabilistic occupancy grid map has significant advantages over an amplitude-based grid map in terms of robustness and resolution, and no probabilistic approaches to SAR processing exist up to now. This article presents a fundamental approach of processing radar raw data to generate high-resolution SAR images based on probabilities. A probabilistic SAR processing is presented that combines high-resolution environmental mapping with amplitude-independent target detection. Based on the measurements, a qualitative and quantitative comparison between conventional amplitude and phase-based SAR processing, the presented probabilistic SAR processing, and a probabilistic target-list-based occupancy grid map is performed. Since the presented algorithm is not limited to the automotive field and chirp-sequence radar sensors, it can be extended to arbitrary SAR applications and radar architectures.

AB The underwater acoustic wireless communication networks are generally formed by the different autonomous underwater acoustic vehicles, and transceivers interconnected to the bottom of the ocean with battery deployed modems. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has become the most popular modulation technique in underwater acoustic communication due to its high data transmission and robustness over other symmetrical modulation techniques. To maintain the operability of underwater acoustic communication networks, the power consumption of battery-operated transceivers becomes a vital necessity to be minimized. The OFDM technology has a major lack of peak to average power ratio (PAPR) which results in the consumption of more power, creating non-linear distortion and increasing the bit error rate (BER). To overcome this situation, we have contributed our symmetry research into three dimensions. Firstly, we propose a machine learning-based underwater acoustic communication system through long short-term memory neural network (LSTM-NN). Secondly, the proposed LSTM-NN reduces the PAPR and makes the system reliable and efficient, which turns into a better performance of BER. Finally, the simulation and water tank experimental data results are executed which proves that the LSTM-NN is the best solution for mitigating the PAPR with non-linear distortion and complexity in the overall communication system.

AB IEEE 802.11p and LTE-V2X are the current wireless standards of interest to enable connected and autonomous driving. The specification for their follow up generations, i.e., IEEE 802.11bd and NR-V2X are being developed and expected to be completed soon. To evaluate and compare the performance of these technologies, system-level studies are required to be carried out for various channel conditions and reliability requirements. However, these studies are time-intensive and require highly complex computations, if they are performed using link-level simulators. Therefore, the physical layer performance is usually abstracted using a link quality model, also known as Physical layer abstraction (PLA). For this purpose, we present novel PLA techniques to model different fading and interference effects for considered technologies. Further, we compare the performance of PLA techniques in terms of estimation accuracy against physical layer simulations. The results show that the estimated packet error rate (PER) by proposed PLA methods are close to the results obtained through physical layer simulations. Besides, we compare the performance of all considered technologies (i.e., IEEE 802.11p, LTE-V2X, IEEE 802.11bd, and NR-V2X) in terms of data rates, latency, and reliability. The results indicate that NR-V2X is superior in terms of average data rates compared to other technologies. In contrast, IEEE 802.11bd has lower transmission latency and higher reliability compared to other technologies.

AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide superior performance on machine learning tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, pattern analysis, and intrusion detection. However, an adversarial example, created by adding a little noise to an original sample, can cause misclassification by a DNN. This is a serious threat to the DNN because the added noise is not detected by the human eye. For example, if an attacker modifies a right-turn sign so that it misleads to the left, autonomous vehicles with the DNN will incorrectly classify the modified sign as pointing to the left, but a person will correctly classify the modified sign as pointing to the right. Studies are under way to defend against such adversarial examples. The existing method of defense against adversarial examples requires an additional process such as changing the classifier or modifying input data. In this paper, we propose a new method for detecting adversarial examples that does not invoke any additional process. The proposed scheme can detect adversarial examples by using a pattern feature of the classification scores of adversarial examples. We used MNIST and CIFAR10 as experimental datasets and Tensorflow as a machine learning library. The experimental results show that the proposed method can detect adversarial examples with success rates: 99.05% and 99.9% for the untargeted and targeted cases in MNIST, respectively, and 94.7% and 95.8% for the untargeted and targeted cases in CIFAR10, respectively.

AB Because the underwater environment is complex, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have difficulty locating their surroundings autonomously. In order to improve the adaptive ability of AUVs, this paper presents a novel obstacle localization strategy based on the flow features. Like fish, the strategy uses the flow field information directly to locate the object obstacles. Two different localization methods are provided and compared. The first method, which is named the Method of Spatial Distribution (MSD), is based on the spatial distribution of the flow field. The second method, which is named the Method of Amplitude Variation (MAV), is provided by the amplitude variation of the flow field. The flow field around spherical targets is obtained by a numerical method, and both methods use the parallel velocity component on the virtual lateral line. During the study, different target numbers, detective ratios, spacing ratios, and flow velocities are taken into account. It is demonstrated that both methods are able to locate object obstacles. However, the prediction accuracy of MAV is higher than that of MSD. That implies that MAV is more robust than MSD. These new findings indicate that the object obstacles can be directly located based on the flow field information and robust flow sensing is perhaps not based on the spatial distribution of the flow field but rather, on its fluctuation range.

TI Uniformity of Terminology for Circular Intersection Designs
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
AB Most transportation engineers around the world, and now in the United States, are relatively familiar with roundabouts and their operational and safety benefits. Although roundabouts are becoming increasingly common, drivers and even engineering professionals often contend with mixed messages about roundabout design and operation. In a world speckled with all manner of spiral roundabouts, signalized roundabouts, traffic circles, gyratories, and rotaries, is it any wonder that confusion, and public resistance, often persists? These mixed messages may represent the greatest hurdle to implementation, public acceptance, and safe operation of multi-lane roundabouts in particular. Within North America and across the globe, circular intersection designs that appear relatively similar to users can in fact require significantly different driver behaviors, depending on whether they are configured with a continuous circle road or a network of crossing roadways. This distinction can be of critical importance for roadway designers and agencies, elected officials and other policymakers, road user education and licensing, traffic enforcement, mapping and GPS navigation, and safe operation of autonomous vehicles. This paper aims to provide an overview of existing definitions, explore the nature of conflict points for each design, provide a framework modeling method for analysis, and provide globally applicable definitions for roundabout features for use in design, education, policy, enforcement, and research. This paper is focused primarily on roundabout design guidance and operations within the United States, but places these practices within the global context, such that the definitions and analyses provided can be applied to all forms of roundabout intersections around the world.

AB This article introduces a time-selective strategy for enhancing temporal consistency of input data for multi-sensor data fusion for in-network data processing in ad hoc wireless sensor networks. Detecting and handling complex time-variable (real-time) situations require methodical consideration of temporal aspects, especially in ad hoc wireless sensor network with distributed asynchronous and autonomous nodes. For example, assigning processing intervals of network nodes, defining validity and simultaneity requirements for data items, determining the size of memory required for buffering the data streams produced by ad hoc nodes and other relevant aspects. The data streams produced periodically and sometimes intermittently by sensor nodes arrive to the fusion nodes with variable delays, which results in sporadic temporal order of inputs. Using data from individual nodes in the order of arrival (i.e. freshest data first) does not, in all cases, yield the optimal results in terms of data temporal consistency and fusion accuracy. We propose time-selective data fusion strategy, which combines temporal alignment, temporal constraints and a method for computing delay of sensor readings, to allow fusion node to select the temporally compatible data from received streams. A real-world experiment (moving vehicles in urban environment) for validation of the strategy demonstrates significant improvement of the accuracy of fusion results.

AB We envision unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for rapid evacuation of critically-ill patients from hazardous locations to health care facilities in safe zones. For safety, medical teams accompany patients to monitor vital signs and titrate anesthesia dose during transport. UAV transports would require continuous automated remote monitoring of both vital signs and of sedative dose to be feasible and safe. Volatile anesthetics (isoflurane) are the only anesthetic agents that can be monitored continuously with infrared spectroscopy (IR) devices; but unsuitable for transport. Our objective is to devise a safe UAV transport protocol incorporating novel technology for gas monitoring. Our group has developed and tested a miniaturized wearable fuel cell sensor that can detect isoflurane gas vapors as low as 40 ppm (within therapeutic range) with a sensitivity of 0.0112 nA ppm(-1) cm(-2). Ambient signal interference was resolved by principal component analysis (PCA). Data variance of 1st and 2nd principal components was 88.68% and 11.31%, respectively. The PCA regression model reported here can determine accurate Isoflurane concentrations. Electronic IoT platform has been built constituting micro-fuel cell, miniaturized electronic components with Bluetooth. This wearable sensor can be incorporated into a comprehensive life support system for casualty evacuation in conjunction with autonomous UAV emergency medical operations. (C) The Author(s) 2018.

TI An SVSF-Based Generalized Robust Strategy for Target Tracking in Clutter
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE Automotive tracking; data association; estimation; smooth variable
   structure filter (SVSF); robust filtering
AB Autonomous self-drive requires intelligence and cognition that relies on observations and tracking of the state of motion of surrounding vehicles. This information can be acquired by using sensors; however, these are often affected by clutter and noise that, in turn, introduce the issues of estimation and data origin uncertainty into the tracking system. The most popular methods for estimation and tracking are based on the well-studied Kalman filter (KF). KF is optimal when noise is white and remains so despite uncertainties in the filter model; the robustness and stability of the KF is affected if this condition is not met. The smooth variable structure filter (SVSF) is a relatively new method that is more robust to disturbances and uncertainties. The SVSF ensures stability by using a discontinuous corrective term that maintains estimates to within a subspace of the true state trajectory. The discontinuous corrective term results in chattering that is removed by using a smoothing boundary layer. In this paper, a generalized covariance formulation of the SVSF and a generalized optimal time-varying smoothing boundary layer are proposed. The generalized optimal SVSF is then combined with a joint probabilistic data association technique for target tracking. The robustness and accuracy of the new form of filtering and data association is validated and comparatively analyzed by its application to an experimental traffic monitoring system based on Light Detection and Ranging.

AB Compared with those of a fixed-wing aircraft, the dynamics of a rotorcraft are significantly more complex. One of the major challenges in the design of an autonomous helicopter is the development of a flight dynamic model, which can be useful for simulation studies and for the design of control law and navigational aspects. There is always a trade-off from the accuracy of the mathematical model to the more simplified model required for a control design as far as the helicopter rotor/fuselage dynamics is concerned. Small-scale helicopters posses a higher bandwidth of dynamics; hence, models developed from the first principle alone do not fulfill the needs, and more-sophisticated mathematical models are thus required. The main objective of the present work is to improve the parameterized identification model by replacing it with a most-general flight dynamic model for a minihelicopter. This model includes the rotor blade flap dynamics, stabilizer bar dynamics, and vehicle dynamics, which will be applicable for a general maneuvering flight. A systematic study is undertaken to analyze the influence of inflow models and flap response on the helicopter trim. Stability of the minihelicopter is also analyzed; except for phugoid, all other modes are stable in hover and high forward flight conditions. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000065.

   transformer; large kernel; attention mechanism
AB Because thermal infrared (TIR) images are not affected by light and foggy environments, which are widely used in various night traffic scenarios. Especially, thermal infrared images also play an important role in autonomous vehicles. However, low contrast and lack of chromaticity have always been their problems. Image colorization is a vital technique to improve the quality of TIR images, which is beneficial to human interpretation and downstream tasks. Despite thermal infrared image colorization methods have been rapidly improved, the detail blurriness and color distortion in colorized images remain under-addressed. Mostly because these methods cannot effectively extract the ambiguous feature information of TIR images. Hence, we propose a large kernel (LK) U-Net and Attention_U-Net-Transformer (ViT-Based) based generative adversarial network. An LK_U-Net is designed to extract the feature of TIR images. Then, a branch structure composed of Attention_U-Net and ViT-Based can provide the network with semantic information from different perspectives to decode features. In addition, a composite loss function is employed to ensure the network generates a high-quality colorized image. The proposed method is evaluated on KAIST and IRVI datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LKAT-GAN over other methods for the task of thermal infrared image colorization. The code is available at https://github.com/jinxinhuo/LKAT-GAN.

AB The navigation performance of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) as the main tool for exploring the ocean greatly affects its work efficiency. Under the circumstance that high-precision GNSS positioning signals cannot be obtained, the role of the Strapdown Inertial Navigation System/Doppler Velocity Log (SINS/DVL) integrated navigation system is becoming more prominent. Due to marine creatures or the seafloor topography, DVL is prone to outliers or even failures during measurement. To solve these problems, a LSTM/SVR-VBAKF algorithm aided integrated navigation system is proposed. First, under normal circumstances of DVL, the output information of SINS and DVL are used as training samples, and they train the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. To enhance the robustness and adaptability of the filter, a novel variational Bayesian adaptive filtering algorithm based on support vector regression is proposed. When the DVL formation is missing, the deep learning method adopted in this paper will be continuously output to ensure the effect of integrated navigation. The shipboard test data is verified from two aspects: filter performance and neural network-assisted integrated navigation system capability. The experimental results show that the new method proposed in this paper can effectively handle a situation where DVL output is not available.

AB One of the challenging issues in a hybrid power system (HPS) is to provide a stable power supply with minimum frequency deviation, which can be accomplished by ensuring a coordinated operation among intermittent type distributed generators (DGs). In this study, the coordinated operation of a tidal turbine generator (TTG) (an emerging and less explored DG), diesel engine generator (DEG) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) based an autonomous HPS (a less explored HPS of this kind) for load frequency control (LFC) is investigated. The coordinated operation of different control loops such as the blade pitch control loop of TTG, supplementary control loop of DEG, and power control loop of PHEVs are realized through the maiden application of the proposed quasi-oppositional harmony search algorithm (QOHSA) based model predictive control (MPC) strategy. To establish the superiority of the proposed QOHSA tuned MPC method in mitigating frequency deviation following disturbance, its performance is compared with that of the coordinated performance obtained using QOHSA tuned conventional controllers and other existing optimization algorithms. The results conclude that the suggested method can significantly reduce frequency fluctuation under different load disturbances. The proposed method can handle different variances of the disturbance signals or noise entering the system as well as the model mismatch.

AB Dual function radar communications (DFRC) systems are attractive technologies for autonomous vehicles, which utilize electromagnetic waves to constantly sense the environment while simultaneously communicating with neighbouring devices. An emerging approach to implementing DFRC systems is to embed information in radar waveforms via index modulation (IM). Implementation of DFRC schemes in vehicular systems gives rise to strict constraints in terms of cost, power efficiency, and hardware complexity. In this paper, we extend IM-based DFRC systems to utilizing sparse arrays and frequency modulated continuous waveforms (FMCWs), which are popular in automotive radar for their simplicity and low hardware complexity. The proposed FMCW-based radar-communications system (FRaC) operates at reduced cost and complexity by transmitting with a reduced number of radio frequency modules, combined with narrowband FMCW signalling. This is achieved via array sparsification in transmission, formulating a virtual multiple-input multiple-output array by combining the signals in one coherent processing interval, in which the narrowband waveforms are transmitted in a randomized manner. Performance analysis and numerical results show that the proposed radar scheme achieves similar resolution performance compared with a wideband radar system operating with a large receive aperture, while requiring less hardware overhead. For the communications subsystem, FRaC achieves higher rates and improved error rates compared to dual-function signalling based on conventional phase modulation.

AB Fast and accurate global localization of autonomous ground vehicles is often required in indoor environments and GPS-shaded areas. Typically, with regard to global localization problem, the entire environment should be observed for a long time to converge. To overcome this limitation, a new initialization method called deep initialization is proposed and it is applied to Monte Carlo localization (MCL). The proposed method is based on the combination of a three-dimensional (3D) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and a camera. Using a camera, pose regression based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is conducted to initialize particles of MCL. Particles are sampled from the tangent space to a manifold structure of the group of rigid motion. Using a 3D LiDAR as a sensor, a particle filter is applied to estimate the sensor pose. Furthermore, we propose a re-localization method for performing initialization whenever a localization failure or the situation of robot kidnapping is detected. Either the localization failure or the kidnapping is detected by combining the outputs from a camera and 3D LiDAR. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a mobile robot platform to prove the method & x2019;s effectiveness in terms of both the localization accuracy and time consumed for estimating the pose correctly.

AB The controversy surrounding military drones has generated many proposals for restricting or prohibiting existing drones, additional autonomous variants that may be created in the future, and the sale of drones to certain markets. Moreover, there is broad interest in regulating military drones, with proposals coming not only from academics but also from NGOs and policymakers. I argue that these proposals generally fail to consider the dual-use character of drones and that they therefore provide inadequate regulatory guidance. Drones are not confined to the military but rather spread across international and domestic security roles, humanitarian relief efforts, and dozens of civilian applications. Drones, their component technologies, the control infrastructure, and the relevant technical expertise would continue to develop under a military-focused regulatory regime as civilian technologies that have the potential to be militarized. I evaluate the prospects of drone regulation with the help of research on other dual-use technologies, while also showing what the study of drones can contribute to that literature. Drones' ubiquity in nonmilitary roles presents special regulatory challenges beyond those associated with WMDs and missiles, which indicates that strict regulatory controls or international governance frameworks are unlikely to succeed. With this in mind, I further argue that future research should acknowledge that drone proliferation across military and civilian spheres is unavoidable and shift focus to considering how drone warfare may be moderated by countermeasures and institutional pressures.

AB Exploring large, unknown, and unstructured environments is challenging for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), but they are valuable tools to inspect large structures safely and efficiently. The Lazy Theta* path-planning algorithm is revisited and adapted to generate paths fast enough to be used in real time and outdoors in large 3D scenarios. In real unknown scenarios, a given minimum safety distance to the nearest obstacle or unknown space should be observed, increasing the associated obstacle detection queries, and creating a bottleneck in the path-planning algorithm. We have reduced the dimension of the problem by considering geometrical properties to speed up these computations. On the other hand, we have also applied a non-regular grid representation of the world to increase the performance of the path-planning algorithm. In particular, a sparse resolution grid in the form of an octree is used, organizing the measurements spatially, merging voxels when they are of the same state. Additionally, the number of neighbors is trimmed to match the sparse tree to reduce the number of obstacle detection queries. The development methodology adopted was Test-Driven Development (TDD) and the outcome was evaluated in real outdoors flights with a multirotor UAV. In the results, the performance shows over 90 percent decrease in overall path generation computation time. Furthermore, our approach scales well with the safety distance increases.

AB The potential of using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for underwater exploration is confined by its limited on-board battery energy and data storage capacity. This problem has been addressed using docking systems by underwater recharging and data transfer for AUVs. In this paper, we propose a vision-based framework by addressing the detection and pose estimation problems for short-range underwater docking using these systems. For robust and credible detection of docking stations, we propose a convolutional neural network called docking neural network (DoNN). For accurate pose estimation, a perspective-n-point algorithm is integrated into our framework. In order to examine our framework in underwater docking tasks, we collected a dataset of 2D images, named underwater docking images dataset (UDID), which is the first publicly available underwater docking dataset to the best of our knowledge. In the field experiments, we first evaluate the performance of DoNN on the UDID and its deformed variations. Next, we examine the pose estimation module by ground and underwater experiments. At last, we integrate our proposed vision-based framework with an ultra-short baseline acoustic sensor, to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our framework by performing experiments in a lake. The experimental results show that the proposed framework is able to detect docking stations and estimate their relative pose more efficiently and successfully, compared with the state-of-the-art baseline systems.

TI Glider soaring via reinforcement learning in the field
SO NATURE
LA English
DT Article
ID BIRDS; TURBULENCE
AB Soaring birds often rely on ascending thermal plumes (thermals) in the atmosphere as they search for prey or migrate across large distances(1-4). The landscape of convective currents is rugged and shifts on timescales of a few minutes as thermals constantly form, disintegrate or are transported away by the wind(5,6). How soaring birds find and navigate thermals within this complex landscape is unknown. Reinforcement learning(7) provides an appropriate framework in which to identify an effective navigational strategy as a sequence of decisions made in response to environmental cues. Here we use reinforcement learning to train a glider in the field to navigate atmospheric thermals autonomously. We equipped a glider of two-metre wingspan with a flight controller that precisely controlled the bank angle and pitch, modulating these at intervals with the aim of gaining as much lift as possible. A navigational strategy was determined solely from the glider's pooled experiences, collected over several days in the field. The strategy relies on on-board methods to accurately estimate the local vertical wind accelerations and the roll-wise torques on the glider, which serve as navigational cues. We establish the validity of our learned flight policy through field experiments, numerical simulations and estimates of the noise in measurements caused by atmospheric turbulence. Our results highlight the role of vertical wind accelerations and roll-wise torques as effective mechanosensory cues for soaring birds and provide a navigational strategy that is directly applicable to the development of autonomous soaring vehicles.

TI Robust Fault-Tolerant Tracking Control for Spacecraft Proximity
   Operations Using Time-Varying Sliding Mode

ID ATTITUDE TRACKING; RELATIVE MOTION; ORBITS; TRANSLATION; DYNAMICS
AB The capture of a free-floating tumbling object using an autonomous vehicle is a key technology for many future orbital missions. Spacecraft proximity operations will play an important role in guaranteeing the success of such missions. In this paper, we technically propose a tracking control scheme for proximity operations between a target and a pursuer spacecraft that ensures accurate relative position tracking as well as attitude synchronization. Specifically, an integrated six degrees of freedom dynamics model is first established to describe the relative motion of the pursuer with respect to the target. Then, a robust fault-tolerant controller is derived by combining the sliding mode control and the adaptive technique. The designed controller is proved to be not only robust against unexpected disturbances and adaptive to unknown and uncertain mass/inertia properties of the pursuer, but also able to accommodate a large class of actuator faults. In particular, by incorporating a novel time-varying forcing function into the sliding dynamics, the proposed control algorithm is able to guarantee the finite-time convergence of the translational and rotational tracking errors, and the convergence time as an explicit parameter can be assigned a priori by the designers. Furthermore, a theoretical analysis is also presented to assess the fault tolerance ability of the designed controller. Finally, numerous examples are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness and demonstrate the benefits of the overall control approach.

ID MIDFREQUENCY ENHANCEMENT; COINCIDENCE FREQUENCY; TONE BURSTS; LAMB WAVE;

AB The development of low-frequency sonar systems, using, for instance, a network of autonomous systems in unmanned vehicles, provides a practical means for bistatic measurements (i.e., when the source and receiver are widely separated) allowing for multiple viewpoints of the target of interest. Time-frequency analysis, in particular, Wigner-Ville analysis, takes advantage of the evolution time dependent aspect of the echo spectrum to differentiate a man-made target, such as an elastic spherical shell, from a natural object of the similar shape. A key energetic feature of fluid-loaded and thin spherical shell is the coincidence pattern, also referred to as the mid-frequency enhancement (MFE), that results from antisymmetric Lamb-waves propagating around the circumference of the shell. This article investigates numerically the bistatic variations of the MFE with respect to the monostatic configuration using the Wigner-Ville analysis. The observed time-frequency shifts of the MFE are modeled using a previously derived quantitative ray theory by Zhang et al. [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 91, 1862-1874 (1993)] for spherical shell's scattering. Additionally, the advantage of an optimal array beamformer, based on joint time delays and frequency shifts is illustrated for enhancing the detection of the MFE recorded across a bistatic receiver array when compared to a conventional time-delay beamformer.

AB In this paper, an integrated management system for the planning and activation of a field monitoring task is presented. The architecture of the system is built around a mobile robotic unit. The internet-based architecture of the system includes a station unit that works as a mobile on-farm operating console, the mobile robotic unit and a field server for generating and storing maps. The hypothesis is that it is possible to automate the planning and execution of the operation of monitoring the in-field weed density and species distribution. The developed planning system includes the automatic field geometrical representation and the route planning for the mobile unit. For the field representation two algorithmic approaches for automated track generation were used. For the route planning, a graph-based field coverage algorithm and a discrete grid-based path planning method were used. The low computational requirements of the implemented algorithms make it feasible to adopt a real-time re-planning strategy in which a set of new planning problems are solved based on the latest information. The central part of such a planning, concerns the dynamic re-evaluation of the initial plan for sampling and routing based on the on-line analysis of the samples. This provides the basis for a fully sequential adaptive adjustment of the sampling procedure after each individual sampling. It is expected that such a dynamic targeted sampling and routing system will reduce the overall cost and time consumption of the weed monitoring operation.

AB A Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) at component level was done to study safety-relevant implications arising from possible failures in performing remote handling (RH) operations at ITER facility [1].
   Autonomous air cushion transporter, pallet, sealed casks and tractor movers needed for port plug mounting/dismantling operation were analysed. For each sub-system, the breakdown of significant components was outlined and, for each component, possible failure modes have been investigated pointing out possible causes, possible actions to prevent the causes. consequences and actions to prevent or mitigate consequences.
   Off-normal events which may result in hazardous consequences to the public and the environment have been defined as Postulated Initiating Events (PIEs). Two safety-relevant PIEs have been defined by assessing elementary failures related to the analysed system. Each PIE has been discussed in order to qualitatively identify accident sequences arising from each of them.
   As an output of this FMEA study, possible incidental scenarios, where the intervention of rescue RH equipments is required to overcome critical situations determined by fault of RH components, were defined as well. Being rescue scenarios of main concern for ITER remote handling activities, such families could be helpful in defining the design requirements of port handling systems in general and on RH transfer system in particular. Furthermore, they could be useful in defining casks and vehicles to be used for rescue activities. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Microbiological investigations utilizing molecular genetic approaches to characterize microbial communities can require large volume water samples, tens to hundreds of liters. The requirement for large volume samples can be especially challenging in deep-sea hydrothermal vent environments of the oceanic ridge system. By and large studies of these environments rely on deep submergence vehicles. However collection of large volume (> 100 L) water samples adjacent to the benthos is not feasible due to weight considerations. To address the technical difficulty of collecting large volume water samples from hydrothermal diffuse flow environments, a semi-autonomous large-volume water sampler (LVWS) was designed. The LVWS is capable of reliably collecting and bringing to the surface 120 L water samples from diffuse flow environments. Microscopy, molecular genetic and chemical analyses of water samples taken from 9degreesN East Pacific Rise are shown to demonstrate the utility of the LVWS for studies of near-benthos environments. To our knowledge this is the first report of virioplankton abundance within diffuse-flow waters of a deep-sea hydrothermal vent environment. Because of its simple design and relatively low cost, the LVWS should be applicable to a variety of studies which require large-volume water samples collected immediately adjacent to the benthos.

AB This paper focuses on the trajectory tracking control of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and time-varying external disturbances. Two adaptive integral terminal sliding mode control schemes, namely, adaptive integral terminal slidingmode control (AITSMC) scheme and adaptive fast integral terminal sliding mode control (AFITSMC) scheme are proposed for UUVs based on integral terminal sliding mode (ITSM) and fast ITSM (FITSM), respectively. Each control scheme is double-looped: composed of a kinematic controller and a dynamic controller. First, a kinematic controller is designed for each of the two control schemes. The two kinematic controllers are based on ITSM and FITSM, respectively. These kinematic controllers yield local finite-time convergence of the position tracking errors to zero meanwhile avoid the singularity problem in the conventional terminal sliding mode control (TSMC). Then, using the output of the kinematic controller as a reference velocity command, a dynamic controller is developed for each of the two control schemes. The two dynamic controllers are also based on ITSM and FITSM, respectively. An adaptive mechanism is introduced to estimate the unknown parameters of the upper bound of the lumped system uncertainty which consists of dynamic uncertainties and time-varying external disturbances so that the prior knowledge of the upper bound of the lumped system uncertainty is not required. The estimated parameters are then used as controller parameters to eliminate the effects of the lumped system uncertainty. The convergence rate of the integral terminal sliding variable vector is investigated and the local finitetime convergence of the velocity tracking errors to zero in the ITSM or FITSM is obtained. Finally, based on the designed kinematic and dynamic controllers, the finite-time stability of the full closed-loop cascaded system is shown. The two proposed control schemes improve the tracking accuracy over the existing globally finite-time stable tracking control (GFTSTC) and adaptive nonsingular TSMC schemes, and enhance the robustness against parameter uncertainties and external disturbances over the GFTSTC scheme. Compared with the conventional adaptive integral sliding mode control (AISMC) scheme, the two proposed control schemes offer faster convergence rate and stronger robustness against dynamic uncertainties and time-varying external disturbances for the trajectory tracking control of UUVs due to involving the fractional integrator. Comparative numerical simulations are performed on the dynamic model of the Omni Directional Intelligent Navigator UUV for two trajectory tracking cases. The convergence rate and robustness to uncertainties and disturbances are quantified as the convergent time and bounds of the steady-state position and velocity tracking errors, respectively. The results show that the two proposed control schemes improve at least 20s in convergence rate and enhance about 2% robustness in position tracking and 20% robustness in velocity tracking over the AISMC scheme.

AB Submarine eruptions dominate volcanism on Earth, but few are observed or even identified. Knowledge of how they operate is largely based on inference from ancient deposits, lagging by a decade or more our understanding of subaerial eruptions. In 2012, the largest wholly deep-subaqueous silicic eruption with any observational record occurred 700-1220 m below sea level at Havre volcano, Kermadec Arc, New Zealand. Pre- and post-eruption shipboard bathymetry surveys, acquisition by autonomous underwater vehicle of meter-scale-resolution bathymetry, and sampling by remote-operated vehicle revealed 14 seafloor lavas and three major seafloor clastic deposits. Here we analyze one of these clastic deposits, an Ash with Lapilli (AL) unit, which drapes the Havre caldera, and interpret the fragmentation and dispersal processes that produced it. Seafloor images of the unit reveal multiple subunits, all ash-dominated. Sampling destroyed layering in all but two samples, but by combining seafloor imagery with granulometry and componentry, we were able to determine the subunits' stratigraphy and spatial extents throughout the study area. Five subunits are distinguished; from the base these are Subunit 1, Subunit 2a, Subunit 3, Subunit 4 (comprising the coeval Subunit 4 west and Subunit 4 east), and Subunit 2b. The stratigraphic relationships of the four AL unit subunits to other seafloor products of the 2012 Havre eruption, coupled with the wealth of remote-operated vehicle observations and detailed AUV bathymetry, allow us to infer the overall order of events through the eruption. Ash formed by explosive fragmentation of a glassy vesicular magma and was dispersed by a buoyant thermal plume and dilute density currents from which Subunits 1 and 2 were deposited. Following a time break (days/weeks?), effusion of lava along the southern caldera rim led to additional ash generation; first by syn-extrusive ash venting, quenching, brecciation, and comminution (S3 and S4e) and then by gravitational collapse of a dome (S4w). Slow deposition of extremely fine ash sustained S2 deposition across the times of S3 and S4 emplacement, so that S2 ash was the last deposited. These thin ash deposits hold information critical for interpretation of the overall eruption, even though they are small in volume and bathymetrically unimpressive. Ash deposits formed during other submarine eruptions are similarly likely to offer new perspectives on associated lavas and coarse pumice beds, both modern and ancient, and on the eruptions that formed them. Submarine ash is widely dispersed prior to deposition, and tuff is likely to be the first product of eruption identified in reconnaissance exploration; it is the start of the trail to vent hydrothermal systems and associated mineralized deposits of submarine volcanoes, as well as a sensitive indicator of submarine eruptive processes.

AB In several countries around the world, the ageing of their populations is accelerating. As middle-aged and elderly people get older, their physical functions gradually decline, and increasing problems with moving around become an important factor preventing them from leading active lives. The popularity of smart cars is going to play an important part in solving this problem. This makes it all the more important to have an accurate un-derstanding of the attitude of middle-aged and elderly people via-`a-vis smart cars, and to take those attitudes into consideration when designing, developing and promoting smart cars. Based on a large number of literature reviews and technology acceptance extension models like TAM and UTAUT, this study proposed and tested a model of the acceptance of smart cars amongst middle-aged and elderly people (MSCTAM) that includes external variables. Other factors that determined whether middle-aged and elderly people in China would accept smart cars were also taken into account. In terms of model verification, we used SEM of SPSS AMOS for fit indices and aggregation validity analysis. The hypothesis test part was based on model fit indices, discriminant validity and path analysis, while power analysis, using Python, was also conducted. The Wilcoxon's Sign Rank Test of SPPS was used for acceptance. For data collection, we mainly used a combination of online and offline questionnaire surveys, with subjects from various provinces and cities in China. A total of 293 questionnaires was collected, and 262 valid responses were obtained. The results showed that the attitudes towards use, perceived usefulness, enjoyment and social norms were significantly positively correlated with usage intention, while trust was positively correlated with usage intention. Affordability was negatively correlated with usage intention, perceived ease of use; reliability was significantly positively correlated with perceived usefulness; enjoyment was significantly positively correlated with perceived ease of use, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, per-sonal innovation, and environment-friendliness. Symbolic value was significantly positively correlated with at-titudes towards use, while safety risks and privacy risks were negatively correlated with attitudes towards use. Of the 16 hypotheses, 12 were supported, indicating that middle-aged and elderly people in China on the one hand have a positive and open attitude towards smart cars, but on the other, also have a number of concerns. The proposed model provides more refined survey models and data support for Chinese smart car developers and manufacturers, and furnishes them with references for the research field of technology acceptance models. The proposed model provides Chinese intelligent automobile development companies and distributors with a more refined survey model and data support, and offers references and guidance for further research of technology acceptance models.

AB A GEOMAR (Kiel, Germany) research team has developed a passive electric field acquisition system for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to optimize seafloor massive sulfides exploration. This sensor was made of two perpendicular and horizontal pairs of electrodes, and was successfully tested over active basalt-hosted hydrothermal site TAG (26 degrees N, Mid-Atlantic Ridge) and several inactive sites in its vicinity. The resulting data underline the efficiency of combining deep-sea electric and magnetic measurements for searching for active and inactive hydrothermal vent fields. With these datasets, it becomes possible to determine the geological nature of the targets and to constrain the characteristics of fluid circulation at depth without involving costly and invasive underwater tools such as Remotely Operated Vehicles or even manned submersibles to collect samples. Data analysis also revealed that AUV attitude variations induce distortions of the electric signal. These distortions start prevailing for dives at altitudes higher than 90 m above the seafloor, as the distance between the AUV becomes too important to guarantee that the signal produced by the geological target still dominates. To improve the acquisition system and reduce the overall noise, we discuss solutions that limit the impact of such attitude variations. These solutions consist of minor adjustments, such as masts at AUVs stern to tow damping electrodes arrays. In such configurations, we believe that deep-sea passive electric measurements combined with high-resolution magnetic measurements can become a highly efficient seafloor exploration tool, including for sulfide deposits associated with inactive hydrothermal systems.
   Plain Language Summary Since the 1970s, the scientific community knows that the seafloor in the vicinity of mid-ocean ridges is associated with hydrothermalism. Fluid circulations drain minerals from the deep crust that are precipitated near the seafloor. These minerals may form seafloor massive sulfide deposits that have raised the interest of the scientific community. Whereas active hydrothermal vent fields may be detected from surface vessels thanks to their associated chemical anomaly diffusing, and potentially drifting in the water column, inactive sites are more challenging to identify. Highresolution magnetic data collected by deep- sea exploration vehicles have proven their efficiency to undertake such exploration. Nevertheless, these data have limitations, such as the non-uniqueness of the interpretations, and must be completed by others to optimize the efficiency of deep-sea research. Here, we present a combined dataset made of deep-sea passive electric, magnetic and bathymetric data, as well as water temperature analyzes collected simultaneously over several active and inactive basalt-hosted hydrothermal sites of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. We emphasize the complementarity nature between highresolution passive electric and magnetic data to identify and study active and inactive hydrothermal sites, and propose engineering adjustments to ensure that this combination becomes the most efficient seafloor exploration tool in the future.

AB Vehicle and airborne navigation users are facing more and more complex signal interference and even spoofing. If vehicles and aircraft do not strengthen their anti-spoofing ability, their navigation performance is bound to be adversely affected. global navigation satellite system (GNSS) spoofing technology has gradually become a preferred interference method for spoofer because of its high concealment and great harm. For spoofer, user terminal increasingly adopts GNSS with inertial measurement unit (IMU): tightly-coupled GNSS/IMU, on this basis, user also configures a variety of anti-spoofing techniques to effectively deal with spoofing. Even if spoofer slowly changes user's positioning, if spoofing strategy is unreasonable, it will lead to the violation of parameter rationality of coupled filter output parameters and spoofing observation, which greatly increases the difficulty of spoofing. In view of the above problems, from the perspective of spoofer, in order to effectively counter the non cooperative target of assembling tightly-coupled GNSS/IMU by using GNSS spoofing, this paper establishes GNSS spoofing mathematical model, and proposes a slowly varying spoofing algorithm to avoid tightly-coupled GNSS/IMU with multiple anti-spoofing techniques based on the analysis of the influence mechanism of spoofing on the positioning of tightly-coupled GNSS/IMU, the algorithm proposes a measurement deviation determination method to avoid a variety of anti-spoofing techniques, which can gradually pull the positioning results of coupled system, and successfully avoid anti-spoofing techniques detection of least squares residual receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) and parameter rationality check. The experimental results show that the algorithm can gradually change positioning of tightly-coupled GNSS/IMU within 30 s, and the north, east and down displacements basically achieve the spoofing effect, the errors with the expected offset are -0.5 m, 1.9 m and 12.7 m respectively. At the same time, the detection of the above anti-spoofing techniques is avoided. The mean value of test statistics for tightly-coupled system is reduced by 75.4% and does not exceed the alarm threshold, so as to achieve the purpose of spoofing, the effectiveness and high concealment of the spoofing algorithm are proved.

AB Nakadomari Hill is an unexplored edifice in the southern Okinawa Trough back-arc basin where crustal extension by continental rifting occurs and few submarine eruptions associated with back-arc volcanism have been mapped in detail. High-resolution bathymetric mapping with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) reveals that Nakadomari Hill is a submarine volcanic complex with recent lava flow eruptions. The high-resolution (2 m) bathymetry shows striking contrast between rugged terrain in the central area and the adjacent smooth terrain. The cone-shaped features in the rugged terrain are covered by ropey fabric with high acoustic reflectivity and are devoid of tectonic deformation, thus they are interpreted to be relatively younger lava domes. The cone-shaped features in the smooth terrain show low reflectivity and are dissected by ENE-WSW trending tectonic lineaments, suggesting they were formed during older volcanism. Nakadomari Hill developed through multi-stage eruptions before and after back-arc rifting and faulting. The ropey and curtain-folded morphology with high acoustic reflectivity are interpreted to be a field of lava flows and they are relatively young. The area considered to be lava flows is estimated to be over 13 km(2), showing that eruptions in the southern Okinawa Trough have been extensive. An active volcanic system is supported by indicators of high-temperature hydrothermal venting. Hydrothermal plumes with concurrent sharp temperature increases of up to 0.17 degrees C were present even at the vehicle altitude of similar to 100 m above the bottom. The alignment of volcanic cone-shaped features at Nakadomari Hill is in the NNW-SSE direction which is clearly different from the orientation of local rifting (ENE-WSW). At a larger scale, the volcanic edifices west of Kume Island from the arc to back-arc are also aligned roughly in the NNW-SSE direction and they are sub-parallel to a major tectonic structure in the arc, the Kerama Gap. The agreement of the local volcanic and tectonic trends implies that magmatic focusing may have taken place along the tectonic structures of the Kerama gap and in turn caused the extensive back-arc volcanism in this area.

AB Advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs), particularly pedestrian protection systems (PPSs), have emerged as a hot research topic with the goal of enhancing traffic safety. The development of reliable on-board pedestrian detection systems is a critical problem for PPSs. It is extremely difficult to provide the required resilience of this type of system due to the fluctuating look of pedestrians (e.g., varied attire, changing size, aspect ratio, and dynamic shape) and the unstructured surroundings. The detection of pedestrians has gained huge focus among researchers because of its huge applications in the domain of automated vehicles. In the previous decades, the majority of examinations are done to obtain better solutions for detecting pedestrians, but fewer of them concentrated on determining the pedestrian. It is one of crucial interest to study regarding transport safety as it implies minimizing the count of traffic collisions and protecting pedestrians who are more susceptible to accidents. Predicting pedestrian conduct is critical for road safety, traffic management systems, ADAS, and autonomous vehicles in general. The fundamental problem in the field of self-driving and smart automobiles is identifying impediments, particularly people, and taking action to avoid collisions with them. Various studies have been conducted in this sector by many researchers, yet there are still many mistakes in the proper identification of pedestrians. Hence, this paper devises an approach to estimate pedestrian time for crossing in an advanced driving assistance system (ADAS). The inputted videos undergo keyframe extraction wherein crucial keyframes are extracted. The deep joint segmentation is further applied for identifying the pedestrian followed by intention classification. Then, the estimation of pedestrian time to cross is predicted using Hybrid-Long short term memory (HY-LSTM), and it is a new time series model obtained by unifying LSTM and Object-based convolution neural network (OCNN), where the layer and hyperparameters of OCNN are optimally derived using Gradient Chef Based Optimization (GCBO). The proposed GCBO-HY-LSTM outperformed showing the least Mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.038, Mean square error (MSE) of 0.029, and Root Mean square error (RMSE) of 0.170.

AB Since the 1990s, state-dependent Riccati equation (SORE) strategies have emerged as general design methods that provide a systematic and effective means of designing nonlinear controllers, observers and filters These methods overcome many of the difficulties and shortcomings of existing methodologies, and deliver computationally simple algorithms that have been highly effective in a variety of practical and meaningful applications in very diverse fields of study. These include missiles, aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, satellites and spacecraft, ships, autonomous underwater vehicles, automotive systems, biomedical systems, process control, and robotics, along with various benchmark problems, as well as nonlinear systems exhibiting several interesting phenomena such as parasitic effects of friction and backlash, unstable nonminimum-phase dynamics, time-delay, vibration and chaotic behavior SORE controllers, in particular, have become very popular within the control community, providing attractive stability, optimality, robustness and computational properties, making real-time implementation in feedback form feasible. However, despite a documented history of SORE control in the literature, there is a significant lack of theoretical justification for logical choices of the design matrices, which have depended on intuitive rules of thumb and extensive simulation for evaluation and performance. In this paper, the capabilities and design flexibility of SORE control are emphasized, addressing the issues on systematic selection of the design matrices and going into detail concerning the art of systematically carrying out an effective SORE design for systems that both do and do not conform to the basic structure and conditions required by the method. Several situations that prevent the direct application of the SDRE technique, such as the presence of control and state constraints, are addressed, demonstrating how these situations can be readily handled using the method In order to provide a clear understanding of the proposed methods, systematic and effective design tools of SORE control are illustrated on a single-inverted pendulum nonlinear benchmark problem and a practical application problem of optimally administering chemotherapy in cancer treatment Lastly, real-time implementation aspects are discussed with relevance to practical applicability.

AB Today's modern cities depend on basic services such as water and sewer systems including tunnels, which are supported by a pervasive infrastructure. The structural condition of these places is naturally prone to deterioration. Therefore, regular inspections are required for early detection of damage and material failure. It is envisaged that robotic systems may provide an up-to-date solution for this inspection task. Considering the challenging conditions in the surrounding environments, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may be a potential candidate to meet the need for both purely visual (contactless) and subsurface (contact-based) inspection functionalities. When the interaction with an uncooperative target is required, the UAV needs to be aware of the forces arising during the contact phase. This stage brings additional challenges including a variable center of gravity as well as the moment of inertias due to the shift in the attached parts, sliding on the target because of the surface characteristics and reaching desired interaction levels out of the equilibrium point without crashing the dedicated sensors while creating counter forces (reactions) in a desired manner. At the same time, ultrasonic inspection requires uninterrupted contact in certain force ranges. In order to address these factors in a compact and feasible manner, an optimization algorithm consisting of nonlinear moving horizon estimation (NMHE), which is a part of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is proposed. In this algorithm, the baseline model of the UAV is augmented by the external forces where uncertainties, modeling mismatches and disturbances are lumped. Therefore, the NMHE has estimated these values in an online manner. In a simultaneous fashion, the identified external forces are fed into the NMPC to physically interact with the ceiling during the contact phase. The experimental inspection data is collected while autonomously staying in predefined constraint limits. It is observed that the complete inspection data is obtained and streamed via Bluetooth when the force on the ultrasonic tool reached 5.5 N level. The external force update coming from the estimation allows the proposed approach to reach these interaction levels.

AB Coral growth patterns result from an interplay of coral biology and environmental conditions. In this study colony size and proportion of live and dead skeletons in the cold-water coral (CWC) Lopheliapertusa (Linnaeus, 1758) were measured using video footage from Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) transects conducted at the inshore Mingulay Reef Complex (MRC) and at the offshore PISCES site (Rockall Bank) in the NE Atlantic. The main goal of this paper was to explore the development of a simple method to quantify coral growth and its potential application as an assessment tool of the health of these remote habitats. Eighteen colonies were selected and whole colony and dead/living layer size were measured. Live to dead layer ratios for each colony were then determined and analysed. The age of each colony was estimated using previously published data. Our paper shows that: (1) two distinct morphotypes can be described: at the MRC, colonies displayed a 'cauliflower-shaped' morphotype whereas at the PISCES site, colonies presented a more flattened 'bush-shaped' morphotype; (2) living layer size was positively correlated with whole colony size; (3) live to dead layer ratio was negatively correlated to whole colony size; (4) live to dead layer ratio never exceeded 0.27. These results suggest that as a colony develops and its growth rate slows down, the proportion of living polyps in the colony decreases. Furthermore, at least 73% of L. pertusa colonies are composed of exposed dead coral skeleton, vulnerable to ocean acidification and the associated shallowing of the aragonite saturation horizon, with significant implications for future deep-sea reef framework integrity. The clear visual contrast between white/pale living and grey/dark dead portions of the colonies also gives a new way by which they can be visually monitored over time. The increased use of marine autonomous survey vehicles offers an important new platform from which such a surveying technique could be applied to monitor deep-water marine protected areas in the future.

AB BackgroundAutonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and animal telemetry have become important tools for understanding the relationships between aquatic organisms and their environment, but more information is needed to guide the development and use of AUVs as effective animal tracking platforms. A forward-facing acoustic telemetry receiver (VR2Tx 69 kHz; VEMCO, Bedford, Nova Scotia) attached to a novel AUV (gliding robotic fish) was tested in a freshwater lake to (1) compare its detection efficiency (i.e., the probability of detecting an acoustic signal emitted by a tag) of acoustic tags (VEMCO model V8-4H 69 kHz) to stationary receivers and (2) determine if detection efficiency was related to distance between tag and receiver, direction of movement (toward or away from transmitter), depth, or pitch.ResultsDetection efficiency for mobile (robot-mounted) and stationary receivers were similar at ranges less than 300 m, on average across all tests, but detection efficiency for the mobile receiver decreased faster than for stationary receivers at distances greater than 300 m. Detection efficiency was higher when the robot was moving toward the transmitter than when moving away from the transmitter. Detection efficiency decreased with depth (surface to 4 m) when the robot was moving away from the transmitter, but depth had no significant effect on detection efficiency when the robot was moving toward the transmitter. Detection efficiency was higher when the robot was descending (pitched downward) than ascending (pitched upward) when moving toward the transmitter, but pitch had no significant effect when moving away from the transmitter.ConclusionResults suggested that much of the observed variation in detection efficiency is related to shielding of the acoustic signal by the robot body depending on the positions and orientation of the hydrophone relative to the transmitter. Results are expected to inform hardware, software, and operational changes to gliding robotic fish that will improve detection efficiency. Regardless, data on the size and shape of detection efficiency curves for gliding robotic fish will be useful for planning future missions and should be relevant to other AUVs for telemetry. With refinements, gliding robotic fish could be a useful platform for active tracking of acoustic tags in certain environments.

AB Poor air quality is considered among the main causes of millions of premature deaths annually, about 8 million in 2012 according to the World Health Organization [1]. Several epidemiological studies have found a relationship between exposure beyond specified limits and burden of disease [2]. These and many more have led to an increased and urgent need to both monitor and consequently limit personal exposure to harmful pollutants [3]. There is a generalized attention from different governmental agencies globally to limit anthropogenic emissions via legislations and policies. City councils, including for instance in Cambridge, UK, promote new policies that help accelerate switching from combustion engines to electric vehicles both for public and for private transport, accompanied by installation of a distributed urban network of rapid charging points by 2020 [4], along with imposition of road taxes, and exemption from the same based on vehicles' emission of polluting gases and smaller particulate matter (PM2.5). Besides, reduction of indoor wood burning for heating, as one of the largest sources of indoor particulate matter, also has the potential to drastically reduce PM2.5 exposure levels. Citizens are nowadays more conscious of and attentive to their personal exposure to polluting agents and environments and prone to adopt cleaner solutions for living, transport, energy generation and heating. Adoption of personal exposure monitoring devices on an individual level therefore offers multiple benefits and is motivated by the willingness to continue making healthier choices in everyday life consistently. Access to high resolution data of personal exposure with high space and time accuracy is however difficult to achieve with currently available centralized or public network of monitoring stations. Providing individuals with portable devices for air quality monitoring that operate in real time and allow them to monitor and record their personalized exposure levels in combination with conventional geolocation offering a half-meter or less space resolution may become a unique instrument and breakthrough, not only for the individuals, but also for the city councils, and other government agencies to shape and fine-tune their policies for control of air quality in urban, industrial and rural areas. This is possible with the use of both existing and emerging technologies for autonomous sensors, data communication and modern mobile networks, including Internet of Things.

AB The continuing development of avionics for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs) is introducing higher levels of intelligence and autonomy both in the flight vehicle and in the ground mission control, allowing new promising operational concepts to emerge. One-to-Many (OTM) UAS operations is one such concept and its implementation will require significant advances in several areas, particularly in the field of Human-Machine Interfaces and Interactions (HMI2). Measuring cognitive load during OTM operations, in particular Mental Workload (MWL), is desirable as it can relieve some of the negative effects of increased automation by providing the ability to dynamically optimize avionics HMI2 to achieve an optimal sharing of tasks between the autonomous flight vehicles and the human operator. The novel Cognitive Human Machine System (CHMS) proposed in this paper is a Cyber-Physical Human (CPH) system that exploits the recent technological developments of affordable physiological sensors. This system focuses on physiological sensing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques that can support a dynamic adaptation of the HMI2 in response to the operators' cognitive state (including MWL), external/environmental conditions and mission success criteria. However, significant research gaps still exist, one of which relates to a universally valid method for determining MWL that can be applied to UAS operational scenarios. As such, in this paper we present results from a study on measuring MWL on five participants in an OTM UAS wildfire detection scenario, using Electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye tracking measurements. These physiological data are compared with a subjective measure and a task index collected from mission-specific data, which serves as an objective task performance measure. The results show statistically significant differences for all measures including the subjective, performance and physiological measures performed on the various mission phases. Additionally, a good correlation is found between the two physiological measurements and the task index. Fusing the physiological data and correlating with the task index gave the highest correlation coefficient (CC = 0.726 +/- 0.14) across all participants. This demonstrates how fusing different physiological measurements can provide a more accurate representation of the operators' MWL, whilst also allowing for increased integrity and reliability of the system.

AB Deep-sea sponge grounds are relatively understudied ecosystems that may provide key habitats for a large number of fish and invertebrates including commercial species. Glass sponge grounds have been discovered from the tropics to polar regions but there are only a few places with high densities of dictyonine sponges. Dictyonine glass sponges have a fused skeleton, which stays intact when they die and in some areas the accumulation of successive generations of sponges leads to the formation of reefs. In 2010 and 2016, we surveyed an area near Grays Canyon in Washington, USA, where dense aggregations of glass sponges and potential sponge reefs were discovered in 2007. Our primary aims were to make a preliminary assessment of whether the glass sponges form reefs at this location, characterize the sponge assemblage present at this site and examine associations between the sponges and commercially important species. Multibeam mapping and sub-bottom profiling indicate that the glass sponges at this site do not form reefs and are mostly attached to hard substrates. Analysis of photographs collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle and samples collected by a remotely operated vehicle guided by telepresence revealed the presence of two abundant dictyonine sponge species at this site, Heterochone calyx and Aphrocallistes vastus (mean densities = 1.43 +/- 0.057 per 10 m(2), max = 24 per 10 m(2)). We also observed a large number of non-reef-building glass sponges and various demosponges including a potentially new species in the genus Acarnus. A diverse fish assemblage was recorded at this site including eight species of rockfish. Rockfish abundance was positively related to sponge abundance. Spot prawns (Pandalus platyceros) were also abundant and were strongly associated with sponges. Despite not finding sponge reefs, this is an ecologically significant area. Further research is necessary to determine the environmental factors that give rise to the abundance of large dictyonine sponges at this location and also to determine if other similar sponge grounds exist along the west coast of the United States.

AB Coralline algae constitute a cosmopolitan group of calcifying rhodophytes (red algae) that display characteristic optical fingerprints due to light absorption by specific light-harvesting pigments. The spectrally conspicuous nature of coralline algae makes them potential candidates for optical remote sensing surveys. Recently, underwater hyperspectral imaging (UHI), which we believe is a novel optical remote sensing technique, also has become the subject of marine research. The aim of the study was to characterize the spectral properties of different coralline algal species and to assess the potential of UHI as a coralline algal identification and mapping tool. Four species of coralline algae were investigated: Corallina officinalis, Lithothamnion glaciale, Phymatolithon lenormandii, and Phymatolithon tenue. Important coralline algal pigments were identified using spectrophotometry and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Reflectance spectra of all species were obtained using both a spectrometer and UHI. Multivariate statistical analyses were performed on the reflectance data to identify spectral differences between the species and the instruments. Supervised classification of coralline algae in UHI transects recorded both in vivo and in situ was also carried out. R-phycoerythrin and chlorophyll a were found to be the most dominant coralline algal pigments. The analyzed species of coralline algae displayed highly similar reflectance spectra, and dips in reflectance corresponding to the absorbance peaks of R-phycoerythrin and chlorophyll a were identified in all spectra. Wavelengths corresponding to R-phycoerythrin light absorbance were the greatest contributors to interspecific spectral differences, but the investigated coralline algal species could not be spectrally distinguished with great accuracy. Optical signatures recorded using different instruments were comparable, but inter-instrumental spectral differences were found to be greater than interspecific differences. Supervised UHI classification was unable to accurately map different coralline algal species due to the similarity of the optical fingerprints; however, as a group, coralline algae could easily be identified. In the future, large-scale UHI surveys of coralline algal habitats should be carried out using platforms such as remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to enhance our understanding of this widespread and ecologically important organism group.

ID OPTIC FLOW; VISION; SYSTEM; COMPUTATION; FLIGHT
AB Considerable attention has been paid during the past decade to navigation systems based on the use of visual optic flow cues. Optic flow based visuomotor control systems have been implemented on an increasingly large number of sighted autonomous robots designed to travel under specific lighting conditions. Many algorithms based on conventional cameras or custom-made sensors are being used nowadays to process visual motion. In this paper, we focus on the reliability of our optical sensors, which can be used to measure the local one-dimensional angular speed of robots flying outdoors over a visual scene in terms of their accuracy, range, refresh rate, and sensitivity to illuminance variations. We have designed, constructed, and characterized two miniature custom-made visual motion sensors: (i) the APIS (adaptive pixels for insect-based sensors)-based local motion sensor involving the use of an array custom-made in Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) technology, which is equipped with Delbruck-type autoadaptive pixels, and (ii) the LSC-based (LSC is a component purchased from iC-Haus) local motion sensor involving the use of off-the-shelf linearly amplified photosensors, which is equipped with an onchip preamplification circuit. By combining these photodetectors with a low-cost optical assembly and a bioinspired visual processing algorithm, highly effective miniature sensors were obtained for measuring the visual angular speed in field experiments. The present study focused on the static characteristics and the dynamic responses of these local motion sensors over a wide range of illuminance values, ranging from 50 to 10,000 lux both indoors and outdoors. Although outdoor experiments are of great interest to equip micro-air vehicles with visual motion sensors, we also performed indoor experiments as a comparison. The LSC-based visual motion sensor was found to be more accurate in a narrow, 1.5-decade illuminance range, whereas the APIS-based visual motion sensor was more robust to illuminance changes in a larger, 3-decade range. The method presented in this study provides a new benchmark test for thoroughly characterizing visual motion and optic flow sensors designed to operate outdoors under various lighting conditions, in unknown environments where future micro-aerial vehicles will be able to navigate safely.

AB Fuel cell technology can offer environmental benefits (low noise and emissions) and also a competitive advantage over conventional power sources (better performance, low thermal signature, less vibration issues, etc) in small manned and unmanned electric air vehicles (UAVs). To develop an environmentally acceptable solution, the hydrogen fuel source must be produced on-site from renewable energy sources. This paper describes the development and testing of a fully operational small-scale demonstrator to generate and supply hydrogen for 2 to 3 daily fuel cell-powered UAV operations. The purity of the hydrogen delivered to the air platforms is >= 99.99%.
   Solar irradiation data and daily hydrogen demand across the year for the location selected (Ocana, Spain) were employed as the primary input to a spreadsheet-based model to calculate a recommended the optimum sizing solution. Simulations were then performed to assess the expected operation of the system. Additional practical issues were then considered, including project budget, available space, size and availability of commercial components, safety standards and regulatory compliance. The design selected comprises a concentrated photovoltaic array (CPV), an alkaline electrolyser, a hydrogen buffer tank and a diaphragm hydrogen compressor. Four small composite tanks rated at 3000 barg are included to ensure enough endurance and fast refuelling of the UAVs at any time during the year. These tanks are recharged and installed on-board the UAV at the beginning of each flying mission. For the system to operate effectively the recommended design has 10 kW of CPV capacity and over 34 Nm(3) of total hydrogen storage capacity to accumulate hydrogen generation during sunny periods and guarantee performance across winter months.
   Once the detailed design was completed, all components were installed and assembled, including a bespoke control system for self-governing off-grid operation. Grid-connected tests were then carried out to assess the components integration and acceptance prior to any unsupervised off-grid operation. It is expected that the system will provide enough field data to act as a test-bed towards a fully autonomous refuelling solution for UAVs. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB In multi-UAV networks, the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) associations between a UAV and a user equipment (UE) is typically coupled, which restricts each UE to associate to the same UAV for both DL and UL. However, this mode may not be efficient since UAV networks can be heterogeneous (e.g., multi-tier UAV networks) and can experience high link uncertainty due to the mobility of UAVs. The introduction of full-duplex communication in a multi-UAV network further complicates the UE-UAV association. For this reason, the idea of DL-UL decoupling (DUDe) is introduced in this work, with which each UE is allowed to associate with separate UAVs for UL and DL transmissions. Besides, the UE-UAV association depends on the flight trajectory of the UAVs, which makes the DUDe design challenging. In this article, we study the joint decoupled UL-DL association and trajectory design problem for full-duplex multi-UAV networks. A joint optimization problem is formulated with the objective of maximizing the UEs' sum-rate in both UL and DL. Since the problem is non-convex with sophisticated states and an individual UAV may not know the reward functions of other UAVs, a robust partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model is proposed to characterize the model uncertainty. A multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach is proposed which enables each UAV to select its policy in a distributed manner. To train the actor-critic neural networks in the MADRL approach, an improved clip and count-based proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is developed. In particular, a modified clip distribution is designed to deal with the hard restrictions between current and old policies, and an intrinsic reward is introduced to enhance the exploration capability. Simulation results illustrate the superiority of our proposed schemes when compared to the benchmarks. The codes are made publicly available in GitHub (https://github.com/isdai/MADRL-PPO).

AB The visual-inertial navigation system using a single camera and IMU requires an accurate initialization without increasing the processing cost and complexity for real-time deployment. The processing cost in the existing solutions can be traced to the gyroscopic bias estimation using 1) Closed-form solutions (Martinelli, Int. J. Comput. Vis. 106(2), 138-152, 2014; Kaiser et al., IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett. 2(1), 18-25, 2017 and 2) Loosely coupled schemes using visual-inertial alignment (Mur-Artal and Tardos IEEE Robot. Autom. Lett. 2(2), 796-803 2017); Qin, IEEE Trans. Robot. 34(4), 1004-1020 2018). The complexity arises because of the non-linear nature of the system to estimate the gyro bias, which is solved either by directly solving the non-linear, non-convex problem or by decoupling the vision and IMU measurements using linear models. The termination conditions are based on condition number or covariance of the estimated variables, which varies from one experiment to another. The present paper seeks to improve the closed-form solution with higher accuracy and less processing cost per frame. The proposed method separates the gyroscope bias estimation from the closed-form solution using tightly coupled but linear models with reduced number of variables in the closed-form solution. This paper also addresses the problem inherent to the closed-form solutions, which requires sufficient motion in the initialization window with a minimum number of common features. Towards this, a novel method of propagating the past information into the present initialization window is presented. This reduces the total processing cost per frame by limiting the initialization window to 10 frames approximate to 1s without compromising the motion inside the window. We also present a common and intuitive termination criteria which is independent from the experiment scenario. This helps to increase the robustness in the initialization by removing erroneous solutions. The proposed method is evaluated with EuRoC Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) dataset (Burri et al. 2016) sequences. We compare the proposed method with a recently proposed loosely coupled method, which shows the improved accuracy, processing cost and robustness in the initialization.

AB Labour shortages and fatal accidents in agricultural work have recently emerged as critical problems in Japan, necessitating productivity enhancement, workload reduction, and safety assurance. Therefore, in Japan and countries with similar agricultural environments, the use of small and inexpensive agricultural robots that can be employed in mountain farms and orchards is desirable. In this study, a dynamic positioning test was performed in orchards in a mountainous region to verify the positioning accuracy and stability of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and realtime kinematic (RTK)-GNSS. In addition, a simulator for an agricultural robot that could consider the environmental information of orchards was developed, and driving tests were conducted using the GNSS data acquired in the simulation. The error of the GNSS module was set to be higher than that for the measured value, and the robot travelling in the orchard was simulated. The results of GNSS positioning tests in an orchard near a mountainous area indicate that in the specific environmental conditions, the RTK-GNSS and stand-alone (SA)-GNSS can attain a positioning accuracy with an order of tens of centimetres and few metres, respectively. Moreover, the simulation results based on the GNSS positioning results indicate that a vehicle implementing RTKGNSS and a simple obstacle detection sensor can travel autonomously in a farmyard without colliding with the tree rows. In contrast, a vehicle implementing SA-GNSS and a simple obstacle detection sensor cannot drive autonomously in an orchard and must realise self- positioning using a more accurate sensor. Therefore, the proposed approach of realising simulations of autonomous agricultural robots based on GNSS data from a real orchard can facilitate the evaluation of practical agricultural robots and confirm safe travelling roots. Furthermore, the results demonstrate the possibility of developing small agricultural robots for orchards. We conducted the GNSS positioning test in an orchard at an altitude of approximately 830 m. A similar performance can be expected under alike agricultural situations because the error of the GNSS module was set to be higher than the measured value in the driving simulation test.

   characterization; interactive 3-D visualization
AB Over the past few years there have been remarkable and concomitant advances in sonar technology, positioning capabilities, and computer processing power that have revolutionized the mapping, imaging and exploration of the seafloor. Future developments must involve all aspects of the "seafloor mapping system," including, sonars, ancillary sensors (motion sensors, positioning systems, and sound speed sensors), platforms upon which they are mounted, and the products that are produced. Current trends in sonar development involve the use of innovative new transducer materials and the application of sophisticated processing techniques including focusing algorithms that dynamically compensate for the curvature of the wavefront in the nearfield and thus allow narrower beam widths (higher lateral resolution) at close ranges . Future developments will involve "hybrid", phase-comparison/beam-forming sonars, the development of broad-band "chirp" multibeam sonars, and perhaps synthetic aperture multibeam sonars. The inability to monitor the fine-scale spatial and temporal variability of the sound speed structure of the water column is often a limiting factor in the production of accurate maps of the seafloor; improvements in this area will involve continuous monitoring devices as well as improved ocean models and perhaps tomography. Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV's) and particularly Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV's) will become more important as platforms for seafloor mapping systems. There will also be great changes in the products produced from seafloor mapping and the processing necessary to create them. New processing algorithms are being developed that take advantage of the density of multibeam sonar data and use statistically robust techniques to "clean" massive data sets very rapidly. A range of approaches are being explored to use multibeam sonar bathymetry and imagery to extract quantitative information about seafloor properties, including those relevant to fisheries habitat. The density of these data also enable the use of interactive 3-D visualization and exploration tools specifically designed to facilitate the interpretation and analysis of very large, complex, multi-component spatial data sets. If properly georeferenced and treated, these complex data sets can be presented in a natural and intuitive manner that allows the simple integration and fusion of multiple components without compromise to the quantitative aspects of the data and opens up new worlds of interactive exploration to a multitude of users.

AB Crescent-shaped bedforms with wavelengths from 20 to 80 m, amplitudes to 2.5 m, and concave down-canyon crests occur in the axial channel of Monterey Canyon (offshore California, USA) in water depths from 11 to more than 350 m. The existence of these features may be an important new clue as to how sediment moves through submarine canyons. Three complementary studies were initiated in 2007 to understand the origin and evolution of these bedforms. (1) Vibracoring. Three transects of closely spaced remotely operated vehicle-collected vibracores were obtained across these bedforms. The seafloor underneath these features is composed of gravity-flow deposits. (2) Acoustic array. Three boulder-sized concrete monuments containing acoustic beacons were buried just below the surface of the canyon floor in similar to 290 m water depth and their locations were redetermined on 17 subsequent occasions. Although the beacons became more deeply buried >0.6 m below the seafloor, they still could be tracked acoustically. Over a 26-month period the position of 1 or more of the beacons moved down-canyon during at least 6 discrete transport events for a total displacement of 994-1676 m. The movement and burial of the monuments suggest that the seabed was mobilized to >1 m depth during gravity-flow events. (3) Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) repeat mapping. AUV-acquired high-resolution multibeam mapping, and CHIRP (compressed high-intensity radar pulse) subbottom profiling surveys of the seafloor in the active channel were repeated four times in the first half of 2007. In addition, the movement of large instrument frames deployed in 2001-2003 within the axis of Monterey Canyon in the area now known to be associated with the crescent-shaped bedforms is documented. The fate of the frames has helped elucidate the frequency, transport potential, and processes occurring within the axis of Monterey Canyon associated with these bed-forms. The crescent-shaped bedforms appear to be produced during brief gravity-flow events that occur multiple times each year, commonly coincident with times of large significant wave heights. Whether the bedforms are generated by erosion associated with cyclic steps in turbidity flows or internal deformation associated with slumping during gravity-flow events remains unclear.

AB Background and Purpose: This work explains the duets in both, human brain and animal behavior. Duets transmit the knowledge and learning messages within the Universal Brain, by the Flow of Favorable Factors, through the Barrier. The Time-Information-Space Set, TISS is formed.
   Material and Methods: Real-time computer is used for data acquisition from three duets: the northern true katydid, Pterophylla camellifolia (Orthopteria, Tettigoniidae); the firefly, Photuris versi-color the bird, white-crested jay thrush, Garrulax leucolophus patkaicus (Timaliidae). Computer models relate behavioral duets to the duets within the human mind, perception and brain.
   Results: The following types of duets have been identified: solo, alternation, aggression, selective courting, aggressive mimicry, complex messages using sequences of syllables. These duets are based on: steps in a response function; Brain Windows; patterns; message quanta; chaos and attractors. The human brain-mind tissue, TISS, is presented.
   Conclusion: Human Brain, Mind and behavior are composed of communicating agents, Three classes of duets have been identified. The chaotic duet is a dynamic structure. Duet trajectories concentrate in to a narrow attractor space. This is a case of massive. self-organization. The courting/mimicry duets are based on symbol-signal processing and are capable of discovering the hidden information by observing sample behavior and comparing it with the past learned experience. The pattern duet is capable to recognize inexact, incomplete patterns. Through many duet loops, the human brain agents called kalydids, fireflies and birds learn about the partner, and adapt answers and behavior. Symbol-signal processing is responsible for mental states and for consciousness. The genetic, sensation and mental vehicles in all layers of the Barrier, combine the born-with knowledge, with learning, The layers are unconscious of the underlying vehicle traffic regulations. Yet each layer of the Barrier recognizes the intentions and the meaning of quanta] messages within its duet domain, The duets are involved in the Universal Brain and Mind self-organization and in perception, The dynamic nodes, groups, flocks and pools form the brain-mind tissue TISS.

AB Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to become integral components of future cellular networks. To this end, one of the important problems to address is how to support energy-efficient UAV operation while maintaining reliable connectivity between those aerial users and cellular networks. In this paper, we aim to minimize the energy consumption of cellular-connected UAV via jointly designing the mission completion time and UAV trajectory, as well as communication base station (BS) associations, while ensuring a satisfactory communication connectivity with the ground cellular network during the UAV flight. An optimization problem is formulated by taking into account the UAV's flight energy consumption and various practical aspects of the air-ground communication models, including BS antenna pattern, interference from non-associated BSs and local environment. The formulated problem is difficult to tackle due to the lack of closed-form expressions and non-convexity nature. To this end, we first assume that the channel knowledge map (CKM) or radio map for the considered area is available, which contains rich information about the relatively stable (large-scale) channel parameters. By utilizing path discretization technique, we obtain a discretized equivalent problem and develop an efficient solution based on graph theory by employing convex optimization technique and a dynamic-weight shortest path algorithm over graph. Next, we study the more practical case that the CKM is unavailable initially. By transforming the optimization problem to a Markov decision process (MDP), we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based on multi-step learning and double Q-learning over a dueling Deep Q-Network (DQN) architecture, where the UAV acts as an agent to explore and learn its moving policy according to its local observations of the measured signal samples. Extensive simulations are carried out and the results show that our proposed designs significantly outperform baseline schemes. Furthermore, our results reveal new insights of energy-efficient UAV flight with connectivity requirements and unveil the tradeoff between UAV energy consumption and time duration along line segments.

AB Airport passenger leakage is the phenomenon of air passengers choosing to travel longer distances to access more extensive air services offered by airlines at an out-of-region hub (or, substitute) airport, instead of using their local airports. Airport leakage can cause further reduction in services offered by airlines at a local airport, thereby causing even further leakage, and so on, which can significantly impact an airport's role in the growth of the local economy. This paper explores the geographic and operational attributes of local-and-substitute airport pairs in the United States, explicitly accounting for the interactive feedback relationship between passenger volumes and air service characteristics that contribute to the onset, persistence, and exacerbation of airport passenger leakage. A two-stage least squares regression model of air passenger demand at small- and medium-sized airports is first presented, where local passengers may travel by vehicle to larger, out-of-region hub airports. The results confirm that airfare and passenger volume relationships exist between the local and substitute airport pairs included in the dataset, and that lower airfares at the substitute airport have a greater impact on airport choices made by larger travel groups. They also suggest the existence of positive feedback in that if an airport attracts increasingly smaller passenger numbers with fewer air services and fewer air services with fewer passengers, without external intervention airport leakage impacts may be irreversible and exacerbate over time. A conceptual market share equilibrium analysis is used to illustrate the mechanisms of a direct two-way feedback relationship between passenger volumes at a local airport and air service characteristics at both the local and substitute airports. With data, this quantitative framework can help guide airport planners in further assessing and verifying suspected passenger leakage issues at their airport. The results suggest that without intervention, airport leakage impacts may be difficult to reverse; further exacerbating the trend are technological advancements that make driving cheaper and easier (connected and autonomous vehicles). However, the results can also guide planners in choosing the types and degrees of infrastructure investments and airline incentives that may be used to expand or retain air services to attract passengers.

   This work is relevant in the context of multi-user LiDAR applications where multiple LiDARs may be active in the same environment simultaneously. Automotive safety, driving assistance, robotic navigation, and automated industrial vehicles are a few examples of scenarios where interference among concurrent LiDARs quickly becomes a critical issue. In those applications, being able to guarantee interference-free LiDAR operation is a necessary step towards the realization of safe and reliable functions.
   Abstract This paper describes an optical interference suppression scheme that allows flash light detection and ranging (LiDAR) imagers to run safely and reliably in uncontrolled environments where multiple LiDARs are expected to operate concurrently. The issue of optical interference is a potential show-stopper for the adoption of flash LiDAR as a technology of choice in multi-user application fields such as automotive sensing and autonomous vehicle navigation. The relatively large emission angle and field of view of flash LiDAR imagers make them especially vulnerable to optical interference. This work illustrates how a time-correlated single-photon counting LiDAR can control the timing of its laser emission to reduce its statistical correlation to other modulated or pulsed light sources. This method is based on a variable random delay applied to the laser pulse generated by LiDAR and to the internal circuitry measuring the time-of-flight. The statistical properties of the pseudorandom sequence of delays determines the effectiveness of LiDAR resilience against unintentional and intentional optical interference. For basic multi-camera operation, a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) was used as a random delay generator, and the performance of the interference suppression was evaluated as a function of sequence length and integration time. Direct interference from an identical LiDAR emitter pointed at the same object was reduced up to 50 dB. Changing integration time between 10 ms and 100 ms showed a marginal impact on the performance of the suppression (less than 3 dB deviation). LiDAR signal integrity was characterized during suppression, obtaining a maximum relative deviation of the measured time-of-flight of 0.1%, and a maximum deviation of measurements spread (full-width half-maximum) of 3%. The LiDAR signal presented an expected worst-case reduction in intensity of 25%.

AB Purpose This paper aims to define hybrid reality (HyR) as an ongoing process in which artificial intelligence (AI) technology is gradually introduced as an active stakeholder by using reasoning to execute real-life activities. Also, to examine the implications of social responsibility (SR) concepts as featured in the HyR underlying common framework to progress towards the redefinition of global society. Design/methodology/approach A combination of systemic tools is used to examine and assess the development of HyR. The research is based on evolutionary and learning concepts, leading to the new meta-system development. It also builds upon the viable system model and AI, invoking SR as a conceptual framework. The research is conducted by using a new approach: using system dynamics based interactions modelling, the following two models have been proposed. The state-of-the-art HyR interactions model, examined using SR concepts; and a SR concept-based HyR model, examined using a smart vehicle case. Findings In the HyR model, interaction asymmetry between stakeholders is identified, possibly leading to pathological behaviour and AI technology learning corruption. To resolve these asymmetry issues, an interaction model based on SR concepts is proposed and examined on the example of an autonomous vehicle transport service. The examination results display significant changes in the conceptual understanding of transport services, their utilisation and data-sharing concepts. Research limitations/implications As the research proposal is theoretical in nature, the projection may not display a fully holistic perspective and can/should be complemented with empirical research results. Practical implications For researchers, HyR provides a new paradigm and can thereby articulate potential research frameworks. HyR designers can recognise projected development paths and the resources required for the implication of SR concepts. Individuals and organisations should be aware of their not necessarily passive role in HyR and can therefore use the necessary social force to activate their status. Originality/value For the first time, to the best of the author's knowledge, the term HyR is openly elaborated and systemically examined by invoking concepts of SR. The proposed model provides an overview of the current and potential states of HyR and examines the gap between them.

TI A PAD-Based Unmanned Aerial Vehichle Route Planning Scheme for Remote

DE remote sensing; PAD; path planning; UAV
AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been employed extensively for remote-sensing missions. However, due to their energy limitations, UAVs have a restricted flight operating time and spatial coverage, which makes remote sensing over huge regions that are out of UAV flight endurance and range challenging. PAD is an autonomous wireless charging station that might significantly increase the flying time of UAVs by recharging them in the air. In this work, we introduce PADs to simplify UAV-based remote sensing over a huge region, and then we explore the UAV route planning problem once PADs have been predeployed throughout a huge remote sensing region. A route planning scheme, named PAD-based remote sensing (PBRS), is proposed to solve the problem. The PBRS scheme first plans the UAV's round-trip routes based on the location of the PADs and divides the whole target region into multiple PAD-based subregions. Between adjacent subregions, the UAV flight subroute is planned by determining piggyback points to minimize the total time for remote sensing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme by conducting several sets of simulation experiments based on the digital orthophoto model of Hutou Village in Beibei District, Chongqing, China. The results show that the PBRS scheme can achieve excellent performance in three metrics of remote sensing duration, the number of trips to charging stations, and the data-storage rate in UAV remote-sensing missions over huge regions with predeployed PADs through effective planning of UAVs.

AB Flying Ad-hoc Network (FANET) is an autonomous technology that constitutes Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to establish a wireless network that is ad-hoc in nature. In FANET, without a well-established infrastructure, the UAV nodes within the network can communicate even with a constrained wireless communication range. Because of the rapidly changing network topology and unique characteristics of FANET, the existing routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) or vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are inappropriate. Thus, this paper proposes a 3D position-based modified OLSR routing protocol for efficient MPR selection, which deals with high mobility, topological changes, and energy constraint issues in the existing protocols. The proposed protocol takes into account both energy efficiency: by considering residual energy and node degree of UAVs and frequent topological changes: by combining the 3D-position information of the UAVs, which is used to calculate the link expiration time. The performance of the proposed protocol is mathematically assessed and simulated through the NS-3 simulator. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol enhances packet delivery ratio by 8%, 13.4% and average throughput by 4.46%, 19.67% on an average compared to the existing benchmark protocols "P-OLSR" and "improved OLSR-ETX", respectively. In addition, the suggested technique minimizes the routing overhead by 6.47%, 4% and end-to-end delay by 18.99%, 25.10% on average compared to the existing protocols "P-OLSR" and "improved OLSR-ETX", respectively.

AB Automation in the modern world has become a necessity for humans. Intelligent mobile robots have become necessary to perform various complex tasks in healthcare and industry environments. Mobile robots have gained attention during the pandemic; human-robot interaction has become vibrant. However, there are many challenges in obtaining human-robot interactions regarding maneuverability, controllability, stability, drive layout and autonomy. In this paper, we proposed a stability and control design for a telepresence robot called auto-MERLIN. The proposed design simulated and experimentally verified self-localization and maneuverability in a hazardous environment. A model from Rieckert and Schunck was initially considered to design the control system parameters. The system identification approach was then used to derive the mathematical relationship between the manipulated variable of robot orientation control. The theoretical model of the robot mechanics and associated control were developed. A design model was successfully implemented, analyzed mathematically, used to build the hardware and tested experimentally. Each level takes on excellent tasks for the development of auto-MERLIN. A higher level always uses the services of lower levels to carry out its functions. The proposed approach is comparatively simple, less expensive and easily deployable compared to previous methods. The experimental results showed that the robot is functionally complete in all aspects. A test drive was performed over a given path to evaluate the hardware, and the results were presented. Simulation and experimental results showed that the target path is maintained quite well.

AB Multi-UAV cooperative mission assignment is an important research direction in the field of UAV research. In the planning process, the assignment conflict between UAVs and mission points and the solution efficiency are the key difficulties in multi-UAV cooperative mission assignment. Based on the Weighted Approximate Flight Cost (WAFC) method and the Reduced Redundant Assignment Scheme (RRAS) algorithm, a multi-UAV cooperative mission problem considering different assignment models is proposed. The contributions of this study are: firstly, the approximate flight cost matrix is constructed based on the vertical distance between the UAV and the mission point, and the matrix is applied to calculate the initial flight distance of the UAV, which fully takes into account the effects of mountain type and radar threat on the mission assignment. Secondly, the auxiliary flight cost method and the spatial mapping matrix are constructed, which maps the discrete approximation of the flight cost to the continuous space and solves the UAV's local conflict problem in the assignment process. Finally, an adaptive selection mutation strategy based on iterative individual fitness values is proposed to reduce the redundancy of candidate assignment schemes and improve the efficiency of the planning system. The simulation results verify that the algorithm has high cooperative capability, good robustness and fast solution speed when dealing with cooperative multi-UAV mission assignment planning.

AB This paper elucidates the automatic detection and analysis of work zones (construction zones) in naturalistic roadway images. An underlying motivation is to identify locations that may pose a challenge to advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) or autonomous vehicle navigation systems. We first present an in-depth characterization of work-zone scenes from a custom data set collected from more than a million miles of naturalistic driving data. We then describe two machine learning algorithms based on the ResNet and U-Net architectures. The first approach works in an image classification framework that classifies an image as a work-zone scene or non-work-zone scene. The second algorithm was developed to identify individual components representing evidence of a work zone (signs, barriers, machines, etc.). These systems achieved an F (0.5) score of 0.951 for the classification task and an F-1 score of 0.611 for the segmentation task. We further demonstrate the viability of our proposed models through saliency map analysis and ablation studies. To our knowledge, this is the first study to consider the detection of work zones in large-scale naturalistic data. The systems demonstrate potential for real-time detection of construction zones using forward-looking cameras mounted on automobiles. Such a system can be incorporated with ADAS to assist drivers in navigating through challenging environments such as construction zones, making those areas safer for commuters. The code is available on our GitHub page: https://github.com/VTTI/Segmentation-and-detection-of-work-zonescenes.

AB The deployment and coordination of mobile sensor networks for coverage control applications can present several practical challenges, including how to efficiently share limited communication resources and how to reduce the use of localization devices (e.g., radars and lidars). One potential solution to these challenges is to reduce the frequency at which agents communicate or sample each other's position. In this article, we present a distributed asynchronous self-triggered control policy for centroidal Voronoi coverage control that is shown to decrease the sampling or communication instants among agents without degrading the performance of the mobile sensor network. Each agent independently decides when to sample the position of nearby agents and uses outdated information of its neighbors until new information is required. We prove that the locational cost function describing the distribution of agents monotonically decreases everywhere outside of a bounded neighborhood around the group's optimal configuration and that the agents asymptotically converge to their Voronoi centroids if the data-sampled centroid errors approach zero. In addition, we show that the sampling intervals are always positive and lower bounded and, as illustrated by simulations and experiments, they tend to stabilize at a large value as the mobile sensor network comes to a steady state. Simulations and experiments with ground vehicles validate the control strategy and show that the proposed policy can achieve similar level of performance as a continuous or fast periodic implementation.

AB A Dual Command (DC) cycle "dynamic sequencing" method in unit-load multiple-rack AS/RS system under Time-Of-Use (TOU) electricity tariffs is applied in this paper. To make a type of energy-efficient model, overconsumption cost of on-peak period electricity, penalty cost of overconsumption of power, bounds on the total consumed energy, and accessible times of all facilities are considered in the model. Moreover, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is developed to achieve a near-optimum solution to the suggested energy-based mathematical model with the objective of minimizing the total cost of the AS/RS system under TOU tariffs. Considering that no benchmark is obtainable in the literature, a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm is developed to certify the outcome gained. For supplementary confirmation, we compare the total cost of our model with that of single-tariff model and also conduct sensitivity analysis of the allowable amount of power consumption. The system throughput, in terms of time and cost, is calculated for the model too. In the last part, sixteen numerical examples with different numbers of required storage/retrieval orders are suggested to display the function of the proposed procedure. Our outcomes verified that GA is able to obtain favorable and closer optimal solutions and the TOU tariffs model get the minimum total cost. (c) 2017 Sharif University of Technology.

AB Perception-action (P-A) learning is an approach to cognitive system building that seeks to reduce the complexity associated with conventional environment-representation/action-planning approaches. Instead, actions are directly mapped onto the perceptual transitions that they bring about, eliminating the need for intermediate representation and significantly reducing training requirements. We here set out a very general learning framework for cognitive systems in which online learning of the P-Amapping may be conducted within a symbolic processing context, so that complex contextual reasoning can influence the P-A mapping. In utilizing a variational calculus approach to define a suitable objective function, the P-A mapping can be treated as an online learning problem via gradient descent using partial derivatives. Our central theoretical result is to demonstrate top-down modulation of low-level perceptual confidences via the Jacobian of the higher levels of a subsumptive P-A hierarchy. Thus, the separation of the Jacobian as a multiplying factor between levels within the objective function naturally enables the integration of abstract symbolic manipulation in the form of fuzzy deductive logic into the P-A mapping learning. We experimentally demonstrate that the resulting framework achieves significantly better accuracy than using P-A learning without top-down modulation. We also demonstrate that it permits novel forms of context-dependent multilevel P-A mapping, applying the mechanism in the context of an intelligent driver assistance system.

ID EMERGENCY BRAKING; RIDERS
AB Objective: Active safety systems such as motorcycle autonomous emergency braking (MAEB) capable of ensuring effectiveness and safe rider-vehicle interaction present many potential benefits to reduce road fatalities but also many challenges. The whole development cycle of MAEB requires research through extensive field tests that reproduce unexpected interventions or real-life driving situation before the system can be available to the end-user. This study aims to better understand the rider's kinematic response required to control the stability of the rider-motorcycle system, as well as the extent of unexpectedness perceived by participants under different degrees of awareness of automatic braking (AB) activation.
   Methods: We compared responses to AB in anticipated and (un)anticipated conditions and in a condition that was intended to be genuinely unexpected (Out of the Blue). Twenty men and women, wearing an inertial measurement unit on their upper-back, rode a scooter-type motorcycle with two front wheels simulating urban riding maneuvers on a closed test-track. Three automatic braking (AB) profiles were tested in different sessions, ranged from 3 to 5 m/s(2) deceleration and 15 to 25 m/s(3) braking-jerk. Differences between AB conditions were analyzed using linear mixed models.
   Results: The unanticipated condition was perceived as fairly unexpected (rated between Quite Unexpected and Very Unexpected). Out of the Blue condition was on average close to the highest level of unexpectedness (Completely Unexpected). The exposure to unanticipated AB events resulted in upper-body response with larger peaks of pitch rate (0.20 to 0.77 rad/s higher) and acceleration (1.0 to 2.3 m/s(2) higher) than those of anticipated. Participants showed less postural stability during unanticipated events taking longer both to start correcting the initial forward lean and to fully stabilize balance. Unanticipated and Out of the Blue conditions did not differ in either the amplitude of the kinematic variables or the time-to-peak pitch rate.
   Conclusions: The kinematic response of the rider's upper-body was found to be a reliable estimator of unexpectedness in AB. The findings suggest that unanticipated AB events while the rider engages in riding tasks can enable testing aimed at designing MAEB systems and assessing end-user acceptance in a reliable manner and within ethical safety limits.

AB A reliable navigation, guidance and control system of Autonomous Unmanned Surface Vehicle (AUSV) is the major challenge for most researchers, especially when Global Positioning System (GPS) signal outages or its accuracy decreases in some places on the Earth's surface. Our paper introduces a novel navigation, guidance and control system of AUSV as follows; the proposed navigation system of AUSV is based on integrated Micro Electric Mechanical System -Inertial Navigation System (MEMS-INS) smartphone sensors with GPS and Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) to correct AUSV navigation system errors. The guidance and control system of AUSV is based on Ultrasonic sensors, Raspberry Pi microcontroller, and digital compass sensor. The ultrasonic sensor is used to detect and avoid obstacles on the path of AUSV. The Raspberry Pi microcontroller and digital compass are used to guide AUSV in the required path.
   Since the GPS and DVL signals are used as the reference sources to correct errors of MEMS-INS system, the accuracy of GPS and DVL decreases due to a bad weather and due to associated noise of DVL measurement, which effects on a whole AUSV navigation system. To resolve this problem, the Adaptive Data Sharing Factor (ADSF) using Combined Filter (CF) is used as integrated method. According to proposed ADSF CF integrated method, the reference source (GPS or DVL) which has the beast accurate system will be used to correct the navigation errors. At same time the least accuracy system will detect and avoid.
   The efficiency of navigation, guidance and control system of AUSV based on proposed GPS/DVL/MEMS-INS ADFS CF integrated method is tested on surface reference trajectory with four obstacles located on the path of AUSV. During GPS outages, the AUSV was able to reach the target location to implement several tasks such as monitoring, exploring, tracking and returned back to base station depending on the stored path in its memory with high efficiency. Based on estimated results, the proposed navigation system could provide continuous navigation solution and reduce the navigation error to about 85.43% compared to GPS/DVL/MEMS CKF method and to about 68.14% compared to GPS/DVL/MEMS Constant DSF Combined Filter.

AB Objective The anthropomorphic test device (ATD) used in NCAP frontal impact, the Thor 50(th), has undergone substantial changes for safety restraint systems testing of upcoming autonomous vehicles (AVs), resulting in the Thor-AV 50 M. Likewise, a deep analysis of the ATD for lateral impacts, the WorldSID 50(th), is needed to determine the requirements it has to fulfill to accurately replicate the human body response under lateral impact. This study sets out general considerations regarding the WorldSID 50(th) ATD design in order to assess its suitability for AV testing scenarios. Methods The WorldSID 50(th) ATD was placed in a driver seat at a conventional upright driving posture. Relevant body landmarks and angles as well as profile streams of the mockup and the ATD were recorded. The seatback was then reclined stepwise. The ATD was repositioned and the recording procedure repeated at every posture until the seatback was fully reclined. Examination of the ATD assemblies and hinge mechanisms was performed, searching for limitations that could result on inadequate positioning or performance under impact. An eventual SAEJ3016 Level 3 cross-legged posture (SAE J3016, 2021) was considered for examination as well. Results Most relevant anthropometric constraints were noticed at the abdomen and the shoulder and neck assemblies: At the abdomen, a gap between the pelvis and the lower torso appeared at seatback recline angles larger than 30 degrees, likely promoting belt intrusion in case of a test event, and the lumbar spine rubber deformed progressively in a manner that might cause tearing damage. The number and arrangement of the shoulder clevis detents, on the other hand, did not allow the arm to be placed at intermediate positions. Finally, the current neck bracket design allowed head orientation only along the sagittal plane. The head could neither be level at seatback angles larger than 43 degrees nor be placed resting on the head restraint for seatback angle values larger than 59 degrees. Conclusions The WorldSID ATD stands as an accurate 50(th) percentile human being surrogate in upright and low/mid reclined postures. Some limitations that might constrain its use in AV scenarios, though, appeared at mid/high reclined positions. Hence, design updating of the lumbar, neck and shoulder clevis assemblies, and the implementation of instrumented lower abdomen and lower arms assemblies should be taken into consideration.

AB The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to disruption sources, such as signal jamming. This, in turn, can cause severe degradation or discontinuities of the GNSS-based position, navigation, and timing services. The availability of multi-frequency signals from multi-constellation GNSS systems, such as Galileo and GLONASS, along with the modernization of GPS with multi-frequency signals, has the potential to increase the immunity of GNSS-based navigation systems to signal jamming. Despite various studies completed on the utilization of multi-frequency and multi-constellation global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals to resist receiver jamming, there is still an urge to further investigate this concern under different circumstances. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of the advantages of the employment of multi-frequency multi-constellation GNSS signals for better GNSS receivers' performance during signal jamming situations for high-dynamic platforms such as aircraft/drones. Additionally, the study examines the effects of both simulated and real jamming signals on all possible combinations of the GPS, Galileo, and GLONASS signal frequencies and constellations. Two airplane trajectory routes were built, and their corresponding RF signals were generated using the Spirent and Orolia GNSS signal simulators. The results indicated that the GPS multi-frequency-based solution maintains reliable positioning performance to some extent under low jamming scenarios. However, the combination of GPS, Galileo, and GLONASS signals proved its ability to provide a continuous and accurate positioning solution during both low and high jamming scenarios.

AB Gait recognition is a biometric identification method based on individual walking patterns. This modality is applied in a wide range of applications, such as criminal investigations and identification systems, since it can be performed at a long distance and requires no cooperation of interests. In general, cameras are used for gait recognition systems, and previous studies have utilized depth information captured by RGB-D cameras, such as Microsoft Kinect. In recent years, multi-layer LiDAR sensors, which can obtain range images of a target at a range of over 100 m in real time, have attracted significant attention in the field of autonomous mobile robots and self-driving vehicles. Compared with general cameras, LiDAR sensors have rarely been used for biometrics due to the low point cloud densities captured at long distances. In this study, we focus on improving the robustness of gait recognition using LiDAR sensors under confounding conditions, specifically addressing the challenges posed by viewing angles and measurement distances. First, our recognition model employs a two-scale spatial resolution to enhance immunity to varying point cloud densities. In addition, this method learns the gait features from two invariant viewpoints (i.e., left-side and back views) generated by estimating the walking direction. Furthermore, we propose a novel attention block that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise weights to fuse the features from the aforementioned resolutions and viewpoints. Comprehensive experiments conducted on our dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods, particularly in cross-view, cross-distance challenges, and practical scenarios.

AB Autonomous vehicle technology is advancing rapidly. Their control capabilities often rely on high-bandwidth state estimation incorporating inertial measurements. High-performance state estimation incorporates inertial measurement error models through the process of state augmentation to enable on-the-fly instrument calibration. The feature article Inertial Measurement Unit Error Modeling Tutorial by Jay A. Farrell, Felipe O. Silva, Farzana Rahman, and J. Wendel provides a tutorial describing the process and issues related to developing a state-space model for the stochastic errors affecting an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The starting point is the instrument error characterization data sheet provided by the manufacturer, which is typically either an Allan standard deviation graph or the Allan variance parameters extracted from that graph. The desired output of the modeling process is a linear, discrete-time, state-space model of the IMU stochastic errors suitable for augmentation to the INS error-state model. Along with this tutorial, supplementary open source software is available. One software component does the following: 1) Given a continuous-time state-space IMU stochastic error model selected by the designer to match the Allan variance, the software computes a discrete-time equivalent state-space model. 2) Given that discrete-time model, it produces a stochastic error sequence suitable for Allan variance computations. 3) Given a sequence of stochastic errors, it computes and plots the Allan variance. Given Allan variance data and a specific continuous-time state-space IMU stochastic error model structure, a second software component implements an optimization-based approach for selecting the model parameters to match the Allan variance data.

AB Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to fixed datasets of logged interactions pertaining to actual applications in healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. In limited and fixed dataset settings, data augmentation can be beneficial in developing better policies. Several online RL methods for data augmentation have recently been utilized to enhance sampling efficiency and generalization. Here, a novel, simple data-augmentation technique referred to as Swapping Target Q-Value (SQV) is introduced to enhance offline RL algorithms and enable robust pixel-based learning without auxiliary loss. Our method matches the current Q-value of a transformed image to the target Q-value of the next original image, whereby the current Q-value of the original image is matched to the target Q-value of the next transformed image. The proposed method considers similar states as the same and different states as more distinct. Furthermore, the approach ties unseen data (lacking in the dataset) to similar states in the seen data. After training, these effects were observed to increase the performance of the offline RL algorithm. The method was tested on 23 games in the Atari 2600 game domain. As a result, the performance of our method improved in 18 out of 23 games, with an average performance improvement of 144% compared with batch-constrained deep Q-learning (BCQ), which is the latest offline RL method.

ID ALLOCATION
AB Low-latency IoT applications, such as autonomous vehicles, augmented/virtual reality devices, and security applications, require high computation resources to make decisions on the fly. However, these kinds of applications cannot tolerate offloading their tasks to be processed on a cloud infrastructure due to the experienced latency. Therefore, edge computing (EC) is introduced to enable low latency by moving the tasks processing closer to the users at the edge of the network. The edge of the network is characterized by the heterogeneity of edge devices (EDs) forming it; thus, it is crucial to devise novel solutions that take into account the different physical resources of each ED. In this article, we propose a resource representation scheme, allowing each ED to expose its resource information to the supervisor of the edge node through the mobile EC application programming interfaces proposed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute. The information about the ED resource is exposed to the supervisor of the edge node each time a resource allocation is required. To this end, we leverage a Lyapunov optimization framework to dynamically allocate resources at the EDs. To test our proposed model, we performed intensive theoretical and experimental simulations on a testbed to validate the proposed scheme and its impact on different system's parameters. The simulations have shown that our proposed approach outperforms other benchmark approaches and provides low latency and optimal resource consumption.

AB In precision agriculture, activities such as selective spraying of agrochemicals are essential to maintaining high productivity and quality of agricultural products. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to perform this activity reduces soil compaction, compared to the use of heavy machinery, and helps to reduce the waste of these artificial substances through a punctual and self-regulating application. This work proposes an entire guiding system for use on UAVs (hardware and software) based on image processing techniques. The software part consists of two algorithms. The first algorithm is the Crop Row Detection which is responsible for the correct identification of the crop rows. The second algorithm is the Line Filter that is responsible for generating the driving parameters sent to the flight controller. In the field experiments performed on the proposed hardware, the algorithm achieved a detection rate of 100% of the crop rows for images with resolutions above 320 x 240. The system performance was measured in laboratory experiments and reached 31.22 FPS for images with small resolution, 320 x 240, and 1.63 FPS for the highest resolution, 1920 x 1080. The main contribution of this work is the design and development of an entire embedded guidance system composed of a hardware and software architectures. Other contributions are: the proposed filter for the image pretreatment; the filter to remove the false positive lines; and the algorithm for generating the guiding parameters based on detected crop rows.

AB An accurate motion model and reliable measurements are required for autonomous underwater vehicle localization and navigation in underwater environments. However, without a propeller, underwater gliders have limited maneuverability and carrying capacity, which brings difficulties for modeling and measuring. In this paper, an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based method, combining a modified kinematic model of underwater gliders with the travel-time differences between signals received from a single beacon, is proposed for estimating the glider positions in a predict-update cycle. First, to accurately establish a motion model for underwater gliders moving in the ocean, we introduce two modification parameters, the attack and drift angles, into a kinematic model of underwater gliders, along with depth-averaged current velocities. The attack and drift angles are calculated based on the coefficients of hydrodynamic forces and the sensor-measured angle variation over time. Then, instead of satisfying synchronization requirements, the travel-time differences between signals received from a single beacon, multiplied by the sound speed, are taken as the measurements. To further reduce the EKF estimation error, the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoothing method is merged into the EKF system. The proposed method is tested in a virtual spatiotemporal environment from an ocean model. The experimental results show that the performance of the RTS-EKF estimate is improved when compared with the motion model estimate, especially by 46% at the inflection point, at least in the particular study developed in this article.

ID REFLECTION
AB The "veil of ignorance" is a moral reasoning device designed to promote impartial decision making by denying decision makers access to potentially biasing information about who will benefit most or least from the available options. Veil-of-ignorance reasoning was originally applied by philosophers and economists to foundational questions concerning the overall organization of society. Here, we apply veil-of-ignorance reasoning in a more focused way to specific moral dilemmas, all of which involve a tension between the greater good and competing moral concerns. Across 7 experiments (n = 6,261), 4 preregistered, we find that veil-of-ignorance reasoning favors the greater good. Participants first engaged in veil-of-ignorance reasoning about a specific dilemma, asking themselves what they would want if they did not know who among those affected they would be. Participants then responded to a more conventional version of the same dilemma with a moral judgment, a policy preference, or an economic choice. Participants who first engaged in veil-of-ignorance reasoning subsequently made more utilitarian choices in response to a classic philosophical dilemma, a medical dilemma, a real donation decision between a more vs. less effective charity, and a policy decision concerning the social dilemma of autonomous vehicles. These effects depend on the impartial thinking induced by veilof-ignorance reasoning and cannot be explained by anchoring, probabilistic reasoning, or generic perspective taking. These studies indicate that veil-of-ignorance reasoning may be a useful tool for decision makers who wish to make more impartial and/or socially beneficial choices.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Outdoor scene understanding based on the results of point cloud classification plays an important role in mobile robots and autonomous vehicles equipped with a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system. In this paper, a novel model named Panoramic Bearing Angle (PBA) images is proposed which is generated from 3D point clouds. In a PBA model, laser point clouds are projected onto the spherical surface to establish the correspondence relationship between the laser ranging point and the image pixels, and then we use the relative location relationship of the laser point in the 3D space to calculate the gray value of the corresponding pixel. To extract robust features from 3D laser point clouds, both image pyramid model and point cloud pyramid model are utilized to extract multiple-scale features from PBA images and original point clouds, respectively. A Random Forest classifier is used to accomplish feature screening on extracted high-dimensional features to obtain the initial classification results. Moreover, reclassification is carried out to correct the misclassification points by remapping the classification results into the PBA images and using superpixel segmentation, which makes full use of the contextual information between laser points. Within each superpixel block, the reclassification is carried out again based on the results of the initial classification results, so as to correct some misclassification points and improve the classification accuracy. Two datasets published by ETH Zurich and MINES ParisTech are used to test the classification performance, and the results show the precision and recall rate of the proposed algorithms.

ID FRAMEWORK; TIME
AB The operation of today's robots entails interactions with humans, e.g., in autonomous driving amidst human-driven vehicles. To effectively do so, robots must proactively decode the intent of humans and concurrently leverage this knowledge for safe, cooperative task satisfaction: a problem we refer to as proactive decision making. However, simultaneous intent decoding and robotic control requires reasoning over several possible human behavioral models, resulting in high-dimensional state trajectories. In this paper, we address the proactive decision-making problem using a novel combination of formal methods, control, and data mining techniques. First, we distill high-dimensional state trajectories of human-robot interaction into concise, symbolic behavioral summaries that can be learned from data. Second, we leverage formal methods to model high-level agent goals, safe interaction, and information-seeking behavior with temporal logic formulas. Finally, we design a novel decision-making scheme that maintains a belief distribution over models of human behavior, and proactively plans informative actions. After showing several desirable theoretical properties, we apply our framework to a dataset of humans driving in crowded merging scenarios. For it, temporal logic models are generated and used to synthesize control strategies using tree-based value iteration and deep reinforcement learning. In addition, we illustrate how data-driven models of human responses to informative robot probes, such as from generative models such as conditional variational autoencoders, can be clustered with formal specifications. Results from simulated self-driving car scenarios demonstrate that data-driven strategies enable safe interaction, correct model identification, and significant dimensionality reduction.

AB Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) bands have become the de-facto candidate for 5G vehicle-to-everything (V2X) since future vehicular systems demand Gbps links to acquire the necessary sensory information for (semi)-autonomous driving. Nevertheless, the directionality of mmWave communications and its susceptibility to blockage raise severe questions on the feasibility of mmWave vehicular communications. The dynamic nature of 5G vehicular scenarios and the complexity of directional mmWave communication calls for higher context-awareness and adaptability. To this aim, we propose an online learning algorithm addressing the problem of beam selection with environment-awareness in mmWave vehicular systems. In particular, we model this problem as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem. Next, we propose a lightweight context-aware online learning algorithm, namely fast machine learning (FML), with proven performance bound and guaranteed convergence. FML exploits coarse user location information and aggregates the received data to learn from and adapt to its environment. Furthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of a real-world implementation of FML by proposing a standard-compliant protocol based on the existing architecture of cellular networks and the forthcoming features of 5G. We also perform an extensive evaluation using realistic traffic patterns derived from Google Maps. Our evaluation shows that FML enables mmWave base stations to achieve near-optimal performance on average within 33 mins of deployment by learning from the available context. Moreover, FML remains within similar to 5% of the optimal performance by swift adaptation to system changes (i.e., blockage, traffic).

AB Autonomous platforms and vehicles are a growing component of the ocean research fleet, producing data sets crucial to our understanding of oceanographic and fishery ecosystem processes. One emerging tool for making these measurements is underwater gliders that autonomously sample the water column for weeks to months at a time. Although originally designed to measure temperature and salinity, underwater gliders can now support a myriad of sensors. For the demonstration project described within, three complementary acoustic technologies were integrated into an underwater glider for mapping fish on the continental shelf: an acoustic telemetry receiver, a passive acoustic monitoring recorder, and a fisheries echosounder.
   The demonstration project was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of each sensing technology. Sixty-one fish were implanted with acoustic tags near the Gulfstream Natural Gas pipeline in the eastern Gulf of Mexico in advance of planned underwater glider missions. The glider was deployed four times over 12 months, with all three acoustic technologies to traverse the pipeline and surrounding habitat. Glider detections were compared to detections of fish at moored acoustic tag telemetry receivers and passive acoustic recorders co-located at the tagged fish locations. All three technologies identified fish along the targeted hard-bottom pipeline habitat, as well as previously uncharted areas of hard-bottom reef. The results of this study demonstrate the utility of gliders integrated with acoustic sensors as a potential tool to identify areas that merit deeper investigation to assess fish stocks.

AB High resolution light detection and ranging (LIDAR) systems enable rapid imaging and mapping for applications such as autonomous vehicles and robotics. This paper presents a high-resolution LIDAR sensor system-on-a-chip (SoC) prototype containing a 31 x 2 pixel channel array with the input time-of-flight resolved by a 32 x 1 time-to-digital converter (TDC) array. A low-power avalanche photodiode (APD) receiver front-end with output bit-line sharing allows an array implementation and achieves - 22 dBm sensitivity. Injection-locked oscillators (ILOs) are utilized in a TDC design to both minimize clock distribution power and improve timing accuracy. An on-chip phase-looked loop calibrates for ILO global PVT variations and ensures reliability over a wide operating range. Fabricated in GP 65 nm CMOS, the 14-bit TDC consumes 788 mu W/channel and achieves 52 ps resolution over an 830 ns full-scale range, 37.2 ps(rms) single-shot precision, 11 ps(rms) channel uniformity, and DNL/INL of 0.56/1.56 LSB, respectively. This electrical characterization projects that the SoC has the potential for 0.78 cm ranging precision over a 124 m maximum ranging distance. Sensor testing with a pulsed laser and an APD array hybrid-integrated with the CMOS SoC shows a measurement range of over 700 ns with a 3.2 ns maximum single-shot error.

AB A continuous-flow microfluidic chip-based standard addition/absorption detection system has been developed for accurate determination of nitrite in water of varying salinity. The absorption detection of nitrite is made via color development using the Griess reaction. We have found the yield of the reaction is significantly affected by salinity (e.g., -12% error for 30% NaCl, 50.0 mu g L-1 N - NO2- solution). The microchip has been designed to perform standard addition, color development, and absorbance detection in sequence. To effectively block stray light, the microchip made from black poly(dimethylsiloxane) is placed on the top of a compact housing that accommodates a light-emitting diode, a photomultiplier tube, and an interference filter, where the light source and the detector are optically isolated. An 80-mm liquid-core waveguide mounted on the chip externally has been employed as the absorption detection flow cell. These designs for optics secure a wide linear response range (up to 500 mg L-1 N - NO2-) and a low detection limit (0.12 mg L-1 N - NO2- = 8.6 nM N - NO2-, S/N = 3). From determination of nitrite in standard samples and real samples collected from an estuary, it has been demonstrated that our microfluidic system is highly accurate (<1% RSD, n = 3) and precise (<1% RSD, n = 3).

AB Two bio-inspired guidance principles involving no reference frame are presented here and were implemented in a rotorcraft, which was equipped with panoramic optic flow (OF) sensors but (as in flying insects) no accelerometer. To test these two guidance principles, we built a tethered tandem rotorcraft called BeeRotor (80 grams), which was tested flying along a high-roofed tunnel. The aerial robot adjusts its pitch and hence its speed, hugs the ground and lands safely without any need for an inertial reference frame. The rotorcraft's altitude and forward speed are adjusted via two OF regulators piloting the lift and the pitch angle on the basis of the common-mode and differential rotor speeds, respectively. The robot equipped with two wide-field OF sensors was tested in order to assess the performances of the following two systems of guidance involving no inertial reference frame: (i) a system with a fixed eye orientation based on the curved artificial compound eye (CurvACE) sensor, and (ii) an active system of reorientation based on a quasi-panoramic eye which constantly realigns its gaze, keeping it parallel to the nearest surface followed. Safe automatic terrain following and landing were obtained with CurvACE under dim light to daylight conditions and the active eye-reorientation system over rugged, changing terrain, without any need for an inertial reference frame.

AB The goals of this project were to determine the daily, seasonal and spatial patterns of red grouper Epinephelus morio sound production on the West Florida Shelf (WFS) using passive acoustics. An 11 month time series of acoustic data from fixed recorders deployed at a known E. morio aggregation site showed that E. morio produce sounds throughout the day and during all months of the year. Increased calling (number of files containing E. morio sound) was correlated to sunrise and sunset, and peaked in late summer (July and August) and early winter (November and December). Due to the ubiquitous production of sound, large-scale spatial mapping across the WFS of E. morio sound production was feasible using recordings from shorter duration-fixed location recorders and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Epinephelus morio were primarily recorded in waters 15-93m deep, with increased sound production detected in hard bottom areas and within the Steamboat Lumps Marine Protected Area (Steamboat Lumps). AUV tracks through Steamboat Lumps, an offshore marine reserve where E. morio hole excavations have been previously mapped, showed that hydrophone-integrated AUVs could accurately map the location of soniferous fish over spatial scales of <1km. The results show that passive acoustics is an effective, non-invasive tool to map the distribution of this species over large spatial scales. (C) 2014 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles

AB UnderWater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UW-ASNs) consist of sensors and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) performing collaborative monitoring tasks. In this article, UW-MAC, a distributed Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol designed for UW-ASNs, is introduced. The proposed MAC protocol is: a transmitter-based Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) scheme that incorporates a novel closed-loop distributed algorithm to jointly set the optimal transmit power and code length. CDMA is; the most promising physical layer and multiple access technique for UW-ASNs because it is robust to frequency-selective fading, it compensates for the effect of multipath at the receiver, and it allows receivers to distinguish among signals simultaneously transmitted by multiple devices.
   UW-MAC aims at achieving three objectives, i.e., guarantee i) high network throughput, ii) low channel access delay, and iii) low energy consumption. It is demonstrated that UW-MAC simultaneously achieves these three objectives in deep water communications (where the ocean depth is more than 100 m), which are usually not severely affected by multipath. In shallow water communications, which may he heavily affected by multipath, it dynamically finds the optimal trade-off among these objectives according to the application requirements. UW-MAC is the first protocol that leverages CDMA properties to achieve multiple access to the scarce underwater bandwidth, while other protocols tailored for this environment. have considered CDMA merely from a physical layer perspective. Experiments show that UW-MAC outperforms many existing MAC protocols tuned for the underwater environment under different architecture scenarios and simulation settings.

AB There is a growing need for marine biodiversity baseline and monitoring data to assess ocean ecosystem health, especially in the deep sea, where data are notoriously sparse. Baited cameras are a biological observing method especially useful in the deep ocean to estimate relative abundances of scavenging fishes and invertebrates. The National Geographic Society Exploration Technology Lab developed an autonomous benthic lander platform with a baited camera system to conduct stationary video surveys of deep-sea megafauna. The first-generation landers were capable of sampling to full ocean depth, however, the form factor, power requirements, and cost of the system limited deployment opportunities. Therefore, a miniaturized version (76 cm x 76 cm x 36 cm, 18 kg in air) was developed to provide a cost-effective method to observe ocean life to 6000 m depth. Here, we detail this next-generation deep-sea camera system, including the structural design, scientific payload, and the procedures for deployment. We provide an overview of NGS deep-sea camera system deployments over the past decade with a focus on the performance improvements of the next-generation system, which began field operations in 2017 and have performed 264 deployments. We present example imagery and discuss the strengths and limitations of the instrument in the context of existing complementary survey methods, and for use in down-stream data products. The key operational advantages of this new instrument are spatial flexibility and cost-efficiency. The instrument can be hand-deployed by a single operator from a small craft concurrent with other shipboard operations. The main limitation of the system is battery power, which allows for 6 h of continuous recording, and takes up to 8 h to recharge between deployments. Like many baited-camera methods, this instrument is specialized to measure the relative abundance of mobile megafauna that are attracted to bait, which results in a stochastic snapshot of the species at the deployment location and time. The small size and ease of deployment of this next-generation camera system allows for increased sample replication on expeditions, and presents a path forward to advance cost-effective biological observing and sustained monitoring in the deep ocean.

AB Aims. Since it launched on 22 March 2021, the 1U-sized CubeSat GRBAlpha operates and collects scientific data on high-energy transients, making it the smallest astrophysical space observatory to date. GRBAlpha is an in-orbit demonstration of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) detector concept suitably small to fit into a standard 1U volume. As was demonstrated in a companion paper, GRBAlpha adds significant value to the scientific community with accurate characterization of bright GRBs, including the recent outstanding event of GRB 221009A.
   Methods. The GRB detector is a 75 x 75 x 5 mm CsI(Tl) scintillator wrapped in a reflective foil (ESR) read out by an array of SiPM detectors, multi-pixel photon counters by Hamamatsu, driven by two separate redundant units. To further protect the scintillator block from sunlight and protect the SiPM detectors from particle radiation, we applied a multi-layer structure of Tedlar wrapping, anodized aluminium casing, and a lead-alloy shielding on one edge of the assembly. The setup allows observations of gamma radiation within the energy range of 70-890 keV with an energy resolution of similar to 30%.
   Results. Here, we summarize the system design of the GRBAlpha mission, including the electronics and software components of the detector, some aspects of the platform, and the current semi-autonomous operations. In addition, details are given about the raw data products and telemetry in order to encourage the community to expand the receiver network for our initiatives with GRBAlpha and related experiments.

AB A novel subsea shuttle tanker (SST) concept was proposed as a cost-effective alternative to subsea pipelines and tanker ships for liquid CO2 transportation between a source facility and a subsea well. The SST will be deployed to transport CO2 to marginal subsea fields with an annual CO2 storage capacity of around 1 million tonnes. A baseline design was recently developed by the authors to support research work aimed at assessing large and ultra-efficient subsea cargo drone technology. One crucial aspect is the development of SST's operation envelope, i.e., the safe depth versus speed regions. The development of this envelope entails comprehensive and detailed studies of SST's dynamic load-effects under all expected operating scenarios which in the early concept development phase can be performed using suitable computational models. In this technical brief, the initial development of such a model is unveiled. This fully coupled 2D planar model considers the most relevant load-effects which are from hydrodynamics, hydrostatics, and control surface induced loads. The most important features of the model such as the derivation of hydrodynamic derivatives and model verification are also discussed. As an example, this model is then used to study the depth control problem which is a key aspect in the determination of the safety operational envelope. The results show that unsuitable control schemes that do not look ahead in the trajectory lead to undesirable results. In contrast, a feed-forward heading control method achieves a good and fast control response.

AB Reinforcement learning has shown to be profoundly successful at learning optimal policies for simulated environments using distributed training with extensive compute capacity. Model-free reinforcement learning uses the notion of trial and error, where the error is a vital part of learning the agent to behave optimally. In mission-critical, real-world environments, there is little tolerance for failure and can cause damaging effects on humans and equipment. In these environments, current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning approaches are not sufficient to learn optimal control policies safely.
   On the other hand, model-based reinforcement learning tries to encode environment transition dynamics into a predictive model. The transition dynamics describes the mapping from one state to another, conditioned on an action. If this model is accurate enough, the predictive model is sufficient to train agents for optimal behavior in real environments.
   This paper presents the Dreaming Variational Autoencoder (DVAE) for safely learning good policies with a significantly lower risk of catastrophes occurring during training. The algorithm combines variational autoencoders, risk-directed exploration, and curiosity to train deep-q networks inside "dream" states. We introduce a novel environment, ASRS-Lab, for research in the safe learning of autonomous vehicles in grid-based warehousing. The work shows that the proposed algorithm has better sample efficiency with similar performance to novel model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms while maintaining safety during training.

AB The proliferation of advanced underwater technology and the emergence of various cloud services promote the horizon of cloud-based underwater acoustic sensor network (UASN). Sending end data to cloud for analysis is becoming a prominent trend, driving cloud computing as an indispensable computing paradigm. However, UASN bears tremendous burdens with respect to data collection from end to cloud, such as large transmission power consumption and high delay, which makes it difficult to meet the delay-sensitive and context-aware service requirements by using cloud computing alone. To this end, a two-level bidirectional data prediction model for end-edge-cloud orchestration is proposed in this article. The mobility and computing ability of edge elements are exploited to analyze and collect data. Edge elements predict the future data based on historical information and trend to decrease acoustic communication. Moreover, a data collection protocol with mobile edge elements is designed. With this protocol, computing paradigms are shifted from centralized cloud to distributed edge, and the differentiated capability of heterogeneous devices is exploited. After extensive experiments, the results show that the data collection cost is dramatically decreased while the bandwidth utilization is increased, which is critical for underwater acoustic communication. The proposed method and protocol strike a good balance between data accuracy and energy consumption for the new end-edge-cloud orchestrated system.

AB In this paper, we propose an uplink multiuser-multiple input multiple output (MU-MIMO) cooperative retransmission control scheme for the reliable and efficient communication of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (i.e., flight communication and drone-to-drone communication). This scheme is a key element in the design of a drone-based ad-hoc network. Because drone relay transmission operates in the air, flexible wireless relay networks over large areas can be achieved without interference from multipath signals caused by buildings and obstacles in ground-based communication. However, two main challenges exist. First, the relay transmission system occupies bandwidth every time the drone relays information. Therefore, because the radio channel is shared by multiple relay stations, the throughput is greatly reduced. To improve throughput, it is better to transmit using the minimum number of relay stations. Ultimately, long-distance direct transmission is the best. The other issue is a direct result of the first issues solution: the propagation loss increase when relaying information directly over a long distance. Moreover, because the frequency of interference waves from the ground increases, transmission signal errors are an important issue. To solve this issue, a transmission scheme to reduce errors is required. The scheme proposed in this study achieves high transmission reliability and efficiency even under high transmission error conditions. The results of a computer simulation reveal that the proposed method achieves a direct transmission throughput that is 1.5 times better than that of a conventional scheme. It is also shown that the proposed scheme requires only about three stations to achieve acceptable results.

AB Residential variable energy price schemes can be made more effective with the use of a demand response (DR) strategy along with smart appliances. Using DR, the electricity bill of participating customers/households can be minimised, while pursuing other aims such as demand-shifting and maximising consumption of locally generated renewable-electricity. In this article, a two-stage optimization method is used to implement a price-based implicit DR scheme. The model considers a range of novel smart devices/technologies/schemes, connected to smart-meters and a local DR-Controller. A case study with various decarbonisation scenarios is used to analyse the effects of deploying the proposed DR-scheme in households located in the west area of the Isle of Wight (Southern United Kingdom). There are approximately 15,000 households, of which 3000 are not connected to the gas-network. Using a distribution network model along with a load flow software-tool, the secondary voltages and apparent-power through transformers at the relevant substations are computed. The results show that in summer, participating households could export up to 6.4 MW of power, which is 10% of installed large-scale photovoltaics (PV) capacity on the island. Average carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) reductions of 7.1 ktons/annum and a reduction in combined energy/transport fuel-bills of 60%/annum could be achieved by participating households.

ID RECOGNITION; MODEL
AB Semantic segmentation performs pixel-level classification of multiple classes in the input image. Previous studies on semantic segmentation have used various methods such as multi-scale image, encoder-decoder, attention, spatial pyramid pooling, conditional random field, and generative models. However, the contexts of various sizes and types in diverse environments make their performance limited in robustly detecting and classifying objects. To address this problem, we propose an enhanced semantic segmentation network (ESSN) robust to various objects, contexts, and environments. The ESSN can extract multi-scale information well by concatenating the residual feature maps with various receptive fields extracted from sequential convolution blocks, and it can improve the performance of semantic segmentation without additional modules such as loss or attention during the training process. We performed the experiments with two open databases, the Stanford background dataset (SBD) and Cambridge-driving labeled video database (CamVid). Experimental results demonstrated the pixel acc. of 92.74%, class acc. of 79.66%, and mIoU of 71.67% with CamVid, and pixel acc. of 87.46%, class acc. of 81.51%, and mIoU of 71.56% with SBD, which are higher than those of the existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the average processing time were 31.12 ms and 92.46 ms on the desktop computer and Jetson TX2 embedded system, respectively, which confirmed that ESSN is applicable to both the desktop computer and Jetson TX2 embedded system which is widely used in autonomous vehicles.

TI Cooperative Bargain for the Autonomous Separation of Traffic Flows in
   Smart Reversible Lanes
SO COMPLEXITY
LA English
DT Article
ID ALGORITHM
AB Spacer bars in the smart reversible lanes make periodically broadcast of messages to share their local observed traffic information with each other. This aims to help other spacer bars acquire the global traffic information and make consistent movement when separating the flows. However, radio interference and vehicles in the traffic may degrade the qualities of wireless communication links and cause frequent message losses in the broadcast. Existing solutions tend to use data forwarding to enhance the message dissemination, which may cause imbalanced load in the spacer bars. For instance, the nodes close to the sink have to forward more messages, whereas the ones far away from the sink have fewer messages for forwarding. The unbalanced distribution of network load has a high risk of blocking the wireless communication links and yield inconsistent movement in the reversible lanes. In this paper, we propose a Cooperative Bargain (CoB) scheme where each spacer bar carries some received messages to help other spacer bars recover their lost messages. Since the spacer bars can only acquire the local information, we formulate a cooperative bargain game to negotiate how to allocate the task of message recovery with a balanced network load until a consensus is achieved. CoB is evaluated with the real-world Wi-Fi communication traces in Isti/rural. Simulation results show that CoB can recover an average of 98.6% messages within 100 milliseconds in a 50-node network. CoB does not require the global network information but it can still achieve a comparable performance to other broadcast schemes.

AB IoT applications constitute one of the fastest developing areas in today's technology and at the same time pose the most demanding challenges for the respective radio access network design. While the initial studies in IoT were focused primarily on scaling the existing radio solutions for higher numbers of small-data and low-cost sensors, the current developments aim at supporting wearable augmented/virtual reality platforms, moving industrial robots, driving (semi-)autonomous vehicles, and flying drones, which produce large amounts of data. To satisfy these rapidly growing performance demands, the 5G-grade IoT is envisioned to increasingly employ millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum, where wider bandwidths promise to enable higher data rates and low-latency communication. While the mainstream trend in mmWave-based IoT is to rely on licensed bands around 28 GHz or leverage unlicensed bands at 60 GHz, in this work we introduce a conceptual vision for the integrated use of these frequencies within a single radio access system named 5G over unlicensed spectrum or 5G-U. We study the performance of 5G-U in supporting stringent IoT use cases, discuss and compare the alternative strategies for spectrum management in 5G-U, and demonstrate that a harmonized utilization of licensed and unlicensed bands provides notable performance improvements in both device-centric and network-centric metrics. Finally, we offer useful guidelines for future implementations of 5G-U and detail its potential applications in the area of advanced IoT services.

AB Over the past 40+ years, III-V materials have been intensively studied for avalanche photodetectors, driven by applications including optical communications, imaging, quantum information processing, and autonomous vehicle navigation. Unfortunately, impact ionization is a stochastic process that introduces noise, thereby limiting sensitivity and achievable bandwidths, leading to intense effort to mitigate this noise through the identification of different materials and device structures. Exploration of these materials has seen limited success as it has proceeded in a largely ad hoc fashion due to little consensus regarding which fundamental properties are important. Here, we report an exciting step toward deterministic design of low-noise avalanche photodetector materials by alternating the composition at the monolayer scale; this represents a dramatic departure from previous approaches, which have concentrated on either unconventional compounds/alloys or nanoscale band-engineering. In particular, we demonstrate how to substantially improve upon the noise characteristics of the current state-of-the art telecom avalanche multipliers, In0.52Al0.48As grown on InP substrates, by growing the structure as a strain-balanced digital alloy of InAs and AlAs layers, each only a few atomic layers thick. The effective k-factor, which has historically been considered a fundamental material property, was reduced by 6-7 x from k= 0.2 for bulk In0.52Al0.48As to k= 0.05 by using the digital alloy technique. We also demonstrate that these "digital alloys" can significantly extend the photodetector cutoff wavelength well beyond those of their random alloy counterparts. Published by AIP Publishing.

ID CONTINENTAL-SLOPE; NORTHERN GULF; FEATURES; MEXICO
AB High-resolution geophysical data were acquired for an investigation across a portion of Sigsbee Escarpment using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV Hugin 3000), which allowed mapping of the seabed and near-seafloor features in detail and large two-dimensional data sets to be collected in a short time in deep water over rugged terrain. Complex seafloor structures are revealed in the survey area. These seafloor structures include a graben fault zone, rugged escarpment faces, slump deposits, and erosional furrows. Geological morphologies occurring in the survey area are associated with salt tectonics, gravitational driven failure, and ocean bottom-current activities. The Sigsbee Escarpment in the survey area is marked by an abrupt scarp on the order of 700 m (2300 ft) and a prominent increase in seafloor gradients as much as 30degrees. The Sigsbee Escarpment in the center and west of the survey area is generally scalloped, representing retrogressive slumps. The escarpment face is characterized by narrow and sharp ridges and numerous gullies. In the east of the survey area, the escarpment appears to be upturned, tilted, and eroded. A graben fault structure, representing a suture zone possibly associated with the joining of the two underlying salt sheets, is observed in the north-central survey area. in front of the escarpment, on the continental rise, a series of longitudinal furrows and slump deposits have been interpreted. The slump deposits at the base of the escarpment form aprons of sediment consisting of displaced and mixed sediments primarily of clay.

DT Article
DE Adversarial learning; deep neural networks; dictionary learning; domain
   adaptation; traffic scene classification
AB In recent years, the accurate recognition of traffic scenes has played a key role in autonomous vehicle operations. However, most works in this area do not address the domain shift issue where the classification performance is degraded when the distribution of the source and target images are different due to weather changes. Also, lack of sparsity of current studies results in sample complexity and overfitting issues. To mitigate these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Sparse Adversarial Domain Adaptation (SADA) model for traffic scene classification. Our objective is to learn a scene classifier on a source domain with sunny weather and transfer its knowledge to a target domain with different weather (i.e., cloudy, rainy, and snowy) to enhance the classification performance on the target. First, a sparse representation is learned from the source traffic scenes via nonlinear dictionary learning in the latent space of a deep classifier. Then, a conditional generative adversarial network is devised to capture the distribution of the source sparse codes. Finally, a domain invariant sparse feature extractor is developed via a minimax game to align the sparse codes of the target domain images with the source; hence, providing domain adaptation for traffic scene classification using a deep neural network. Experimental results on a real-world dataset collected by the Honda Research Institute (HRI) indicate the superior performance of the proposed SADA compared to current traffic scene classification methods and state-of-the-art domain adaptation frameworks.

AB As human-robot collaboration increases tremendously in real-world applications, a fully autonomous and reliable mobile robot for the collaboration has been a central research topic and investigated extensively in a large number of studies. One of the most pressing issues in such topic is the collision-free navigation that has a moving goal and unknown obstacles under the unstructured environment. In this article, a cognitive robotic system (CRS) is proposed for the robot to navigate itself to the moving target person without obstacle collision. This CRS consists of a cognitive agent, which is created based on the Soar cognitive architecture to reason its current situation and make action decision for the robot to avoid obstacles and reach the target position, and a speed planning module, which is based on dynamic window approach (DWA) to generate appropriate linear and angular velocities for driving the robot's motors. For the implementation of the proposed system, we use a differential drive wheel robot equipped with two ultrawideband (UWB) sensors and a color depth camera as the experimental platform. Finally, to evaluate the performance of our system in actual operating conditions, we conduct experiments with a scenario that includes main tasks: avoiding consecutive unknown obstacles and turning at corner while the robot follows continuously human user along the corridor.

AB Networked control systems, where feedback loops are closed over communication networks, arise in several domains, including smart energy grids, autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles, and many industrial and robotic systems active in service, production, agriculture, and smart homes and cities. In these settings, the two main layers of the system, control and communication, strongly affect each other's performance, and they also reveal the interaction between a cyber-system component, represented by information-based computing and communication technologies, and a physical-system component, represented by the environment that needs to be controlled. The information access and distribution constraints required to achieve reliable state estimation and stabilization in networked control systems have been intensively studied over the course of roughly two decades. This article reviews some of the cornerstone results in this area, draws a map for what we have learned over these years, and describes the new challenges that we will face in the future. Rather than simply listing different results, we present them in a coherent fashion using a uniform notation, and we also put them in context, highlighting both their theoretical insights and their practical significance. Particular attention is given to recent developments related to decentralized estimation in distributed sensing and communication systems and the information-theoretic value of event timing in the context of networked control.

   light detection and ranging (LiDAR); transformer
AB Nowadays, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) plays an important role in environmental perception technology; however, LiDAR cannot detect some blocked objects, and it can even detect some incorrect and unimportant objects as target objects due to the sparsity and disorder of the point cloud and the limited receiving area. Indeed, the detection accuracy can be improved by setting multiple cameras and LiDAR, but the cost can be unacceptable. In order to resolve these issues, a transformer-based architecture that can connect voxels with each other by neighborhood sparse attention is proposed. A standardized transformer, however, cannot be applied directly to sparse point cloud space because it contains a large number of empty voxels. Hence, a scheme of neighborhood sparse voxel attention to window attention (NSAW) is introduced, which is an efficient and accurate single stride transformer for connecting 3-D backbone to 2-D bird-eye-view (BEV) feature map. In this architecture, neighborhood window attention (NWA) and neighborhood voxel attention (NVA) are proposed to effectively extract features from no-empty voxels, which can achieve 84.30% average precision with 40 recall points (AP3D(R40)) and bring 2.68% AP3D(R40) improvement for Voxel region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) on the moderate car class on the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute (KITTI) test split. On the premise of computational efficiency, the proposed NSAW demonstrates quite a few improvements over the traditional baselines on KITTI3D dataset.

AB Lane detection on roads is essential for autonomous vehicles. Most previous studies detected the area of the road and all possible lanes built on it, whereas only the specific lane that the car is currently traveling on should be detected. In addition, they are complex, slow, fail under degraded road conditions, and can-not be generalized to different scenarios. Moreover, these methods require costly hardware and under -consider road conditions. In this study, the ego lane, which is the lane a car is currently traveling on, is detected. This study proposes an adaptive hybrid lane detection method that adopts the advantages of traditional vision-based and machine-learning-based approaches. The proposed method involves a set of preprocessing methods for obtaining the candidate lane borders from an image in any degraded state. Subsequently, numerical features about the boundaries of the candidate lanes are extracted and used by a model of the k-nearest neighbor algorithm and the Gaussian process for final lane discovery. A set of experiments were conducted using the KITTI dataset to evaluate the performance. The results show that the proposed method overcomes various challenges. It is relatively simple and fast; it requires low-cost devices and processes and can be generalized without major modifications.(c) 2022 The Author.

AB As a parametric polynomial curve family, Bezier curves are widely used in safe and smooth motion design of intelligent robotic systems from flying drones to autonomous vehicles to robotic manipulators. In such motion planning settings, the critical features of high-order Bezier curves such as curve length, distance-to-collision, maximum curvature/velocity/acceleration are either numerically computed at a high computational cost or inexactly approximated by discrete samples. To address these issues, in this article we present a novel computationally efficient approach for adaptive approximation of high-order Bezier curves by multiple low-order Bezier segments at any desired level of accuracy that is specified in terms of a Bezier metric. Accordingly, we introduce a new Bezier degree reduction method, called parameter-wise matching reduction, which approximates Bezier curves more accurately compared to the standard least squares and Taylor reduction methods. We also propose a new Bezier metric, called the maximum control-point distance, that can be computed analytically, has a strong equivalence relation with other existing Bezier metrics, and defines a geometric relative bound between Bezier curves. We provide extensive numerical evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Bezier approximation approach. As a rule of thumb, based on the degree-one matching reduction error, we conclude that an nth-order Bezier curve can be accurately approximated by 3(n - 1) quadratic and 6(n - 1) linear Bezier segments, which is fundamental for Bezier discretization.

AB Standard Model Predictive Control (MPC) or trajectory optimization approaches perform only a local search to solve a complex non-convex optimization problem. As a result, they cannot capture the multi-modal characteristic of human driving. A global optimizer can be a potential solution but is computationally intractable in a real-time setting. In this letter, we present a real-time MPC capable of searching over different driving modalities. Our basic idea is simple: we run several goal-directed parallel trajectory optimizations and score the resulting trajectories based on user-defined meta cost functions. This allows us to perform a search over several locally optimal motion plans. Although conceptually straightforward, realizing this idea in real-time with existing optimizers is highly challenging from technical and computational standpoints. With this motivation, we present a novel batch non-holonomic trajectory optimization whose underlying matrix algebra is easily parallelizable across problem instances and reduces to computing large batch matrix-vector products. This structure, in turn, is achieved by deriving a linearization-free multi-convex reformulation of the non-holonomic kinematics and collision avoidance constraints. We extensively validate our approach using both synthetic and real data sets (NGSIM) of traffic scenarios. We highlight how our algorithm automatically takes lane-change and overtaking decisions based on the defined meta cost function. Our batch optimizer achieves trajectories with lower meta cost, up to 6x faster than competing baselines.

AB This article presents a semi-automated method to extract the lane features along the curved roads from mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds. The proposed method consists of four steps. After data pre-processing, a road edge detection algorithm is performed to distinguish road curbs and extract road surfaces. Then, textual and directional road markings such as arrows, symbols, and words, to inform drivers in necessary cases, are detected by intensity thresholding and conditional Euclidean clustering algorithms. Furthermore, lane markings are extracted by local intensity analysis and distance thresholding methods according to road design standards, because they are more regular along the road. Finally, centerline points on lanes are estimated based on the coordinates of extracted lane markings. Our method shows strong feasibility and robustness when creating high-definition (HD) maps from MLS data, by increasing the number of blocks in the curve and the distance threshold control in curved lane centerline extraction. Quantitative evaluations show that the average recall, precision, and F1-score obtained from four datasets for road marking extraction are 93.87%, 93.76%, and 93.73%, respectively. The generated lane centerlines are evaluated by overlaying them on manually labeled reference buffers from 4 cm resolution orthoimagery. The comparative study indicates that the proposed methods can achieve higher accuracy and robustness than most state-of-the-art methods.

AB Future wireless communication networks can benefit from Unmanned Aerial Base Stations (UABSs) to provide enhanced capacity to ground users (GU) in large and remote locations. Connecting UABSs to the terrestrial network presents several challenges, such as the limited gain traditional antennas need to maintain suitable wireless links between the core network, UABS, and GU. A convenient solution is to use MaMIMO (Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output) since it improves spectral and energy efficiency, thus providing high data rates while reducing power consumption. This paper proposes a Multi-user MIMO (MuMIMO) model for UABS aided networks to increase service range and served capacity. It uses hybrid beamforming and beamsteering on Terrestrial Base Stations (TBSs) and UABSs to grant access to mobile GU in a bicycle race scenario. Results show that using the mobile operators' locations will benefit the backhaul network's performance by duplicating the capacity compared to using a private operator. Furthermore, user coverage increases by 400% if MuMIMO is used, compared to a single beam MaMIMO network. The proposed scenario could achieve a channel efficiency of 6.5 bit/s/Hz in the access network and 8.6 bit/s/Hz in the backhaul network. Finally, the average UABS transmitted power is reduced by 2/3, increasing the number of used beams.

AB SeaLite Engineering, after a 10-yr research and development program, has produced an operational antifouling system for ocean sensors and instruments designed for low power consumption and long (> 1 yr) deployments. The important innovation is the replacement of pumps by gravity and external motion to significantly reduce energy consumption. Also, a prototype system for autonomous underwater vehicle control surfaces is now undergoing laboratory testing. The effectiveness of SeaLite's technology has been demonstrated year-round in northern estuaries and in the Gulf of Mexico, the latter by an independent agency. The process leading to this result was, first starting in 2010, an extensive laboratory evaluation of electrode alloys, calibration of chlorine production versus electric power input, and the location for attaching electrodes to various objects requiring protection from fouling. After 2015 the experimentation moved to the ocean, first in a Cape Cod estuary and then to the Gulf of Mexico. Comparisons with a mechanical antifouling system were done in situ, and with a UV antifouling system from AML Oceanographic, Ltd., by comparing the data. Starting in 2019, the development of biofilms, from their initial deposition through the extra polysaccharide substance stage, were experimentally investigated by taking samples from an estuary near SeaLite's laboratory. Biofilms on microscope slides and water column samples were collected. This was done in different seasons, from spring bloom, summer doldrums, autumn temperature decline, and the winter freeze. The objective was to determine the level of biofilm growth that would require antifouling, and its' seasonal, temperature, and solar radiation dependence, and thus to conserve power.

AB Tracking maneuvering target in real time autonomously and accurately in an uncertain environment is one of the challenging missions for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In this paper, aiming to address the control problem of maneuvering target tracking and obstacle avoidance, an online path planning approach for UAV is developed based on deep reinforcement learning. Through end-to-end learning powered by neural networks, the proposed approach can achieve the perception of the environment and continuous motion output control. This proposed approach includes: (1) A deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based control framework to provide learning and autonomous decision-making capability for UAVs; (2) An improved method named MN-DDPG for introducing a type of mixed noises to assist UAV with exploring stochastic strategies for online optimal planning; and (3) An algorithm of task decomposition and pre-training for efficient transfer learning to improve the generalization capability of UAV's control model built based on MN-DDPG. The experimental simulation results have verified that the proposed approach can achieve good self-adaptive adjustment of UAV's flight attitude in the tasks of maneuvering target tracking with a significant improvement in generalization capability and training efficiency of UAV tracking controller in uncertain environments.

AB The state-of-health (SoH) of the reaction wheel (RW) is a key indicator of the satellite's ability to function properly and complete its mission successfully. Quick and accurate prediction of the RW's SoH is an important guarantee of autonomous satellite mission execution and health management. In view of the pseudoperiodicity and strong noise characteristics of satellite on-orbit telemetry data, this paper aims to design a prediction framework meeting the satellite state on-orbit prediction requirements, which mainly includes data reconstruction, similar data screening, self-revised prediction and the fuzzy expression of results. First, a new method for RW health characterization is proposed for actual telemetry data from satellites, and a completely new set of historical samples is constructed. Second, a fusion deviation measure is proposed by selecting samples from the historical sample set that are similar to the sample to be predicted. Third, a Fourier Broad Learning System (FBLS) is proposed to improve the depiction accuracy of a standard Broad Learning System (BLS) in learning satellite telemetry data with less computational and time resources. Finally, a fuzzy expression is proposed to obtain the prediction results. The proposed method is validated with real satellite on-orbit telemetry data. The case study results show that the SoH of the RW can be predicted quickly and accurately, which demonstrates the promising performance of our method.

   REPRESENTATION
AB Machine learning (ML) methods have become powerful, predictive tools in a wide range of applications, such as facial recognition and autonomous vehicles. In the sciences, computational chemists and physicists have been using ML for the prediction of physical phenomena, such as atomistic potential energy surfaces and reaction pathways. Transferable ML potentials, such as ANI-1x, have been developed with the goal of accurately simulating organic molecules containing the chemical elements H, C, N, and O. Here, we provide an extension of the ANI-1x model. The new model, dubbed ANI-2x, is trained to three additional chemical elements: S, F, and Cl. Additionally, ANI-2x underwent torsional refinement training to better predict molecular torsion profiles. These new features open a wide range of new applications within organic chemistry and drug development. These seven elements (H, C, N, O, F, Cl, and S) make up similar to 90% of drug-like molecules. To show that these additions do not sacrifice accuracy, we have tested this model across a range of organic molecules and applications, including the COMP6 benchmark, dihedral rotations, conformer scoring, and nonbonded interactions. ANI-2x is shown to accurately predict molecular energies compared to density functional theory with a similar to 106 factor speedup and a negligible slowdown compared to ANI-1x and shows subchemical accuracy across most of the COMP6 benchmark. The resulting model is a valuable tool for drug development which can potentially replace both quantum calculations and classical force fields for a myriad of applications.

AB The efficiency of park and ride (PnR) lots has not been investigated in serious depth in prior literature. This study examines the effect of various factors on the utilization rate of PnR lots with panel Tobit models. The examined factors consist of land use features, roadway design features, transit ridership, sociodemographic attributes, travel characteristics, policy tools, gasoline prices, and weather conditions. The data is drawn from PnR lots in King County, Washington. Results show that: (1) degree of mixed land use, road density, employment density, percentages of people aged between 18 and 34 and people over 65, the percentage of white people, the percentage of poor people, and transit ridership are positively associated with the utilization rate of PnR lots; (2) the percentage of drive lanes in total roadway miles, the percentage of males, and the mode share percentage of driving are negatively correlated with the utilization rate of PnR lots; (3) various policy interventions, including countermeasures for preserving transit after the economic recession, congestion reduction charge, and bus-rail integration, are all positively correlated with the utilization rate of PnR lots. Contextualized to US cities, PnR is a practical way to attract bus riders, especially young adults, senior citizens, and low-income people to public transit. Dense urban development is encouraged for the full utilization of PnR lots. Additionally, the integration between bus and rail appears to be an effective policy tool to promote PnR utilization.

AB Compression is one of the most critical issues related to almost all hydrogen storage methods and its subsequent usage. Hydrogen compression is only part of the so-called "Hydrogen Value Chain", but it is crucial for overcoming the entry barriers for a "Hydrogen Economy". It is widely accepted that there is a strong need for significant improvements in efficiency, durability and reliability of hydrogen compressors as well as for cost reductions, The basic scope of this work is to present the current developments on Metal Hydride Hydrogen Compressors (MH2C) and try to evaluate from both technical and economical point of view the potential integration of MH2C in real power systems comprising Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen technologies.
   In this work, certain target markets for the MH2 compressor are identified, while all technical and financial issues of its integration in complete power systems have been assessed. Through a preliminary analysis of potential markets for the MH2 Compressor, it is shown that there are three major niche markets: (i) Chemical industry, by utilisation of waste industrial and/or available renewable heat; (ii) Hydrogen filling stations for vehicles and (iii) RES & H2 autonomous power systems for remote communities (e.g. off-grid islands).
   A specific case study (the Greek island of Milos) is analysed in detail (using the HOMER software tool) with the aim of increasing RES penetration. A RES & hydrogen storage power supply system is proposed and examined from an economic, environmental and social perspective drawing the relevant conclusions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Emergency medical transports provide life-saving services to their patients; however, staffing levels in the United States are leading to reduced capabilities or even in extreme situations, an inability to provide ambulance services. As technology continues to increase, driverless vehicles are becoming a reality. It is possible, in the near future, that technology may be able to support an ambulance operated autonomously. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to try and determine patient's willingness to ride on an ambulance operated autonomously as opposed to one driven by a human. Affect measures were also collected to determine if affect mediated the relationship between willingness to ride and the type of ambulance configuration. Through the use of 3 studies, the findings indicate that patients were less willing to ride in the scenario where the ambulance was operated autonomously than in the traditional configuration, and there was a significant interaction between gender and type of ambulance configuration with females being less willing to ride in the autonomous ambulance than males. Affect was found to act as a mediator between willingness to ride and the type of ambulance. Additionally, through the use of the six universal facial expressions, it was determined that the mediating emotions for males were fear and happiness, and the mediating emotion for females was anger. The authors propose practical implications of these research findings and suggest areas of future research. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Road detection is one of the key challenges for autonomous vehicles. Two kinds of sensors are commonly used for road detection: cameras and LIDARs. However, each of them suffers from some inherent drawbacks. Thus, sensor fusion is commonly used to combine the merits of these two kinds of sensors. Nevertheless, current sensor fusion methods are dominated by either cameras or LIDARs rather than making the best of both. In this paper, we extend the conditional random field (CRF) model and propose a novel hybrid CRF model to fuse the information from camera and LIDAR. After aligning the LIDAR points and pixels, we take the labels (either road or background) of the pixels and LIDAR points as random variables and infer the labels via minimization of a hybrid energy function. Boosted decision tree classifiers are learned to predict the unary potentials of both the pixels and LIDAR points. The pairwise potentials in the hybrid model encode (i) the contextual consistency in the image, (ii) the contextual consistency in the point cloud, and (iii) the cross-modal consistency between the aligned pixels and LIDAR points. This model integrates the information from the two sensors in a probabilistic way and makes good use of both sensors. The hybrid CRF model can be optimized efficiently with graph cuts to get road areas. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the KITTI-ROAD benchmark dataset and the experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the current methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper, we examine the development of a kinematically compatible control framework for a modular system of wheeled mobile manipulators that can team up to cooperatively transport a common payload. Each individually autonomous mobile manipulator consists of a differentially-driven Wheeled Mobile Robot (WMR) with a mounted two degree-of-freedom (d.o.f) revolute-jointed, planar and passive manipulator arm. The composite wheeled vehicle, formed by placing a payload at the end-effectors of two (or more) such mobile manipulators, has the capability to accommodate, detect and correct both instantaneous and finite relative configuration errors.
   The kinematically-compatible motion-planning/control framework developed here is intended to facilitate maintenance of all kinematic (holonomic and nonholonomic) constraints within such systems. Given an arbitrary end-effector trajectory, each individual mobile-manipulator's bi-level hierarchical controller first generates a kinematically-feasible desired trajectory for the WMR base, which is then tracked by a suitable lower-level posture stabilizing controller. Two variants of system-level cooperative control schemes-leader-follower and decentralized control-are then created based on the individual mobile-manipulator control scheme. Both methods are evaluated within an implementation framework that emphasizes both virtual prototyping (VP) and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimentation. Simulation and experimental results of an example of a two-module system are used to highlight the capabilities of a real-time local sensor-based controller for accommodation, detection and corection of relative formation errors.

AB The putative replication origin of Azotabacter vinelandii was cloned as an autonomously replicating fragment after ligation to an antibiotic resistance cartridge. The resulting plasmids could be isolated and labelled by Southern hybridisation with the antibiotic resistance cartridge as probe and also visualised by electron microscopy. These plasmids integrated into the chromosome after a few generations, even in the recA mutant of A. vinelandii. The integrated copy of the plasmid was re-isolated from the chromosome and the DNA and its subfragments were cloned in the plasmid vector pBR322. A 200-bp DNA fragment was sufficient to allow the replication of pBR322 in an Escherichia coli polA strain. Electron microscopic analysis of this plasmid showed that replication initiated mostly within the A. vinelandii DNA fragment. The nucleotide sequence of the putative replication origin and its flanking regions was determined. In the sequence of the 200-bp fragment many of the distinctive features found in other replication origins are lacking. A greater variation from the consensus DnaA binding sequence was observed in A. vinelandii. Direct sequencing of the relevant genomic fragment was also carried after amplifying it from. A. vinelandii chromosomal DNA by PCR. This con; firmed that no rearrangements had taken place while the cloned fragment was resident in E. coli. It was shown by hybridisation that the 200-bp chromosomal origin fragment of A. vinelandii was present in three other field strains of Azotobacter spp.

AB The graphical approaches often have different backgrounds and view a system or an algebraic model from different perspectives in order to facilitate the communication and the understanding. These graphical approaches satisfy the modeling needs and give a clear and easily understandable overview of the behavioral and functional models and make easier to see what the process is, which vulnerabilities and asset that are involved and how the system works. The main goal of this paper is to develop and implement a methodology which combines the functional analysis and the bond graph (BG) tool for intelligent and autonomous systems. As a result, a supervisory interface is obtained, given under a finite automaton, displaying to the operators the possibilities the system has to achieve or not, its objectives. Each operating mode, corresponding to a vertex of the automaton, is associated with a set of services from a functional point-of-view and is defined accurately by a behavioral BG model. Furthermore, the service availability (associated to the BG elements) and the conditions for switching from one mode to another one are analyzed by fault detection and isolation algorithms generated on the basis of the structural and causal properties of the BG tool. Moreover, when a fault is not completely isolable some results can nevertheless be expressed in terms of available or unavailable services.
   Note to Practitioners-This paper was motivated by the problem of intelligent system diagnosis and supervision. Indeed, by associating diagnosis and reconfiguration aspects, all built on the same model, we hope to contribute to the development of a global supervisory control system. This paper presents a new approach which combines the Generic Component Model (GCM) and the Bond Graph Model (BGM). The GCM provides a systematic tool for finding the different reconfiguration strategies of a system when faults occur. Within a given operating mode, a system is reconfigurable if there exist different versions of the services which allow to achieve its current objectives. These versions are ranked according to a preference relation. This allows an automated real time management of the system configurations. The BGM is proposed to describe the inner procedure on which the realization of a service rests. Its structural properties are exploited to generate fault indicators. Even if the fault mode of a lower level component can not always be identified, interesting results can be obtained on the availability of the associate services and in the most of the cases, it is enough to evaluate the possibility the system has or not to achieve an objective. The proposed approach is applied to design a supervision system representing the management of the operating modes and giving the conditions for reconfiguration of an intelligent and autonomous vehicle. The latter should be transferable on different sizes of port terminals in order to transport goods from one specific place to another one in both normal and degraded operating mode. The approach can be also applied to different kind of electromechanical systems. In future research, we will address the robust decision making diagnosis based on Fuzzy Logic Methodology in order to facilitate the identification of vulnerabilities by identifying the residuals thresholds changing through time.

AB Silicon photonics has emerged as a mature technology that is expected to play a key role in critical emerging applications, including very high data rate optical communications, distance sensing for autonomous vehicles, photonic-accelerated computing, and quantum information processing. The success of silicon photonics has been enabled by the unique combination of performance, high yield, and high-volume capacity that can only be achieved by standardizing manufacturing technology. Today, standardized silicon photonics technology platforms implemented by foundries provide access to optimized library components, including low-loss optical routing, fast modulation, continuous tuning, high-speed germanium photodiodes, and high-efficiency optical and electrical interfaces. However, silicon's relatively weak electro-optic effects result in modulators with a significant footprint and thermo-optic tuning devices that require high power consumption, which are substantial impediments for very large-scale integration in silicon photonics. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology can enhance silicon photonics with building blocks that are compact, low-loss, broadband, fast and require very low power consumption. Here, we introduce a silicon photonic MEMS platform consisting of high-performance nano-opto-electromechanical devices fully integrated alongside standard silicon photonics foundry components, with wafer-level sealing for long-term reliability, flip-chip bonding to redistribution interposers, and fibre-array attachment for high port count optical and electrical interfacing. Our experimental demonstration of fundamental silicon photonic MEMS circuit elements, including power couplers, phase shifters and wavelength-division multiplexing devices using standardized technology lifts previous impediments to enable scaling to very large photonic integrated circuits for applications in telecommunications, neuromorphic computing, sensing, programmable photonics, and quantum computing.

AB Mobile robots have become more and more popular in large-scale and crowded environments, such as airports, shopping malls, etc. However, due to sparse landmarks and crowd noise, localization in this environment is a great challenge. Furthermore, it is unreliable for the robot to navigate safely in crowds while considering human comfort. Thus, how to navigate safely with localization precision in that environment is a critical problem. To solve this problem, we proposed a curiosity-based framework that can find an effective path with the consideration of human comfort and crowds, localization uncertainty, and the cost-to-go to the target. Three parts are involved in the proposed framework: the distance assessment module, the Curiosity for Positive Content (CPC), namely information-rich areas, and the Curiosity for Negative Content (CNC), namely crowded areas. CPC is introduced when the real-time localization uncertainty evaluation is not satisfied. This factor is predicted through the propagation of uncertainty along the candidate trajectory to provoke the robot to approach localization-referenced landmarks. The Human Comfort and Crowd Density Map (HCCDM) based on the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is established to calculate CNC, which drives the robot to bypass the crowd and consider human comfort. The evaluation is conducted in a series of large-scale and crowded environments. The results show that our method can find a feasible path that can consider the localization uncertainty while simultaneously avoiding the crowded area.

ID SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION
AB Understanding urban scenes is a fundamental ability requirement for assisted driving and autonomous vehicles. Most of the available urban scene understanding methods use red-green-blue (RGB) images; however, their segmentation performances are prone to degradation under adverse lighting conditions. Recently, many effective artificial neural networks have been presented for urban scene understanding and have shown that incorporating RGB and thermal (RGB-T) images can improve segmentation accuracy even under unsatisfactory lighting conditions. However, the potential of multimodal feature fusion has not been fully exploited because operations such as simply concatenating the RGB and thermal features or averaging their maps have been adopted. To improve the fusion of multimodal features and the segmentation accuracy, we propose a multitask-aware network (MTANet) with hierarchical multimodal fusion (multiscale fusion strategy) for RGB-T urban scene understanding. We developed a hierarchical multimodal fusion module to enhance feature fusion and built a high-level semantic module to extract semantic information for merging with coarse features at various abstraction levels. Using the multilevel fusion module, we exploited low-, mid-, and high-level fusion to improve segmentation accuracy. The multitask module uses boundary, binary, and semantic supervision to optimize the MTANet parameters. Extensive experiments were performed on two benchmark RGB-T datasets to verify the improved performance of the proposed MTANet compared with state-of-the-art methods.(1)

AB This work considers the problem of depth completion, with or without image data, where an algorithm may measure the depth of a prescribed limited number of pixels. The algorithmic challenge is to choose pixel positions strategically and dynamically to maximally reduce overall depth estimation error. This setting is realized in daytime or nighttime depth completion for autonomous vehicles with a programmable LiDAR. Our method uses an ensemble of predictors to define a sampling probability over pixels. This probability is proportional to the variance of the predictions of ensemble members, thus highlighting pixels that are difficult to predict. By additionally proceeding in several prediction phases, we effectively reduce redundant sampling of similar pixels. Our ensemble-based method may be implemented using any depth-completion learning algorithm, such as a state-of-the-art neural network, treated as a black box. In particular, we also present a simple and effective Random Forest-based algorithm, and similarly use its internal ensemble in our design. We conduct experiments on the KITTI dataset, using the neural network algorithm of Ma et al. and our Random Forest-based learner for implementing our method. The accuracy of both implementations exceeds the state of the art. Compared with a random or grid sampling pattern, our method allows a reduction by a factor of 4-10 in the number of measurements required to attain the same accuracy.

AB The shuttle-based storage and retrieval system (SBS/RS) is composed of a shuttle sub-system that is responsible for horizontal movements and a lift sub-system that is responsible for vertical movements. As the combination of the two sub-systems yields high flexibility, low operating cost and large storage capacity, SBS/RS is becoming more and more popular, but also raises managerial issue of how to coordinate the shuttle and the lift. Based on its operational processes, this study models the tier-to-tier SBS/RS system as a semi-open queuing network (SOQN). By removing or adding the synchronization nodes, the SOQN is further transformed into two different closed queuing networks (CQNs), and applies the approximate mean value analysis (AMVA) algorithm to solve the model and estimate its performance. The system performance is measured by the utilization of shuttles, the utilization of lift, and the task cycle time, under various design configurations. Simulation is carried out to validate the effectiveness of the analytical model and algorithm. Compared with the simulation results, the established semi-open queuing network can accurately estimate task cycle time for different rack configurations. The proposed solution method can help to identify the optimal number of shuttles and guide the design of the SBS/RS system.

AB Energy storage is increasingly demanded in many new niches of applications from wearables to unmanned autonomous vehicles. However, current energy storage systems are unable to fulfill the power requirements (high energy at high power) needed for these novel applications. Recently, Li-ion capacitors (LICs) have been spotted as hybrid devices with the potential to display high energy and high power. Nevertheless, it is still a great challenge to achieve high performance LICs due to the unmatched kinetic properties and capacity between anode and cathode materials. Herein, we are presenting our first seminal report on the use of BiVO4 nanorods as a new anode material for LICs coupled with a partially reduced graphene oxide (PRGO) cathode. The BiVO4 nanorods show an excellent reversible capacity of 877 mA h g(-1) (ultrahigh volumetric capacity of 4560 mA h cm(-3)) at 1.1 A g(-1) with a great capacity retention (in half-cell design), which is the highest value reported so far for metal vanadates. Later on, a LIC was constructed with BiVO4 as the anode and PRGO as the cathode electrode, delivering a high energy density of 152 W h kg(-1) and a maximum power density of 9.6 kW kg(-1) compared to that for hard carbon and intercalation (such as Li4Ti5O12 and Li3VO4) based anode materials. Additionally, the BiVO4//PRGO LIC exhibits a good cyclability of 81% over 6000 cycles. Thus, this investigation opens up new opportunities to develop different LIC systems.

TI Design of Complex Engineered Systems Using Multi-Agent Coordination
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; METRICS
AB In complex engineering systems, complexity may arise by design, or as a by-product of the system's operation. In either case, the cause of complexity is the same: the unpredictable manner in which interactions among components modify system behavior. Traditionally, two different approaches are used to handle such complexity: (i) a centralized design approach where the impacts of all potential system states and behaviors resulting from design decisions must be accurately modeled and (ii) an approach based on externally legislating design decisions, which avoid such difficulties, but at the cost of expensive external mechanisms to determine trade-offs among competing design decisions. Our approach is a hybrid of the two approaches, providing a method in which decisions can be reconciled without the need for either detailed interaction models or external mechanisms. A key insight of this approach is that complex system design, undertaken with respect to a variety of design objectives, is fundamentally similar to the multi-agent coordination problem, where component decisions and their interactions lead to global behavior. The results of this paper demonstrate that a team of autonomous agents using a cooperative coevolutionary algorithm (CCEA) can effectively design a complex engineered system. This paper uses a system model of a Formula SAE racing vehicle to illustrate and simulate the methods and potential results. By designing complex systems with a multi-agent coordination approach, a design methodology can be developed to reduce design uncertainty and provide mechanisms through which the system level impact of decisions can be estimated without explicitly modeling such interactions.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is set to become one of the key technological developments of our times provided we are able to realize its full potential. The number of objects connected to IoT is expected to reach 50 billion by 2020 due to the massive influx of diverse objects emerging progressively. IoT, hence, is expected to be a major producer of big data. Sharing and collaboration of data and other resources would be the key for enabling sustainable ubiquitous environments, such as smart cities and societies. A timely fusion and analysis of big data, acquired from IoT and other sources, to enable highly efficient, reliable, and accurate decision making and management of ubiquitous environments would be a grand future challenge. Computational intelligence would play a key role in this challenge. A number of surveys exist on data fusion. However, these are mainly focused on specific application areas or classifications. The aim of this paper is to review literature on data fusion for IoT with a particular focus on mathematical methods ( including probabilistic methods, artificial intelligence, and theory of belief) and specific IoT environments ( distributed, heterogeneous, nonlinear, and object tracking environments). The opportunities and challenges for each of the mathematical methods and environments are given. Future developments, including emerging areas that would intrinsically benefit from data fusion and IoT, autonomous vehicles, deep learning for data fusion, and smart cities, are discussed.

AB A proposal for an autonomous and flexible ship container inspection system is presented. This could be accomplished by the incorporation of an inspection system on various container transportation devices (straddle carriers, yard gentry cranes, automated guided vehicles, trailers). The configuration is terminal specific and it should be defined by the container terminal operator. This enables that no part of the port operational area is used for inspection. The inspection scenario includes container transfer from ship to transportation device with the inspection unit mounted on it. The inspection is performed during actual container movement to the container location. A neutron generator without associated alpha particle detection is used. This allows the use of higher neutron intensities (5 x 10(9) - 10(10) n/s in 4 pi). The inspected container is stationary in the "inspection position" on the transportation device while the "inspection unit" moves along its side. The following analytical methods will be used simultaneously: neutron radiography, X-ray radiography, neutron activation analysis, (n,gamma) and (n, n'gamma) reactions, neutron absorption. and scattering, X-ray backscattering. The neutron techniques will utilize "smart collimators" for neutrons and gamma rays, both emitted and detected. The inspected voxel is defined by the intersection of the neutron generator and the detectors solid angles. The container inspection protocol is based on identification of discrepancies between the cargo manifest, elemental "fingerprint" and radiography profiles. In addition, the information on container weight is obtained during the container transport and screening by measuring of density of material in the container.

TI Monocular Road Detection Using Structured Random Forest

DT Article
DE Road Detection; Structured Random Forest
ID TRACKING; VISION
AB Road detection is a key task for autonomous land vehicles. Monocular vision-based road-detection algorithms are mostly based on machine learning approaches and are usually cast as classification problems. However, the pixel-wise classifiers are faced with the ambiguity caused by changes in road appearance, illumination and weather. An effective way to reduce the ambiguity is to model the contextual information with structured learning and prediction. Currently, the widely used structured prediction model in road detection is the Markov random field or conditional random field. However, the random field-based methods require additional complex optimization after pixel-wise classification, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. In this paper, we present a structured random forest-based road-detection algorithm which is capable of modelling the contextual information efficiently. By mapping the structured label space to a discrete label space, the test function of each split node can be trained in a similar way to that of the classical random forests. Structured random forests make use of the contextual information of image patches as well as the structural information of the labels to get more consistent results. Besides this benefit, by predicting a batch of pixels in a single classification, the structured random forest-based road detection can be much more efficient than the conventional pixel-wise random forest. Experimental results tested on the KITTI-ROAD dataset and data collected in typical unstructured environments show that structured random forest-based road detection outperforms the classical pixel-wise random forest both in accuracy and efficiency.

AB The Atlantic inflow is the primary source of water and heat to the Arctic Ocean. A large portion enters through Fram Strait where it splits into the Yermak and Svalbard Branches. In October to November 2001 the USCGC Healy occupied five oceanographic transects across the Svalbard Branch west and north of Spitsbergen. Temperature and salinity sections show the warm, salty Atlantic Water cooling and freshening as it flows along the continental slope for 553 km. The temperature in the upper 500 m of the water column decreased by 0.25 degrees C/(100 km) implying a heat flux across the sea surface of up to 520 W/m(2) if one assumes a nominal current of speed of 0.1 m/s. A temperature-salinity (T-S) analysis shows that the shape of the T-S curves can be explained in terms of the ratio of the atmospheric-to-ice-melt heat flux. The observations imply that ice melt accounts for progressively more surface cooling as the flow moves toward the Arctic Ocean. An autonomous underwater vehicle completed a vertical section in the region of maximum water mass gradient and revealed layer interleaving in fine detail. Data from this cruise extend a long time series of Atlantic layer source temperature beginning in 1910 (Saloranta and Haugan, 2001). The extended observations show that after the temperature of the Atlantic layer inflow reached a peak in 1992, it cooled to a minimum in 1998 and rose again through 2001.

AB The global transition to cleaner energy sources intensifies pressure on the mining industry to secure the supply of energy transition minerals. However, fulfilling the demands of climate-driven technologies must not compromise critical factors such as health, safety, production efficiency, and the environmental and climatic impacts of mineral extraction. To remain future-fit, the mining industry must adapt to changing demands and realize safe, intelligent, and green & climate-smart (SIGCS) practices. This research offers nuanced insight into building a sustainable future for the mining industry with the advent of Mining 4.0. To achieve this, the investigation centers around two objectives. First, it proposes a unified index system for concurrently implementing SIGCS mining. Second, it develops a reliable evaluation model that integrates Z-number theory and Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to COmpromise Solution method (Z-MARCOS). The proposed decision system prioritizes twenty-one development approaches according to their significance and determines areas requiring immediate attention to make SIGCS mining successful. Results indicate that "digitization" is the top priority option. "Mechanization and automation", "intellectualization", "energy conservation and utilization", and "autonomous and unmanned vehicles" were ranked second, third, and fourth, respectively. This study is a pioneering effort in providing technical assistance for implementing SIGCS practices, enabling the mining industry to secure the supply of energy transition minerals while contributing responsibly to global efforts towards achieving climate neutrality.

AB Accurate, continuous and reliable positioning is required in autonomous driving. The precise point positioning (PPP) technique, which can provide a global accurate positioning service using a single global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver, has attracted much attention. Nevertheless, due to the cycle slips and multipath effects in the GNSS signal, the performance of PPP is severely degraded in urban areas, which has a negative effect on the PPP/inertial navigation system (INS)/vision integrated navigation. Moreover, the carrier phase observations with un-modeled multipath cause false detection of small cycle slips and lead to deviation in the state variable estimation in PPP. Therefore, an effective cycle slip/multipath estimation, detection and mitigation (EDM) method is proposed. A clustering method is used to separate the cycle slips and multipath from the carrier phase observations aided by visual inertial odometry (VIO) positioning results. The influence of the carrier phase multipath on state variable estimation is reduced by adjusting the stochastic ambiguity model in the Kalman filter. The proposed EDM method is validated by vehicle experiments conducted in urban and freeway areas. Experimental results demonstrate that 0.2% cycle slip detection error is achieved by our method. Besides, the multipath estimation accuracy of EDM improves by more than 50% compared with the geometry-based (GB) method. Regarding positioning accuracy, the EDM method has a maximum of 72.2% and 63.2% improvement compared to traditional geometry-free (GF) and GB methods.

AB The aircraft conflict detection and resolution problem has been addressed with a wide range of centralised methods in the past few decades, e.g. constraint programming, mathematical programming or metaheuristics. In the context of autonomous, decentralized collision avoidance without explicit coordination, geometric methods provide an elegant, cost-effective approach to avoid collisions between mobile agents, provided they all share a same logic and a same view of the traffic. The Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) algorithm is a state-of-the art geometric method for robot collision avoidance, which can be used as a Detect & Avoid logic on-board aircraft or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. However, ORCA does not handle well some degenerate situations where agents operate at constant or near-constant speeds, which is a widespread feature of commercial aircraft or fixed-winged Unmanned Airborne Systems. In such degenerate situations, pairs of aircraft could end up flying parallel tracks without ever crossing paths to reach their respective destination. The Constant Speed ORCA (CS-ORCA) was proposed in 2018 to better handle these situations. In this paper, we discuss the limitations of both ORCA and CS-ORCA, and introduce the Dual-Horizon ORCA (DH-ORCA) algorithm, where two time horizons are used respectively for short-term collision avoidance and medium-term path-crossing. We show that this new approach mitigates the main issues of ORCA and CS-ORCA and yields better performances with dense traffic scenarios.

AB Road crashes cost over a million lives each year. Consequently, researchers and transport engineers continue their efforts to improve road safety and minimize road crashes. With the increasing availability of various sensor technologies to capture road safety-related data and the recent breakthrough in modern data-driven techniques, in particular Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques, data-driven road safety research has gained significant attention in the past few years. As road safety involves a number of different aspects, including road infrastructure (e.g., surface conditions), road user behaviors (e.g., driver/pedestrian behavior), and traffic congestion, critically reviewing all these major aspects and their relationships with road crashes is a challenging task. In this paper, we present a detailed review of 70 articles, which are shortlisted from 2871 articles found by searching relevant keywords from the scopus IEEE digital library and google scholar databases. To better analyze the data-driven road safety research a number of taxonomies are first introduced to characterize data sources Equipment & sensors to capture data And methodologies to analyze and make decisions based on data. Then Based on the defined taxonomies Selected research articles covering different aspects of road safety are critically analyzed. This study highlights important directions for future work and some major challenges such as data collection Poor data quality and lack of ground truth data.

TI Aerial-aquatic robots capable of crossing the air-water boundary and

SO SCIENCE ROBOTICS

ID CLASSIFICATIONS; VEHICLES; INSIGHTS
AB Many real-world applications for robots-such as long-term aerial and underwater observation, cross-medium operations, and marine life surveys-require robots with the ability to move between the air-water boundary. Here, we describe an aerial-aquatic hitchhiking robot that is self-contained for flying, swimming, and attaching to surfaces in both air and water and that can seamlessly move between the two. We describe this robot's redundant, hydrostatically enhanced hitchhiking device, inspired by the morphology of a remora (Echeneis naucrates) disc, which works in both air and water. As with the biological remora disc, this device has separate lamellar compartments for redundant sealing, which enables the robot to achieve adhesion and hitchhike with only partial disc attachment. The self-contained, rotor-based aerial-aquatic robot, which has passively morphing propellers that unfold in the air and fold underwater, can cross the air-water boundary in 0.35 second. The robot can perform rapid attachment and detachment on challenging surfaces both in air and under water, including curved, rough, incomplete, and biofouling surfaces, and achieve long-duration adhesion with minimal oscillation. We also show that the robot can attach to and hitchhike on moving surfaces. In field tests, we show that the robot can record video in both media and move objects across the air/water boundary in a mountain stream and the ocean. We envision that this study can pave the way for future robots with autonomous biological detection, monitoring, and tracking capabilities in a wide variety of aerial-aquatic environments.

   Log-Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method; carbon neutrality
ID INDUSTRY; SYSTEM
AB Under the targets of peaking CO2 emissions and carbon neutrality in China, it is a matter of urgency to reduce the CO2 emissions of road transport. To explore the CO2 emission reduction potential of road transport, this study proposes eight policy scenarios: the business-as-usual (BAU), clean electricity (CE), fuel economy improvement (FEI), shared autonomous vehicles (SAV), CO2 emission trading (CET) (with low, medium, and high carbon prices), and comprehensive (CS) scenarios. The road transport CO2 emissions from 2020 to 2060 in these scenarios are calculated based on the bottom-up method and are evaluated in the Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP). The Log-Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method is employed to analyze the contribution of each factor to road transport CO2 emission reduction in each scenario. The results show that CO2 emissions of road transport will peak at 1419.5 million tonnes in 2033 under the BAU scenario. In contrast, the peaks of road transport CO2 emissions in the CE, SAV, FEI, CET-LCP, CET-MCP, CET-HCP, and CS scenarios are decreasing and occur progressively earlier. Under the CS scenario with the greatest CO2 emission reduction potential, CO2 emissions of road transport will peak at 1200.37 million tonnes in 2023 and decrease to 217.73 million tonnes by 2060. Fuel structure and fuel economy contribute most to the emission reduction in all scenarios. This study provides possible pathways toward low-carbon road transport for the goal of carbon neutrality in China.

AB The Star-Planet Activity Research CubeSat (SPARCS) is a 6U CubeSat under development to monitor the flaring and chromospheric activity of M dwarfs at near-ultraviolet (NUV) and far-ultraviolet (FUV) wavelengths. The spacecraft hosts two UV-optimized delta-doped charge-coupled devices fed by a 9-cm telescope and a dichroic beam splitter. A dedicated science payload processor performs near-real-time onboard science image processing to dynamically change detector integration times and gains to reduce the occurrence of pixel saturation during strong M dwarf flaring events and provide adequate flare light-curve structure resolution while enabling the detection of low-amplitude rotational modulation. The processor independently controls the NUV and FUV detectors. For each detector, it derives control updates from the most recent completed exposure and applies them to the next exposure. The detection of a flare event in the NUV channel resets the exposure in the FUV channel with new exposure parameters. Implementation testing of the control algorithm using simulated light curves and full-frame images demonstrates a robust response to the quiescent and flaring levels expected for the stars to be monitored by the mission. The SPARCS onboard autonomous exposure control algorithm is adaptable for operation in future point source-targeting space-based and ground-based observatories geared towards the monitoring of extreme transient astrophysics phenomena.

AB Coastal ship tracking is significant for cargo transportation and route determination. However, there are few effective tracking methods for specialized ship tracking. Although Siamese networks have been commonly used for object tracking in the field of deep learning, the results for the ship are not accurate due to the lack of contour and edge information. In addition, scale variation and seawater cause unstable ship movements, which aggravates the reduction in tracking accuracy. Therefore, we propose an enhanced SiamMask network for coastal ship tracking. Compared to the previous Siamese network, our algorithm has the following three advantages. First, we apply the unity of visual object tracking and semisupervised object segmentation to the ship tracking task, which completes target tracking while outputting edge shape information. Second, we propose a refined feature pyramid network that utilizes a feature fusion module and enhanced residual module (ERM) to solve the problems of scale variation in datasets. Third, we propose an attentionwise cross correlation with a multidimension attention module (MDAM) to focus more on ship targets and suppress nontargets through autonomous learning at width, height, and channel levels, which creates a tradeoff between the accuracy and the robustness of tracking algorithms. The experimental results show that our method achieves leading performance in LMD-TShips, outperforming most of the state-of-the-art trackers.

AB This article proposes areinforcement learning (RL)-based six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) control scheme for the final-phase proximity operations of spacecraft. The main novelty of the proposed method are from two aspects: 1) The closed-loop performance can be improved in real-time through the RL technique, achieving an online approximate optimal control subject to the full 6-DOF nonlinear dynamics of spacecraft; 2) nontrivial motion constraints of proximity operations are considered and strictly obeyed during the whole control process. As a stepping stone, the dual-quaternion formalism is employed to characterize the 6-DOF dynamics model and motion constraints. Then, an RL-based control scheme is developed under the dual-quaternion algebraic framework to approximate the optimal control solution subject to a cost function and a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. In addition, a specially designed barrier function is embedded in the reward function to avoid motion constraint violations. The Lyapunov-based stability analysis guarantees the ultimate boundedness of state errors and the weight of NN estimation errors. Besides, we also show that a PD-like controller under dual-quaternion formulation can be employed as the initial control policy to trigger the online learning process. The boundedness of it is proved by a special Lyapunov strictification method. Simulation results of prototypical spacecraft missions with proximity operations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Active transportation (AT) is widely viewed as an important target for increasing participation in aerobic physical activity and improving health, while simultaneously addressing pollution and climate change through reductions in motor vehicular emissions. In recent years, progress in increasing AT has stalled in some countries and, furthermore, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created new AT opportunities while also exposing the barriers and health inequities related to AT for some populations. This paper describes the results of the December 2019 Conference on Health and Active Transportation (CHAT) which brought together leaders from the transportation and health disciplines. Attendees charted a course for the future around three themes: Reflecting on Innovative Practices, Building Strategic Institutional Relationships, and Identifying Research Needs and Opportunities. This paper focuses on conclusions of the Research Needs and Opportunities theme. We present a conceptual model derived from the conference sessions that considers how economic and systems analysis, evaluation of emerging technologies and policies, efforts to address inclusivity, disparities and equity along with renewed attention to messaging and communication could contribute to overcoming barriers to development and use of AT infrastructure. Specific research gaps concerning these themes are presented. We further discuss the relevance of these themes considering the pandemic. Renewed efforts at research, dissemination and implementation are needed to achieve the potential health and environmental benefits of AT and to preserve positive changes associated with the pandemic while mitigating negative ones.

ID VISUAL RESPONSES; SPEED; HEIGHT; COMPENSATION; PHEROMONE
AB To minimize the risk of colliding with the ground or other obstacles, flying animals need to control both their ground speed and ground height. This task is particularly challenging in wind, where head winds require an animal to increase its airspeed to maintain a constant ground speed and tail winds may generate negative airspeeds, rendering flight more difficult to control. In this study, we investigate how head and tail winds affect flight control in the honeybee Apis mellifera, which is known to rely on the pattern of visual motion generated across the eye-known as optic flow-to maintain constant ground speeds and heights. We find that, when provided with both longitudinal and transverse optic flow cues (in or perpendicular to the direction of flight, respectively), honeybees maintain a constant ground speed but fly lower in head winds and higher in tail winds, a response that is also observed when longitudinal optic flow cues are minimized. When the transverse component of optic flow is minimized, or when all optic flow cues are minimized, the effect of wind on ground height is abolished. We propose that the regular sidewards oscillations that the bees make as they fly may be used to extract information about the distance to the ground, independently of the longitudinal optic flow that they use for ground speed control. This computationally simple strategy could have potential uses in the development of lightweight and robust systems for guiding autonomous flying vehicles in natural environments.

ID MODEL
AB As acoustic waves are affected by the channel characteristics, such as scattering and reverberation when propagating in water, sonar images often exhibit speckle noise which will cause visual quality of the image to decrease. Therefore, denoising is a crucial preprocessing technique in sonar image applications. However, speckle noise is mainly caused by the sediment echo signals which are related to the background of seafloor sediment and can be obtained by prior modeling. Although deep learning-based denoising algorithms represent a research hotspot now, they are not suitable for such applications due to the high calculation amount and the large requirement of original images considering that sonar is carried by Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for collecting sonar images and performing calculation. In contrast, dictionary learning-based denoising method is more suitable and easier to be modeled. Compared with deep learning, it can greatly reduce the calculation amount and is more easily integrated into AUV systems. In addition, dictionary learning method based on image sparse representation can effectively achieve image denoising similarly. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a new adaptive dictionary learning method based on multi-resolution characteristics, which combines K-SVD dictionary learning with wavelet transform. Our method has the characteristics of dictionary learning and inherits the features of wavelet analysis as well. Compared with several classical methods, the proposed method is better at speckle noise reduction and edge detail preservation. At the same time, the calculation time is greatly reduced and the efficiency is significantly improved.

AB As the automotive industry enters a period of rapid evolution changing the way cars are designed and produced, the number of complex safety-critical components deployed in advanced driver assistance systems or autonomous vehicles is progressively rising with high-end models containing around 120 MCUs. These integrated circuits must adhere to stringent requirements for high quality and long-term reliability driven by functional safety standards. This requires test solutions that address challenges posed by automotive electronics. This paper presents Stellar BIST-a next generation compression scheme for in-system automotive test. The proposed solution can work with any sequential test compression. It builds on a finding that certain clusters of test vectors are capable of detecting many random-resistant faults, where a cluster consists of a parent (base) pattern and its transformed derivatives. Stellar BIST involves generating vectors based on simultaneous and multiple complements of scan slices of encodable parent patterns. The multiple complements are also skewed between successive patterns to diversify the resultant tests. The new scheme elevates compression to values unachievable through conventional reseeding-based solutions and provides significant tradeoffs between storage requirements and test application time, critical for in-system automotive applications. The experimental results obtained for industrial designs and different fault models illustrate feasibility of the proposed test scheme and are reported herein.

ID RESOURCE-ALLOCATION
AB Wireless-powered communication network (WPCN) is a key technology to power energy limited massive devices, such as on-board wireless sensors in autonomous vehicles, for Internet-of-Things applications. Conventional WPCNs rely only on dedicated downlink wireless power transfer (WPT), which is practically inefficient due to the significant energy loss in wireless signal propagation. Meanwhile, ambient energy harvesting is highly appealing as devices can scavenge energy from various existing energy sources (e.g., solar energy and cellular signals). Unfortunately, the randomness of the availability of these energy sources cannot guarantee stable communication services. Motivated by the above statements, we consider a generalized WPCN where the devices can not only harvest energy from a dedicated multiple-antenna power station (PS), but can also exploit stored energy stemming from ambient energy harvesting. Since the dedicated WPT consumes system resources, if the stored energy is sufficient, WPT may not be needed to maximize the weighted sum rate. To analytically characterize this phenomenon, we derive the condition for WPT activation and reveal how it is affected by the different system parameters. Subsequently, we further derive the optimal resource allocation policy for the cases that WPT is activated and deactivated, respectively. In particular, it is found that when WPT is activated, the optimal energy beamforming at the PS does not depend on the devices' stored energy, which is shown to lead to a new unfairness issue. Simulation results verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal resource allocation.

AB Satellite navigation is more and more important in a plethora of very different application fields, ranging from bank transactions to shipping, from autonomous driving to aerial applications, such as avionics as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Due to the increasing dependency on satellite navigation, the need for robust systems able to counteract unintentional or intentional interferences is growing. When considering interference-robust designs; however, the complexity increases. Top performance is obtained through the use of multi-antenna receivers capable of performing spatial nulling in the direction of the interference signals. In particular, mobile applications (aeronautics, UAVs, automotive) have a substantial interest in robust navigation, but they also have the strongest constraints on the weight and available places for installation, with the use of bigger and heavier systems posing a substantial problem. In order to overcome this limitation, the present work shows a miniaturized five element (4+1) antenna array, which operates at the L1/E1 band (with array capability), as well as at the L5/E5 band (as a single antenna). The proposed antenna array is able to fit into a 3.5-inch footprint, i.e., is compliant with the most widespread footprints for single antennas. Moreover, it is capable of multiband operation and meets the requirements of dual-frequency multi-constellation (DFMC) systems. Thanks to its extreme miniaturization and its compliance with current airborne single antenna footprints, the presented antenna array is suitable for easy integration in future aerial platforms, while enabling robustness and enhancing interference mitigation techniques using multi-antenna processing.

AB The architecture of the cephalic lateral line canal system, with distinct lines for the supraorbital, infraorbital and mandibular canals, is highly conserved among fish species. Because these canals lie on a cranial platform, the sensory input they receive is expected to change based on how flow interacts with the head and how the canal pores are spatially distributed. In this study, we explored how head width, a trait that can vary greatly between species and across ontogeny, affects flow sensing. We inserted pressure sensors into physical fish head models of varying widths (narrow, intermediate and wide) and placed these models in steady and vortical flows. We measured sensory performance in terms of detecting flow parameters (flow speed, vortex shedding frequency and cylinder diameter), sensitivity (change in pressure gradient as a function of flow speed) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR; strength of vortex shedding frequency with respect to background). Our results show that in all model heads the amount of hydrodynamic information was maximized at the anterior region regardless of what metric we used to evaluate the sensory performance. In addition, we discovered that all model heads had the highest SNR for vortices at the intermediate flow speeds but that each head width passively optimized the SNR for different sized vortices, which may have implications for refuge and prey seeking. Our results provide insight into the sensory ecology of fishes and have implications for the design of autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB This paper presents a fast and robust approach for estimating the flight altitude of multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) using 3D point cloud sensors in cluttered, unstructured, and dynamic indoor environments. The objective is to present a flight altitude estimation algorithm, replacing the conventional sensors such as laser altimeters, barometers, or accelerometers, which have several limitations when used individually. Our proposed algorithm includes two stages: in the first stage, a fast clustering of the measured 3D point cloud data is performed, along with the segmentation of the clustered data into horizontal planes. In the second stage, these segmented horizontal planes are mapped based on the vertical distance with respect to the point cloud sensor frame of reference, in order to provide a robust flight altitude estimation even in presence of several static as well as dynamic ground obstacles. We validate our approach using the IROS 2011 Kinect dataset available in the literature, estimating the altitude of the RGB-D camera using the provided 3D point clouds. We further validate our approach using a point cloud sensor on board a UAV, by means of several autonomous real flights, closing its altitude control loop using the flight altitude estimated by our proposed method, in presence of several different static as well as dynamic ground obstacles. In addition, the implementation of our approach has been integrated in our open-source software framework for aerial robotics called Aerostack.

TI Phero-Trail: A Bio-Inspired Location Service for Mobile Underwater
   Sensor Networks
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS

DT Article

   networks; pheromone trail
AB A SEA Swarm (Sensor Equipped Aquatic Swarm) is a collection of mobile underwater sensors that moves as a group with water current and enables 4D (space and time) monitoring of local underwater events such as contaminants and intruders. For prompt alert reporting, mobile sensors routes events to mobile sinks (i.e., autonomous underwater vehicles) via geographic routing that is known to be most efficient under mobility and scarce acoustic bandwidth. In order for a packet to be routed to the destination using geographical routing, it requires to know the location of the destination. This is accomplished by having a location service that returns the location of a requested node. Our goal is to design such location service for SEA Swarm. In this paper, we analyze various design choices to realize an efficient location service in SEA Swarm scenarios. We find that conventional ad hoc network location service protocols cannot be directly used, because the entire swarm moves along water current. We prove that maintaining location information in a 2D plane is a better design choice. Given this, we propose a bio-inspired location service called a Phero-Trail location service protocol. In Phero-Trail, location information is stored in a 2D upper hull of a SEA Swarm, and a mobile sink uses its trajectory (a la a pheromone trail of ants) projected to the 2D hull to maintain location information. This enables mobile sensors to efficiently locate a mobile sink. Our results show that Phero-Trail performs better than existing approaches.

TI From battlefields to urban grids: New research challenges in ad hoc
   wireless networks
SO PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
AB There has been much talk over the past two decades about commercialization of the mobile ad hoc network (MANET) technology. Potential ad hoc network applications with some commercial appeal are now finally emerging, "drafted" by the enormously successful wireless LAN technology. Closely coupled to commercial applications and critically dependent on commercial ad hoc networks will be the "pervasive computing" applications. Since military and civilian emergency MANETs have been around for over three decades, and since the Government has continuously supported MANET research for as many years, it may seem natural to assume that all the research has already been done and that commercial MANETs can be deployed by simply leveraging the military and civilian research results. Unfortunately, there is a catch. Commercial MANETs (and therefore pervasive computing applications) will evolve in a way totally different from their military counterparts. Most importantly, they will start small, and will initially be tethered to the Internet. They will be extremely cost-aware. They will also need to cater to a variety of different applications. This is in sharp contrast with the large scale, autonomous, special purpose and cost insensitive military networks. In this paper we review a typical "battlefield" MANET application and contrast it to two emerging commercial MANET scenarios-the urban vehicle grid and the Campus network. We compare characteristics and design goals and make the case for new research to help kick off commercial MANETs. In particular we argue that P2P technology will be critical in the early evolution of commercial MANETs and identify research directions for P2P MANETs. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Identifying a notable object and predicting its importance in front of a vehicle are crucial for automated systems' risk assessment and decision making. However, current research has rarely exploited the driver's attentional characteristics. In this study, we propose an attention-driven saliency object estimation (SOE) method that uses the attention intensity of the driver as a criterion for determining the salience and importance of objects. First, we design a driver attention prediction (DAP) network with a 2D-3D mixed convolution encoder-decoder structure. Second, we fuse the DAP network with faster R-CNN and YOLOv4 at the feature level and name them SOE-F and SOE-Y, respectively, using a shared-bottom multi-task learning (MTL) architecture. By transferring the spatial features onto the time axis, we are able to eliminate the drawback of the bottom features being extracted repeatedly and achieve a uniform image-video input in SOE-F and SOE-Y. Finally, the parameters in SOE-F and SOE-Y are classified into two categories, domain invariant and domain adaptive, and then the domain-adaptive parameters are trained and optimized. The experimental results on the DADA-2000 dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in several evaluation metrics and can more accurately predict driver attention. In addition, driven by a human-like attention mechanism, SOE-F and SOE-Y can identify and detect the salience, category, and location of objects, providing risk assessment and a decision basis for autonomous driving systems.

AB Due to the large amount of data involved in the three-dimensional (3D) LiDAR point clouds, point cloud compression (PCC) becomes indispensable to many real-time applications. In autonomous driving of connected vehicles for example, point clouds are constantly acquired along the time and subjected to be compressed. Among the existing PCC methods, very few of them have effectively removed the temporal redundancy inherited in the point clouds. To address this issue, a novel lossy LiDAR PCC system is proposed in this paper, which consists of the inter-frame coding and the intra-frame coding. For the former, a deep-learning approach is proposed to conduct bi-directional frame prediction using an asymmetric residual module and 3D space-time convolutions; the proposed network is called the bi-directional prediction network (BPNet). For the latter, a novel range-adaptive floating-point coding (RAFC) algorithm is proposed for encoding the reference frames and the B-frame prediction residuals in the 32-bit floating-point precision. Since the pixel-value distribution of these two types of data are quite different, various encoding modes are designed for providing adaptive selection. Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted using multiple point cloud datasets, and the results clearly show that our proposed PCC system consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art MPEG G-PCC in terms of data fidelity and localization, while delivering real-time performance.

AB A small-sized brake generating the torque less than 0.5 Nm is very attractive to achieve desired dynamic motions in many different fields such as medical haptic and auto door closure. In this work, a controllable compact-sized brake utilizing a magnetorheological fluid (MRF) is proposed and its effectiveness is validated through simulation and experiment. Unlike conventional shear mode magnetorheological brake (MRB), a mixed mode MRB (M-MRB) featuring both the flow and shear mode operations is designed to obtain high torque efficiency in which both the key shape and ring shape structures play the significant role. Through these structures, the proposed M-MRB can provide higher torque with the relatively less amount of MRF than conventional shear mode MRB. The key shape structure is fixed to the rotor and shaft of MRB and rotates in same direction. Then, MRF on the front and back of the barrier is subjected to the pressure difference resulting in the field-dependent torque generation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design concept, a small-sized M-MRB is designed and manufactured considering the required torque level and space constraint of auto door closure applicable to autonomous vehicle systems. It is identified through a reasonable comparison between the proposed M-MRB and conventional MRB that the proposed one can improve controllable torque range up to 325% with less MR fluid than conventional MRB.

AB Intelligent data collection is a key component in underwater acoustic sensor networks, and it plays an important role in seabed environment monitoring, marine resource detection and marine disaster early warning. Owing to the particularities of the underwater environment, such as reduced infrastructure and noisy communication channels, the data collected by underwater nodes are more efficiently transmitted to a control center on the surface by way of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). However, with the increasing complexity of the underwater tasks, using a single AUV for data collection cannot meet the requirements of low latency and low power consumption. To solve this problem, a multi-AUV collaborative data collection algorithm that reduces the load of data collection task on a single AUV is proposed. The algorithm is divided into two stages: multi-AUV task allocation and Q-learning-based AUV path planning. The data transmission of the clusters is regarded as a set of different tasks, which are assigned to the AUVs for completion. Subsequently, path planning is performed to guide the AUVs, so that the tasks are completed promptly and at a reduced cost. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can leverage the energy consumption of a network and extend its lifetime. The performance of the proposed algorithm in energy consumption is increased by about 10%, and the delay of data collection is also significantly reduced.

AB Across the globe, remote image data is rapidly being collected for the assessment of benthic communities from shallow to extremely deep waters on continental slopes to the abyssal seas. Exploiting this data is presently limited by the time it takes for experts to identify organisms found in these images. With this limitation in mind, a large effort has been made globally to introduce automation and machine learning algorithms to accelerate both classification and assessment of marine benthic biota. One major issue lies with organisms that move with swell and currents, such as kelps. This paper presents an automatic hierarchical classification method local binary classification as opposed to the conventional flat classification to classify kelps in images collected by autonomous underwater vehicles. The proposed kelp classification approach exploits learned feature representations extracted from deep residual networks. We show that these generic features outperform the traditional off-the-shelf CNN features and the conventional hand-crafted features. Experiments also demonstrate that the hierarchical classification method outperforms the traditional parallel multi-class classifications by a significant margin (90.0% vs. 57.6% and 77.2% vs. 59.0%) on Benthoz15 and Rottnest datasets respectively. Furthermore, we compare different hierarchical classification approaches and experimentally show that the sibling hierarchical training approach outperforms the inclusive hierarchical approach by a significant margin. We also report an application of our proposed method to study the change in kelp cover over time for annually repeated AUV surveys.

AB This article is concerned with remote monitoring and control of the 2-degrees of freedom (DoF) robotic manipulators, which have nonlinear dynamics over the packet erasure channel, which is an abstract model for communication over the Internet, WiFi, or Zigbee modules. This type of communication is subject to imperfections, such as random packet dropout and rate distortion. These imperfections cause a significant challenge for monitoring and control of robotic manipulators in the industrial environments because sensitive data, such as sensor data and control commands may not ever reach to their destination resulting in significant performance degradation. Therefore, the effects of these imperfections must be compensated. In this article, we apply two coding and control techniques previously developed for the telepresence ad teleoperation of autonomous vehicles to compensate the effects of the above communication imperfections for remote monitoring and control of the 2-DoF robotic manipulators controlled over the packet erasure channel. To achieve this goal, we design a new linear controller and a new nonlinear controller for the 2-DoF robotic manipulators over the packet erasure channel. The first technique is based on the linearization method and the second technique uses a nonlinear controller. The performances of these two techniques for remote monitoring and control of robotic manipulators are evaluated and compared with each other in this paper. We illustrate their satisfactory performances in the presence of severe communication imperfections.

AB While Machine Learning (ML) technologies are widely adopted in many mission critical fields to support intelligent decision-making, concerns remain about system resilience against ML-specific security attacks and privacy breaches as well as the trust that users have in these systems. In this article, we present our recent systematic and comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art ML robustness and trustworthiness from a security engineering perspective, focusing on the problems in system threat analysis, design and evaluation faced in developing practical machine learning applications, in terms of robustness and user trust. Accordingly, we organize the presentation of this survey intended to facilitate the convey of the body of knowledge from this angle. We then describe a metamodel we created that represents the body of knowledge in a standard and visualized way. We further illustrate how to leverage the metamodel to guide a systematic threat analysis and security design process which extends and scales up the classic process. Finally, we propose the future research directions motivated by our findings. Our work differs itself from the existing surveys by (i) exploring the fundamental principles and best practices to support robust and trustworthy ML system development, and (ii) studying the interplay of robustness and user trust in the context of ML systems. We expect this survey provides a big picture for machine learning security practitioners.

AB With the soaring popularity of ride-hailing, the interdependence between transit ridership, ride-hailing ridership, and urban congestion motivates the following question: can public transit and ride-hailing coexist and thrive in a way that enhances the urban transportation ecosystem as a whole? To answer this question, we develop a mathematical and computational framework that optimizes transit schedules while explicitly accounting for their impacts on road congestion and passengers' mode choice between transit and ride-hailing. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear program and solved using a bilevel decomposition algorithm. Based on computational case study experiments in New York City, our optimized transit schedules consistently lead to 0.4%-3% systemwide cost reduction. This amounts to rush-hour savings of millions of dollars per day while simultaneously reducing the costs to passengers and transportation service providers. These benefits are driven by a better alignment of available transportation options with passengers' preferences-by redistributing public transit resources to where they provide the strongest societal benefits. These results are robust to underlying assumptions about passenger demand, transit level of service, the dynamics of ride-hailing operations, and transit fare structures. Ultimately, by explicitly accounting for ride-hailing competition, passenger preferences, and traffic congestion, transit agencies can develop schedules that lower costs for passengers, operators, and the system as a whole: a rare win-win-win outcome.

DE Representation learning; search and rescue robots; collision avoidance
AB Deep reinforcement learning (RL), where the agent learns from mistakes, has been successfully applied to a variety of tasks. With the aim of learning collision-free policies for unmanned vehicles, deep RL has been used for training with various types of data, such as colored images, depth images, and LiDAR point clouds, without the use of classic map-localize-plan approaches. However, existing methods are limited by their reliance on cameras and LiDAR devices, which have degraded sensing under adverse environmental conditions (e.g., smoky environments). In response, we propose the use of single-chip millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar, which is lightweight and inexpensive, for learning-based autonomous navigation. However, because mmWave radar signals are often noisy and sparse, we propose a cross-modal contrastive learning of representations (CM-CLR) method that maximizes the agreement between mmWave radar data and LiDAR data in the training stage. We evaluated our method in real-world robot compared with 1) a method with two separate networks using cross-modal generative reconstruction and an RL policy and 2) a baseline RL policy without cross-modal representations. Our proposed end-to-end deep RL policy with contrastive learning successfully navigated the robot through smoke-filled maze environments and achieved better performance compared with generative reconstruction methods, in which noisy artifact walls or obstacles were produced. All pretrained models and hardware settings are open access for reproducing this study and can be obtained at https://arg-nctu.github.io/projects/deeprl-mmWave.html.

TI Bottom Detection Method of Side-Scan Sonar Image for AUV Missions
SO COMPLEXITY
LA English
DT Article
AB In order to obtain the measurement parameters of the sea bottom geomorphology or underwater objects, the first step in side-scan sonar (SSS) image processing is bottom detection. Due to the complexity of the marine environment, the acoustic signals received by SSS are usually polluted by noises, which affect its image quality and make the extraction of image features difficult. To address this problem, this study proposes an automatic detection method for the sea bottom line based on the actual experimental acquisition of SSS images, which is supposed to support the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for intelligent target detection and classification. The proposed method comprises four main steps. First, the raw SSS data is analyzed to obtain a grayscale image, and the blind zone boundary of the image is obtained using the threshold method. Then, the noise characteristics of the image are analyzed and the denoising algorithm is optimized to effectively remove high-frequency noise. Next, spatial-temporal matching calculations are performed on each ping port and starboard data, and the accurate coordinates of first bottom returns are obtained through extreme value detection. Finally, automatic and accurate detection of the bottom line is realized according to the smooth processing of the coordinate sequence of first bottom returns. The experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. As the method does not require human intervention in adjusting parameters during operation, the proposed method with a certain time window imposed during image acquisition will be suitable for AUV missions when the SSS is determined.

ID EXPERIENCE
AB Sense of agency (SoA), or the subjective feeling that "I am the agent controlling the object," is essential for learning and enjoying object manipulation. Recently developed automatic control systems, such as the cruise control systems in autonomous vehicles, require less manual control from the manipulators. It has to date been impossible to completely relieve operators of the need for manual control in many automatic control systems developed for tool-using situations. Therefore, it is important to examine how to maintain SoA (illusorily) during an automatic control situation. We investigated the effects of two typical characteristics of everyday tool-use situations on SoA when braking a moving object with a keypress. These characteristics included the presence of a goal (e.g., in driving situations, the driver steps on the brake pedal to stop the car at an expected position) and the gradual emergence of the outcome (e.g., the driver steps on the brake pedal and the car usually slows down first and then stops). We conducted an experiment in which participants stopped a moving object and then rated their SoA for stopping the object. Participants were explicitly informed that the object would sometimes stop independently of their keypress. Results showed that both characteristics decreased SoA in the manual control situation but increased SoA in the automatic control situation. Thus, these characteristics could be useful for maintaining a sense of agency in automatic control situations.

AB This overview article proposes a revised approach to improve the urban realm, against the backdrop of new models for delivering transport services as digitalisation, collaborative consumption and autonomous technologies take hold. We propose the concept of modal efficiency illustrated through a conceptual framework situating both existing and emerging modes of transport around spatial and temporal dimensions. This framework helps us evaluate how the push towards smaller and more flexible transport services in questionable settings can have significant and adverse effects on road capacity, increasing congestion and in the longer term impacting urban form. We propose linking urban land use characteristics to travel price and modal efficiency to improve the broader transport system and guide the sustainable development of our cities. Mobility as a service (MaaS) based on shared mobility and modal integration constitutes a major opportunity to deliver on these ideals, if organised appropriately. Widely diverging service delivery models for MaaS are introduced, including commercially-motivated models (which may exacerbate efficiency issues), and systems which incorporate an institutional overlay. We propose consideration of a government-contracted model for MaaS, where road pricing is incorporated as an input into package price, defined by time of day, geography and modal efficiency. In amidst the hype of new mobility technologies and services, a critical assessment of the realm of possibilities can better inform government policy and ensure that digital disruption occurs to our advantage.

TI WaterGAN: Unsupervised Generative Network to Enable Real-Time Color
   Correction of Monocular Underwater Images
SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Marine robotics; visual learning
AB This letter reports on WaterGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for generating realistic underwater images from in-air image and depth pairings in an unsupervised pipeline used for color correction of monocular underwater images. Cameras onboard autonomous and remotely operated vehicles can capture high-resolution images to map the seafloor; however, underwater image formation is subject to the complex process of light propagation through the water column. The raw images retrieved are characteristically different than images taken in air due to effects, such as absorption and scattering, which cause attenuation of light at different rates for different wavelengths. While this physical process is well described theoretically, the model depends on many parameters intrinsic to the water column as well as the structure of the scene. These factors make recovery of these parameters difficult without simplifying assumptions or field calibration; hence, restoration of underwater images is a nontrivial problem. Deep learning has demonstrated great success in modeling complex nonlinear systems but requires a large amount of training data, which is difficult to compile in deep sea environments. Using WaterGAN, we generate a large training dataset of corresponding depth, in-air color images, and realistic underwater images. These data serve as input to a two-stage network for color correction of monocular underwater images. Our proposed pipeline is validated with testing on real data collected from both a pure water test tank and from underwater surveys collected in the field. Source code, sample datasets, and pretrained models are made publicly available.

AB Aiming at the problem that Doppler velocity log (DVL) cannot measure the velocity of the vehicle in the middle water environment, a Strap-down Inertial Navigation System (SINS)/DVL integrated navigation method based on hierarchical water velocity assistance is proposed. Firstly, according to the principle of DVL water layer flow measurement, the paper gives a hierarchical water recurrence principle. On this basis, a water velocity estimation method based on average weighted recurrence is proposed. The carrier depth information is introduced in this method, and the carrier velocity information is obtained by means of average value. This method can prevent the carrier velocity anomaly caused by the large error of single-layer water velocity measurement. Secondly, in view of the problem that the DVL water velocity measurement is easily disturbed in the middle water environment, a sliding window and a Chebyshev polynomial fitting function are introduced to realize the robust treatment of the water velocity. On this basis, combined with the Huber M robust filter algorithm, a hierarchical water velocity assisted integrated navigation algorithm based on the improved Huber M robust estimation is proposed to further improve the autonomous navigation accuracy in the middle water environment. Finally, the method proposed in this paper is verified by simulation. The results show that the hierarchical water velocity estimation method proposed in this paper can effectively estimate the water flow velocity, and its robust filtering algorithm can further improve the SINS/DVL integrated navigation accuracy in the middle water environment.

AB High-resolution trajectory data from the intersection shared space (ISS) is an ideal resource for testing autonomous driving and studying microscopic traffic flow theory in urban road traffic environments. It is common to use computer vision (CV) technologies to extract trajectory data from camera recordings at the ISS. However, it is challenging to accurately extract non-motorized (NONM) trajectories due to vehicle occlusion and mutual interference, which cause trajectory noise and missing. This study proposed a novel NONM trajectory reconstruction method, which integrates the social force model with the particle filter to reduce trajectory noise. The approach was tested on trajectories extracted from two advanced CV algorithms (ie, Yolov7 and MASK RCNN), and its performance was compared with seven SOTA methods. The results show that the proposed method achieved a much better RMSE (0.6 meters) than both the baseline (unprocessed CV trajectories, the RMSE is 1.16 meters) and selected SOTA methods (the best RMSE is 0.78 meters). The contribution of the study is to enhance the classical noise reduction algorithm by introducing the driving interaction model; ablation experiments and sensitivity analysis further demonstrate the importance of the driving interaction model in reducing trajectory noise and the stability of the method. The approach also includes an LSTM-Hungarian part to make up the missing trajectory. The proposed method is expected to serve as a useful post-processing tool for current CV algorithms.

AB Thanks to its superior imaging resolution and range, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is fast becoming an indispensable optical perception technology for intelligent automation systems including autonomous vehicles and robotics(1-3). The development of next-generation LiDAR systems critically needs a non-mechanical beam-steering system that scans the laser beam in space. Various beam-steering technologies(4) have been developed, including optical phased array(5-8), spatial light modulation(9-11), focal plane switch array(12,13), dispersive frequency comb(14,15) and spectro-temporal modulation(16). However, many of these systems continue to be bulky, fragile and expensive. Here we report an on-chip, acousto-optic beam-steering technique that uses only a single gigahertz acoustic transducer to steer light beams into free space. Exploiting the physics of Brillouin scattering(17,18), in which beams steered at different angles are labelled with unique frequency shifts, this technique uses a single coherent receiver to resolve the angular position of an object in the frequency domain, and enables frequency-angular resolving LiDAR. We demonstrate a simple device construction, control system for beam steering and frequency domain detection scheme. The system achieves frequency-modulated continuous-wave ranging with an 18 degrees field of view, 0.12 degrees angular resolution and a ranging distance up to 115 m. The demonstration can be scaled up to an array realizing miniature, low-cost frequency-angular resolving LiDAR imaging systems with a wide two-dimensional field of view. This development represents a step towards the widespread use of LiDAR in automation, navigation and robotics.

AB Companies are constantly changing in their organization and the way they treat information. In this sense, relevant data analysis processes arise for decision makers. Similarly, to perform decision-making analyses, multi-criteria and metaheuristic methods represent a key tool for such analyses. These analysis methods solve symmetric and asymmetric problems with multiple criteria. In such a way, the symmetry transforms the decision space and reduces the search time. Therefore, the objective of this research is to provide a classification of the applications of multi-criteria and metaheuristic methods. Furthermore, due to the large number of existing methods, the article focuses on the particle swarm algorithm (PSO) and its different extensions. This work is novel since the review of the literature incorporates scientific articles, patents, and copyright registrations with applications of the PSO method. To mention some examples of the most relevant applications of the PSO method; route planning for autonomous vehicles, the optimal application of insulin for a type 1 diabetic patient, robotic harvesting of agricultural products, hybridization with multi-criteria methods, among others. Finally, the contribution of this article is to propose that the PSO method involves the following steps: (a) initialization, (b) update of the local optimal position, and (c) obtaining the best global optimal position. Therefore, this work contributes to researchers not only becoming familiar with the steps, but also being able to implement it quickly. These improvements open new horizons for future lines of research.

AB A depth map helps robots and autonomous vehicles (AVs) visualize the three-dimensional world to navigate and localize neighboring obstacles. However, it is difficult to develop a deep learning model that can estimate the depth map from a single image in real-time. This study proposes a fast monocular depth estimation model named FastMDE by optimizing the deep convolutional neural network according to the encoder-decoder architecture. The decoder needs to obtain partial and semantic feature maps from the encoding phase to improve the depth estimation accuracy. Therefore, we designed FastMDE with two effective strategies. The first one involved redesigning the skip connection with the features of the squeeze-excitation module to obtain partial and semantic feature maps of the encoding phase. The second strategy involved redesigning the decoder by using the fusion dense block to permit the usage of high-resolution features that were learned earlier in the network before upsampling. The proposed FastMDE model utilizes only 4.1 M parameters, which is much lesser than the parameters utilized by state-of-art models. Thus, FastDME has a higher accuracy and lower latency than previous models. This study also demonstrates that MDE can leverage deep neural networks in real-time (i.e., 30 fps) with the Linux embedded board Nvidia Jetson Xavier NX.

AB Estimating the robot's heading is a crucial requirement in odometry systems which are attempting to estimate the movement trajectory of a robot. Small errors in the orientation estimation result in a significant difference between the estimated and real trajectory, and failure of the odometry system. The odometry problem becomes much more complicated for micro flying robots since they cannot carry massive sensors. In this manner, they should benefit from the small size and low-cost sensors, such as IMU, to solve the odometry problem, and industries always look for such solutions. However, IMU suffers from bias and measurement noise, which makes the problem of position and orientation estimation challenging to be solved by a single IMU. While there are numerous studies on the fusion of IMU with other sensors, this study illustrates the power of the first deep learning framework for estimating the full 3D orientation of the flying robots (as yaw, pitch, and roll in quaternion coordinates) accurately with the presence of a single IMU. A particular IMU should be utilized during the training and testing of the proposed system. Besides, a method based on the Genetic Algorithm is introduced to measure the IMU bias in each execution. The results show that the proposed method improved the flying robots' ability to estimate their orientation displacement by approximately 80% with the presence of a single particular IMU. The proposed approach also outperforms existing solutions that utilize a monocular camera and IMU simultaneously by approximately 30%.

AB Airborne measurements of volcanic gas composition using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Cessna aircraft were conducted at Kuchinoerabujima volcano, Japan, between 2014 and 2016. Because eruptions occurred in August 2014, May 2015, and June 2015, access to the summit crater was limited because of the risk of sudden eruption such that airborne measurements were the only viable method to measure the volcanic gas composition. Multi-GAS and alkali-filter pack measurements were made on the leeward side of the crater and around the crater, using the Cessna and UAV, respectively. Observations using the UAV could measure the dense plume and quantify the gas species of H2O, CO2, SO2, H2S, H-2, HCl, and HF, while the observations using the Cessna could measure only the diluted plume and quantify CO2, SO2, H2S, and H-2. The seven airborne observations enabled us to monitor variations in the volcanic gas composition. Over the observation period, the SO2/H2S ratio decreased from 10 to 1.9. The H2O/SO2 ratio, H-2/SO2 ratio, and apparent equilibrium temperatures (AET) estimated using the volcanic gas composition increased after the 2014 eruption. The decrease in the SO2/H2S ratio might be attributed to changes in the pressure of degassing magma and interactions with the hydrothermal system. The airborne methods presented here highlight the utility of using light aircrafts to safely conduct volcanic gas measurements during periods of volcanic unrest when traditional ground-based methods are not possible.

AB The network real-time kinematic (RTK) technique can provide centimeter-level real time positioning solutions and play a key role in geo-spatial infrastructure. With ever-increasing popularity, network RTK systems will face issues in the support of large numbers of concurrent users. In the past, high-precision positioning services were oriented towards professionals and only supported a few concurrent users. Currently, precise positioning provides a spatial foundation for artificial intelligence (AI), and countless smart devices (autonomous cars, unmanned aerial-vehicles (UAVs), robotic equipment, etc.) require precise positioning services. Therefore, the development of approaches to support large-scale network RTK systems is urgent. In this study, we proposed a self-organizing spatial clustering (SOSC) approach which automatically clusters online users to reduce the computational load on the network RTK system server side. The experimental results indicate that both the SOSC algorithm and the grid algorithm can reduce the computational load efficiently, while the SOSC algorithm gives a more elastic and adaptive clustering solution with different datasets. The SOSC algorithm determines the cluster number and the mean distance to cluster center (MDTCC) according to the data set, while the grid approaches are all predefined. The side-effects of clustering algorithms on the user side are analyzed with real global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data sets. The experimental results indicate that 10 km can be safely used as the cluster radius threshold for the SOSC algorithm without significantly reducing the positioning precision and reliability on the user side.

AB The rapid development of information and communication technologies (ICT) has been argued to affect time use patterns in a variety of ways, with consequent impacts on travel behaviour. While there exists a significant body of empirical studies documenting these effects, theoretical developments have lagged this empirical work and in particular, microeconomic time allocation models have not to date been fully extended to accommodate the implications of an increasingly digitised society. To address this gap, we present a modelling framework, grounded in time allocation theories and the goods-leisure framework, for joint Modelling of the choice of mode of activity (physical versus tele-activity), travel mode and route, and ICT bundle. By providing the expression for a conditional indirect utility function, we use hypothetical scenarios to demonstrate how our framework can conceptualise various activity-travel decision situations. In our scenarios we assume a variety of situations such as the implications of severe weather, the introduction of autonomous vehicles, and the interaction between multiple decision makers. Moreover, our approach lays the microeconomic foundations for deriving subjective values of ICT qualities such as broadband speed or connection reliability. Finally, we also demonstrate the means by which our framework could be linked to various data collection protocols (stated preference exercises, diaries of social interactions, laboratory experiments) and modelling approaches (discrete choice modelling, hazard-based duration models).

AB In the challenging environment, a reliable and autonomous navigation is the key performance factor for robotics. This paper presents a bio-inspired multi-sensor navigation system with the skylight compass and visual place recognition for the UAVs in the GNSS-denied environment. The system can integrate the position and heading constraints outputs from a skylight polarized sensor, a micro-inertia sensor and a monocular camera. An optimal orientation algorithm is proposed with the skylight polarized patterns for obtaining the heading constraint. We also propose a two-dimensional visual place recognition for providing the position constraint in the aerial environment and the metric encoding pattern and place recognition are presented in detail. Based on the position and heading constraints, a biologically multi-sensor integrating system with Kalman Filter has been developed to accurately estimate the motion information for UAVs. Unlike previous approaches having a fragile navigation scheme and path-error accumulation, our system can build a bionic and robust association between the motion metric information and the sensor inputs, and use reliable position and heading constraints for improving the navigation performance. The flying experiments have demonstrated that the proposed bio-inspired navigation system can outperform other vision-based navigation algorithms and the position errors are convergent and do not grow with the flying distance, in which the best performance of position precision is within 5m. Finally, we present interesting insights gained with respect to further work in robotics.

AB Handing uncertain information is one of the research focuses currently. For the sake of great ability of handing uncertain information, Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (D-S theory) has been widely used in various fields of uncertain information processing. However, when highly contradictory evidence appears, the results of the classical Dempster combination rules (DCR) can be counterintuitive. Aiming at this defect, by considering the relationship between the evidence and its own characteristics, the proposed method is a new method of conflicting evidence management based on non-extensive entropy and Lance distance in uncertain scenarios. Firstly, the Lance distance function is used to measure the degree of discrepancy and conflict between evidences, and the credibility of evidence is expressed by matrix. Introducing non-extensive entropy to measure the amount of information about evidence and express the uncertainty of evidence. Secondly, the discount coefficient of the final fusion evidence is measured by considering the credibility and uncertainty of the evidence, and the original evidence is modified by the discount coefficient. Then, the final result is obtained by evidence fusion with DCR. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method, and the utility of our work is demonstrated through an application of the active lane change to avoid obstacles to the autonomous driving of new energy vehicles. The proposed method has a better identification accuracy, reaching 0.9811.

   multi-scale feature enhancement
AB Nowadays, object detection methods based on deep neural networks have been widely applied in autonomous driving and intelligent robot systems. However, weakly perceived objects with a small size in the complex scenes own too few features to be detected, resulting in the decrease of the detection accuracy. To improve the performance of the detection model in complex scenes, the detector of an improved CenterNet was developed via this work to enhance the feature representation of weakly perceived objects. Specifically, we replace the ResNet50 with ResNext50 as the backbone network to enhance the ability of feature extraction of the model. Then, we append the lateral connection structure and the dilated convolution to improve the feature enhancement layer of the CenterNet, leading to enriched features and enlarged receptive fields for the weakly sensed objects. Finally, we apply the attention mechanism in the detection head of the network to enhance the key information of the weakly perceived objects. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we evaluate the proposed model on the KITTI dataset and COCO dataset. Compared with the original model, the average precision of multiple categories of the improved CenterNet for the vehicles and pedestrians in the KITTI dataset increased by 5.37%, whereas the average precision of weakly perceived pedestrians increased by 9.30%. Moreover, the average precision of small objects (AP_S) of the weakly perceived small objects in the COCO dataset increase 7.4%. Experiments show that the improved CenterNet can significantly improve the average detection precision for weakly perceived objects.

AB Each day, motile pelagic organisms of all sizes undergo vertical movements tied to sunset and sunrise. Diel migration of animals is thought to result from the competing need to feed in energy rich surface waters while avoiding visual predators. Previous study using a newly adapted autonomous vehicle to measure individual characteristics in scattering layers provided the first measures of the internal layer structure, demonstrating that deep scattering layers can be made up of many topologically scaled, mono-specific aggregations, or "schools." Follow-up measurements presented here show these schools of mesopelagic animals remain coherent during upward migration at dusk. We found that groups of smaller animals began migrating sooner each night than larger individuals, consistent with their relatively lower detectability by visual predators. We also found a correlation with taxonomic differences in swimming capabilities, suggesting that the ability to avoid predators if they are encountered also plays a role in the patterns of migration observed. The presence of acoustic predators, Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus), however, altered this pattern for their primary prey, causing squid to remain at depth for approximately 40min longer than others. The risk of predation by this air-breathing predator decreases with depth, making delaying migration an appropriate response to this largely nonvisual predation risk. Understanding the timing of individual migration patterns provides insights into the bioenergetic and predator-prey processes in the mesopelagic zone that are critical for understanding the ecological and biogeochemical impacts of these high biomass layers in the ocean.

AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are quickly becoming an attractive solution for autonomous vehicles, military weapons, and space exploration. Thanks to their reconfiguration ability, design flexibility, and low power consumption, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have become a promising candidate for CNN accelerators. However, FPGAs have been proven to be susceptible to radiation-induced single-event upsets (SEUs). One goal of this article is to analyze the impact of quantization on the reliability of CNNs in FPGAs. Therefore, we performed quantization on ZynqNet without affecting its classification accuracy. Meanwhile, we implemented the triple modular redundancy (TMR) version of ZynqNet and we also evaluated the effects of SEUs on these CNNs through both fault injections and neutron exposures. Fault injection results show that TMRed ZynqNet reduces the soft error rate (SER) by 33.59% with a circuit area increase of 111.92% when compared with the standard ZynqNet. The experimental results demonstrate that the quantized ZynqNet reduces the SER by 71.36% with a circuit area reduction of 44.76% when compared with the standard ZynqNet. These results confirm that quantization does contribute to SER reduction of the neural networks. In addition, the operating system on the processing system (PS) side was also found to be highly sensitive to SEUs, and, thus, mitigation techniques should be applied.

AB The 5G heterogeneous networks (HetNets) are capable of providing real-time computing services for autonomous vehicles (AVs) by deploying edge computing devices (ECDs) at macro cell base stations (MCBSs) and small cell base stations (SCBSs). With the imbalanced distribution and fast moving AVs contending intensely for computing services, how to efficiently exploit cooperations among participants in 5G HetNets to improve the service performance is therefore challenging. In this paper, we develop a game theoretic scheme for collaborative vehicular task offloading to facilitate the computing services in 5G HetNets. Specifically, we propose a two-stage vehicular task offloading mechanism to promote the cooperation among participants with the target of improving the task completion rate and the utilities of the participants, where the mechanism jointly considers the network architecture of the HetNets, the imbalanced distribution of AVs and the reuse of task results. In the first stage, an auction model is designed to help the MCBS select the optimal SCBS to execute the offloaded task based on the requirement of the task and the available computing resources of SCBSs. According to the task execution cost declared by the selected SCBS, the MCBS then bargains with the AV for the agreement of the task offloading service to maximize their utilities in the second stage. Using simulations, we show that the proposed collaborative task offloading scheme can achieve a higher task completion rate for the task offloading service and bring higher utilities to all participants than conventional schemes.

AB The article presents the idea of modeling the decision-making process in the field of the metropolitan areas transport system. Due to the increasing process of metropolization and urbanization, which is predicted to be 68.4% worldwide and 83.7% in Europe in 2050, the issue will be even more sophisticated. The problem of depletion of transport network capacity as well as the implementation of modern technology solutions forces metropolitan committees to apply tools for metropolitan passenger transport system optimization. Significantly, the policy and regulations on sustainable urban mobility management are based on the mobility demand predictions and understanding of the travel decision-making process of citizens. The scientific purpose of this article is to build a mathematical model, as a tool supporting the multi-criteria decision-making process regarding the choice of means of transport in a developing metropolis. The issue raised in this article considers the most important research areas of the metropolitan transport means selection, which includes transport safety, qualitative, financial, and ecological aspects. The model was implemented in Silesian Metropolis in Poland with a particular emphasis on sharing mobility transport means users. As a result, a ranking of sharing transport means was developed, which is a piece of significant information for planners and future investors in the development of the metropolitan transport system.

ID DATA AGGREGATION
AB Security is an indispensable part of smart grid (SG). Key establishment protocols play a vital role in fulfilling the security requirements in SG. In recent years, many key establishment schemes have been proposed for SG. However, only three of them offer the strong smart meter anonymity. In 2015, Tsai and Lo presented an anonymous key establishment scheme to be employed in SG. Recently, Odelu et al. have demonstrated that Tsai and Lo's scheme suffers from the ephemeral secret leakage attack. Furthermore, another scheme has been proposed recently by He et al. that has improved the efficiency of Tsai and Lo's scheme. However, besides its merits, we indicate that He et al.'s scheme suffers from both known session-specific temporary information attack and private key leakage. Additionally, these three anonymous schemes have the key escrow problem since the trusted anchor is aware of entities' private key. Hence, to cover the existing issues, in this paper we propose a key establishment scheme that not only is free from the security challenges of the previous anonymous schemes and key escrow problem, but also is efficient in terms of both computational and communication costs. Finally, yet importantly, we present the performance analysis of our proposed scheme on a state-of-the-art advanced RISC machine (ARM) chip, namely NXP LPC1788, as a suitable hardware for the smart meters.

AB Surface ocean wind datasets are required to be of high spatial and temporal resolution and high precision to accurately force or be assimilated into coupled atmosphere-ocean numerical models and to understand ocean-atmospheric processes. In situ observed sea surface winds from the Southern Ocean are scarce and, consequently, the validity of simulation models is often questionable. Multiple wind data products were compared to the first known high-resolution in situ measurements of wind speed from Wave Glider (WG) deployments in the Southern Ocean with the intent to determine which blended satellite or reanalysis product best represents the magnitude and variability of the observed wind field. Results show that the ECMWF reanalysis product is the most accurate in representing the temporal variability of winds, exhibiting consistently higher correlation coefficients with in situ data across all wind speed categories. However, the NCEP-DOE AMIP-II Reanalysis product matches in situ trends of deviation from the mean and performs best in depicting the mean wind state, especially during high wind states. The ECMWF product also leads to smaller differences in wind speeds from the in situ data, while CFSv2 showed slightly higher biases and a greater RMSE. The SeaWinds (SW) product consistently performed poorly at representing the mean or wind stress variability compared to those observed by the WG. Overall, the study shows autonomous surface vehicles provide valuable observations by which to validate, understand, and potentially assist in correcting satellite/reanalysis products, particularly in remote regions, where few in situ estimates exist.

AB The 3-D LiDAR scanner and the 2-D chargecoupled device (CCD) camera are two typical types of sensors for surrounding-environment perceiving in robotics or autonomous driving. Commonly, they are jointly used to improve perception accuracy by simultaneously recording the distances of surrounding objects, as well as the color and shape information. In this paper, we use the correspondence between a 3-D LiDAR scanner and a CCD camera to rearrange the captured LiDAR point cloud into a dense depth map, in which each 3-D point corresponds to a pixel at the same location in the RGB image. In this paper, we assume that the LiDAR scanner and the CCD camera are accurately calibrated and synchronized beforehand so that each 3-D LiDAR point cloud is aligned with its corresponding RGB image. Each frame of the LiDAR point cloud is then projected onto the RGB image plane to form a sparse depth map. Then, a self-adaptive method is proposed to upsample the sparse depth map into a dense depth map, in which the RGB image and the anisotropic diffusion tensor are exploited to guide upsampling by reinforcing the RGB-depth compactness. Finally, convex optimization is applied on the dense depth map for global enhancement. Experiments on the KITTI and Middlebury data sets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several other relevant state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual comparison and root-mean- square error measurement.

AB Large ports are seeking innovative logistical ways to improve their competitiveness worldwide. This article proposes waterborne AGVs, inspired by conventional automated guided vehicles and autonomous surface vessels, for transport over water. A predictive path following with arrival time awareness controller is proposed for such waterborne AGVs. The controller is able to achieve smooth tracking and energy efficiency with arrival time awareness for transport oriented applications. Tracking errors are conveniently formulated with vessel dynamics modeled in connected reference path coordinate systems and a coordinate transformation at switching coordinate systems. Binary decision variables and logic constraints based on an along-track state are proposed for modeling switches in the framework of Model Predictive Control (MPC) so that overshoots are avoided. Moreover, timing aware along-track references are generated by a two-level double integrator scheme. The lower level is embedded in online MPC optimizations for smooth tracking. The higher level solves a mixed-integer quadratic programming problem considering distance-to-go and time-to-go before each MPC optimization. References over the next prediction horizon are generated being aware of the requirements on arrival time. Furthermore, successive linearizations of nonlinear vessel dynamics about a shifted previous optimal system trajectory are implemented to maintain a trade-off between computational complexity and optimality. Simulation results of two industrially relevant Inter Terminal Transport case studies illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and control design for waterborne AGVs.

AB Chlorophyll concentration, phytoplankton biomass, and total and nitrate-fueled primary productivity increase toward the coast over the 12-km-wide continental shelf of the southern portion of the Southern California Bight. These gradients are accompanied by changes in phytoplankton community composition: the outer shelf is characterized by offshore assemblages including pelagophytes and oligotrophic Synechococcus ecotypes while the inner shelf is dominated by diatoms, coastal Synechococcus ecotypes, and the picoeukaryote Ostreococcus. Across the small horizontal scale of the shelf, large changes in the vertical distribution and flux of nitrate maintain elevated productivity, driving variability in the vertical distribution of biomass and the integrated biomass and productivity of the entire shelf. Temporal variability from hours to days in chlorophyll fluorescence as measured by an autonomous profiling vehicle demonstrates that phytoplankton respond vigorously and rapidly to physical variability. The interaction of physical processes at different temporal and spatial scales is responsible for the observed biological gradients. These dynamics include: (1) vertical shear in the alongshore currents, (2) local wind forcing, (3) the internal tide, and (4) remote, large-scale variability. Individually, these mechanisms rarely or never explain the phytoplankton community composition and metabolic rate gradients. These results and a reanalysis of historical data suggest that monitoring thermal stratification at the shelf break and the tilt of the thermocline across the shelf will augment our ability to predict phytoplankton productivity, community composition, and biomass, thereby improving our understanding of fisheries dynamics and carbon cycling in the coastal ocean.

ID MODEL
AB Compression ignition engine technologies have been advanced in the past decade to provide superior fuel economy and high performance. These technologies offer increased opportunities for optimizing engine calibration. Current engine calibration methods rely on deriving static tabular relationships between a set of steady-state operating points and the corresponding values of the controllable variables. While the engine is running, these values are being interpolated for each engine operating point to coordinate optimal performance criteria, e.g., fuel economy, emissions, and acceleration. These methods, however, are not efficient in capturing transient engine operation designated by common driving habits, e.g., stop-and-go driving, rapid acceleration, and braking. An alternative approach was developed recently, which makes the engine an autonomous intelligent system, namely, one capable of learning its optimal calibration for both steady-state and transient operating points in real time. Through this approach, while the engine is running the vehicle, it progressively perceives the driver's driving style and eventually learns to operate in a manner that optimizes specified performance criteria. The major challenge to this approach is problem dimensionality when more than one controllable variable is considered. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a decentralized learning control scheme. The scheme is evaluated through simulation of a diesel engine model, which learns the values of injection timing and variable geometry turbocharging vane position that optimize fuel economy and pollutant emissions over a segment of the FTP-75 driving cycle.

AB Video description refers to understanding visual content and transforming that acquired understanding into automatic textual narration. It bridges the key AI fields of computer vision and natural language processing in conjunction with real-time and practical applications. Deep learning-based approaches employed for video description have demonstrated enhanced results compared to conventional approaches. The current literature lacks a thorough interpretation of the recently developed and employed sequence to sequence techniques for video description. This paper fills that gap by focusing mainly on deep learning-enabled approaches to automatic caption generation. Sequence to sequence models follow an Encoder-Decoder architecture employing a specific composition of CNN, RNN, or the variants LSTM or GRU as an encoder and decoder block. This standard-architecture can be fused with an attention mechanism to focus on a specific distinctiveness, achieving high quality results. Reinforcement learning employed within the Encoder-Decoder structure can progressively deliver state-of-the-art captions by following exploration and exploitation strategies. The transformer mechanism is a modern and efficient transductive architecture for robust output. Free from recurrence, and solely based on self-attention, it allows parallelization along with training on a massive amount of data. It can fully utilize the available GPUs for most NLP tasks. Recently, with the emergence of several versions of transformers, long term dependency handling is not an issue anymore for researchers engaged in video processing for summarization and description, or for autonomous-vehicle, surveillance, and instructional purposes. They can get auspicious directions from this research.

AB The sea surface temperature (SST) is one of the essential parameters needed to understand the climate change in the Arctic. Saildrone, an advanced autonomous surface vehicle, has proven to be a useful tool for providing accurate SST data at high latitudes. Here, data from two Saildrones, deployed in the Arctic in the summer of 2019, are used to investigate the diurnal variability of upper ocean thermal structure. An empirical cool skin effect model with dependence on the wind speed with new coefficients was generated. Several local large diurnal warming events were observed, the amplitudes of warming in the skin layer >5 K, rarely reported in previous studies. Furthermore, the warming signals could persist beyond 1 day. For those cases, it was found surface warm air suppressed the surface turbulent heat loss to maintain the persistence of diurnal warming under low wind conditions. Salinity also plays an important role in the formation of upper ocean density stratification during diurnal warming at high latitudes. A less salty and hence less dense surface layer was likely created by precipitation or melting sea ice, providing favorable conditions for the formation of upper ocean stratification. Comparisons with two prognostic diurnal warming models showed the simulations match reasonably well with Saildrone measurements for moderate wind speeds but exhibit large differences at low winds. Both schemes show significant negative biases in the early morning and late afternoon. It is necessary to improve the model schemes when applied at high latitudes.

AB Binocular vision and neural networks (CNNs) are widely seen in modern intelligent vision processing systems, such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and AR gadgets. However, both the classic semiglobal matching (SGM) and deep CNNs entail substantial computing resource to reach the performance goal. Traditional embedded CPU/graphic processor unit (GPU) cannot simultaneously meet the processing speed and energy requirement, while the specialized circuits dedicated to SGM and CNN processing, respectively, will take considerable hardware and development costs. However, as the popularity of deep learning, neural processing units (NPUs) become prevalent in many embedded and edge devices, which possess high throughput computing power to deal with the matrix operations involved by neural networks. In this work, we attempt to take advantage of the neural processing architectures integrated in SoC chips to accelerate the SGM process, so that the hardware resources will be better utilized instead of investing more resources to create specialized SGM components. Thereby, this letter first deploys SGM on NPU by converting the incompatible operations into the neural-computing flow, and a configurable neural processing element is proposed to flexibly support various vector operation sequences. Then, a hybrid dataflow scheduler and the corresponding hardware modification are introduced to accelerate the cost processing, improving hardware utilization and on-chip memory footprint and access. Our solution runs at 45 fps for an image size of $640\times 480$ , with 128 disparity levels. The speed-energy efficiency is $52\times $ better than the GPU (Jetson TX1) solution with negligible additional hardware overhead and accuracy loss.

AB The discovery of non-chromosomal circular DNA offers new directions in linking genome structure with function in plant biology. Glyphosate resistance through EPSPS gene copy amplification in Palmer amaranth was due to an autonomously replicating extra-chromosomal circular DNA mechanism (eccDNA). CIDER-Seq analysis of geographically distant glyphosate sensitive (GS) and resistant (GR) Palmer Amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) revealed the presence of numerous small extra-chromosomal circular DNAs varying in size and with degrees of repetitive content, coding sequence, and motifs associated with autonomous replication. In GS biotypes, only a small portion of these aligned to the 399 kb eccDNA replicon, the vehicle underlying gene amplification and genetic resistance to the herbicide glyphosate. The aligned eccDNAs from GS were separated from one another by large gaps in sequence. In GR biotypes, the eccDNAs were present in both abundance and diversity to assemble into a nearly complete eccDNA replicon. Mean sizes of eccDNAs were similar in both biotypes and were around 5kb with larger eccDNAs near 25kb. Gene content for eccDNAs ranged from 0 to 3 with functions that include ribosomal proteins, transport, metabolism, and general stress response genetic elements. Repeat content among smaller eccDNAs indicate a potential for recombination into larger structures. Genomic hotspots were also identified in the Palmer amaranth genome with a disposition for gene focal amplifications as eccDNA. The presence of eccDNA may serve as a reservoir of genetic heterogeneity in this species and may be functionally important for survival.

AB Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology is an active remote-sensing system used in autonomous vehicles, machine vision and augmented reality. Improvements in the speed and signal-to-noise ratio of photodetectors are needed to meet these demanding ranging applications. Silicon electronics have been the principal option for LiDAR photodetectors in the range of 850-950 nm. However, its indirect bandgap leads to a low absorption coefficient in the near-infrared region, as well as a consequent trade-off between speed and efficiency. Here we report solution-processed lead-tin binary perovskite photodetectors that have an external quantum efficiency of 85% at 850 nm, dark current below 10(-8) A cm(-2) and response time faster than 100 ps. The devices are fabricated using self-limiting and self-reduced tin precursors that enable perovskite crystallization at the desired stoichiometry and prevent the formation of interfacial defects with the hole transport layer. The approach removes oxygen from the solution, converts Sn4+ to Sn2+ through comproportionation, and leaves neither metallic tin nor SnOx residues. To illustrate the potential of these solution-processed perovskite photodetectors in LiDAR, we show that they can resolve sub-millimetre distances with a typical 50 mu m standard deviation.

TI Towards a Weakly Supervised Framework for 3D Point Cloud Object
   Detection and Annotation

AB It is quite laborious and costly to manually label LiDAR point cloud data for training high-quality 3D object detectors. This work proposes a weakly supervised framework which allows learning 3D detection from a few weakly annotated examples. This is achieved by a two-stage architecture design. Stage-1 learns to generate cylindrical object proposals under inaccurate and inexact supervision, obtained by our proposed BEV center-click annotation strategy, where only the horizontal object centers are click-annotated in bird's view scenes. Stage-2 learns to predict cuboids and confidence scores in a coarse-to-fine, cascade manner, under incomplete supervision, i.e., only a small portion of object cuboids are precisely annotated. With KITTI dataset, using only 500 weakly annotated scenes and 534 precisely labeled vehicle instances, our method achieves 86 - 97 percent the performance of current topleading, fully supervised detectors (which require 3,712 exhaustively annotated scenes with 15,654 instances). More importantly, with our elaborately designed network architecture, our trained model can be applied as a 3D object annotator, supporting both automatic and active (human-in-the-loop) working modes. The annotations generated by our model can be used to train 3D object detectors, achieving over 95 percent of their original performance (with manually labeled training data). Our experiments also show our model's potential in boosting performance when given more training data. The above designs make our approach highly practical and open-up opportunities for learning 3D detection at reduced annotation cost.
