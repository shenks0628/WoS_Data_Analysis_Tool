AB Obstacle avoidance is an important and challenging task for the autonomous flight of unmanned aerial vehicles. Obstacle regions extraction from image sequences is a critical prerequisite in obstacle avoidance. We propose an obstacle regions extraction method based on space-time tensor descriptor. In our method, first, the space-time tensor descriptor is defined and a criterion function based on the descriptor of extracting space-time interest points (STIPs) is designed. Then a self-adaptive clustering of STIPs approach is presented to locate the possible obstacle regions. Finally, an improved level set algorithm is applied with the result of clustering to extract the obstacle regions. We demonstrate the experiments of obstacle regions extraction by our method on image sequences. Sequences are captured in indoor simulative obstacle avoidance environments and outdoor real flight obstacle avoidance environments. Experimental results validate that our method can effectively complete extraction and segmentation of obstacle region with captured images. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method performs well to extract the contours of obstacle regions on the whole and significantly improves segmentation speed. (C) 2016 SPIE and IS&T

AB The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in commercial and warfare activities has intensified over the last decade. One of the main challenges is to enable UAVs to become as autonomous as possible. A vital component toward this direction is the robust and accurate estimation of the egomotion of the UAV. Egomotion estimation can be enhanced by equipping the UAV with a video camera, which enables a vision-based egomotion estimation. However, the high computational requirements of vision-based egomotion algorithms, combined with the real-time performance and low power consumption requirements that are related to such an application, cannot be met by general-purpose processing units. This paper presents a system architecture that employs a field-programmable gate array as the main processing platform connected to a low-power CPU that targets the problem of vision-based egomotion estimation in a UAV. The performance evaluation of the proposed system, using real data captured by a UAV's on-board camera, demonstrates the ability of the system to render accurate estimation of the egomotion parameters, meeting at the same time the real-time requirements imposed by the application.

TI Optimizing Constrained Search Patterns for Remote Mine-Hunting Vehicles

DT Article
DE Mine countermeasures; path optimization; route planning; traveling

AB When conducting remote mine-hunting operations with a sidescan-sonar-equipped vehicle, a lawn-mowing search pattern is standard if no prior information on potential target locations is available. Upon completion of this initial search, a list of contacts is obtained. The overall classification performance can be significantly improved by revisiting these contacts to collect additional looks. This paper provides, for the first time, a link between the recent literature which finds optimal secondary looks and optimal route planning software. Automated planning algorithms are needed to generate multiaspect routes to improve the performance of mine-hunting systems and increase the capability of navies to efficiently clear potential mine fields. This paper introduces two new numerical techniques designed to enable current remote mine-hunting systems to achieve secondary paths minimizing the total distance to be traveled and satisfying all motion and imaging constraints. The first "local" approach is based on a sequential algorithm dealing with more tractable subproblems, while the second is "global" and based on simulated annealing. These numerical techniques are applied to two test sites created for the Mongoose sea trial held at the 2007 Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Fest, Panama City, FL. Highly satisfactory planning solutions are obtained.

ID MUTUAL INFORMATION
AB Several datasets exist which contain annotated information of individuals' trajectories. Such datasets are vital for many real-world applications, including trajectory prediction and autonomous navigation. One prominent dataset currently in use is the Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD) (Robicquet et al., 2016). Despite its prominence, discussion surrounding the characteristics of this dataset is insufficient. We demonstrate how this insufficiency reduces the information available to users and can impact performance. Our contributions include the outlining of key characteristics in the SDD, employment of an information-theoretic measure and custom metric to clearly visualize those characteristics, the implementation of the PECNet (Mangalam et al., 2020) and Y-Net (Mangalam et al., 2021) trajectory prediction models to demonstrate the outlined characteristics' impact on predictive performance, and lastly we provide a comparison between the SDD and Intersection Drone (inD) Dataset. Our analysis of the SDD's key characteristics is important because without adequate information about available datasets a user's ability to select the most suitable dataset for their methods, to reproduce one another's results, and to interpret their own results are hindered. The observations we make through this analysis provide a readily accessible and interpretable source of information for those planning to use the SDD. Our intention is to increase the performance and reproducibility of methods applied to this dataset going forward, while also clearly detailing less obvious features of the dataset for new users.

AB This work is an extension of a study by Li et al. (2021) in which a two-echelon network consisting of multiple depots and a fleet of Autonomous Mobile Lockers (AMLs) co-operating with couriers was examined to address the simultaneous pickup and delivery problem. This work considers the same problem but allows couriers and robots to traverse open routes. Most importantly, couriers can perform multiple missions, allowing them to restart a new mission from any stop. In order to formulate this problem, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model was introduced with the aim of minimizing the total cost. Since the MILP model is not able to solve large-scale problems, an Adaptive Backtracking-Simulated Annealing metaheuristic (ABSM) algorithm was developed whose efficiency was analysed using numerical experimentation. The results show that the ABSM algorithm introduced is able to provide quality solutions within a reasonable amount of time. Also, the proposed algorithm was compared with three variants of the simultaneous pickup and delivery problem and the amount of savings was calculated. Finally, the significant problem parameters were identified and their impact on the value of the objective function was investigated. The results show that significant savings can be achieved when couriers are able to perform multiple open routes in a cooperative system of AMLs and couriers.

AB Deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have exhibited remarkable performance in solving vision-related problems, especially in unpredictable, dynamic, and challenging environments. In autonomous vehicles, imitation-learning-based steering angle prediction is viable due to the visual imagery comprehension of CNNs. In this regard, globally, researchers are currently focusing on the architectural design and optimization of the hyperparameters of CNNs to achieve the best results. Literature has proven the superiority of metaheuristic algorithms over the manual-tuning of CNNs. However, to the best of our knowledge, these techniques are yet to be applied to address the problem of imitation-learning-based steering angle prediction. Thus, in this study, we examine the application of the bat algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm for the optimization of the CNN model and its hyperparameters, which are employed to solve the steering angle prediction problem. To validate the performance of each hyperparameters' set and architectural parameters' set, we utilized the Udacity steering angle dataset and obtained the best results at the following hyperparameter set: optimizer, Adagrad; learning rate, 0.0052; and nonlinear activation function, exponential linear unit. As per our findings, we determined that the deep learning models show better results but require more training epochs and time as compared to shallower ones. Results show the superiority of our approach in optimizing CNNs through metaheuristic algorithms as compared with the manual-tuning approach. Infield testing was also performed using the model trained with the optimal architecture, which we developed using our approach.

AB This study aims to solve the problems of poor exploration ability, single strategy, and high training cost in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) motion planning tasks and to overcome certain difficulties, such as multiple constraints and a sparse reward environment. In this research, an end-to-end motion planning system based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed to solve the motion planning problem of an underactuated AUV. The system directly maps the state information of the AUV and the environment into the control instructions of the AUV. The system is based on the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, which enhances the exploration ability and robustness to the AUV environment. We also use the method of generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) to assist its training to overcome the problem that learning a policy for the first time is difficult and time-consuming in reinforcement learning. A comprehensive external reward function is then designed to help the AUV smoothly reach the target point, and the distance and time are optimized as much as possible. Finally, the end-to-end motion planning algorithm proposed in this research is tested and compared on the basis of the Unity simulation platform. Results show that the algorithm has an optimal decision-making ability during navigation, a shorter route, less time consumption, and a smoother trajectory. Moreover, GAIL can speed up the AUV training speed and minimize the training time without affecting the planning effect of the SAC algorithm.

AB We used an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to survey bathymetry and water mass properties at Glover's Reef atoll in Belize as part of a multidisciplinary study of population connectivity of Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus). Nassau grouper populations are declining dramatically throughout its range in the Caribbean because of overfishing. In response, Marine Protected Areas have been established at several spawning aggregation (SPAG) sites. However, effectiveness of these measures is presently unclear, as the regional patterns of transport and recruitment of grouper larvae have not been measured in extensive field studies. As part of a pilot study to relate oceanographic processes with transport and recruitment of Nassau grouper larvae, we used a Remote Environmental Monitoring Unit(S) (REMUS) AUV to measure the bathymetry, stratification, current velocity, and chlorophyll a fluorescence around Glover's Reef. The portability of the REMUS system enabled comprehensive oceanographic data collection in a remote location with minimal infrastructure. Using REMUS, we were able to effectively map the bathymetry of the reef and the shelfbreak. These data were merged with historical bathymetric data to develop a new chart of the atoll margin. A distinct contrast in the width of the shelves on the eastern and western sides of the atoll was demonstrated, with the widest shelf coinciding with the SPAG site. Water mass structure in the vicinity of SPAG site was also markedly different from other locations on the reef, suggesting an offshore advective influence on eggs and early-stage larvae released there.

AB Aiming at the problem of vehicle model tracking error and overdependence in traditional path planning of intelligent driving vehicles, a path planning method of intelligent driving vehicles based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed. Firstly, the abstract model of real environment is extracted. The model uses deep reinforcement learning end-to-end strategy (DRL-ETE) and vehicle dynamics model to train the reinforcement learning model which approaches the optimal intelligent driving. Secondly, the real scene problem is transferred to the virtual abstract model through the model transfer strategy, and the control and trajectory sequences are calculated according to the trained deep reinforcement learning model in the environment. Finally, the optimal trajectory sequence is selected according to the evaluation function in real environment. Because the storage mode of experience playback mechanism of Deep Q-Network algorithm is FIFO, and the sampling mode of later playback training is average sampling, the efficiency of experience playback is low. These two problems lead to the slow process of intelligent driving vehicle to target and route finding. And because of greedy strategy, the information of exploration map is incomplete, and IDQNPER algorithm model is proposed. When storing samples, the samples are given weight, and sent to the network in priority order for sample training. Meanwhile, the importance data sequence is retained in the experience playback cache area, and the sequence with high similarity is removed. The total reward value is about 10% higher than the reward value of original Deep Q-network, which proves that the accuracy of intelligent driving vehicles tends to target points is higher. In order to further realize the autonomous decision-making of intelligent driving vehicles and solve the problem of relying too much on map information in the traditional human planning framework, an end-to-end path planning method is proposed based on the depth reinforcement learning theory, which maps the action instructions directly from the sensor information and then issues them to the intelligent driving vehicles. Firstly, CNN and LSTM are used to process radar and camera information. By comparing the advantages of DQ, Double DQN, Dueling DQN and PER algorithm, IDQNPER algorithm is used to train the automatic path planning of intelligent driving vehicles. Finally, the simulation and verification experiments are carried out in the static obstacle environment. The test results show that IDQNPER algorithm is adaptable to intelligent vehicles in different environments. The method can deal with the continuous input state and generate the continuous control sequence of the corner control, which can reduce the lateral tracking error. At the same time, the generalization performance of the model can be improved and the overdependence problem can be reduced by experience playback.

AB 3D object detection is a common function within the perception system of an autonomous vehicle and outputs a list of 3D bounding boxes around objects of interest. Various 3D object detection methods have relied on fusion of different sensor modalities to overcome limitations of individual sensors. However, occlusion, limited field-of-view and low-point density of the sensor data cannot be reliably and cost-effectively addressed by multi-modal sensing from a single point of view. Alternatively, cooperative perception incorporates information from spatially diverse sensors distributed around the environment as a way to mitigate these limitations. This article proposes two schemes for cooperative 3D object detection using single modality sensors. The early fusion scheme combines point clouds from multiple spatially diverse sensing points of view before detection. In contrast, the late fusion scheme fuses the independently detected bounding boxes from multiple spatially diverse sensors. We evaluate the performance of both schemes, and their hybrid combination, using a synthetic cooperative dataset created in two complex driving scenarios, a T-junction and a roundabout. The evaluation shows that the early fusion approach outperforms late fusion by a significant margin at the cost of higher communication bandwidth. The results demonstrate that cooperative perception can recall more than 95% of the objects as opposed to 30% for single-point sensing in the most challenging scenario. To provide practical insights into the deployment of such system, we report how the number of sensors and their configuration impact the detection performance of the system.

AB In marine research, image data sets from the same area but collected at different times allow seafloor fauna communities to be monitored over time. However, ongoing technological developments have led to the use of different imaging systems and deployment strategies. Thus, instances of the same class exhibit slightly shifted visual features in images taken at slightly different locations or with different gear. These shifts are referred to as concept drift in the domains computational image analysis and machine learning as this phenomenon poses particular challenges for these fields. In this paper, we analyse four different data sets from an area in the Peru Basin and show how changes in imaging parameters affect the classification of 12 megafauna morphotypes with a 34-layer ResNet. Images were captured using the ocean floor observation system, a traditional sled-based system, or an autonomous underwater vehicle, which is used as an imaging platform capable of surveying larger regions. ResNet applied on separate individual data sets, i.e., without concept drift, showed that changing object distance was less important than the amount of training data. The results for the image data acquired with the ocean floor observation system showed higher performance values than data collected with the autonomous underwater vehicle. The results from this concept drift studies indicate that collecting image data from many dives with slightly different gear may result in training data well-suited for learning taxonomic classification tasks and that data volume can compensate for light concept drift.

AB We introduce the combinatorial optimization problem Time Disjoint Walks (TDW), which has applications in collision-free routing of discrete objects (e.g., autonomous vehicles) over a network. This problem takes as input a digraph G with positive integer arc lengths, and k pairs of vertices that each represent a trip demand from a source to a destination. The goal is to find a walk and delay for each demand so that no two trips occupy the same vertex at the same time, and so that a min-max or min-sum objective over the trip durations is realized. We focus here on the min-sum variant of Time Disjoint Walks, although most of our results carry over to the min-max case. We restrict our study to various subclasses of DAGs, and observe that there is a sharp complexity boundary between Time Disjoint Walks on oriented stars and on oriented stars with the central vertex replaced by a path. In particular, we present a poly-time algorithm for min-sum and min-max TDW on the former, but show that min-sum TDW on the latter is NP-hard. Our main hardness result is that for DAGs with max degree Delta <= 3, min-sum Time Disjoint Walks is APX-hard. We present a natural approximation algorithm for the same class, and provide a tight analysis. In particular, we prove that it achieves an approximation ratio of Theta(k/log k) on bounded-degree DAGs, and Theta(k) on DAGs and bounded-degree digraphs.

AB Penetrative convection in the surface layer of a midsize temperate lake (5 km(2)) was investigated in both summer and winter using a conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) logger mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) flown repeatedly along horizontal transects at selected depths. In summer, the epilimnion cooled differentially during a calm evening (240 and 297 W m(-2) on the east and west sides of the lake, respectively). These cooling rates agree well with the average net heat flux of 270 W m(-2) estimated from meteorological data. Density currents were driven by this differential cooling. In winter, CTD profiles during a sunny day showed four distinct thermal layers beneath the ice (similar to 50 cm thick), consistent with radiative penetrative convection: a stratified diffusive layer just beneath the ice (top 1.6 m); a well-mixed convective layer (that deepens at 1.14 m d(-1) and warms at 0.015 degrees C d(-1) during the observation period); an entrainment layer (1.5 m thick); and a weakly stratified quiescent layer (to bottom). AUV transects, flown at constant depths in each layer, revealed a 150-m wide region displaying evidence of penetrative convection, surrounded by regions with negligible heat changes. These high-resolution, horizontal CTD measurements provided insight into previously unresolved physical dynamics of the well-mixed layer of a temperate lake in quasi-shear-free conditions that would have been difficult to quantify during summer months and impossible under winter ice cover without the use of an AUV platform.

AB The driver's cognitive and physiological states affect his/her ability to control the vehicle. Thus, these driver states are essential to the safety of automobiles. The design of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) or autonomous vehicles will depend on their ability to interact effectively with the driver. A deeper understanding of the driver state is, therefore, paramount. Electroencephalography (EEG) is proven to be one of the most effective methods for driver state monitoring and human error detection. This paper discusses EEG-based driver state detection systems and their corresponding analysis algorithms over the last three decades. First, the commonly used EEG system setup for driver state studies is introduced. Then, the EEG signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms for driver state detection are reviewed. Finally, EEG-based driver state monitoring research is reviewed in-depth, and its future development is discussed. It is concluded that the current EEG-based driver state monitoring algorithms are promising for safety applications. However, many improvements are still required in EEG artifact reduction, real-time processing, and between-subject classification accuracy.

AB Collision-avoidance is a crucial research topic in robotics. Designing a collision-avoidance algorithm is still a challenging and open task, because of the requirements for navigating in unstructured and dynamic environments using limited payload and computing resources on board micro aerial vehicles. This article presents a novel depth-based collision-avoidance method for aerial robots, enabling high-speed flights in dynamic environments. First of all, a depth-based Euclidean distance field mapping algorithm is generated. Then, the proposed Euclidean distance field mapping strategy is integrated with a rapid-exploration random tree to construct a collision-avoidance system. The experimental results show that the proposed collision-avoidance algorithm has a robust performance at high flight speeds in challenging dynamic environments. The experimental results show that the proposed collision-avoidance algorithm can perform faster collision-avoidance maneuvers when compared to the state-of-art algorithms (the average computing time of the collision maneuver is 25.4 ms, while the minimum computing time is 10.4 ms). The average computing time is six times faster than one baseline algorithm. Additionally, fully autonomous flight experiments are also conducted for validating the presented collision-avoidance approach.

AB This article deals with the robust optimal control and identification of uncertain adaptive cruise control systems. Both measurement delay and engine's lag are investigated in system modeling and control design. The control structure consists of two steps. In the first step, by using a new approach, the uncertain parameters of longitudinal dynamics of each vehicle is identified. Afterwards, at the second step, by using the relative position and velocity measurement with respect to ahead vehicle, a robust control against size changing of platoon is presented to assure the internal stability, string stability, and safety of heterogeneous vehicular platoons. A cost function involving important metrics internal stability, maximum overshoot, and settling time is introduced, and the particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to find the optimal values of control parameters minimizing the cost function. It will be shown that the proposed robust controller guarantees the internal stability, string stability, and safety of adaptive cruise control systems in the presence of measurement and parasitic delays. Several simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

AB Obtaining spatially separated, high-frequency water samples from rivers and lakes is critical to enhance our understanding and effective management of freshwater resources. In this work, we present an aerial water sampler and assess the system through field experiments. The aerial water sampler has the potential to vastly increase the speed and range at which scientists obtain water samples while reducing cost and effort. The water sampling system includes 1) a mechanism to capture three 20ml samples per mission, 2) sensors and algorithms for altitude approximation over water, and 3) software components that integrate and analyze sensor data, control the vehicle, drive the sampling mechanism, and manage risk. We validate the system in the lab, characterize key sensors, develop a framework for quantifying risk, and present results of outdoor experiments that characterize the performance of the system under windy conditions. In addition, we compare water samples from local lakes obtained by our system to samples obtained by traditional sampling techniques. We find that even winds of 5.8m/s have little impact on the water sampling system and that the samples collected are consistent with traditional techniques for most properties. These experiments show that despite the challenges associated with flying precisely over water, it is possible to quickly obtain scientifically useful water samples with an unmanned aerial vehicle.

TI Camera configuration and use of AUVs to census mobile fauna
SO MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID DEEP-WATER FISH; HABITAT
AB There is a diversity of shapes and sensor configurations used in the design of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Cameras and lighting (for both still and video imaging) are common sensor systems and have traditionally been configured to produce orthogonal images of the seafloor. Such imagery provides invaluable small-scale, high resolution data for studies of seafloor geology and sessile invertebrate communities. However, using orthogonal imagery to census the diversity of mobile fauna has limitations caused by avoidance. A simple analysis using species-individual curves demonstrated that species richness was generally lower in surveys using orthogonal images when compared to forward-looking oblique images despite encountering the same number or individual fishes. The pattern was consistent when contrasting data from separate AUV and ROV surveys at boulder reefs in the Gulf of Maine as well as from down-looking and forward-looking cameras simultaneously collecting video imagery from a camera sled in a variety of habitats. These results indicate a need to evaluate the effects of camera configuration on the performance of abundance and diversity indicators developed from image data acquired using AUVs and other other vehicles. Further, we recommend that AUV designers endeavor to accommodate oblique angles for cameras and associated lighting within vehicle design parameters in order to support missions that improve detection of mobile fauna.

TI UAV Localization in Low-Altitude GNSS-Denied Environments Based on POI

DT Article

AB Localization is the most important basic information for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) during their missions. Currently, most UAVs use GNSS to calculate their own position. However, when faced with complex electromagnetic interference situations or multipath effects within cities, GNSS signals can be interfered with, resulting in reduced positioning accuracy or even complete unavailability. To avoid this situation, this paper proposes an autonomous UAV localization method for low-altitude urban scenarios based on POI and store signage text matching (LPS) in UAV images. The text information of the store signage is first extracted from the UAV images and then matched with the name of the POI data. Finally, the scene location of the UAV images is determined using multiple POIs jointly. Multiple corner points of the store signage in a single image are used as control points to the UAV position. As verified by real flight data, our method can achieve stable UAV autonomous localization with a positioning error of around 13 m without knowing the exact initial position of the UAV at take-off. The positioning effect is better than that of ORB-SLAM2 in long-distance flight, and the positioning error is not affected by text recognition accuracy and does not accumulate with flight time and distance. Combined with an inertial navigation system, it may be able to maintain high-accuracy positioning for UAVs for a long time and can be used as an alternative to GNSS in ultra-low-altitude urban environments.

AB Data collection in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) and the exposure of node location information pose a threat to the security of the entire network. Therefore, the main challenge for underwater acoustic sensor network security is to protect the security and privacy of the node locations. Compared to active attacks, the characteristics of passive attacks are indistinguishable. Therefore, this research focuses on passive attacks in underwater acoustic sensor networks, and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-aided data-importance-based scheme for protecting location privacy (DIS-PLP) is proposed. The DIS-PLP comprises three main parts. First, the anchor node calculates the importance of the current data based on the historical dataset and decides whether to send data packets to the base station according to the importance result. Subsequently, an AUV privacy violation is defined, and an AUV path planning method is proposed to prevent attackers from tracking the AUV to obtain the location of the source node. Finally, to prevent nodes from waiting too long for AUVs, a secure multi-hop transmission method is proposed that uses fake source nodes to send fake source data packets to hide the real traffic. The simulation results show that the DIS-PLP offers well performance in terms of safety time and delay, which has strong practical significance for Smart Ocean to improve the level of network security.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have been widely implemented to explore marine resources or perform marine missions; meanwhile, complex mission planning has been expected to enhance the intelligence level, improve energy efficiency, and expand AUVs' application areas. The mission planning model needs to consider energy consumption, mission quality, and mission quantity of long-term working in the marine environment. In this article, one unified and robust model was proposed based on the above requirements in the complex marine environment to improve the automaticity of AUV. However, solving this mission planning model is a nontrivial problem, especially when high robustness, high efficiency, fast response, and near-optimal results are required. Therefore, we propose a novel hyperheuristic algorithm based on evolutionary strategy (ES-HH). The proposed ES-HH combines a metaheuristic framework with a selection function to evaluate the performance of low-level heuristic operators online. This evolutionary strategy endows the hyperheuristic algorithm with the online learning feature, giving the ES-HH algorithm better computing efficiency, robustness, and near-optimal results. The experiment results show that the ES-HH algorithm can achieve better convergence and higher robustness than other algorithms, such as ant colony optimization and biogeography-based optimization algorithms. Compared with ACO and BBO algorithms, the proposed ES-HH algorithm can improve the mission completion rate by 3.42% and reduce the average energy consumption of a single task by 8.02%.

AB Sand waves constitute ubiquitous geomorphology distribution in the ocean. In this paper, we quantitatively investigate the sand wave variation of topology, morphology, and evolution from the high-resolution mapping of a side scan sonar (SSS) in an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), in favor of online sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM). We utilize echo intensity directly derived from SSS to help accelerate detection and localization, denote a collection of Gaussian-type morphological templates, with one integrated matching criterion for similarity assessment, discuss the envelope demodulation, zero-crossing rate (ZCR), cross-correlation statistically, and estimate the specific morphological parameters. It is demonstrated that the sand wave detection rate could reach up to 95.61% averagely, comparable to deep learning such as MobileNet, but at a much higher speed, with the average test time of 0.0018 s, which is particularly superior for sand waves at smaller scales. The calculation of morphological parameters primarily infer a wave length range and composition ratio in all types of sand waves, implying the possible dominant direction of hydrodynamics. The proposed scheme permits to delicately and adaptively explore the submarine geomorphology of sand waves with online computation strategies and symmetrically integrate evidence of its spatio-temporal responses during formation and migration.

AB National navies equip their submarines with Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) technology. It has become an important component of submarine development in technologically-advanced countries. Employing advanced and reliable recovery systems directly improves the safety and operational efficiency of submarines equipped with AUVs. In this paper, based on aerial refueling technology, a cone-shaped recovery system with two different guiding covers (closed structure and frame structure) is applied to the submarine. By taking the Suboff model as the research object, STAR-CCM was used to study the influence of the installation position of the recovery system, and the length of the rigid rod, on the Suboff model. It was found that when the recovery system is installed in the middle and rear of the Suboff model at the same velocity and the same length of the rigid rod, the Suboff model has the good stability and less drag. It experiences the largest drag when being installed in the front of the rigid rod. Moreover, when the recovery system is installed in the front and middle of the rigid rod, the drag increases as its length increases, and the lift decreases as its length increases. Compared with the closed structure guiding cover, the Suboff model will have less drag and better stability when the recovery system uses the frame structure guiding cover. Besides, the deflection and vibration of the rigid rod were also analyzed via mathematical theory.

AB This article addresses the three-dimensional (3-D) path-following problem of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the presence of multiple uncertainties and nonlinearities, including unmodeled dynamics, actuator hysteresis, input saturation, and oceanic disturbance. First, the AUV kinetic model is reconstructed as a second-order nonlinear system by coupling the smooth saturation function and hysteresis dynamics of actuators. Second, the 3-D tracking error is derived in a simplified manner based on the relative motion theory. Then the approach angle-based symmetrical hyperbolic-tangent line-of-sight (SHLOS) guidance and kinematic control scheme are designed to ensure the global asymptotic stability of the kinematic system. Third, two sets of kinetic control schemes are designed without prior knowledge of AUV dynamics and disturbance, where the Nussbaum gain technique is applied to deal with the unknown hysteresis parameter. The application of the reconstructed kinetic model avoids the degraded performance caused by actuator nonlinearities. The first scheme is improved by adaptively estimating the bound of the generalized disturbance-like term which lumps the unmodeled dynamics, external disturbance, and saturation approximation error. The improved scheme guarantees the global stability of the system and transient tracking performance. Finally, comparative simulation studies under dynamic oceanic environments prove the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control schemes.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are widely used to accomplish various missions in the complex marine environment; the design of a control system for AUVs is particularly difficult due to the high nonlinearity, variations in hydrodynamic coefficients, and external force from ocean currents. In this paper, we propose a controller based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in a simulation environment for studying the control performance of the vectored thruster AUV. RL is an important method of artificial intelligence that can learn behavior through trial-and-error interactions with the environment, so it does not need to provide an accurate AUV control model that is very hard to establish. The proposed RL algorithm only uses the information that can be measured by sensors inside the AUVs as the input parameters, and the outputs of the designed controller are the continuous control actions, which are the commands that are set to the vectored thruster. Moreover, a reward function is developed for deep RL controller considering different factors which actually affect the control accuracy of AUV navigation control. To confirm the algorithm's effectiveness, a series of simulations are carried out in the designed simulation environment, which is a method to save time and improve efficiency. Simulation results prove the feasibility of the deep RL algorithm applied to the control system for AUV. Furthermore, our work also provides an optional method for robot control problems to deal with improving technology requirements and complicated application environments.

AB Spoofing can seriously threaten the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) in critical applications such as positioning and navigation of autonomous vehicles. Research into spoofing generation will contribute to assessment of the threat of possible spoofing attacks and help in the development of anti-spoofing methods. However, the recent commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) spoofing generators are expensive and the technology implementation is complicated. To address the above problem and promote the GPS safety-critical applications, a spoofing generator using a vector tracking-based software-defined receiver is proposed in this contribution. The spoofing generator aims to modify the raw signals by cancelling the actual signal component and adding the spoofing signal component. The connections between the spreading code and carrier, and the states of the victim receiver are established through vector tracking. The actual signal can be predicted effectively, and the spoofing signal will be generated with the spoofing trajectory at the same time. The experimental test results show that the spoofing attack signal can effectively mislead the victim receiver to the designed trajectory. Neither the tracking channels nor the positioning observations have abnormal changes during this processing period. The recent anti-spoofing methods cannot detect this internal spoofing easily. The proposed spoofing generator can cover all open-sky satellites with a high quality of concealment. With the superiority of programmability and diversity, it is believed that the proposed method based on an open source software-defined receiver has a great value for anti-spoofing research of different GNSS signals.

ID SURFACE CRAFT; LOCALIZATION
AB This paper presents the results from field testing of a unique approach to the navigation of a fleet of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) using only onboard sensors and information provided by a moving surface ship. The approach, considered moving short-baseline (MSBL) navigation, uses two transponders mounted on a single surface ship that alternately broadcast acoustic messages containing one of the parameters of the kinematic state of the surface ship. The broadcasts are initiated according to a predefined schedule so that the one-way travel time (OWTT) of the acoustic messages may be used to determine the range to the transponder. Each AUV in the fleet uses the surface ship state measurements and ranges provided by the acoustic messages in two extended Kalman filters (EKFs) for state estimation. The first EKF merges the intermittent surface ship state measurements with a kinematic model to estimate the state of the surface ship. This is necessary because the presented approach uses 13-bit acoustic messages as opposed to the more commonly used 32-byte messages, which allow the full state to be encoded in a single broadcast. The second EKF uses the current surface ship state estimate to properly interpret the acoustic ranges, combining them with a kinematic model to estimate the state of the AUV itself. Numerous MSBL navigation experiments were compared against a more traditional approach using a long-baseline (LBL) array of transponders and OWTT acoustic ranging. The results of all tests were verified by independent LBL measures of position. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The composition of sessile benthic megafauna communities on mesophotic coral reefs (50 to 65 m depth) was investigated at 3 sites (Noggin Pass, Viper Reef and Hydrographers Passage) over 500 km of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) shelf-edge, Australia. High-resolution stereo imagery was collected in 4 separate autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) surveys and used to characterise the substratum and megafauna at each site (2 surveys from Viper Reef, and one from each of Noggin Pass and Hydrographers Passage). Random sampling of 100 images from a 100 x 100 m area at each site indicated that non-reef habitats predominated and that megafauna were largely confined to reef habitats, while a more detailed investigation of these reef substrata revealed diverse benthic megafaunal communities that varied significantly both within and between study sites. There were consistent patterns in the functional ecological groups occupying particular finer-scale habitat types, with phototrophic taxa dominating the flatter tops of submerged reefs and heterotrophic suspension-feeders occupying steeper habitats. Slope angle, water clarity and productivity best explained the distribution of megafauna on reef habitats. Reduced photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) likely excludes most phototrophic taxa from steeper slopes. These results suggest that the extensive submerged reefs on the outer-shelf of the GBR harbour diverse mesophotic reef communities. Given these results, GBR mesophotic coral ecosystems deserve further study, not only of their benthic megafauna but also their fish and mobile invertebrate communities.

AB Automation of transportation will play a crucial role in the future when people driving vehicles will be replaced by autonomous systems. Currently, the positioning systems are not used alone but are combined in order to create cooperative positioning systems. The ultra-wideband (UWB) system is an excellent alternative to the global positioning system (GPS) in a limited area but has some drawbacks. Despite many advantages of various object positioning systems, none is free from the problem of object displacement during measurement (data acquisition), which affects positioning accuracy. In addition, temporarily missing data from the absolute positioning system can lead to dangerous situations. Moreover, data pre-processing is unavoidable and takes some time, affecting additionally the object's displacement in relation to its previous position and its starting point of the new positioning process. So, the prediction of the position of an object is necessary to minimize the time when the position is unknown or out of date, especially when the object is moving at high speed and the position update rate is low. This article proposes using the long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural network to predict objects' positions based on historical data from the UWB system and inertial navigation. The proposed solution creates a reliable positioning system that predicts 10 positions of low and high-speed moving objects with an error below 10 cm. Position prediction allows detection of possible collisions-the intersection of the trajectories of moving objects.

AB Autonomous driving related researches require the analysis and usage of massive amounts of driving scenario data. Compared to raw data collected by sensors, scenario data provide a preliminary abstraction of driving tasks and processes, explicitly integrate information about the road environment and the dynamic and static attributes of traffic participants, making it easier to conduct task understanding and decision making. However, many existing driving scenario datasets have the following two problems. First, it is not clear which data fields need to be recorded for driving scenarios. The data storage formats and organization standards are inconsistent. Second, the datasets cannot establish driving scenario indexing effectively. Existing datasets are sparsely annotated and difficult to index, which is detrimental to data sampling and extraction for machine learning process, thus hindering efficient fusion and reuse. In this paper, we propose MetaScenario, a framework for driving scenario data. We describe driving scenarios and design the centralized and unified data framework for the storage, processing, and indexing of scenario data based on relational database. The concept of atom scenario is proposed and characterized using semantic graphs. We also annotate and classify behaviors and interactions of traffic participants in atom scenarios by extracting the spatiotemporal evolution of semantic information. The annotation facilitates the indexing and extraction of data. The scenario datasets are further evaluated via the data distribution and annotation statistics. MetaScenario can provide researchers with convenient tools for scenario data extraction and important analytical references.

AB Accurate 3D object detection from point clouds is critical for autonomous vehicles. However, point cloud data collected by LiDAR sensors are inherently sparse, especially at long distances. In addition, most existing 3D object detectors extract local features and ignore interactions between features, producing weak semantic information that significantly limits detection performance. We propose a self-attention graph convolutional network (SAT-GCN), which utilizes a GCN and self-attention to enhance semantic representations by aggregating neighborhood information and focusing on vital relationships. SAT-GCN consists of three modules: vertex feature extraction (VFE), self-attention with dimension reduction (SADR), and far distance feature suppression (FDFS). VFE extracts neighboring relationships between features using GCN after encoding a raw point cloud. SADR performs further weight augmentation for crucial neighboring relationships through self-attention. FDFS suppresses meaningless edges formed by sparse point cloud distributions in remote areas and generates corre-sponding global features. Extensive experiments are conducted on the widely used KITTI and nuScenes 3D object detection benchmarks. The results demonstrate significant improvements in mainstream methods, PointPillars, SECOND, and PointRCNN, improving the mean of AP 3D by 4.88%, 5.02%, and 2.79% on KITTI test dataset. SAT-GCN can boost the detection accuracy of the point cloud, especially at medium and long distances. Furthermore, adding the SAT-GCN module has a limited impact on the real-time performance and model parameters.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The rising number of technological advanced devices making network coverage planning very challenging tasks for network operators. The transmission quality between the transmitter and the end users has to be optimum for the best performance out of any device. Besides, the presence of coverage hole is also an ongoing issue for operators which cannot be ignored throughout the whole operational stage. Any coverage hole in network operators' coverage region will hamper the communication applications and degrade the reputation of the operator's services. Presently, there are techniques to detect coverage holes such as drive test or minimization of drive test. However, these approaches have many limitations. The extreme costs, outdated information about the radio environment and high time consumption do not allow to meet the requirement competently. To overcome these problems, we take advantage of Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Q-learning to autonomously detect coverage hole in a given area and then deploy UAV based base station (UAV-BS) by considering wireless back-haul with the core network and users demand. This machine learning mechanism will help the UAV to eliminate human-in-the-loop (HiTL) model. Later, we formulate an optimisation problem for 3D UAV-BS placement at various angular positions to maximise the number of users associated with the UAV-BS. In summary, we have illustrated a cost-effective as well as time saving approach of detecting coverage hole and providing on-demand coverage in this article.

AB Autonomous estimation of the state is of key importance in UAVs, as the measurement systems may experience faults and failures. Thus estimation techniques must provide estimates of the most important variables used in the control algorithms for safe, autonomous, unmanned flights. In this paper, a filter with low computational complexity for attitude estimation of a quadrotor UAV is introduced, with a model suitable for Fault-Tolerant Observation. The new filtration method, called the Square Root Unscented Complementary Kalman Filter (SRUCKF), is based on the commonly-known Kalman Filter (KF) in its nonlinear version, namely the Square Root Unscented Kalman Filter (SRUKF). The fundamental equation of the KF is modified so that the complementary feature of the filter is exalted. The new filter introduces characteristics that are analyzed on the basis of its application in quadrotor state estimation. Finally, the results are compared to an ordinary filter of the same type (using the Unscented Transformation). The presented studies indicate that the newly derived filter (SRUCKF) handles strong nonlinearities and gives results similar to those obtained from the SRUKF. Furthermore, it introduces lower computational burden, as the undergoing process uses diagonal matrices in its crucial places. In the paper, the estimation algorithms are tailored to a quadrotor UAV (Crazyflie 2.0), for which a quaternion-based model is proposed. The contribution of the paper lies in a Kalman-based novel state observer and its application in Fault-Tolerant Observation (FTO).

AB Cell-responsive hydrogels hold tremendous potential as cell delivery devices in regenerative medicine. In this study, we developed a hydrogel-based cell delivery vehicle, in which the encapsulated cell cargo control its own release from the vehicle in a protease-independent manner. Specifically, we have synthesized a modified poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel that undergoes degradation responding to cell-secreted molecules by incorporating disulfide moieties onto the backbone of the hydrogel precursor. Our results show the disulfide-modified PEG hydrogels disintegrate seamlessly into solution in presence of cells without any external stimuli. The rate of hydrogel degradation, which ranges from hours to months, is found to be dependent upon the type of encapsulated cells, cell number, and fraction of disulfide moieties present in the hydrogel backbone. The differentiation potential of human mesenchymal stem cells released from the hydrogels is maintained in vitro. The in vivo analysis of these cell-laden hydrogels, through a dorsal window chamber and intramuscular implantation, demonstrated autonomous release of cells to the host environment. The hydrogel-mediated implantation of cells resulted in higher cell retention within the host tissue when compared to that without a biomaterial support. Biomaterials that function as a shield to protect cell cargos and assist their delivery in response to signals from the encapsulated cells could have a wide utility in cell transplantation and could improve the therapeutic outcomes of cell-based therapies.

AB Trajectory planning for a heavy-duty mining truck near the loading/dumping sites of an open-pit mine is difficult. As opposed to trajectory planning for a small-sized passenger car in a parking lot, trajectory planning for a heavy-duty mining truck involves complex factors in vehicle kinematics and environment. These factors make the concerned trajectory planning scheme a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) incorporated with conditional constraints (denoted as C-MINLP). MINLP solvers can neither deal with conditional constraints nor find global optima in real time. Instead of solving the C-MINLP directly, we build a from-coarse-to-fine framework so that the coupled difficulties (the mixed integral variables, conditional constraints, and the demand for global optimality) are divided and conquered. At the coarse search stage, a global-optimality-enhanced hybrid A* search algorithm is proposed to find a near-optimal coarse trajectory with the mixed integral variables, conditional kinematic constraints, and global optimality considered. The coarse trajectory is further polished at the refinement stage, wherein the nominal C-MINLP is simplified as a small-scale NLP. The solution to the NLP is an optimized trajectory, which does not violate the complex constraints in the nominal C-MINLP. This indicates that conversion from the C-MINLP to an NLP is efficient with the help of a high-quality coarse trajectory.

AB Autonomous collision avoidance technology provides an intelligent method for unmanned surface vehicles' (USVs) safe and efficient navigation. In this paper, the USV collision avoidance problem under the constraint of the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea (COLREGs) was studied. Here, a reinforcement learning collision avoidance (RLCA) algorithm is proposed that complies with USV maneuverability. Notably, the reinforcement learning agent does not require any prior knowledge about USV collision avoidance from humans to learn collision avoidance motions well. The double-DQN method was used to reduce the overestimation of the action-value function. A dueling network architecture was adopted to clearly distinguish the difference between a great state and an excellent action. Aiming at the problem of agent exploration, a method based on the characteristics of USV collision avoidance, the category-based exploration method, can improve the exploration ability of the USV. Because a large number of turning behaviors in the early steps may affect the training, a method to discard some of the transitions was designed, which can improve the effectiveness of the algorithm. A finite Markov decision process (MDP) that conforms to the USVs' maneuverability and COLREGs was used for the agent training. The RLCA algorithm was tested in a marine simulation environment in many different USV encounters, which showed a higher average reward. The RLCA algorithm bridged the divide between USV navigation status information and collision avoidance behavior, resulting in successfully planning a safe and economical path to the terminal.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) enable drivers to devote their primary attention to non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs). Consequently, AVs must provide intelligibility services appropriate to drivers' in-situ states and in-car activities to ensure driver safety, and accounting for the type of NDRT being performed can result in higher intelligibility. We discovered that sleeping is drivers' most preferred NDRT, and this could also result in a critical scenario when a take-over request (TOR) occurs. In this study, we designed TOR situations where drivers are woken from sleep in a high-fidelity AV simulator with motion systems, aiming to examine how drivers react to a TOR provided with our experimental conditions. We investigated how driving performance, perceived task workload, AV acceptance, and physiological responses in a TOR vary according to two factors: (1) feedforward timings and (2) presentation modalities. The results showed that when awakened by a TOR alert delivered >10 s prior to an event, drivers were more focused on the driving context and were unlikely to be influenced by TOR modality, whereas TOR alerts delivered <5 s prior needed a visual accompaniment to quickly inform drivers of on-road situations. This study furthers understanding of how a driver's cognitive and physical demands interact with TOR situations at the moment of waking from sleep and designs effective interventions for intelligibility services to best comply with safety and driver experience in AVs.

AB In this work, we implement a decentralized and noncooperative state estimation and control algorithm to autonomously balance a team of robots in a circular formation pattern. The group of robots includes a leader periodically moving at a constant steering angle and a set of followers that, by only leveraging intermittent and noisy proximity measurements, independently implement a fully decentralized state estimation control algorithm to determine and adjust their relative position with closest neighbors. The algorithm is conducted in a pause-and-go sequence, where, during the pause, each robot stops to gather and process the information coming from the measurements, estimate the relative phase with respect to the others, and identify its closest pursuant. During the go, each robot accelerates to space from its closest pursuant and then to move at a constant speed when the desired spacing is achieved. The algorithm is tested in an unprecedented experiment on a custom-made low-cost caster-wheeled robotic framework featuring sonar and vision sensors mounted on a rotating platform to estimate the proximity distance to closer neighbors. The control scheme, which does not necessitate cooperation and is capable of coping with uncertain and intermittent sensor feedback data, is shown to be effective in balancing the robot on the circle even when, at a steady state, no feedback sensor data are available.

DE pothole detection; deep learning; faster-RCNN; road condition monitoring
AB Road surface deteriorations such as potholes have caused motorists heavy monetary damages every year. However, effective road condition monitoring has been a continuing challenge to road owners. Depth cameras have a small field of view and can be easily affected by vehicle bouncing. Traditional image processing methods based on algorithms such as segmentation cannot adapt to varying environmental and camera scenarios. In recent years, novel object detection methods based on deep learning algorithms have produced good results in detecting typical objects, such as faces, vehicles, structures and more, even in scenarios with changing object distances, camera angles, lighting conditions, etc. Therefore, in this study, a Deep Learning Pothole Detector (DLPD) based on the deep region-based convolutional neural network is proposed for autonomous detection of potholes from images. About 900 images with potholes and road surface conditions are collected and divided into training and testing data. Parameters of the network in the DLPD are calibrated based on sensitivity tests. Then, the calibrated DLPD is trained by the training data and applied to the 215 testing images to evaluate its performance. It is demonstrated that potholes can be automatically detected with high average precision over 93%. Potholes can be differentiated from manholes by training and applying a manhole-pothole classifier which is constructed using the convolutional neural network layers in DLPD. Repeated detection of the same potholes can be prevented through feature matching of the newly detected pothole with previously detected potholes within a small region.

ID CHARGING SYSTEM
AB An underwater wireless power transfer system with a curly coil structure is proposed to adapt to the cylindrical symmetric hull of the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The unipolar and bipolar curly coils are optimised to minimise the weight of the receiver with the same output power. It is revealed that the bipolar curly coil structure has a heavier receiver than the unipolar curly coil structure. However, the electromagnetic field radiation in the AUV of the bipolar curly coil structure is much smaller than that of the unipolar curly coil structure, which means that the bipolar curly coil structure has a smaller influence on the electronics components in the AUV. Therefore, the bipolar curly coil is adopted for the prototype. The series-series (SS) and double-sided inductor-capacitor-capacitor (LCC-LCC) compensation topologies for the bipolar curly coil structure are also investigated. A prototype was built and the experimental results showed that distorted coil currents are generated in the SS compensation topology, while the LCC-LCC compensation has a nearly sinusoidal coil current. The efficiencies of the SS and LCC-LCC compensation topologies are approximately the same, at similar to 95%, which indicates that the proposed curly coil structure is applicable.

AB Complex systems generally have many components. It is not possible to understand such complex systems only by knowing the individual components and their behavior. This is because any move by a component affects the further decisions/moves by other components and so on. In a complex system, as the number of components grows, complexity also grows exponentially, making the entire system to be seen as a collection of subsystems or aMulti-Agent System (MAS). The major challenge is to make these agents work in a coordinated way, optimizing their local utilities and contributing the maximum towards optimization of the global objective. This paper discusses the theory of Collective Intelligence ( COIN) using the modified version of Probability Collectives ( PC) to achieve the global goal. The paper successfully demonstrated this approach by optimizing the Rosenbrock function in which the coupled variables are seen as autonomous agents working collectively to achieve the function optimum. To demonstrate the PC approach on combinatorial optimization problems, two test cases of the Multi-Depot Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem (MDMTSP) with 3 depots, 3 vehicles and 15 nodes are solved. In these cases, the vehicles are considered as autonomous agents collectively searching the minimum cost path. PC is successfully accompanied with insertion, elimination and swapping heuristic techniques. The optimumresults to the Rosenbrock function and both the MDMTSP test cases are obtained at reasonable computational costs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

ID TRAJECTORY PREDICTION; MODEL
AB There has been a rise of use of Autonomous Vehicles on public roads. With the predicted rise of road traffic accidents over the coming years, these vehicles must be capable of safely operate in the public domain. The field of pedestrian detection has significantly advanced in the last decade, providing high-level accuracy, with some technique reaching near-human level accuracy. However, there remains further work required for pedestrian intent prediction to reach human-level performance. One of the challenges facing current pedestrian intent predictors are the varying scales of pedestrians, particularly smaller pedestrians. This is because smaller pedestrians can blend into the background, making them difficult to detect, track or apply pose estimations techniques. Therefore, in this work, we present a novel intent prediction approach for multi-scale pedestrians using 2D pose estimation and a Long Short-term memory (LSTM) architecture. The pose estimator predicts keypoints for the pedestrian along the video frames. Based on the accumulation of these keypoints along the frames, spatio-temporal data is generated. This spatio-temporal data is fed to the LSTM for classifying the crossing behaviour of the pedestrians. We evaluate the performance of the proposed techniques on the popular Joint Attention in Autonomous Driving (JAAD) dataset and the new larger-scale Pedestrian Intention Estimation (PIE) dataset. Using data generalisation techniques, we show that the proposed technique outperformed the state-of-the-art techniques by up to 7%, reaching up to 94% accuracy while maintaining a comparable run-time of 6.1 ms.

AB Recently, deploying sensors such as LiDARs on the roadside to monitor the passing traffic and assist autonomous vehicle perception has become popular. However, unlike autonomous vehicle systems, roadside sensor systems involve sensors from different subsystems, resulting in a lack of synchronization in both time and space between the sensors. Calibration is a critical technology that enables the central server to fuse data generated by different location infrastructures, which vastly improves sensing range and detection robustness. Regrettably, existing calibration algorithms frequently assume that LiDARs have significant overlap or that temporal calibration has already been achieved. However, since these assumptions do not always hold in real-world scenarios, the calibration results obtained from existing algorithms are frequently unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose -the first system that can automatically calibrate roadside LiDARs in both time and space. The main idea is to automatically calibrate the sensors based on the result of the detection/tracking task, rather than relying on extracting special features. Furthermore, we propose a novel mechanism for evaluating calibration parameters that align with our algorithm, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments. This mechanism can also guide parameter iterations for multiple calibrations, further enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of our calibration method. Finally, to evaluate the performance of, we collected two datasets, one simulated dataset and one real-world dataset. The experimental results show that can achieve a spatial calibration error of less than $10cm$ and a temporal calibration error of less than 1.5ms

AB Background: Over the last few decades, telepresence robots (TRs) have drawn significant attention in academic and healthcare systems due to their enormous benefits, including safety improvement, remote access and economics, reduced traffic congestion, and greater mobility. COVID-19 and advancements in the military play a vital role in developing TRs. Since then, research on the advancement of robots has been attracting much attention. Methods: In critical areas, the placement and movement of humans are not safe, and researchers have started looking at the development of robots. Robot development includes many parameters to be analyzed, and trajectory planning and optimization are among them. The main objective of this study is to present a trajectory control and optimization algorithm for a cognitive architecture named auto-MERLIN. Optimization algorithms are developed for trajectory control. Results: The derived work empirically tests the solutions and provides execution details for creating the trajectory design. We develop the trajectory algorithm for the clockwise direction and another one for the clockwise and counterclockwise directions. Conclusions: Experimental results are drawn to support the proposed algorithm. Self-localization, self-driving, and right and left turn trajectories are drawn. All of the experimental results show that the designed TR works properly, with better accuracy and only a slight jitter in the orientation. The jitter is found due to the environmental factor caught by the sensors, which can be filtered easily. The results show that the proposed approach is less complex and provides better trajectory planning accuracy.

TI Crash safety concerns for out-of-position occupant postures: A look
   toward safety in highly automated vehicles
SO TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Autonomous vehicles; out of position; occupant posture; NASS-CDS
ID SEATS
AB Objective: Highly automated vehicle occupants will all be passengers and may be free to ride while in postures for which existing occupant safety systems such as seat belts and airbags were not originally designed. These occupants could therefore face increased risk of injury when a crash occurs. Given that current vehicles are capable of supporting a variety of occupant postures outside of the normal design position, such as reclined or turned passengers, an evaluation of current field data was performed to better understand the risks of being out of position.Methods: We investigated the frequency, demographics, and injury outcomes for out-of-position occupants using NASS-CDS. A matched analysis was performed to compare injury outcomes for out-of-position passengers with in-position drivers involved in similar crashes. Finally, case studies for out-of-position occupants were examined in the Crash Injury Research (CIREN) database.Results: Only 0.5% of occupants in NASS-CDS with a coded posture were out of position at the time of crash. Of the out-of-position occupants, being turned or seated sideways was almost as likely as being reclined. Out-of-position occupants were younger and less likely to be belted than their in-position counterparts. Analysis of the injury data indicated a trend that being out of position was associated with an elevated risk for serious injury. However, the number of out-of-position occupants was too small to provide a definitive or statistically significant conclusion on injury outcome.Conclusion: Though highly automated vehicles may eventually reduce the number of crashes and traffic fatalities in the future, there will be a transition period when these vehicles remain at risk from collisions with human-driven vehicles. These crashes could cause higher than anticipated rates of injury if occupants are less likely to be belted or tend to be in positions for which restraints are not optimized. This study highlights the need for future research on occupant response and countermeasure design for out-of-position occupants.

AB How an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) performs fully automated task allocation and achieves satisfactory mission planning effects during the search for potential threats deployed in an underwater space is the focus of the paper. First, the task assignment problem is defined as a traveling salesman problem (TSP) with specific and distinct starting and ending points. Two competitive and non-commensurable optimization goals, the total sailing distance and the turning angle generated by an AUV to completely traverse threat points in the planned order, are taken into account. The maneuverability limitations of an AUV, namely, minimum radius of a turn and speed, are also introduced as constraints. Then, an improved ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm based on fuzzy logic and a dynamic pheromone volatilization rule is developed to solve the TSP. With the help of the fuzzy set, the ants that have moved along better paths are screened and the pheromone update is performed only on preferred paths so as to enhance pathfinding guidance in the early stage of the ACO algorithm. By using the dynamic pheromone volatilization rule, more volatile pheromones on preferred paths are produced as the number of iterations of the ACO algorithm increases, thus providing an effective way for the algorithm to escape from a local minimum in the later stage. Finally, comparative simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed algorithm and the influence of critical parameters is also analyzed and demonstrated.

AB Vertical behavior, such as diel vertical migration (DVM) and swarming are widespread among zooplankton. At higher latitudes, synchronized DVM is mostly absent during summer and predominantly herbivorous copepods tend to form large near-surface swarms. This behavior is risky because it can make them vulnerable to visual predators. Here, we used ca. 12 days of mid-summer (28 June to 10 July 2018) high-frequency acoustic data collected on board of an autonomous surface vehicle (Sailbuoy) to study the vertical behavioral patterns of a zooplankton community in the Norwegian Sea (69-71 degrees N). Comparing acoustic data with zooplankton net samples, we could distinguish the sound scatters into (1). lipid-rich older developmental stages of Calanus spp., (2). younger developmental stages of Calanus spp., smaller copepods and krill and (3). unknown group of strong sound scatters that may have been younger stages of planktivorous fish. We observed shorter-range classic DVM during much of the study period, where in two days, the migration appeared to be pronounced (> 50 m in amplitude), largely synchronous and occurred in the presence of sound scatterer group 3. The observed zooplankton community was concentrated in the upper 20 m in cloudy and calm days but retreated to greater depths at increased near-surface turbulence. This turbulence-driven vertical retreat appeared to be synchronized across the zooplankton community, potentially indicating a schooling behavior.

AB In this article, a novel cable-drogue docking system is proposed between an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and one mobile underwater platform, to increase the docking safety and reduce the negative influences of turbulences around the platform shell on the AUV. The mathematical model of the cable-drogue system and an radial basis function neural network (RBFNN)-based Q-learning proportional-integral-differential (PID) controller are developed for the system characteristics analysis and the stabilized control. First, the cable-drogue's mathematical model is established as a link-joint-connected system, whose kinematic and dynamic equations are derived subjected to the hydrodynamic forces on system. One numerical solution procedure is also presented to obtain the motion state of the cable-drogue system. Next, considering the current interferences on the cable-drogue system, a cross rudder is added on the drogue to enhance the robustness. An RBFNN-based Q-learning PID controller is proposed to improve the control performances, in which the control parameters are adaptively optimized by an Q-learning neural network. Finally, numerical simulations are made to study the steady-state and dynamic characteristics of the cable-drogue system in ocean environment, and to investigate the performances of both the traditional PID controller and the proposed RBFNN-based Q-learning PID controller in unknown dynamical system. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the kinematic and dynamic equations of the cable-drogue system and the proposed controller in this article.

AB It is an enduring question how to combine revealed preference (RP) and stated preference (SP) data to analyze individual choices. While the nested logit (NL) model is the classical way to address the question, this study presents multitask learning deep neural networks (MTLDNNs) as an alternative framework, and discusses its theoretical foundation, empirical performance, and behavioral intuition. We first demonstrate that the MTLDNNs are theoretically more general than the NL models because of MTLDNNs' automatic feature learning, flexible regularizations, and diverse architectures. By analyzing the adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs), we illustrate that the MTLDNNs outperform the NL models in terms of prediction accuracy but underperform in terms of cross-entropy losses. To interpret the MTLDNNs, we compute the elasticities and visu-alize the relationship between choice probabilities and input variables. The MTLDNNs reveal that AVs mainly substitute driving and ride hailing, and that the variables specific to AVs are more important than the socio-economic variables in determining AV adoption. Overall, this work demonstrates that MTLDNNs are theoretically appealing in leveraging the information shared by RP and SP and capable of revealing meaningful behavioral patterns, although its performance gain over the classical NL model is still limited. To improve upon this work, future studies can investigate the inconsistency between prediction accuracy and cross-entropy losses, novel MTLDNN architectures, regularization design for the RP-SP question, MTLDNN applications to other choice scenarios, and deeper theoretical connections between choice models and the MTLDNN framework.

AB Iliac wing fractures due to lap belt loading have been identified in laboratory tests for almost 50 years and an analysis of recent data suggests these injuries are also occurring in the field. With the introduction of highly autonomous vehicles on the horizon, vehicle manufacturers are exploring open cabin concepts that permit reclined postures and separation of the occupant from the knee bolster and instrument panel. This will result in greater reliance on the lap belt and lap belt/pelvis loading to restrain occupants. No injury criteria exist for iliac wing fractures resulting from lap belt loading like that seen in frontal crash conditions. This study tested the tolerance of isolated iliac wings in a controlled lap belt-like loading environment while incorporating the effect of loading angle after analyzing lap belt loading experiments from a previous study. Twenty-two iliac wings were tested; nineteen of them sustained fracture (exact), but the loading input was insufficient to cause fracture in the other three (right censored). The fracture tolerance of the tested specimens ranged widely (1463-8895 N) and averaged 4091 N (SD 2381 N). Injury risk functions were created by fitting Weibull survival models to data that integrated censored and exact failure observations.

AB Driven by the development of the smart Internet of Things (IoT), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms have been widely applied to implement diverse sensing tasks for many IoT applications. By integrating resources of UAVs, a UAV swarm can collaboratively collect and process massive image data for fast system response. However, it is difficult to reduce the computing delay caused by overlapping sensing operations and insufficient computing resources. In addition, transmission delays among UAVs may be intensified due to limited bandwidth resources. To address the mentioned challenges, we propose a UAV-swarm-based hierarchical network architecture to jointly schedule sensing, computing, and communication resources. Specifically, multiple computing groups that are formed by UAVs execute image processing in a pipeline manner to improve computing resource utilization. In order to reduce task execution time, we formulate a nonlinear integer optimization problem for the coordination of heterogeneous resources. A multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based algorithm is designed to find the optimal joint resource allocation strategy under sensing accuracy constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm reduces the task execution time while significantly improving the computing resource utilization.

AB The ever increasing amount of connected mobile devices and users in the Internet of vehicles and the fact bicycles, electric scooters and users' smartphones are also connected poses a real challenge in terms of ensuring quality of service. The constantly changing topology due to the high-mobility of devices and users greatly impacts its stability and the connectivity of devices. Furthermore, to ensure safety of people in the case of autonomous vehicles it is of paramount importance to ensure excellent reliability. This is why we have developed a solution that is based on machine learning to classify devices according to their mobility profile and that uses a scoring system to select the best candidates to act as mobile relays amongst devices with a suitable mobility profile. The scoring system allows to find critical locations in terms of user density. This solution does not require a dedicated infrastructure such as road side units. Simulations results will show the proposed solution increases the packet delivery ratio by up to 6%, reduces the energy consumption by up to 30% and increases the efficiency of bandwidth usage without sacrificing the end delay of users and devices compared with the state-of-the-art.

AB Land vehicle navigation based on the inertial navigation system (INS) and odometers (ODs) is a classical autonomous navigation application and has been extensively studied over the past several decades. In this article, we seriously analyze the error characteristics of the OD pulses and investigate three types of OD measurement models in the INS/OD integrated system. Specifically, in the pulse velocity model, a preliminary Kalman filter is designed to obtain an accurate vehicle velocity from the accumulated pulses; the pulse increment model is accordingly obtained by integrating the pulse velocity; a new pulse accumulation model is proposed by augmenting the traveled distance into the system state. The three types of measurements, along with the nonholonomic constraint, are implemented in the standard extended Kalman filter. In view of the motion-related pulse error characteristics, the multiple model adaptive estimation (MMAE) approach is exploited to further enhance the performance. Simulations and long-distance experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods. It is shown that the standard pulse velocity measurement achieves superior performance, whereas the accumulated pulse measurement is most favorable with the MMAE enhancement.

AB This article presents a robust predictor-based sliding-mode control (RPSMC) for multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to ensure desired tracking control under time delays, which appear in practice by communications, complex computation, and actuator delays. Many UAV applications have difficulty in control and operation due to various types of time delays, resulting in repeated commands, severe control instability, and then mission failure. However, existing controllers have limitations in solving time delay problems. In this article, the RPSMC with the prediction of future disturbance and reference trajectory is developed for the multirotor UAV to minimize the effects of time delay, robustly deal with external disturbances, and further achieve desired tracking control. The performance of RPSMC for the multirotor UAV is verified under various time delays and disturbances in numerical simulations. The results show the robustness and fast control convergence compared with proportional-integral-differential and conventional predictor-based controllers. Experimental results with step response and tracking of circular trajectory demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the RPSMC for UAVs in the presence of various time delays and disturbances.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking has been widely applied in real-world applications such as surveillance and monitoring. However, the inherent high maneuverability and agility of UAV often lead to motion blur, which can impair the visual appearance of the target object and easily degrade the existing trackers. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a tracking-oriented adversarial blur-deblur network (ABDNet), composed of a novel deblurrer to recover the visual appearance of the tracked object, and a brand-new blur generator to produce realistic blurry images for adversarial training. More specifically, the deblurrer progressively refines the features through pixel-wise, spatial-wise, and channel-wise stages to achieve excellent deblurring performance. The blur generator adaptively fuses an image sequence with a learnable kernel to create realistic blurry images. During training, ABDNet is plugged into the state-of-the-art real-time trackers and trained with blurring-deblurring loss as well as tracking loss. During inference, the blur generator is removed, while the deblurrer and the tracker can work together for UAV tracking. Extensive experiments in both public datasets and real-world testing have validated the effectiveness of ABDNet.

To improve the communication performance of the AGIN, the following deployment schemes are proposed: 1) a static multi-UAV BS deployment to maximize the number of covered users by user clustering; 2) a mobile multi-UAV BS deployment to maximize the transmission performance of users, which is achieved by jointly optimizing UAV trajectories and user scheduling; 3) an optimized UAV multihop relay deployment to minimize the number of UAV relays and the communication outage probability. Moreover, UAV formation relay is deployed as a virtual multiantenna array to improve the relaying performance by beamforming and orthogonal space-time block coding, and some further open researches and challenges are also discussed.

AB This article proposes a multilateral multienergy trading framework for synergetic hydrogen (H-2) and electricity transactions among renewable-dominated hybrid charging stations (HCSs). In this framework, each autonomous HCS with various renewable energy resource (RES) endowment can harvest local renewables for internal green H-2 and electricity generation to simultaneously meet demands of electric vehicles (EVs) and hydrogen-powered vehicles (HVs) from the transportation network. The surplus electricity/H-2 production of the HCS is accommodated by external multilateral transactions to increase the additional profit. Besides, each HCS is modeled as a sustainable energy hub, and multiple hubs with multienergy transactions contribute toward a low-carbon energy-transport nexus. A partial differential equation model based on fluid dynamic theory is formed to capture the temporal and spatial dynamics of traffic flows for estimating the EV/HV loads at HCSs. Furthermore, a distributed multilateral pricing algorithm is developed to iteratively derive the optimal prices and quantities for transactive electricity and H-2. Comparative studies corroborate the superiority of the proposed methodology on economic merits and RES accommodation.

AB This article presents a novel spoofing device capable of injecting false target information into a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar. The spoofing device uses a radio frequency (RF) single-sideband (SSB) mixer to introduce a frequency shift to the incoming RF signal transmitted by the victim radar and retransmits the modulated RF signal. The modulated RF signal resembles a false target. Upon down-conversion on the receiver chain of the victim radar, the modulated RF signal creates an illusion of a real target in the radar signal processing system. The frequency shift can be adjusted to vary the range of the spoofed target. The theory of the spoofing mechanism was developed, and a 5.8 GHz prototype was built for experimental validation. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of the proposed spoofing device to inject a false target at any arbitrary range. A hybrid-chirp FMCW approach was proposed and verified as a countermeasure to distinguish a real target from a spoofed target to mitigate the RF-spoofing attack.

AB Substantial research is required to ensure that micro-mobility ride sharing provides a better fulfilment of user needs. This study proposes a novel crowdsourcing model for the ride-sharing system where light vehicles such as scooters and bikes are crowdsourced. The proposed model is expected to solve the problem of charging and maintaining a large number of light vehicles where these efforts will be the responsibility of the crowd of suppliers. The proposed model consists of three entities: suppliers, customers, and a management party responsible for receiving, renting, booking, and demand matching with offered resources. It can allow suppliers to define the location of their private e-scooters/e-bikes and the period of time they are available for rent. Using a dataset of over 9 million e-scooter trips in Austin, Texas, we ran an agent-based simulation six times using three maximum battery ranges (i.e., 35, 45, and 60 km) and different numbers of e-scooters (e.g., 50 and 100) at each origin. Computational results show that the proposed model is promising and might be advantageous to shift the charging and maintenance efforts to a crowd of suppliers.

AB Model predictive control (MPC) for linear dynamical systems requires solving an optimal control structured quadratic program (QP) at each sampling instant. This article proposes a primal active-set strategy, called PRESAS, for the efficient solution of such block-sparse QPs, based on a preconditioned iterative solver to compute the search direction in each iteration. Rank-one factorization updates of the preconditioner result in a per-iteration computational complexity ofO(Nm2), wheremdenotes the number of state and control variables andNthe number of control intervals. Three different block-structured preconditioning techniques are presented and their numerical properties are studied further. In addition, an augmented Lagrangian based implementation is proposed to avoid a costly initialization procedure to find a primal feasible starting point. Based on a standalone C code implementation, we illustrate the computational performance ofPRESASagainst current state of the art QP solvers for multiple linear and nonlinear MPC case studies. We also show that the solver is real-time feasible on a dSPACE MicroAutoBox-II rapid prototyping unit for vehicle control applications, and numerical reliability is illustrated based on experimental results from a testbench of small-scale autonomous vehicles.

AB Freshwater ecosystems are vast areas that are constantly changing and evolving. To maintain the ecosystem as well as the structures located close to bodies of water, frequent monitoring is required. Although dangerous and time consuming, manual operations are the conventional way of monitoring such areas. Recently, Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) have been proposed to undertake the monitoring task. As any other platform, ASVs have limitations, such as a restricted point of view and access only where the water is sufficiently deep. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can fly over any terrain and provide a "bird's-eye-view" of the environment. However, UAVs have limited operational time due to power constraints. Heterogeneous marsupial robotic systems use different types of robots to augment their operation envelope, taking advantage of their individual strengths. A marsupial survey system comprised an ASV and a UAV for freshwater monitoring is developed and presented in this paper. This system is able to complete long missions and reach remote locations while also being able to generate detailed maps and inspections of points of interest. The system was thoroughly tested during a 6-month period in a number of field deployments in freshwater ecosystems at Lake Murray and at the Congaree River, SC, USA, to validate its capabilities.

AB Aerial networking using directional antennas (ANDA) is referred as a promising solution for the networking of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and for the fast provision of on-demand communication infrastructure to the ground. The cyber constraints on communication channel characteristics and physical constraints on the payload, power, and mobility of UAVs make it challenging to achieve a robust ANDA. In this study, the authors develop a decentralised control algorithm for directional antennas mounted on two moving UAVs to achieve a robust broad-band long-distance communication channel. In particular, the self-alignment of UAV-mounted directional antennas over a long distance is achieved through fusing the Global Positioning System (GPS) and communication channel characteristic measured by received signal strength indicator, using unscented Kalman filter and fuzzy logic. The solution significantly enhances the performance of wireless communication channel in imperfect environment subject to the unavailability of GPS signals and unstable strength of wireless signals. Finally, simulations are performed to validate the decentralised directional antenna control approach.

AB This paper proposes a novel adaptive fixed-time fault-tolerant control method for the fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) subject to asymmetric time-varying full state constraints. The UAV nonlinear dynamics of six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) with twelve-state-variables is considered in this article, rather than only longitudinal/lateral or attitude dynamics in most existing results. A novel Integral Barrier Lyapunov Function (IBLF) is applied for the first time to solve the control problem of the UAV with the asymmetric time-varying full state constraints, which reduces the conservativeness of the conventional IBLF-based method. Furthermore, a continuous switching function is introduced to solve the singularity problem which typically appears in the fixed-time control methods when tracking errors approach to zero. It is rigorously proved that all the states are forced in the asymmetric time-varying bounds and the tracking errors of velocity and attitude converge to a residual set around origin within fixed time. Finally, the simulation results are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB The Stop Number Problem arises in the management of a dial-a-ride system served by a fleet of autonomous electric vehicles. In such a system, clients request for a ride from an origin station to a destination station, and a fleet of capacitated vehicles must satisfy all requests. The goal is to minimize the number of pick-up/drop-off operations. In this paper we focus on a constrained unitary variant, called Unit Stop Number Problem, where each client requests for a single seat in the vehicles. This variant was recently conjectured to be NP-Hard. In this regard, we show how this problem relates to other problems known in the literature in order to derive some polynomial-time solvable variants. Moreover, we provide a positive answer to the conjecture by showing that the problem is NP-Hard for any fixed capacity greater than or equal to 2, even for the case where the graph of requests is restricted to the class of planar bipartite graphs. Our proof of NP-Hardness also improves the complexity results known in the literature for the related problems identified. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID BROADCAST; EFFICIENT; DESIGN
AB An autonomous driving environment poses a very stringent requirement for the timely delivery of safety messages in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). Time division multiple access (TDMA)-based medium access control (MAC) protocols are considered a promising solution because of their time-bound message delivery. However, in the event of mobility-caused packet collisions, they may experience an unpredicted and extended delay in delivering messages, which can cause catastrophic accidents. To solve this problem, a distributed TDMA-based MAC protocol with mobility-caused collision mitigation (MCCM-MAC) is presented in this paper. The protocol uses a novel mechanism to detect merging collisions and mitigates them by avoiding subsequent access collisions. One vehicle in the merging collisions retains the time slot, and the others release the slot. The common neighboring vehicles can timely suggest a suitable new time slot for the vacating vehicles, which can avoid access collisions between their packet transmissions. A tie-breakup mechanism is employed to avoid further access collisions. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol reduces packet loss more than the existing methods. Consequently, the average delay between the successfully delivered periodic messages is also reduced.

AB Removing the thrust termination mechanism of solid rocket motors is an inevitable trend but reduces the ability of terminal multi-constraints. This paper presents an improved analytic algorithm for rapid and automated ascent guidance of responsive small solid launch vehicles shutting off by fuel exhaustion. The proposed new analytical solution is solved for the two-point boundary value problem with coast arc and constraints of the given burn arc. A velocity increment control method is derived from the minimum steering angle constraints to dissipate the extra energy and an improved pointing algorithm is constructed to restrain the coupling vectors caused by the process of velocity increment control. Then, the solution of the improved pointing algorithm provides the direction of the velocity increment control and the effect of the additional coupling vectors on terminal constraints is suppressed by this direction. Finally, the application of the developed theoretical algorithm in this paper is conducted by using the last stage of all-solid launch vehicles. The proposed guidance method is verified by Monte Carlo simulations and the testing results demonstrate the adaptability, strong robustness and excellent performance for different orbital-insertion missions.

AB Along with the development of computer technology and informatization, the unmanned vehicle has become an important equipment in military, civil and some other fields. The navigation system is the basis and core of realizing the autonomous control and completing the task for unmanned vehicles, and the Strapdown Inertial Navigation System (SINS) is the preferred due to its autonomy and independence. The initial alignment technique is the premise and the foundation of the SINS, whose performance is susceptible to system nonlinearity and uncertainty. To improving system performance for SINS, an improved initial alignment algorithm is proposed in this manuscript. In the procedure of this presented initial alignment algorithm, the original signal of inertial sensors is denoised by utilizing the improved signal denoising method based on the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) firstly to suppress the high-frequency noise on coarse alignment. Afterwards, the accuracy and reliability of initial alignment is further enhanced by utilizing an improved Robust Huber Cubarure Kalman Filer (RHCKF) method to minimize the influence of system nonlinearity and uncertainty on the fine alignment. In addition, real tests are used to verify the availability and superiority of this proposed initial alignment algorithm.

The robust optimal control method, mu-Synthesis, applied to the autonomous flight dynamics control system of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) meets desired control performances. The serial connection between the Gumstix micro-computer and the Kestrel autopilot extends the ability to implement high order robust controllers. The code of the control algorithm implemented (in the C++ language) in the memory of a Gumstix Verdex Pro single-chip micro-computer enables optimization of the threads-based approach. The hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation mode was implemented in the Kestrel autopilot inner loop, and simulations of all stages of flight were performed in real-time using the actual model of the aircraft and autopilot. Finally, HIL simulations and tests were conducted in order to verify the developed control algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) carry a wealth of possible applications, many of which are limited by the vehicle's level of autonomy. The development of efficient and robust computer vision algorithms is a key factor in improving this, as they permit autonomous detection and thereby avoidance of obstacles. Recent developments in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the collection of increasingly diverse datasets, present opportunities for improved computer vision algorithms requiring less data and computational power. One area of potential improvement is the utilisation of temporal context from USV camera feeds in the form of sequential video frames to consistently identify obstacles in diverse marine environments under challenging conditions. This paper documents the implementation of this through long short-term memory (LSTM) cells in existing CNN structures and the exploration of parameters affecting their efficacy. It is found that LSTM cells are promising for achieving improved performance; however, there are weaknesses associated with network training procedures and datasets. Several novel network architectures are presented and compared using a state-of-the-art benchmarking method. It is shown that LSTM cells allow for better model performance with fewer training iterations, but that this advantage diminishes with additional training.

AB In the tasks of image aesthetic quality assessment, it is difficult to reach both the high score area and low score area due to the normal distribution of aesthetic datasets. To reduce the error in labelling and solve the problem of normal data distribution, we propose a new aesthetic mixed dataset with classification and regression called AMD-CR, and we train a meta reweighting network to reweight the loss of training data differently. In addition, we provide a training strategy according to different stages based on pseudo labels, and then we use it for aesthetic training according to different stages in classification and regression tasks. In the construction of the network structure, we construct an aesthetic adaptive block (AAB) structure that can adapt to any size of the input images. Besides, we also use the efficient channel attention (ECA) to strengthen the feature extracting ability of each task. The experimental result shows that our method improves 0.1112 compared with the conventional method in SROCC. The method can also help to find best aesthetic path planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and vehicles.

AB Collision avoidance for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) is significant for the fulfillment of autonomous navigation. Generally, classical collision-avoidance algorithms are proposed for relatively simple encounter situation, in this scenario only two USVs are stressed. Furthermore, to generate the rational manoeuvre operations, it is necessary that USVs should abide by International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea (COLREGS). However, COLREGS has not paid attention to rules for multi-USV collision-avoidance problem. Furthermore, those collision-avoidance rules in COLREGS have not been quantified for USVs. Following that, this paper utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to resolve collision-avoidance for USVs even in complex encounter situations. Within our DRL algorithm, related COLREGS is quantified properly and integrated into the DRL model, and then encounter situation of USVs is formulated as environmental observation value, accordingly a set of decision making is reached by decision-making neural network, and the reward function is designed for updating network parameters iteratively. Consequently, collision avoidance for USVs can be achieved eventually. By employing our DRL algorithm, collision avoidance for USVs under generous complex scenarios are resolved with the aid of corresponding intelligent decision-making operations.

AB The dominant navigation system for low-cost, mass-market Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is based on an Inertial Navigation System (INS) coupled with a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). However, problems tend to arise during periods of GNSS outage where the navigation solution degrades rapidly. Therefore, this paper details a model-based integration approach for fixed wing UAVs, using the Vehicle Dynamics Model (VDM) as the main process model aided by low-cost Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) inertial sensors and GNSS measurements with moment of inertia calibration using an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). Results show that the position error does not exceed 14.5 m in all directions after 140 s of GNSS outage. Roll and pitch errors are bounded to 0.06 degrees and the error in yaw grows slowly to 0.65 degrees after 140 s of GNSS outage. The filter is able to estimate model parameters and even the moment of inertia terms even with significant coupling between them. Pitch and yaw moment coefficient terms present significant cross coupling while roll moment terms seem to be decorrelated from all of the other terms, whilst more dynamic manoeuvres could help to improve the overall observability of the parameters.

TI An Underwater SINS/DVL Integrated System Outlier Interference
   Suppression Method Based on LSTM-EEWKF

DE Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV); exponentially weighed moving
   average; extended exponential weighted Kalman filter (EEWKF); long
   short-term memory (LSTM); strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS);
   Doppler velocity log (DVL) integrated system
AB At present, strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) and Doppler velocity logs (DVLs) integrated navigation is a common way for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to conduct underwater operations. The complex and changeable Marine environment easily leads to unknown noise and outliers in the measurement information of DVL. When the DVL is disturbed by outliers, the positioning accuracy will be reduced. In order to solve this problem, a long short-term memory extended exponential weighted Kalman filter (LSTM-EEWKF) algorithm assisted by long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is proposed. When the DVL works normally, the SINS/DVL integrated navigation system is iteratively learned by the LSTM neural network. When the DVL is disturbed by outliers, the trained LSTM neural network is first used to provide correction information for the system, and then, the extended exponential weighted Kalman filter (EEWKF) algorithm is used to make the system continue to work. The EEWKF algorithm realizes weight allocation for different historical moments by introducing an exponential weighting coefficient, which reduces the weight of the estimator when the SINS/DVL integrated system is disturbed by outliers. It can effectively reduce the impact of outliers and historical data on the positioning results of integrated navigation. The simulation and Yangtze River experiment show that the proposed algorithm has higher positioning accuracy than several hybrid algorithms. It can suppress outliers more effectively and make the system more robust.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) generate a massive amount of multi-modal data that once collected and processed through Machine Learning algorithms, enable AI-based services at the Edge. In fact, only a subset of the collected data present informative attributes to be exploited at the Edge. Therefore, extracting such a subset is of utmost importance to limit computation and communication workloads. Doing that in a distributed manner imposes the AVs to cooperate in finding an agreement on which attributes should be sent to the Edge. In this work, we address such a problem by proposing a federated feature selection (FFS) algorithm where the AVs collaborate to filter out, iteratively, the less relevant attributes in a distributed manner, without any exchange of raw data, thought two different components: a Mutual-Information-based feature selection algorithm run by the AVs and a novel aggregation function based on the Bayes theorem executed on the Edge. The FFS algorithm has been tested on two reference datasets: MAV with images and inertial measurements of a monitored vehicle, WESAD with a collection of samples from biophysical sensors to monitor a relative passenger. The numerical results show that the AVs converge to a minimum achievable subset of features with both the datasets, i.e., 24 out of 2166 (99%) in MAV and 4 out of 8 (50%) in WESAD, respectively, preserving the informative content of data.

AB Ship intelligence has been a hot topic in recent years. How to achieve autonomous maneuvers in a complex marine environment in a safe, efficient, and low-cost manner is a fundamental task that ocean engineers face. This paper presents a two-stage trajectory planning scheme to address the minimum-time maneuvering problem in close-range encounters. The scheme is robust and versatile, as it can deal with the complex spatial variability, such as sea current, state constraints, marine traffic, and physical constraints, of close-range maneuvering. In the first stage, a directed graph with variable length is generated according to the sea current distribution. A wavefront search is applied on the graph to explore the reachability, the cost of state constraints, and the risk of collision. After a discrete solution has been found, the second stage involves searching for a smooth solution. A Bezier curve based parameter optimization approach is proposed to get rid of limited moving directions in the directed graph and explore around the discrete path. The result will be a near-optimal, smooth path. The proposed scheme has been tested to solve the Zermelo's ship steering problem and several other close-range maneuvering problems. The results demonstrate that the scheme is efficient in generating smoothed minimum-time trajectories for surface vessels when maneuvering in close-range encounters.

AB Accurate sensor localization is a crucial requirement for the deployment of underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) in a large variety of applications. However, the asynchronous clock, stratification effect and mobility characteristics of underwater environment make it challenging to realize accurate node localization for UASNs. This paper develops an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) aided localization solution for UASNs, subjected to asynchronous clock, stratification effect and mobility constraints in cyber channels. A hybrid architecture including surface buoys, AUVs, active and passive sensor nodes, is first presented to construct a cooperative location-aware network. Then, an iterative least squares estimator is developed for AUVs to capture the unknown water current parameters, through which the relationship between propagation delay and location estimation can be established. With the assistance of AUVs, two asynchronous localization algorithms are designed to estimate the locations of active and passive sensor nodes. Particularly, motion and ray compensation strategies are jointly employed to improve the localization accuracy. It is worth noticing that, the proposed localization algorithms incorporate the current field estimation into the localization process of UASNs, and more importantly, they can eliminate the influences of asynchronous clock, stratification effect and node mobility together. Moreover, performance analyses for the proposed localization solution are also presented. Finally, simulation and experimental results reveal that the node localization accuracy in this paper can be significantly improved as compared with the other works.

AB The use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for various applications have grown with maturing technology and improved accessibility. The deployment of AUVs for under-ice marine science research in the Antarctic is one such example. However, a higher risk of AUV loss is present during such endeavors due to the extremities in the Antarctic. A thorough analysis of risks is therefore crucial for formulating effective risk control policies and achieving a lower risk of loss. Existing risk analysis approaches focused predominantly on the technical aspects, as well as identifying static cause and effect relationships in the chain of events leading to AUV loss. Comparatively, the complex interrelationships between risk variables and other aspects of risk such as human errors have received much lesser attention. In this article, a systems-based risk analysis framework facilitated by system dynamics methodology is proposed to overcome existing shortfalls. To demonstrate usefulness of the framework, it is applied on an actual AUV program to examine the occurrence of human error during Antarctic deployment. Simulation of the resultant risk model showed an overall decline in human error incident rate with the increase in experience of the AUV team. Scenario analysis based on the example provided policy recommendations in areas of training, practice runs, recruitment policy, and setting of risk tolerance level. The proposed risk analysis framework is pragmatically useful for risk analysis of future AUV programs to ensure the sustainability of operations, facilitating both better control and monitoring of risk.

AB The Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology (KIOST) has developed AUVs for survey on the swallow sea, and is under developing a deep-sea AUV based on the former experience. Since 2010, the AUV named ISiMI6000 was designed to explore the deep-seabed topography and hydrothermal vent up to 6,000 m depth. ISiMI6000 was designed witha cylindrical shape having Myringform to minimize fluid resistance. It has one main thruster and four control planes, of which the maximum speed is 4 knots and has over 1.5 knots in up/down direction. It equips with an underwater navigation system composed of Ultra Short Baseline (USBL), Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), Obstacle Avoid System (OAS), and Global Positioning System (GPS). Its communication tools are Acoustic Telemetry Modem (ATM) under the sea and Radio Frequency (RF) modem at surface. Oceanographic sensors were equipped for precise survey on the deep-sea floor, such as Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD), Side Scan Sonar (SSS), methane sensor, and sub-bottom profiler (SBP) in optional. A HD Camera and LED light was installed for monitoring the sea floor, and an emergency managing device was designed with a weight drop system, a radio beacon and a xenon flash.

AB The paper presents an idea of the surveillance sensor set on-board a miniature Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Because of the strong influence of the atmospheric conditions (winds, thermals, air movements in general) on the airplane behaviour, there is a need for platform stabilization. It is required in order to make use of the sensors in actual operation. In the presented paper the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is considered to be the most important as well as the most demanding sensor. Two methods of platform stabilization are shown and discussed: the hybrid (electro-rnechanical) method and electronic compensation method.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained much popularity for a wide variety of applications that do not require human operators, but also face the spectrum scarcity problem. To address this problem, a cognitive UAV network (CUAVN) framework based on cognitive radio (CR) technology is formulated in this article. On the basis of this, the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) is used as a fundamental cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) scheme to significantly reduce the average number of samples, but the uncertainty of its detection delay has a negative impact on the spectrum-sensing performance and the achievable throughput of CUAVNs, especially in the multiband spectrum sensing. Considering the location flexibility and uneven distribution density of UAVs, we design an intraframe CSS structure, with aim of achieving CSS between microsensing slots. Furthermore, a sequential maximal truncation (SMT) is proposed to realize a quick multiband spectrum sensing for delay-constraint CUAVNs. Compared to uniform tail truncation (UTT), simulation results show that the proposed quick multiband spectrum sensing with the help of SMT requires fewer sensing times in support of better sensing performance and achievable throughput, especially under a strict delay constraint.

AB In this article, a parallel and gradient-free strategy is presented for autonomous navigation of a quadrotor with a limited field of view (FOV). The FOV constraint is nonlinear and noncontinuous in general and involves higher order dynamics of the vehicle. Planning problems with such constraints are difficult to solve, especially with the real-time requirement. The proposed method first constructs an environment map by integrating the measurement of a limited-FOV sensor in a parallel process. Based on the map, it then selects a feasible local goal from a global path and generates a constraint-free nominal control sequence. Finally, a stochastic optimal control problem is solved to satisfy the limited FOV constraint, the dynamic constraint, and the collision-free conditions at the same time. The objective functions are nonlinear and noncontinuous and involves dynamic of MAV. A parallel-gradient-free algorithm is used to address these problems. Both the sensing and planning problems are solved parallelly on a lightweight graphics processing unit. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated through both simulation and real-flight experiments.

AB An autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial remote-sensing system was developed for multispectral imaging of agricultural farms. This system consists of on-board and ground-station subsystems. The on-board subsystem was equipped with body and wings, eight DC brushless motors and eight speed controls, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a global positioning system (GPS), a rechargeable three-cell lithium-polymer battery, a high-resolution multispectral camera, camera mount, and autopilot intelligent navigation system. The ground station was equipped with a radio control, TV monitor, laptop, and flight monitor software. In addition, a telemetry system was used to communicate between the on-board and ground-station subsystems. To investigate the performance of the UAV, several flight tests were carried out in wheat farms, and some technical features of the system were investigated. The acquired imageries were processed and evaluated. The spatial resolution of the imagery obtained from a height of 10-250 m was 3.6 -95 mm/pixel, respectively. Based on the results, the UAV remote-sensing system proved to be extremely promising for monitoring the temporal changes in the studied farm. The supervised classification map with 94% overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 0.9 emphasized the conclusions.

AB We consider the geometric problem of deciding whether a narrow planar passage can be traversed by a curve that satisfies prespecified upper bounds on its curvature. This problem is of importance for path- and motion-planning of autonomous mobile robots, particularly when vehicle dynamical constraints are considered during planning. For a special case of narrow passages, namely, rectangular channels, we present a fast numerical algorithm to determine if a given channel may be traversed via curvature-bounded paths. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can affirm traversability in cases where the most recent result in the literature fails.

The system uses a computer vision algorithm to detect the number of cars in images captured by a set of strategically placed cameras at every intersection. Using this information, the system selects the sequence of actions that optimize traffic flow within the control area, in a simulated scenario. The results obtained show that the system reduces the delay times for each vehicle by 20% and that the controller is able to adapt smoothly to different flow changes.

AB With the continuous development of automatic driving technology and advancements in related experimental research, the probability of traffic accidents caused by human factors has been greatly reduced. However, people are still cautious about the safety of automated driving technology. The purpose of this study was to investigate users' perceived safety indicators and the psychological factors of their perceived safety judgment of self-driving buses. In this study, a structural model of the factors that influence self-driving buses, including behavioral intention of technology acceptance, trust theory, perceived risk, and perceived safety, was developed based on the technology acceptance model (TAM). Subsequently, a relevant survey of 215 respondents was conducted and analyzed using the partial least squares method. The results indicated that trust, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use were important factors for judging the perceived safety of self-driving buses. The structural model developed in this study can quantify and analyze user data to filter out the factors that influence the perceived safety of self-driving buses, which is conducive to improving people's trust and acceptance of self-driving buses.

AB The promise of low latency connectivity and efficient bandwidth utilization has driven the recent shift from vehicular cloud computing (VCC) towards vehicular edge computing (VEC). This paper presents an advanced deep learning-based computational offloading algorithm for multilevel vehicular edge-cloud computing networks. To conserve energy and guarantee the efficient utilization of shared resources among multiple vehicles, an integration model of computational offloading, and resource allocation is formulated as a binary optimization problem to minimize the total cost of the entire system in terms of time and energy. However, this problem is considered NP-hard and it is computationally prohibitive to solve this type of problem, particularly for large-scale vehicles, due to the curse-of-dimensionality problem. Therefore, an equivalent reinforcement learning form is generated and we propose a distributed deep learning algorithm to find the near-optimal computational offloading decisions in which a set of deep neural networks are used in parallel. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can exhibit fast convergence and significantly reduce the overall consumption of an entire system compared to the benchmark solutions.

AB A modular nonlinear observer is considered for tightly coupled integration of inertial measurements with global satellite measurements. A real-time-kinematic (RTK) approach is utilized where the rover and base station measure pseudoranges, carrier-phase, and carrier-phase derived Doppler, to be used in a dual receiver configuration. The modular observer design consists of a nonlinear attitude observer and a translational motion observer (TMO). The attitude observer represents the vehicle attitude as unit quaternions and estimates the gyro bias. A TMO based on the double-differenced measurements between the rover and base station receiver is proposed. The ambiguities introduced by the carrier-phase measurements are included in the state vector and are initially considered real valued, later to be resolved to integer values. The advantages of the nonlinear observer compared with a Kalman filter are reduced computational load, no linearization requirement of the model, and proven stability. The proposed observer is verified using experimental data from flights with an unmanned aerial vehicle, where the position estimates are shown to be within 2-4 cm of a global positioning system L-1-based RTK reference solution.

AB This paper deals with the development of a decentralized event-based control strategy applied to the leader-following consensus problem of a group of two-wheeled self-balancing robots so called mobile inverted pendulum (MIP). The MIP's nonlinear mathematical model which includes the dynamics of the actuators is presented. Then, the model around an operating point is considered which allows to exploit the differential flatness property of the system, permitting a complete parametrization in terms of the flat output. Assuming that the vehicle network exchange information through a directed and strongly connected graph, a decentralized control law is designed, and an event-based algorithm is developed. Then each MIP decides, based on the difference of its current state and its latest broadcast state, when it has to send a new value to its neighbors. The stability of the complete system is carried out in the Lyapunov sense together with the ISS (Input-to-State Stability) approach. Numerical results show the advantages wrt information exchange between MIPs, as well as a good performance in the angular stabilization under two scenarios: regulation and tracking problem.

AB In real-time trajectory planning for unmanned vehicles, on-board sensors, radars and other instruments are used to collect information on possible obstacles to be avoided and pathways to be followed. Since, in practice, observations of the sensors have measurement errors, the stochasticity of the data has to be incorporated into the models. In this paper, we consider using a genetic algorithm for the constrained optimization problem of finding the trajectory with minimum length between two locations, avoiding the obstacles on the way. To incorporate the variability of the sensor readings, we propose a modified genetic algorithm, addressing the stochasticity of the feasible regions. In this way, the probability that a possible solution in the search space, say x, is feasible can be derived from the random observations of obstacles and pathways, creating a real-time data learning algorithm. By building a confidence region from the observed data such that its border intersects with the solution point x, the level of the confidence region defines the probability that x is feasible. We propose using a smooth penalty function based on the Gaussian distribution, facilitating the borders of the feasible regions to be reached by the algorithm.

AB Traffic lights optimization is one of the principal components to lessen the traffic flow and travel time in an urban area. The present article seeks to introduce a novel procedure to design the traffic lights in a city using evolutionary-based optimization algorithms in combination with an ontology-based driving behavior simulation framework. Accordingly, an ontology-based knowledge base is introduced to provide a machine-understandable knowledge of roads and intersections, traffic rules, and driving behaviors. Then, a simulation environment is developed to inspect car behavior in real time. To optimize the traffic lights, a sine-based equation was defined for each traffic light, and the total travel time of the vehicles was considered as the cost function in the optimization algorithm. The optimization was performed with 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 vehicles in the urban areas. Based on the results, in contrast to uncontrolled intersections without traffic lights, optimized traffic lights can significantly contribute to total travel time-saving. To conclude, due to an escalation in the number of vehicles, the significance of optimized traffic lights has encountered an increase, and unoptimized traffic lights could increase total travel time even more than a city deprived of any traffic light.

AB Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are deployed in Novel Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccine distribution process. To address issues of fake vaccine distribution, real-time massive UAV monitoring and control at nodal centers (NCs), the authors propose SanJeeVni, a blockchain (BC)-assisted UAV vaccine distribution at the backdrop of sixth-generation (6G) enhanced ultra-reliable low latency communication (6G-eRLLC) communication. The scheme considers user registration, vaccine request, and distribution through a public Solana BC setup, which assures a scalable transaction rate. Based on vaccine requests at production setups, UAV swarms are triggered with vaccine delivery to NCs. An intelligent edge offloading scheme is proposed to support UAV coordinates and routing path setups. The scheme is compared against fifth-generation (5G) uRLLC communication. In the simulation, we achieve and 86% improvement in service latency, 12.2% energy reduction of UAV with 76.25% more UAV coverage in 6G-eRLLC, and a significant improvement of approximate to 199.76% in storage cost against the Ethereum network, which indicates the scheme efficacy in practical setups.

AB With the benefits of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), they can be combined to further enhance the communication performance. However, the high-quality air-ground channel is more vulnerable to the adversarial eavesdropping. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a covert communication scheme assisted by the UAV-IRS to maximize the covert transmission rate. Specifically, the ground transmitter, Alice, secretly delivers the private message to a legitimate receiver, Bob, via the UAV-IRS, wishing that the transmission will not be observable by the warden, Willie. In addition, Willie is adversarial to Alice and the UAV-IRS, which makes his accurate location difficult to obtain. Given this fact, we first determine an optimal detection threshold and derive the error detection probability at Willie, which is the worst-case situation for the legitimate transmission. Then, we maximize the covert transmission rate by alternatively optimizing the transmit power of Alice, the IRS phase shift and the horizontal location of UAV-IRS subject to the covert requirements. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed covert communication scheme assisted by UAV-IRS.

AB Object detection on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images is a recent research hotspot. Existing object detection methods have achieved good results on general scenes, but there are inherent challenges with UAV images. The detection accuracy of UAV images is limited by complex backgrounds, significant scale differences, and densely arranged small objects. To solve these problems, we propose a UAV image object detection network based on self-attention guidance and multiscale feature fusion (SGMFNet). First, we design a global-local feature guidance (GLFG) module. This module can effectively combine local information and global information, which makes the model focus on the object area and reduces the impact of complex background. Second, an improved parallel sampling feature fusion (PSFF) module is designed to efficiently fuse multiscale features. Third, we design an inverse-residual feature enhancement (IFE) module, which is embedded in the front of the newly added detection head to enhance feature extraction on small objects. Finally, we conduct a large number of experiments on the VisDrone2019 dataset. The results show that the proposed SGMFNet outperforms other popular methods and has achieved good results in many scenarios.

AB With the deep integration between the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and wireless communication, UAV-based air-to-ground (AG) propagation channels need more detailed descriptions and accurate models. In this paper, we aim to conduct cluster-based characterization and modeling for AG channels. To our best knowledge, this is the first study that concentrates on the clustering and tracking of multipath components (MPCs) for time-varying AG channels. Based on measurement data at 6.5 GHz with a bandwidth of 500 MHz, we first estimate potential MPCs utilizing the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. Then, we cluster the extracted MPCs by employing K-Power-Means (KPM) algorithm under multipath component distance (MCD) measure. For characterizing time-variant clusters, we exploit a clustering-based tracking (CBT) method, which efficiently quantifies the survival lengths of clusters. Ultimately, we establish a cluster-based channel model, and validations illustrate the accuracy of the proposed model. This work not only promotes a better understanding of AG propagation channels but also provides a general cluster-based AG channel model with certain extensibility.

AB Platelets participate in many important physiological processes, including hemostasis and immunity. However, despite their broad participation in these evolutionarily critical roles, the anucleate platelet is uniquely mammalian. In contrast with the large nucleated equivalents in lower vertebrates, we find that the design template for the evolutionary specialization of platelets shares remarkable similarities with human-engineered unmanned aerial vehicles in terms of overall autonomy, maneuverability, and expendability. Here, we review evidence illustrating how platelets are uniquely suited for surveillance and the manner in which they consequently provide various types of support to other cell types.

AB The problem of inclination change in near-circular orbit using intermittent, low thrust solar electric propulsion is analyzed. Given the shadow are length and the line of nodes of initial to final orbits, piecewise constant yaw angles are selected, and the location along the orbit where the yaw angle switches is optimized to carry out the largest inclination change per revolution for that particular geometry. Single-switch and two-switch strategics are analyzed, and several algorithms of varying complexity are described and numerically tested for their relative performance. This approach yields suboptimal but robust and real-time autonomous onboard guidance software for electric orbit transfer vehicle orbital transfer applications.

AB Permanent magnet (PM) motors are widely employed in the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) propulsion because of their high efficiency and torque density. Since the AUV housings are sealed and narrow, motors are vulnerable to the risk of overheating, leading to dissolution of the winding insulation and demagnetization of the permanent magnets. In this study, a self-adjusting cooling scheme was proposed, which uses the hydrodynamic pressure to pump seawater into the cooling channel automatically. Firstly, the mathematical model of the flow field and heat transfer was established using equation derivations. Subsequently, to clarify the characteristics of the self-adjusting cooling system, the effect of the AUV speed on the thermal and fluid characteristics was investigated using computational fluid dynamics. Results show that the flow rate in the channel increases from 2 to 8.1 L/min as the AUV speed increases from 15 to 50 kn, resulting in the improvement of the heat transfer coefficient from 41 to 764 W/(m2 center dot K). Subsequently, the influences of inlet and outlet on the thermal characteristics were studied and found to be beneficial for improving the cooling performance. To investigate the spiral flow channels, the distribution coefficient kC and shape factor Rf were defined. Compared to the closed-cycle cooling system for the AUV propulsion motor, the proposed cooling system eliminated auxiliary devices such as pumps and heat exchangers, which makes it more compact and efficient for AUVs. However, introducing seawater into the AUV housing poses a risk of liquid leakage.

ID TRAFFIC CONTROL; ROAD-JUNCTION
AB In logical terms, a 2D map is a polymorphic form of linear objects made from practical features like roads, cartos (geometrical representation of a collection of buildings or specific features), roundabouts, highways, and many more. As autonomous vehicle disrupts transportation and navigation, there is a need to detect and identify map features at a granular level with no human intervention. This paper focuses on one of the practical problems, i.e. determining whether a junction is part of roundabouts using the Map domain, which is a novel approach to the best of the knowledge of an author. In a roundabout, the junction is the node having entry or exit of roads in or away from it. Closed loops in roads are extracted by traversing each link and checking for the common junctions using a deterministic algorithm. Loops can be formed not only by roundabouts it can be present at any intersection of roads, from all the universal sets of junctions; identifying the pattern and finding the right junctions of a roundabout is a very challenging and exciting problem. The authors have solved this problem in two parts; data extraction is done by collecting all the roads of America and Europe and then features are extracted, which depend on logical and domain knowledge. Finally, for the fuzzy part of features, a machine model that provides an efficient accuracy of 81% is created as it reduces lots of manual effort for verifying and correcting junctions. This applied methodology is easy to implement.

AB Existing works have explored anchor deployment for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) localization under the assumption that sound propagates straightly underwater at a constant speed. Considering that the underwater acoustic waves propagate along bent curves at varying speeds in practice, it becomes much more challenging to determine a proper anchor deployment configuration. In this paper, taking the practical variability of underwater sound speed into account, we investigate the anchor-AUV geometry problem in a 3-D time-of-flight-based underwater scenario from the perspective of localization accuracy. To address this problem, we first rigorously derive the Jacobian matrix of measurement errors to quantify the Cramer-Rao lower hound (CRIB) with a widely-adopted isogradient sound speed profile. We then formulate an optimization problem that minimizes the trace of the CRLB subject to the angle and range constraints to figure out the anchor-AUV geometry, which is multivariate and nonlinear, and thus generally hard to handle. For mathematical tractability, by adopting tools from the estimation theory, we interestingly find that this problem can be equivalently transformed into a more explicit univariate optimization problem. By this, we obtain an easy-to-implement anchor-AUV geometry that yields satisfactory localization performance, referred to as the uniform sea-surface circumference (USC) deployment. Extensive simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and show that our proposed USC scheme outperforms both the cube and the random deployment schemes in terms of localization accuracy under the same parameter settings.

The use of a Nd:YAP gain crystal may have certain advantages, such as polarization and wavelength stability, over the more common Nd:YAG active medium. Constructed Nd:YAP/V:YAG compact laser provides linearly polarized radiation at a wavelength of 1342 nm. Stable pulses 12 ns long with energy up to almost 0.2 mJ were generated. This laser system could serve as an eye-safe radiation source of long-range high-resolution LIDAR for autonomous vehicle control.

AB In this paper we present the design of a sliding mode controller for attitude control of spacecraft actuated by three orthogonal reaction wheels. The equilibrium of the closed loop system is proved to be asymptotically stable in the sense of Lyapunov. Due to cases where spacecraft do not have angular velocity measurements, an estimator for the generalized velocity is derived and asymptotic stability is proven for the observer. The approach is tested on an experimental platform with a sphere shaped Autonomous Underwater Vehicle SATellite: AUVSAT, developed at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

AB The ability to locate a target around a corner is crucial in situations where it is impractical or unsafe to physically move around the obstruction. However, current techniques are limited to long acquisition times as they rely on single-photon counting for precise arrival time measurements. Here, we demonstrate a single-shot non-line-of-sight range-finding method operating at 10 Hz and capable of detecting a moving human target up to distances of 3 m around a corner. Due to the potential data acquisition speeds, this technique will find applications in search and rescue and autonomous vehicles.

AB First-excursion times have been developed extensively in the literature for oscillators; one major application is structural dynamics of buildings. Using the fact that most closed-loop systems operate with a moderate to high damping ratio, we have derived a new procedure for calculating first-excursion times for a class of linear continuous, time-varying systems. In several examples, we show that the algorithm is both accurate and time-efficient. These are important attributes for real-time path planning in stochastic environments, and hence the work should be useful for autonomous robotic systems involving marine and air vehicles.

AB Gravity-aided inertial navigation is a leading issue in the application of autonomous underwater vehicle. An improved gravity matching algorithm, based on the principle of the terrain contour matching (TERCOM) algorithm, is proposed. The matching algorithm applies the shortest path algorithm to increase update frequency. In addition, the positioning error can be limited due to the novel correlation analysis method. Compared with existing algorithms, the improved TERCOM algorithm has better real-time performance, positioning accuracy, and reduced calculation burden. The reliability and the accuracy of the algorithm are verified via simulation tests.

AB Unmanned micro air vehicle control in pitch plane is quite challenging. In order to develop an autonomous navigation scheme in pitch plane, longitudinal autopilot design for flight control modes such as take-off, landing, climb, altitude hold, etc., have been actively pursued in the literature. The aircraft trajectories that a controller generates are important to understand these modes. In this paper, it is shown that a multiple input system can offer infinitely a large number of trajectory options that can be used to develop various flight control modes and plan an MAV navigation scheme. Accordingly, the controllers are determined. An MAV example is considered and trajectory options for climb and descend modes are illustrated.

AB In this paper, we consider team (swarm) of unmanned vehicles (UVs) equipped with various sensors (videos, chemicals, etc). Those swarms need efficient communication to feed sensed data, communicate data to other swarms, to navigate and, more generally, to carry out complex mission autonomously. We focus on a particular aspect of mission oriented communications, namely, team multicast. In team multicast, the multicast group does not consist of individual members, rather, of teams. In our case, the teams may consist of special UVs that have been established to launch a search and rescue mission. Simulation results illustrate the performance benefits of the team multicast solution as compared with more traditional multicast approaches.

ID INTELLIGENT REFLECTING SURFACES
AB The recent trend towards the smart transportation system has spurred the development of the smart railway. However, enabling trains with seamless wireless connectivity using the roadside units (RSUs) is extremely challenging, mostly due to the lack of line of sight link. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that uses intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS)-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to provide line of sight communication to the smart railway system. First, we formulate the optimization problem where the objective is to maximize the minimum achievable rate of trains by jointly optimizing the trajectory of UAV and the phase-shift of IRS. Due to the non-convex nature of the formulated problem, it is decomposed into two subproblems: IRS phase-shift problem and UAV trajectory optimization problem. Next, a Binary Integer Linear Programming (BILP) and a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) are constructed in order to solve our decomposed problems. Finally, comprehensive numerical results are provided in order to show the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

AB Being a key technology for beyond fifth-generation wireless systems, joint communication and radar sensing (JCAS) utilizes the reflections of communication signals to detect foreign objects and deliver situational awareness. A cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is uniquely suited to form a mobile bistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with its serving base station (BS) to sense over large areas with superb sensing resolutions at no additional requirement of spectrum. This paper designs this novel BS-UAV bistatic SAR platform, and optimizes the flight path of the UAV to minimize its propulsion energy and guarantee the required sensing resolutions on a series of interesting landmarks. A new trajectory planning algorithm is developed to convexify the propulsion energy and resolution requirements by using successive convex approximation and block coordinate descent. Effective trajectories are obtained with a polynomial complexity. Extensive simulations reveal that the proposed trajectory planning algorithm outperforms significantly its alternative that minimizes the flight distance of cellular-aided sensing missions in terms of energy efficiency and effective consumption fluctuation. The energy saving offered by the proposed algorithm can be as significant as 55%.

AB Modern road vehicles are employing features of driver assistance systems (DAS) to improve drivability performance, comfort, and safety. In the future perspective, the advances in this field will lead these systems to the level of autonomous and cooperative driving, based on sensors networks and sensor fusion. This paper aims to present the readers a novel strategy for lane detection and tracking, which fits as a functional requirement to deploy DAS features like Lane Departure Warning and Lane Keeping Assist. To achieve the presented results, the digital image processing was divided into three levels. At the low-level, the input image dimensionality is reduced from three to one layer, the sharpness is improved, and region of interest is defined based on the minimum safe distance from the vehicle ahead. The feature extractor for lane edges detection design is part of the mid-level processing. The lane tracking strategy development is discussed in the high-level stage; Hough Transform and a shape-preserving spline interpolation are used to achieve a smooth lane fitting. The experimental outcomes were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated using a ground truth comparison. The strategy shows good accuracy levels, including scenarios with shadows, curves, and road slope.

AB For solving the trajectory tracking problem of the underwater vehicle and manipulator system (UVMS) in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and time-varying external disturbances, this paper presents an indirect adaptive control scheme which consists of three parts: an extended Kalman filter (EKF) estimation compensative system, a model-based computed torque controller (CTC), a Hoc, robust compensative tracking controller. The contribution of our method is that it can overcome the disadvantages of existing control schemes, which are based on the accurate dynamic model of UVMS, known statistics unmodeled dynamics/external disturbances (e.g., constant or Gaussian), or the accurate, efficient system feedback measurement states by the sensors. According to the Lyapunov stability theorem, it is shown that the proposed indirect adaptive control scheme can guarantee its embedded Hoo robust controller tracking performance for our UVMS. Simulations show that the proposed control scheme can satisfy the design requirements of UVMS in rapid convergence, tracking accuracy, system stability and disturbance attenuation. Therefore, the method presented in this paper can provide a feasible way of controlling the nonlinear UVMS.

AB The new method which uses the consensus algorithm to solve the coordinate control problems of multiple unmanned underwater vehicles (multi-UUVs) formation in the case of leader-following is adapted. As the communication between the UUVs is difficult and it is easy to be interfered under the water, time delay is assumed to be time-varying during the members communicate with each other. Meanwhile, the state feedback linearization method is used to transfer the nonlinear and coupling model of UUV into double-integrator dynamic. With this simplified double-integrator math model, the UUV formation coordinate control is regarded as consensus problem with time-varying communication delays. In addition, the position and velocity topologies are adapted to reduce the data volume in each data packet which is sent between members in formation. With two independent topologies designed, two cases of communication delay which are same and different are considered and the sufficient conditions are proposed and analyzed. The stability of the multi-UUVs formation is proven by using Lyapunov-Razumikhin theorem. Finally, the simulation results are presented to confirm and illustrate the theoretical results.

AB This paper proposes a capacity model to address the impact of automated dedicated lanes on the capacity of the signalized intersection. Firstly, the car-following modes in the mixed traffic flow are analyzed, and the influence of the setting of the automated dedicated lanes on the average headway is discussed. Secondly, a new capacity model with automated dedicated lanes is derived based on the classic capacity model. Then, a signalized intersection capacity model considering the automated dedicated lanes is further derived based on the saturation flow rate method. Finally, numerical simulation experiments are designed to discuss the key parameters on the traffic capacity of a signalized intersection. The results show that (i) the automated dedicated lanes are conducive to improving the traffic capacity; (ii) when the penetration rate of CAVs is less than 52%, the traffic capacity of the signalized intersection can be increased by nearly 1.25 times with the automated dedicated lanes. These findings can provide theoretical support for designing and optimizing signalized intersections in high levels (i.e. L3-L5) CAVs environments.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL
AB A source-seeking algorithm for mobile robots is a method for the robot to locate and move towards a specific source, such as a light or sound. Developing such algorithms typically involves using sensors, such as cameras or microphones, to detect the source and calculate its location. The algorithm may also incorporate feedback mechanisms to adjust the robot's movement in real time based on changes in the environment or the location of the source. In autonomous vehicles, the problem of seeking the source of a scalar signal as a non-holonomic unicycle is a control problem where the goal is for the vehicle to navigate to the location of the signal's source while maintaining a stable trajectory. In this paper, a control algorithm which was designed to take into account the non-holonomic constraints as well as the noise in the signal of the unicycle model was used to solve this problem and guide the vehicle to the source of the signal while maintaining stability. Additionally, this research suggests a source-seeking algorithm based on Extremum-seeking control (ESC) as an optimization technique to get beyond the limitations listed above. The simulation results show that the stability of the proposed system almost reached 100%.

AB Efficient traffic light control is a critical part of realizing smart transportation. In particular, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms that use deep neural networks (DNNs) have superior autonomous decision-making ability. Most existing work has applied DRL to control traffic lights intelligently. In this article, we propose a novel context-aware multiagent broad reinforcement learning (CAMABRL) approach based on broad reinforcement learning (BRL) for mixed pedestrian-vehicle adaptive traffic light control (ATLC). CAMABRL exploits the broad learning system (BLS) established in a flat network structure to make decisions instead of a deep network structure. Unlike previous works that consider the attributes of vehicles, CAMABRL also takes the states of pedestrians waiting at the intersection into consideration. Combining with the context-aware mechanism that utilizes the states of adjacent agents and potential state information captured by the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, agents can make farsighted decisions to alleviate traffic congestion. The experimental results show that CAMABRL is superior to several state-of-the-art multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods.

AB The development of modern software-defined networking (SDN) solutions brings new opportunities in Internet-of-Vehicles (IoVs). However, the autonomous nature of the vehicular environment leads to unpredictable security vulnerabilities and reliability issues. The high computation overhead and storage requirements also pose a significant challenge in message dissemination. To overcome these issues, we introduce a lightweight blockchain-based security protocol for secure communication and storage in SDN-enabled IoV, known as LBSV. The LBSV is a permissioned blockchain network that uses the proposed modified practical byzantine fault tolerance (mPBFT) consensus algorithm. Additionally, the SDN-enabled network exploits the blockchain framework and schedules different procedures. The secure message dissemination is achieved through various cryptographic functions (i.e., elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and the secure hash algorithm (SHA256)). The security analysis shows that the LBSV withstands various cyberattacks regarding message dissemination privacy. The experimental results show that LBSV provides high performance with 85% less computational cost, 55% less storage and communication overhead and 90% less consensus delay compared with state-of-the-art schemes.

AB This article deals with the issue of designing a flight tracking controller for an unmanned aerial vehicle type of quadrotor based on an optimal model-free fuzzy logic control approach. The main design objective is to perform an automatic flight trajectory tracking under multiple model uncertainties related to the knowledge of the nonlinear dynamics of the system. The optimal control is also addressed taking into consideration unknown external disturbances. To achieve this goal, we propose a new optimal model-free fuzzy logic-based decentralized control strategy where the influence of the interconnection term between the subsystems is minimized. A model-free controller is firstly designed to achieve the convergence of the tracking error. For this purpose, an adaptive estimator is proposed to ensure the approximation of the nonlinear dynamic functions of the quadrotor. The fuzzy logic compensator is then introduced to deal with the estimation error. Moreover, the optimization problem to select the optimal design parameters of the proposed controller is solved using the bat algorithm. Finally, a numerical validation based on the Parrot drone platform is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method with various flying scenarios.

AB Automatic generation of feasible trajectory is one of the key technologies for autonomous flying of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The existing path planning methods, such as swarm intelligence algorithm and graph-based algorithm, cannot incorporate the flying time and UAV dynamic model into evolution. To overcome such disadvantages, a hierarchical trajectory optimization scheme consisted by improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) and Gauss pseudo-spectral method (GPM) is investigated in this paper. Firstly, considering that traditional GPM is sensitive to initial values, we design an improved PSO for path planning in the first layer. By introducing adaptive parameter adjustment strategy and position mutation updating strategy, the rapidity and optimality of the improved PSO is enhanced. Then in the second layer, a fitted curve based on the path waypoints generated by improved PSO is constructed and served as the initial values for GPM. Comparing with random initial values, the designed curve can significant improve GPM efficiency. A multi-segment strategy is also put forward to further improve the efficiency. Finally, with the consideration of dynamic model and state constraints, the time minimum trajectory planning for quadrotor UAVs is solved. Plenty of simulations are carried out and the results illustrate that the proposed scheme guarantees much better efficiency.

AB The horizon line has numerous applications for an unmanned surface vehicles (USV), such as autonomous navigation, attitude estimation, obstacle detection and target tracking. However, maritime horizon line detection is quite a challenging problem. The pixel points of the horizon line features are far fewer than the pixel points of the entire image, on the one hand. Conversely, the detection results might be impacted negatively by the complex maritime environment, waves, light changing, and partial occlusions due to maritime vessels or islands, for example. To solve these problems, a robust horizon line detection method named coarse-fine-stitched (CFS) is proposed in this paper. First, in the coarse step of CFS, a line segment detection approach using gradient features is applied to build a line candidate pool, which probably contains many false detection results. Then, hybrid feature filtering is designed to pick the horizon line segments from the pool in the fine step. Finally, the fine line segments are stitched to obtain the whole horizon line based on random sample consensus (RANSAC). Using real data in the maritime environment, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CFS, compared to the existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.

AB This study aims to develop a waypoint-tracking control system for a biomimetic underwater vehicle (BUV). The BUV is propelled by wide paired pectoral foils, and each pectoral foil is driven by three independent fin rays. To simplify the control strategy, the maximum flapping amplitude of the pectoral fin is used to control the forward velocity, and a turning factor is defined for the manoeuvre control. Several swimming experiments are carried out to investigate the influence of the control parameters on the swimming performance of the prototype. Based on the results of the swimming experiments, a waypoint-tracking control system is proposed, which contains two layers: the velocity control layer and the heading angle control layer. A subdivision control method is adopted by the velocity control layer to get the maximum flapping amplitude. The fuzzy control method is employed by the heading angle control layer to obtain the turning factor for steering motion. Several waypoint-tracking experiments are carried out to verify effectiveness of the control system. The results show that the prototype can automatically reach the target area with the designed control system, even though the waypoints are arranged or randomly given.

AB When a monocular vision-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is flown to the final approach to intercept the glide slope, the position and orientation of the airport runway in the image must be detected accurately for a host of suitable procedures to be followed. The approaching marking on the runway is showed as some white spots of high intensity as well as the complicated backgrounds. In our paper, we use pin-hole perspective principle, the constraint condition of the rectangle in inertial space, the front shot constraint condition of the target, as well as the clustering algorithm to identify the runway and output its position and orientation in image space. The results of the experiments show that by this algorithm, even from a place far away from the runway with marks being unclear, effective detection is possible. After all, single-frame detection errors exist, so we extend the basic runway-detection algorithm to the runway tracking. A full filtering strategy using particle filter can guard against potentially catastrophic results and improve the detection rate. Apparently, the whole algorithm of our paper can be treated as a special vision sensor for landing equipment of UAV.

AB Autonomous learning is a crucially important capability of intelligent robots. As one of the most fashionable machine learning techniques, the reinforcement learning (RL) enables an agent taking an optimized action by interacting with the environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. In this paper, an improved RL algorithm, named as the KT-HA-Q(X) algorithm, is proposed by resorting to the knowledge transfer of source domain. First, a BP neural network and a liner sensor network are skill-fully constructed to perform the knowledge transfer of source task for weight initialization in target task, and the knowledge transfer on actions of case base obtained by source domain, respectively. Then, the novel case base expansion and progressive forgetting criterion, which realize the balance between new experience via online learning and historical experience in the case base, are developed to enhance the learning efficiency and the learning rate. Furthermore, an improved heuristic function is proposed by replacing the action traditionally obtained via a selection strategy by the experience action. This function acts as a crucial role for both the best action selection and its Q value calculation. Finally, the proposed algorithm is utilized in the hill-climbing experiment of unmanned vehicles under a complex 3D scene by transferring the knowledge obtained in a 2D scene. The results of contrast experiments verified the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the growing interest using model predictive control (MPC), there are more and more researches about the applications of MPC on autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), and these researches are mainly focused on simulation and simple application of MPC on AUV. This paper focuses on the improvement of MPC based on the state space model of an AUV. Unlike the previous approaches using a fixed weighting matrix, in this paper, a coefficient, varied with the error, is introduced to adjust the control increment vector weighting matrix to reduce the settling time. Then, an analysis on the effect of the adjustment to the stability is given. In addition, there is always a lag between the AUV real trajectory and the desired trajectory when the AUV tracks a continuous trajectory. To solve this problem, a simple re-planning of the desired trajectory is developed. Specifically, the point certain steps ahead from current time on the desired trajectory is treated as the current desired point and input to the controller. Finally, experimental results for depth control are given to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the improved MPC. Experimental results show that the method of real-time adjusting control increment weighting matrix can reduce settling time by about 2 s when tracking step trajectory of 1 m, and the simple re-planning of the desired trajectory method can reduce the average of absolute error by about 15% and standard deviation of error by about 17%.

AB A critical step in the visual navigation of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) is horizon line detection, which can be used to adjust the altitude as well as for obstacle avoidance in complex environments. In this paper, a real-time and accurate detection method for the horizon line is proposed. Our approach first differentiates the complexity of navigational scenes using the angular second moment (ASM) parameters in the grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). Then, the region of interest (ROI) is initially extracted using minimal human interaction for the complex navigation scenes, while subsequent frames are dynamically acquired using automatic feature point matching. The matched ROI can be maximally removed from the complex background, and the Zernike-moment-based edges are extracted from the obtained ROI. Finally, complete sea horizon information is obtained through a linear fitting of the lower edge points to the edge information. Through various experiments carried out on a classical dataset, our own datasets, and that of another previously published paper, we illustrate the significance and accuracy of this technique for various complex environments. The results show that the performance has potential applications for the autonomous navigation and control of USVs.

AB Automated driving systems have become a potential approach to mitigating collisions, emissions, and human errors in mixed-traffic environments. This study proposes the use of a deep reinforcement learning method to verify the effects of comprehensive automated vehicle movements at a non-signalized intersection according to training policy and measures of effectiveness. This method integrates multilayer perceptron and partially observable Markov decision process algorithms to generate a proper decision-making algorithm for automated vehicles. This study also evaluates the efficiency of proximal policy optimization hyperparameters for the performance of the training process. Firstly, we set initial parameters and create simulation scenarios. Secondly, the SUMO simulator executes and exports observations. Thirdly, the Flow tool transfers these observations into the states of reinforcement learning agents. Next, the multilayer perceptron algorithm trains the input data and updates policies to generate the proper actions. Finally, this training checks the termination and iteration process. These proposed experiments not only increase the speeds of vehicles but also decrease the emissions at a higher market penetration rate and a lower traffic volume. We demonstrate that the fully autonomous condition increased the average speed 1.49 times compared to the entirely human-driven experiment.

AB With the development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in recent years, UAV-mounted Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) systems are widely used for broadband connectivity and emergency communications in areas without internet. However, the onboard energy of UAVs is limited, and how to provide long-term computing services for ground User Equipments (UEs) still faces significant challenges. In this paper, UAVs are used as mobile base stations to offer MEC services for UEs. Unlike existing solutions that mainly solve UAV path planning from convex optimization methods, we propose a Multi-Agent Path planning (MAP) scheme based on deep reinforcement learning. We aim to minimize the total energy consumption of UAVs while completing the offloading tasks of UEs. At the same time, fairness is taken into account to ensure UE offloading balance and UAV load balance. To this end, we establish the optimization problem and design the state space, action space, and reward function for modeling each UAV through Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Extensive simulation experiments show that the proposed scheme outperforms other benchmark schemes.

AB In this article, a new nonlinear robust fault-tolerant position tracking control law is proposed for a tilt tri-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) under unknown rear servo's stuck fault together with parametric uncertainties and unknown external disturbances. The immersion and invariance approach is employed to design the adaptive controller for the position loop of the UAV. For the attitude loop of the UAV, a sliding-mode-based adaptive observer is utilized to estimate the unknown stuck fault associated with the rear servo, and then the robust integral of the signum of the error method is utilized to formulate the robust attitude controller to compensate for the estimation mismatch and unknown disturbances. The stability of the closed-loop system and asymptotic tracking of the desired position trajectory are proved via Lyapunov-based stability analysis. To validate the performance of the proposed fault-tolerant control design, real-time experiments are implemented on a self-built hard-ware-in-loop UAV testbed. Comparing the results with the proportional-integral-differential (PID) controller shows that the proposed control scheme has achieved better control performance.

AB In this work, previous studies focused on wake propagation and flow development of multi-rotor drones are consolidated and discussed. An in depth understanding of wake propagation is critical to accurately predict as it can have adverse effects on vehicle stability and can contaminate in-situ sensor measurements that are placed on the vehicle, such as those which facilitate autonomous maneuvering or atmospheric sampling. Studies that have focused on this issue or similar issues have primarily focused on proximity effects include Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations of wake propagation and multi-rotor flows, and experimental studies using flow visualization and Particle Image Velocimetry to capture multi-rotor wake and flow development. Although some preliminary investigations have been carried out, a comprehensive study has not been conducted that includes research on multi-rotors in vertical flight modes (ascending and descending) which are unique multi-rotor capabilities that are often utilized. An in-depth study of multi-rotor wake development is needed to provide insight into the design and optimization of multi-rotors for various applications, including applications in confined environments or for other applications where the wake propagation significantly impacts mission success.

AB To accelerate self-driving technology developments, testing platforms modified from production passenger cars are widely used nowadays, but the powertrain models and control access to engine/motor are often not available, e.g., the popular hybrid Lincoln MKZ platform only opens brake/throttle pedal control protocol for longitudinal motion. These limitations motivate us to model the powertrain dynamics by experiments and to design new speed controls, differing from the conventional cruise control that manipulates engine/brake torque directly with accurate models. This article explores the powertrain modeling and speed control algorithm design of these testing platforms, by taking the MKZ as an example. Two computationally-efficient algorithms are designed, i.e., a PID+C control when future information (i.e., reference speed and road slope profiles) is unavailable, and a preview control if the information is provided a priori. To guarantee speed tracking errors within a given safe range, a barrier control is also designed to supervise the two controllers, which adds additional brake/throttle actions when the error is approaching the boundary. The algorithms are implemented and tested on the Mcity MKZ platform, experimental results show the speed-tracking performance and the bounded errors achieved by the barrier function.

AB The ubiquitous connectivity between vehicles and smart transportation infrastructure will facilitate the information flow necessary for empowering smart service for efficient, safe, and eco-friendly transportation of people and goods. Although vehicular communication technologies is quickly advancing toward ubiquitously connected cars, the design of networking protocols for such vehicles is still in its infancy, facing multiple daunting challenges. In this article, we advocate for the use of the information-centric networking (ICN) paradigm for the full realization of connected cars, that is, the integration of both in-car computing systems and the car-to-digital world. We discuss the emerging challenges for the design of ICN-based protocols for connected cars, and we formally put the current debate into perspective regarding which transmission mode (broadcast or unicast) should prevail for the design of such protocols. Concerning this debate, we propose to classify recent and representative protocols in broadcast and unicast-oriented solutions, and we highlight the trade-offs of each approach. Based on a critical qualitative evaluation, we advocate that adaptive and hybrid approaches would perform better for information-centric connected cars. Hence, we provide a guideline for the further design of ICN-based protocols for connected cars. Finally, we discuss some future research directions that might be considered to advance the process of content distribution in connected cars.

AB The social cost of road injury and fatalities is still unacceptable. The driver is often mainly responsible for road crashes, therefore changing the driver behaviour is one of the most important and most challenging priority in road transport. This paper presents three innovative visions that articulate the potential of using Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication for supporting the exchange of social information amongst drivers. We argue that there could be tremendous benefits in socialising cars to influence human driving behaviours for the better and that this aspect is still relevant in the age of looming autonomous cars. Our visions provide theoretical grounding how V2V infrastructure and emerging human-machine interfaces (HMI) could persuade drivers to (i) adopt better (e. g. greener) driving practices, (ii) reduce drivers aggressiveness towards pro-social driving behaviours, and (iii) reduce risk-taking behaviour in young, particularly male, adults. The visions present simple but powerful concepts that reveal 'good' aspects of the driver behaviour to other drivers and make them contagious. The use of self-efficacy, social norms, gamification theories and social cues could then increase the likelihood of a widespread adoption of such 'good' driving behaviours. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ID GUIDANCE
AB This article considers the distributed control of a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) investigating autonomous pattern fort-nation and reconfigurability. A behaviour-based approach to formation control is considered with a velocity field control algorithm developed through bifurcating potential fields. This new approach extends previous research into pattern formation using potential field theory by considering the use of bifurcation theory as a means of reconfiguring a swarm pattern through a free parameter change. The advantage of this kind of system is that it is extremely robust to individual failures, is scalable, and also flexible. The potential field consists of a steering and repulsive term with the bifurcation of the steering potential resulting in a change of the swarm pattern. The repulsive potential ensures collision avoidance and an equally spaced final formation. The stability of the system is demonstrated to ensure that desired behaviours always occur, assuming that at large separation distances the repulsive potential can be neglected through a scale separation that exists between the steering and repulsive potential. The control laws developed are applied to a formation of ten UAVS using a velocity field tracking approach, where it is shown numerically that desired patterns can be formed safely ensuring collision avoidance.

We present a novel approach to building world models using signals inherent in positioning systems, building on the work of the robotics research field.
   We implement the approach using the Bat ultrasonic location system. We observe excellent results when trying to extract the height and shape of horizontal surfaces, and demonstrate how to image and characterise object volumes.
   Results are collected using personnel Bats and by using an autonomous vehicle which moves randomly. In both cases, the results are accurate and reliable.

AB This article aims to propose a novel fixed-time distributed optimized formation control scheme for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles with uncertainties, communication link and actuator faults, and performance constraint. Firstly, the prescribed performance function is introduced to improve the steady-state and transient performances of fixed-wing UAVs system. Communication link faults are tolerated by utilizing the distributed leader state observer. Subsequently, with the objective of establishing optimal controllers for velocity and altitude subsystems, the reinforcement learning control method is employed. Simultaneously, an intermediate controller is constructed to tackle the difficulties in applying reinforcement learning to the fault-tolerant control scheme. In addition, new adaptive laws of fault factor parameters are proposed, which can make the fault-tolerant scheme align better with the concept of fixed-time convergence. Finally, fixed-time prescribed performance controllers for velocity and altitude subsystems are developed. The designed control algorithm can ensure that the velocity and altitude tracking errors converge to the prescribed region, and the simulation results further demonstrate that the proposed control strategy is effective.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES; SLIDING-MODE CONTROLLER
AB Trajectory tracking control is crucial for a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV), but the performance can be degraded due to disturbances, process noises, and parametric uncertainties. Therefore, a hierarchical control scheme is proposed to handle this problem. Firstly, a 4DOF kinematic model and dynamic model of the ROV are constructed. Ocean current disturbance is considered in the kinematic model and the dynamic model when tracking the reference trajectory. Parametric uncertainties are also considered on the dynamic model. Secondly, model predictive control using extended state based Kalman filter (ESKF-MPC) is used to design a kinematic controller (velocity layer) based on the kinematic model to generate virtual expected velocities. ESKF-MPC can not only solve constraints on velocities, but also estimate states and ocean current disturbance, which is bene-ficial for improving the robustness to ocean current disturbance. Thirdly, adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC) is applied to construct a dynamic controller (position layer) to compute optimal forces and moments based on the dynamic model and virtual expected velocities output by the kinematic controller, which is robust to parametric uncertainties and can solve the chattering problem. Finally, simulations are performed to validate the perfor-mance of the proposed hierarchical control scheme.

AB We consider a cell-free (CF) massive multi-input multi-output (mMIMO) system, where multi-antenna access points (APs) serve single-antenna unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground users (GUEs). We assume, unlike the existing CF mMIMO literature, hardware-impaired UAVs and GUEs, which observe a mixture of spatially-correlated Rician- and Rayleigh-faded channels while communicating with hardware-impaired APs. We derive a closed-form downlink spectral efficiency (SE) expression by using practical models for the channel mixture, and by considering channel estimation errors. We propose a novel block quadratic transformation (block-QT) technique to optimize non-convex network-centric global energy efficiency (GEE) by appropriately modeling circuit, UAV propulsion and fronthaul powers. The novel block-QT approach combines block optimization and quadratic transformation technique to decompose GEE optimization into simpler convex sub-problems. We numerically show that i) it is better to operate a UAV at a larger height when it has severe hardware impairments; and ii) when UAVs operate at a lower height, they do not significantly affect the SE of GUEs.

AB A wheel loader is one of the main machines that is used in various applications. The present authors have been interested in autonomous control of its locomotion and navigation. An inevitable step in achieving this is path planning. The authors choose a technique of designing a steering method for car-like vehicles by proposing a semi-optimal path generation scheme using a canonical path skeleton consisting of three line segments and two clotohid pairs. Taking such a path skeleton, for any given pair of a locally desired initial configuration and a locally desired destination configuration, path planning is equivalent to finding the suitable values of parameters which characterize this skeleton. Due to the lower number of constraints than the number of parameters, ascertaining the values of parameters comes from the optimizations of the authors' formulated non-linear programmings with equality constraints. In addition, the realizable path must be subject to the upper-bounded curvature and curvature derivative. Adopting a genetic algorithm as the search tool in one of the optimizations makes it possible to allow the use of only a single canonical skeleton for the desired path planning.

An improved hydrodynamic algorithm based on conformal mapping and the boundary element method (BEM) is proposed in this paper to improve the accuracy and efficiency of numerical computation. The proposed algorithm is validated by numerical examples. The effect of an uneven seabed on the pressure distribution of a hull surface is obtained. The improved algorithm is proven to be more efficient in the avoidance of seabed boundary interception and dispersion than conventional BEM.

AB Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is used in solving the problems of localization, navigation, and map construction for autonomous vehicles moving in unknown environments. Place recognition is an inevitable subject in SLAM, and the current lidar-based methods have been popularized for their rising environmental robustness. Currently, the place recognition method with lidar has attracted much attention due to its high environmental robustness. However, many 3-D laser point cloud methods for place recognition descriptors construction with the local or global point-cloud data omit some intrinsic properties of the point clouds. In this article, we propose a place recognition method based on the unitary invariance of the Frobenius norm for utilizing different attributes of ground points and non-ground points. Specifically, the interpretablefiltering framework and a dynamic threshold adjustment strategy are raised according to different environments and sensors with intensity and geometric information. As commissioning, the comparative experiments are conducted with CHDloop datasets and public KITTI datasets of different scales and access types. Compared to the original scan context (SC) and intensity SC (ISC) methods, our proposed method achieves higher efficiency while maintaining an improved recall rate and precision. This novel method has been integrated into the existing lidar SLAM and formed a new framework FSC_ALOAM that reduces drifts in point-cloud mapping. The entire process improves the accordance of maps at the identical position in auto- driving.

AB Seafloor massive sulfide (SMS) deposits contain abundant metals, such as Cu, Zn, Au, and Ag, which are of growing economic interest. Currently, the exploration of SMS deposits has entered into a new stage of resource assessment, so we need a geophysical method to rapidly obtain the 3D structure of these SMS deposits. We report here a self-potential (SP) survey performed with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) at the Yuhuang hydrothermal field on the ultraslow-spreading Southwest Indian Ridge with a water depth ranging from 1300 m to 2200 m. The electric-field sensors are attached to the tail of the AUV to record the electric field approximately 50 m above the seafloor. The electric field strength is observed to reach an amplitude of 0.6 mV/m at this known SMS deposit. SP tomography is used to obtain the 3D structure of the ore body, and benchmark numerical tests are first performed on synthetic cases to optimize the inversion algorithm parameters to estimate the ore location. The 3D SP tomography reveals a south-sloping ore body, which is 100 m long in the north-south direction and nearly 200 m long in the east-west direction. The vertical extent of the ore body is approximately 100 m. These results suggest that an AUV-based SP survey and tomography are potentially useful exploration methods to characterize the geometry of SMS deposits. This method may play an important role in resource assessment in concert with other geophysical methods, such as magnetic and induced-polarization surveys.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) with advanced communication, computing, and control capabilities will provide not only a convenient means of transportation but also an emerging platform for real-time social communications and networking. Thereby, it is crucial to enable timely exchange of information over the dynamic cyber-physical-social system enabled by the AVs. In this paper, we consider age of information (AoI)-centric real-time information dissemination over vehicular social networks (VSNs), where the Aol captures the freshness of received data packets. We first propose a mathematical framework based on the mean-field theory (MIT) to analyze the network AoI (NAol) of VSNs, namely Aol for the AV that lastly receives the information update in the network. The proposed analytical framework considers both the social features of vehicular networks, which are characterized using the scale-free network theory, and the underlying wireless communication process to evaluate the NAol. Then, we further consider joint optimization of the information update rate at the source node and the transmit probabilities at the AVs for minimization of the average peak NAoI (PNAoI), i.e., the time average of peak values occurred in the evolution of the NAol, which is solved via a novel parametric optimization scheme. Both analytical and simulation results show that compared with several baseline schemes, the proposed scheme can exploit the scale-free feature of the VSNs to significantly lower the average PNAoI by up to 96%.

AB The deep-ocean carbon cycle is poorly quantified. An abyssal benthic rover was developed to make long timeseries measurements of seafloor processes related to organic carbon remineralization and sequestration. Benthic Rover II (BR-II) is an autonomous dual-tracked vehicle that measures bottom water temperature and oxygen concentration, current velocity, and sediment community oxygen consumption (SCOC; respiration). BR-II is programmed to transit with low surface-contact pressure across the seafloor, photograph bottom conditions, and stop regularly to occupy respirometer incubation sites, with deployment periods up to 1 year. Now, continuously operational at a 4000-m station in the northeast Pacific over 5 years, substantial weekly, seasonal, annual, and episodic events have been recorded, which are critical to assessing the deep-ocean carbon cycle. There was a significant increase in phytodetritus cover (P < 0.01) arriving on the seafloor from the overlying water column between 2015 and 2020 that was negatively correlated with bottom water dissolved oxygen concentration (P < 0.01). Over the continuous 5-year monitoring period from November 2015 to November 2020, SCOC was positively correlated with phytodetritus cover (P < 0.01) and increased significantly from 2015 to 2020 (P < 0.01). These results show important influences of biological processes on the carbon cycle. The demonstrated success of BR-II now creates opportunities to expand the long-term monitoring of the deep sea to resolve the coupling of water column and benthic processes key to understanding the oceanic carbon cycle on a planet engulfed in a changing climate.

AB Chemical sensor development has been a focus for the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) from its inception. Progress in chemical analyzers benefited from technological advances in many fields. MBARI's development of a low power, reagent-free, in situ ultraviolet spectrophotometer (ISUS) for measuring dissolved nitrate has been transformative. These ultraviolet optical nitrate sensors have been deployed on remotely operated vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, benthic flux chambers, profiling floats, and moorings. This paper focuses on a 15+ year time series of nitrate observations on MBARI's MI mooring in Monterey Bay, California. The resulting data set captures seasonal and interannual variability from El Nifio and La Nifia, and water mass anomalies on the eastern boundary of the Pacific Ocean. The high temporal resolution (hourly) nitrate measurements additionally quantify diel cycles of nitrate uptake as a proxy for new production. The calculated f-ratio varies seasonally with relatively higher values during the lower productivity winter season. The physical supply and uptake of nitrate are dominated by upwelling in this coastal environment. An expanding number of ultraviolet optical nitrate sensor deployments on moorings and autonomous platforms such as profiling floats will provide ever-broadening coverage of the world ocean, resulting in enhanced spatial and temporal resolution of nitrate measurements and, ultimately, improved insight into the dynamics of nitrogen cycling and phytoplankton ecology throughout a changing global ocean.

AB This survey paper reviews the risk assessment methodology for autonomous vehicles. The paper explains the necessity of real-time risk assessment in conjunction with traditional approaches, especially for highly automated driving. The current methodologies are segmented into different approaches to help identify risk in the aspects of quantitative or qualitative measurements. Further analyses are conducted for each methodology used during development or real-time usage. The outcome of this paper includes a recommended list that addresses each of these methodologies for their suitability toward ISO 26262 and ISO/PAS 21448. In addition, this paper addresses the importance of determinism and uncertainty in different risk assessment methodologies, especially in the usage of AI and machine learning.

AB It is confirmed by our experiments that a new pattern of helical motion called anti-helical motion exists for autonomous underwater glider (AUG). Unlike traditional one, this type has its own characteristics. By solving the nonlinear equilibrium equations, we have analyzed the relationship between control variable (CG location) and the anti-helical motion characteristics at steady state. Theoretical research proves that hydrodynamic forces playa critical role in determining this motion style. The main theoretical conclusions are validated by experimental results at last.

ID EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS
AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) leverage advanced sensing and networking technologies (e.g., camera, LiDAR, RADAR, GPS, DSRC, 5G, etc.) to enable safe and efficient driving without human drivers. Although still in its infancy, AV technology is becoming increasingly common and could radically transform our transportation system and by extension, our economy and society. As a result, there is tremendous global enthusiasm for research, development, and deployment of AVs, e.g., self-driving taxis and trucks from Waymo and Baidu. The current practice for testing AVs uses virtual tests-where AVs are tested in software simulations-since they offer a more efficient and safer alternative compared to field operational tests. Specifically, search-based approaches are used to find particularly critical situations. These approaches provide an opportunity to automatically generate tests; however, systematically creating valid and effective tests for AV software remains a major challenge. To address this challenge, we introduce scenoRITA, a test generation approach for AVs that uses an evolutionary algorithm with (1) a novel gene representation that allows obstacles to be fully mutable, hence, resulting in more reported violations and more diverse scenarios, (2) 5 test oracles to determine both safety and motion sickness-inducing violations and (3) a novel technique to identify and eliminate duplicate tests. Our extensive evaluation shows that scenoRITA can produce test scenarios that are more effective in revealing ADS bugs and more diverse in covering different parts of the map compared to other state-of-the-art test generation approaches.

AB This paper studies a high-performance intelligent online adaptive robust saturated dynamic surface control framework for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles by engaging Actor-Critic neural networks in the presence of unmodeled dynamics, uncertainties, ocean disturbances and actuator saturation. The proposed controller is designed based on reinforcement learning method to compensate the effects of unmodeled dynamics and uncertainties more accurately that can lead to a better performance for the controller. The Actor-Critic neural networks are trained real-time by designing online training laws creatively and a new critic function is proposed to supervise the closed-loop performance with the aid of the Critic neural network. The proposed structure for the reinforcement learning method benefits from a model-free algorithm and only relies on the measurable variables of the closed-loop control system. This independency from system dynamics results in considerable low computational burden for the controller and, hence, the proposed control algorithm is efficient computationally. The hyperbolic tangent function is ingeniously used as a saturated stabilizer term to bound the control signals that results in low-amplitude control action and the probability of actuator saturation phenomenon is minimized by learning and compensating the actuator saturation nonlinearity as well. Finally, the stability of the proposed closed-loop system is investigated by the Lyapunov's direct methodology and simulations along a comparative study with some quantitative assessments certify the contributions of this paper.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology is being increasingly used in a wide variety of applications ranging from remote sensing, to delivery and security. As the number of UAVs increases, there is a growing need for UAV to UAV detection and tracking systems for both collision avoidance and coordination. Among possible solutions, autonomous "see-and-avoid" systems based on low-cost high-resolution video cameras offer important advantages in terms of light weight and low power consumption. However, in order to be effective, camera based "see-and-avoid" systems require sensitive, robust, and computationally efficient algorithms for autonomous detection and tracking of UAVs from a moving camera. In this article, we propose a general architecture for a highly accurate and computationally efficient UAV to UAV detection and tracking (U2U-D&T) algorithm from a camera mounted on a moving UAV platform. The system is based on a computationally efficient pipeline consisting of a moving target detector, followed by a target tracker. The algorithm is validated using video data collected from multiple fixed-wing UAVs that is manually ground-truthed and is publicly available. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm can be implemented on commodity hardware and robustly achieves highly accurate detection and tracking of even distant and faint UAVs. Open source code for the U2U-D&T algorithm is available at: https://github.com/jingliinpurdue/Fast-and-Robust-UAV-to-UAV-Detection-and-Tracking.git.

AB Objective:The moral and ethical issue is a great challenge to the development of autonomous vehicles. There may be distinctions between the choices made by an observer and a participant. The paper is designed to investigate whether drivers will sacrifice the fewest people to save more people in social dilemma, and whether human drivers would give priority to protecting pedestrians or self-protection in an emergency. Methodology: The experiment was conducted with a total of 50 participants assigned to three groups. Three experimental scenarios were designed and each of them contained a social dilemma. A driving simulator was used in this study to explore the choices of human drivers in social dilemma. In addition, the simulator results were compared with those of questionnaire survey. Result: In study 1, 73% of 22 participants swerved into the right lane to hit only one pedestrian for the safety of other five. In study 2 and 3, more participants chose to hit the barrier to protect the pedestrian. Conclusion: A conclusion can be drawn from the second and third group of experiments that most drivers consider not only their own safety, but the safety of pedestrians. Most of the participants intended to minimize the total amount of harm in social dilemma. The choice of crashing into barriers to protect a pedestrian can also be seen as a way to minimize the total amount of harm.

AB The article presents a study of the accuracy of estimating the position coordinates of BAUV (Biomimetic Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) by the extended Kalman filter (EKF) method. The fusion of movement parameters measurements and position coordinates fixes was applied. The movement parameters measurements are carried out by on-board navigation devices, while the position coordinates fixes are done by the USBL (Ultra Short Base Line) system. The problem of underwater positioning and the conceptual design of the BAUV navigation system constructed at the Naval Academy (Polish Naval Academy-PNA) are presented in the first part of the paper. The second part consists of description of the evaluation results of positioning accuracy, the genesis of the problem of selecting method for underwater positioning, and the mathematical description of the method of estimating the position coordinates using the EKF method by the fusion of measurements with on-board navigation and measurements obtained with the USBL system. The main part contains a description of experimental research. It consists of a simulation program of navigational parameter measurements carried out during the BAUV passage along the test section. Next, the article covers the determination of position coordinates on the basis of simulated parameters, using EKF and DR methods and the USBL system, which are then subjected to a comparative analysis of accuracy. The final part contains systemic conclusions justifying the desirability of applying the proposed fusion method of navigation parameters for the BAUV positioning.

AB The popularization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has boosted various civil applications such as traffic monitoring, in which the effective coordination of the UAV swarm plays a significant role in expanding the monitoring range and enhancing the execution efficiency. However, due to the isolated local environments as well as the heterogeneous execution capabilities, it is challenging to achieve highly consistent actions. In this article, we incorporate the federated learning framework with the imitation learning technique to coordinate the UAVs' maneuvers by interactively imitating the leader UAV's operations. During the interagent global model download phase, we utilize the generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) model to accurately follow the leader UAV's operations by removing the biased estimates of imitation parameters. While in the intraagent local model training phase, we utilize the self-imitation learning (SIL) model to correct delicate imitation errors by virtue of the follower UAVs' own historical valuable experiences. In order to achieve more efficient distributed parameter interactions, we regularize the federated gradient updates and eventually yield coordinated swarm policies. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in the UAV-based traffic monitoring scenario. Evaluation results demonstrate the superiorities on training and execution efficiencies.

AB This paper studies the trajectory tracking problem of flapping-wing micro aerial vehicles (FWMAVs) in the longitudinal plane. First of all, the kinematics and dynamics of the FWMAV are established, wherein the aerodynamic force and torque generated by flapping wings and the tail wing are explicitly formulated with respect to the flapping frequency of the wings and the degree of tail wing inclination. To achieve autonomous tracking, an adaptive control scheme is proposed under the hierarchical framework. Specifically, a bounded position controller with hyperbolic tangent functions is designed to produce the desired aerodynamic force, and a pitch command is extracted from the designed position controller. Next, an adaptive attitude controller is designed to track the extracted pitch command, where a radial basis function neural network is introduced to approximate the unknown aerodynamic perturbation torque. Finally, the flapping frequency of the wings and the degree of tail wing inclination are calculated from the designed position and attitude controllers, respectively. In terms of Lyapunov's direct method, it is shown that the tracking errors are bounded and ultimately converge to a small neighborhood around the origin. Simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB In this article, a highly nonlinear trajectory optimization problem for reentry vehicles is rapidly solved by the proposed modified sequential convex programming (MSCP) method. A logarithm linearization approach is proposed to decouple the dynamics of high order and nonconvex path constraints of heat rate, dynamic pressure, and normal load. Next, the model including the no-fly zone constraint, and the nonconvex objective function are convexified with first-order Taylor series expansion. Subsequently, the continuous-time optimal problem is converted to an equivalent finite-dimensional sequential convex programming (SCP) problem. Moreover, a compensation term is added to the state equations to maintain the feasibility of the reformulated problem. Consequently, to guarantee the optimality of the solution, a penalty term with respect to the compensation term is added to the objective function. In the end, an online optimization scheme with MSCP is proposed. Compared to a general proposed optimal control solver, numerical simulations are conducted to verify the optimality and fast convergence of MSCP. Furthermore, online optimization simulations demonstrate the validity of the proposed online scheme for pop-up no-fly zone and mission temporary changes.

ID MODEL
AB In this article, a unified lane-keeping and forward collision avoidance system is proposed for semi-trailer trucks. Kinematic and dynamic models are described for lateral motion of the semi-trailer truck. The variation of the cornering stiffness is considered because its value depends on driving conditions such as vehicle speed and vertical load. The proposed system consists of the hitch angle estimation algorithm of the semi-trailer truck and the Model Predictive Controller (MPC) for the lateral motion of the semi-trailer truck. In the hitch angle estimation, the disturbance observer is utilized to compensate the lateral uncertainties and the estimation performance is validated in simulations and experiments. In the controller design, an MPC controller is designed both for lane keeping and collision avoidance, but their constraints in lateral motion are considered separately. In constructing the objective functions, constraint smoothing is applied to improve the feasibility of the semi-trailer truck motion. A simplification method is also introduced to reduce the computational complexity of the MPC and to improve the real-time performance. The proposed system is evaluated in simulations for lane keeping and collision avoidance, respectively.

AB Pest birds are a salient problem in agriculture all around the world due to the damage they can cause to commercial or high-value crops. Recent advancements in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have motivated the use of drones in pest bird deterrence, with promising success already being demonstrated over traditional bird control techniques. This paper presents a novel bird deterrence solution in the form of tethered UAVs, which are attached and arranged in a grid-like fashion across a vineyard property. This strategy aims to bypass the power and endurance limitations of untethered drones while still utilising their dynamism and scaring potential. A simulation model has been designed and developed to assess the feasibility of different UAV arrangements, configurations, and strategies against expected behavioural responses of incoming bird flocks, despite operational and spatial constraints imposed by a tether. Attempts at quantifying bird persistence and relative effort following UAV-induced deterrence are also introduced through a novel bird energy expenditure model. This aims to serve as a proxy for selecting control techniques that reduce future foraging missions. The simulation model successfully isolated candidate configurations, which were able to deter both single and multiple incoming bird flocks using a centralised multi-UAV control strategy. Overall, this study indicates that a grid of autonomous ground-tethered UAV platforms is viable as a bird deterrence solution in agriculture, a novel solution not seen nor dealt with elsewhere to the authors' knowledge.

AB The rapid developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the intensification in the adoption of AI in domains such as autonomous vehicles, lethal weapon systems, robotics and alike pose serious challenges to governments as they must manage the scale and speed of socio-technical transitions occurring. While there is considerable literature emerging on various aspects of AI, governance of AI is a significantly underdeveloped area. The new applications of AI offer opportunities for increasing economic efficiency and quality of life, but they also generate unexpected and unintended consequences and pose new forms of risks that need to be addressed. To enhance the benefits from AI while minimising the adverse risks, governments worldwide need to understand better the scope and depth of the risks posed and develop regulatory and governance processes and structures to address these challenges. This introductory article unpacks AI and describes why the Governance of AI should be gaining far more attention given the myriad of challenges it presents. It then summarises the special issue articles and highlights their key contributions. This special issue introduces the multifaceted challenges of governance of AI, including emerging governance approaches to AI, policy capacity building, exploring legal and regulatory challenges of AI and Robotics, and outstanding issues and gaps that need attention. The special issue showcases the state-of-the-art in the governance of AI, aiming to enable researchers and practitioners to appreciate the challenges and complexities of AI governance and highlight future avenues for exploration.

AB This paper studies three-dimensional (3D) straight line path following and obstacle avoidance control for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) without lateral and vertical driving forces. Firstly, the expected angular velocities are designed by using two different methods in the kinematic controller. The first one is a traditional method based on Line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law, and the second one is an improved method based on model predictive control (MPC). At the same time, a penalty item is designed by using the obstacle information detected by onboard sensors, which can realize the real-time obstacle avoidance of the unknown obstacle. Then, in order to overcome the uncertainty of the dynamics model and the saturation of actual control input, the dynamic controller is designed by using sliding mode control (SMC) technology. Finally, in the simulation experiment, the performance of the improved control method is verified by comparison with two traditional control methods based on LOS guidance law. Since the constraint of an AUV's angular velocities are considered in MPC, simulation results show that the improved control method uses MPC, and SMC not only improves the tracking quality of the AUV when switching paths near the waypoints and realizes real-time obstacle avoidance but also effectively reduces the mean square error (MSE) and saturation rate of the rudder angle. Therefore, this control method is more conducive to the system stability and saves energy.

AB One dimension of the emerging politics of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is the development of public concerns over their societal implications and associated policy issues. This study uses original survey data from the United States to contribute to the anticipation of future policy and political issues for CAVs. Several studies have surveyed the public regarding CAVs; however, there are few studies that highlight the multidimensional public concerns that CAVs will most likely bring. The study breaks down the concept of "public" by showing that the demographic variables of gender, age, race, ethnicity, income, location (rural, suburban, urban), and political ideology (conservative, moderate, liberal) are significantly associated with three of the most salient public concerns to date (safety, privacy, and data security). Furthermore, the effects of demographic variables also vary across the type of policy issue. For example, women tend to be more concerned about safety than their male counterparts, and Hispanics (Latinx) tend to be more concerned about privacy than non-Hispanics. The research shows how the social scientific analysis of the "politics" of CAVs will require attention to the variegated connections between different types of public concern and different demographic variables.

AB To accomplish feasible large-scale integration of distributed energy resources (DER) into the existing grid system, microgrid implementation has proven to be the most effective. This article reviews the vital aspects of DER based microgrid and presents simulations to investigate the impacts of DER sources, electric vehicles (EV), and energy storage system (ESS) on practicable architectures' resilient operation. The focus is primarily on the concept and definition of microgrid, comparison of control strategies (primary, secondary, and tertiary strategies), energy management strategies, power quality (PQ) issues associated with DER based microgrid, and state-of-the-art entities such as ESS and EV's applications toward microgrid reliability. Following discussion on the different attributes of DER sources-based microgrid, simulations are performed to verify the results of the past works on the effects of solar, wind energy sources, ESS, and EVs on the microgrid frequency response. Additional simulations are conducted to assess the influences of DERs, ESS, EVs, and their operational strategies on the microgrid reliability aspects.

AB This paper introduces the sea-launch technology of a cryogenic liquid-fueled medium-lift rocket. It first reviews the current state of sea launch technology, and then gives a brief introduction of China's New Generation Medium-lift Launch Vehicle (NGMLV). The innovations in the NGMVL, such as responsive test and launch control, a H-3 launch model, and unmanned operations, provide convenience for sea launches. Based on these innovations, this paper proposes a sea launch scheme, including the system configuration, test and launch processes, and an improved adaptive design for the rocket. Then, the launch platform is discussed in detail, which integrates the functions of sea transportation, assembly and test, as well as technical and launch areas. The layout and function divisions, fluid filling, gas supply and distribution systems, and lossless storage technology of LH2 are described in order. This breakthrough in sea launch technology will enable China to launch medium and large satellites and constellations 'both on land and sea', especially into low-inclination Low-Earth Orbits (LEOs), and it allows China to remain competitive in the fast-paced space industry.

ID PERCEPTION
AB Imaging sensors are being increasingly used in autonomous vehicle applications for scene understanding. This paper presents a method that combines radar and monocular vision for ground modeling and scene segmentation by a mobile robot operating in outdoor environments. The proposed system features two main phases: a radar-supervised training phase and a visual classification phase. The training stage relies on radar measurements to drive the selection of ground patches in the camera images, and learn online the visual appearance of the ground. In the classification stage, the visual model of the ground can be used to perform high level tasks such as image segmentation and terrain classification, as well as to solve radar ambiguities. This method leads to the following main advantages: (a) self-supervised training of the visual classifier across the portion of the environment where radar overlaps with the camera field of view. This avoids time-consuming manual labeling and enables on-line implementation; (b) the ground model can be continuously updated during the operation of the vehicle, thus making feasible the use of the system in long range and long duration applications. This paper details the algorithms and presents experimental tests conducted in the field using an unmanned vehicle. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A high-frequency sector scan sonar can be used to detect and classify man-made objects located on the sea floor. If the hydrophone array of the sonar is to be mounted on a miniaturized autonomous underwater vehicle, the aperture size of the array must be small enough so that it will not affect the vehicle's maneuverability. However, a small aperture size of the array results in poor angular resolution when using the conventional delay and sum beamforming technique. This paper shows that, with the aid of spatial resampling, narrow-band adaptive beamforming algorithms can be applied to improve the angular resolution of wide-band active sonars with a small aperture uniform linear hydrophone array. Owing to the motion of the vehicle and the highly nonstationary environment, only single-snapshot adaptive beamforming algorithms can be used. In this paper, spatial smoothing is used in conjunction with the minimum variance distortionless response and multiple signal classification adaptive beamforming algorithms to produce a high-resolution image using a single ping. Real sonar images generated using these two algorithms are compared with those generated using another single-snapshot adaptive beamforming algorithm, spatial processing: optimized and constrained, and the conventional delay and sum beamforming algorithm.

AB This article discusses navigation methods for mobile agricultural robots in greenhouses. Today, many dangers of repetitive and hazardous agricultural tasks for humans could be avoided by using robots. The problem of autonomous navigation in, greenhouses has been solved using both deliberative and pseudo-reactive techniques. The first one utilizes a map-based algorithm to create a safe, obstacle-free path to circulate throughout the greenhouse. The second technique applies a sensor-feedback algorithm to move through the greenhouse corridors. Furthermore, along the trajectory a sensorial map is built. Both approaches have been implemented and tested in a real environment, with promising results.

AB The autonomous underwater vehicle mounted on the forward obstacle avoidance sonar is developed to investigate ocean environments such as that of the Arctic Ocean. In order to obtain real time, high efficiency and clear acoustic images, the acoustic lens sonar system has been adopted. Usually, the design of the acoustic lens as well as that of the optical lens is based on geometrical optics theory. In this paper, the acoustic characteristics of the acoustic lens are studied by using the two- and three-dimensional parabolic equation methods.

AB This paper describes the existence of one of the most useful mechanisms for robotic systems, coined the "variable constraint mechanism." The variable constraint mechanism is a system that actively changes constraint conditions by itself; in response to the working purpose or the required motion sequence to acquire varied functionality. The paper discusses some of the generalized design principles for the mechanism and shows some example robotic systems, including an adjustable leg-length walking robot, a legged and wheeled hybrid vehicle, an autonomous multisection robot, and a planetary rover with collapsible frame and compressible wheels.

AB One of the challenges for model prediction and validation is providing them with data of appropriate spatial and temporal resolution. The maturation and increased application of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in aquatic environments allows systematic data collection on these model-relevant scales. The goal of this study was to apply a fine-scale circulation and transport model (Delft3D) to improve AUV mission planning and use data collected by the AUV to evaluate and improve model performance. A dye release was conducted in a tidally dominated embayment, and a planning phase model based on the best available data was used as a baseline for evaluation and for AUV mission planning (forecast). The planning phase model correctly predicted the general shape and direction of the dye plume and allowed for successful mission planning. Subsequently, bathymetry data collected by the AUV was incorporated into the model (hindcast), with temperature and salinity collected before the experiment. Comparisons with fluorometer measurements from the AUV indicate that the model effectively predicted the edges of the plume and centerline location. The location was also confirmed by remote sensing from an aircraft. Thermal stratification was found to be an important fate mechanism in the final model, and the results demonstrate the integration of observational data sets for small, short-duration surface-contaminant releases. This study highlights the strength of a phased, iterative approach with observation platforms and may serve as a guide toward improving the performance and evaluation of future coastal hydrodynamic and transport modeling efforts.

The proposed approach improves the UAV's localization using scanned barcodes as landmarks in a real warehouse with low-light conditions. Instead of using the standard overlapping snake-based grid (OSBG) trajectory, we implement a novel approach for flight-path optimization based on barcode locations. This approach reduces the time of warehouse stocktaking and decreases the number of mistakes in barcode scanning.

AB In this paper, we consider a finite network of multiple mobile autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) collecting data in a given region and transferring them to a surface sink. All AUVs patrol a cylindrical region and dynamically control their 3-Dimensional (3D) location according to the random way-point (RWP) mobility model. Our specific interest focuses on the system throughput under different locations of the serving AUV. The following three serving AUV selection policies are investigated: 1)The serving AUV is the closest AUV among all active AUVs; 2) The serving AUV is randomly selected among the active AUVs; 3)The serving AUV is the farthest AUV among all active AUVs. Under the time slotted network scenario, the system throughput is defined as the probability that the sink can successfully recover the data packet from the serving AUV in one time slot. Further, we consider a practical constraint that all AUVs are equipped with limited data buffers. Based on the probability distributions of the distances between the AUVs and the surface sink, this paper presents a mathematical framework to characterize the performance of the random 3D mobile network. With the help of this framework, we obtain the theoretical performance in terms of the system throughput of the surface sink and the average queue delay of any AUV. Finally, extensive simulations are presented to verify the accuracy of our analysis and study the effects of various parameters.

ID MOVING BOTTLENECKS; MODEL; FLOW
AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) provide a novel perspective to address challenges of traditional evacuation modes, such as the need for trained human drivers, out-of-control, congestion, and limited road capacity. This paper focuses on managing a multiclass traffic evacuation task of private CAVs and mass-transit CAVs. Firstly, we propose a multiclass cell transmission model with moving bottlenecks to model the mul-ticlass CAVs. In particular, we discretize the road network into a multi-size cell network to capture the speed difference between two types of CAVs. The mass-transit CAVs are treated as moving bottlenecks, which can linearly reduce the road capacity in a certain density range. Secondly, we formulate a system optimum collaborative evacuation model to minimize the evacuation network clearance time or minimize the total travel time of evacuees. Constraints include multiclass fleet size, signal-free intersections, loading multiclass CAVs, and non-holding back. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to test the collaborative evacuation model. On an evacuation corridor, the results show that our proposed model can capture multiclass traffic dynamics and traffic congestion. In the Sioux-Falls network, we evaluate the evacuation efficiency of multiclass CAVs using the fully mixed approach and the lane-based approach. The results indicate that the evacuation efficiency of using the fully mixed approach may be better than that of using the lane-based approach under certain evacuation demands. The cooperation of multiclass CAVs can transfer congestion and reduce evacuation time. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We introduce the combinatorial optimization problem Time Disjoint Walks (TDW), which has applications in collision-free routing of discrete objects (e.g., autonomous vehicles) over a network. This problem takes as input a digraph G with positive integer arc lengths, and k pairs of vertices that each represent a trip demand from a source to a destination. The goal is to find a walk and delay for each demand so that no two trips occupy the same vertex at the same time, and so that a min-max or min-sum objective over the trip durations is realized. We focus here on the min-sum variant of Time Disjoint Walks, although most of our results carry over to the min-max case. We restrict our study to various subclasses of DAGs, and observe that there is a sharp complexity boundary between Time Disjoint Walks on oriented stars and on oriented stars with the central vertex replaced by a path. In particular, we present a poly-time algorithm for min-sum and min-max TDW on the former, but show that min-sum TDW on the latter is NP-hard. Our main hardness result is that for DAGs with max degree Delta <= 3, min-sum Time Disjoint Walks is APX-hard. We present a natural approximation algorithm for the same class, and provide a tight analysis. In particular, we prove that it achieves an approximation ratio of Theta(k/ log k) on bounded-degree DAGs, and Theta(k) on DAGs and bounded-degree digraphs.

AB Achieving accurate navigation and localization is crucial for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). Traditional navigation algorithms, such as Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), require the system model and measurement model for state estimation to obtain the AUV position. However, this may introduce modeling errors and state estimation errors which will affect the final precision of AUV navigation system to a certain extent. To avoid these problems, in this paper, we proposed a deep framework - NavNet - by taking AUV navigation as a deep sequential learning problem. Firstly, the proposed NavNet can take raw sensor data at different frequencies as input, which benefits from the sequential learning capability of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Secondly, NavNet takes advantage of a simplified attention mechanism and Fully Connected (FC) layers to output AUV displacements per unit time, which accomplishes low-frequency AUV navigation by accumulation of it. More importantly, there is no need for the model building and state estimation with NavNet, which avoids the import of relevant errors. We compare the performance of NavNet to EKF and UKF using collected data by running Sailfish in the sea. Experimental results show that NavNet has an excellent performance in terms of both the navigation accuracy and fault tolerance. In addition, a reliable fusion strategy of NavNet and conventional method is applied to achieve high-frequency AUV navigation. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture can be a reliable supplement to limit the error growth of conventional algorithms.

TI True Color Correction of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Imagery
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents an automated approach to recovering the true color of objects on the seafloor in images collected from multiple perspectives by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) during the construction of three-dimensional (3D) seafloor models and image mosaics. When capturing images underwater, the water column induces several effects on light that are typically negligible in air, such as color-dependent attenuation and backscatter. AUVs must typically carry artificial lighting when operating at depths below 20-30 m; the lighting pattern generated is usually not spatially consistent. These effects cause problems for human interpretation of images, limit the ability of using color to identify benthic biota or quantify changes over multiple dives, and confound computer-based techniques for clustering and classification. Our approach exploits the 3D structure of the scene generated using structure-from-motion and photogrammetry techniques to provide basic spatial data to an underwater image formation model. Parameters that are dependent on the properties of the water column are estimated from the image data itself, rather than using fixed in situ infrastructure, such as reflectance panels or detailed data on water constitutes. The model accounts for distance-based attenuation and backscatter, camera vignetting and the artificial lighting pattern, recovering measurements of the true color (reflectance) and thus allows us to approximate the appearance of the scene as if imaged in air and illuminated from above. Our method is validated against known color targets using imagery collected in different underwater environments by two AUVs that are routinely used as part of a benthic habitat monitoring program.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can map water conditions at high spatial ( horizontal and vertical) and temporal resolution, including under cloudy conditions when satellite and airborne remote sensing are not feasible. Applications of this technology are numerous, and harnessing the full potential of AUV platforms for oceanographic research will require innovative sampling and data processing techniques, particularly in shallow littoral environments. We deployed a passive radiometer on a small AUV called the Remote Environmental Monitoring UnitS (REMUS; Hydroid) to demonstrate a novel method that uses one optical sensor at depth to characterize variability in underwater clarity and the constituents of coastal seawater (i.e., dissolved organic material, algal biomass, and other particles). This approach uses spectral differences between attenuation coefficients that are computed from ratios of downwelling irradiance measured at one depth assuming a constant shape, but not magnitude, for the solar irradiance spectrum at the surface. A spectral inversion model provides estimates of the absorption coefficients ( m(-1)) of the constituents above the sensor. There is no requirement for sensors at the ocean surface using this approach and, compared to inversion methods for subsurface reflectance, the effects of bottom reflectance in shallow waters are minimal. Maps of biooptical properties at high spatial resolution demonstrate that our approach can be used for characterizing shallow and highly variable coastal waters. This simple and robust technique is also applicable to other in situ sampling platforms ( e. g., gliders, moorings, Argo floats).

AB The winter Lead Experiment (LeadEx) was conducted during 1992 in the Beaufort Sea. There the Autonomous Conductivity Temperature Vehicle (ACTV) was operated under and around leads. These are the first measurements of this kind. Measurements of temperature, salinity, and turbulence parameters were also made at lead edges with sensors fixed to rigid masts. By combining information from the fixed measurements and the ACTV an inertial dissipation method is used to derive horizontal profiles of salt flux from ACTV salinity measurements. Comparisons also show that turbulent vertical velocity perturbations can be estimated from the vertical motion of the ACTV. With these velocity estimates, horizontal profiles of the turbulent fluxes of heat, w'T', and salt, w'S', are also computed directly. Data from a wide (1000-m-wide) lead with rapid ice motion indicate stronger turbulence under the lead than downstream, but the character of the flow is that of a convective boundary layer modified by a change in surface buoyancy flux. The convection is characterized by multiple, intermittent plumes that scale in size with the mixed layer depth. At a medium-sized (100-m-wide) lead with slower ice motion the convective circulation set up by the lead is more apparent. Convective plumes are stronger and more prevalent at the lead edges, particularly the downstream edge. The comparison between the horizontal profiles from the ACTV and time series from fixed sensors suggests that lead convection is a combination of a near surface convective boundary layer and a deeper quasi-stationary convection pattern.

AB Airborne ground-penetrating synthetic aperture radar (GPSAR) using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offers advantages for many applications compared to established methods. In particular, these systems are useful for nontraversable terrain, where they could be used for the detection and localization of buried objects and structures. At distances of a few meters to the ground, refraction effects at the surface need to be considered in processing even for shallowly buried objects. Often the ground is assumed to be horizontal, which is not the case in many situations, such as uneven meadows or acres. This work investigates the influence of uneven ground on GPSAR images. It is shown that neglecting tilt in backprojection (BP) for shallowly buried targets leads to an apparent target shift. A model is derived to predict the shift for circular measurement trajectories and to estimate whether a loss of quality is to be expected. The model is verified using simulations, which are verified by measurement. It is concluded that tilt can be neglected in processing for shallowly buried targets. This is confirmed in a realistic measurement scenario.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Magnetic field sensors installed in the road infrastructure can be used for autonomous traffic flow parametrization. Although the main goal of such a measuring system is the recognition of the class of vehicle and classification, velocity is the essential parameter for further calculation and it must be estimated with high reliability. In-field test campaigns, during actual traffic conditions, showed that commonly accepted velocity estimation methods occasionally produce highly erroneous results. For anomaly detection, we propose a criterion and two different correction algorithms. Non-linear signal rescaling and time-based segmentation algorithms are presented and compared for faulty result mitigation. The first one consists of suppressing the highly distorted signal peaks and looking for the best match with cross-correlation. The second approach relies on signals segmentation according to the feature points and multiple cross-correlation comparisons. The proposed two algorithms are evaluated with a dataset of over 300 magnetic signatures of a vehicle from unconstraint traffic conditions. Results show that the proposed criteria highlight all greatly faulty results and that the correction algorithms reduce the maximum error by twofold, but due to the increased mean error, mitigation technics shall be used explicitly with distorted signals.

AB Self-driving and semi-self-driving cars play an important role in our daily lives. The effectiveness of these cars is based heavily on the use of their surrounding areas to collect sensitive and vital information. However, external infrastructures also play significant roles in the transmission and reception of control data, cooperative awareness messages, and caution notifications. In this case, roadside units are considered one of the most important communication peripherals. Random distribution of these infrastructures will overburden the spread of self-driving vehicles in terms of cost, bandwidth, connectivity, and radio coverage area. In this paper, a new distributed roadside unit is proposed to enhance the performance and connectivity of these cars. Therefore, this approach is based primarily on k-means to find the optimal location of each roadside unit. In addition, this approach supports dynamic mobility with a long period of connectivity for each car. Further, this system can adapt to various locations (e.g., highways, rural areas, urban environments). The simulation results of the proposed system are reflected in its efficiency and effectively. Thus, the system can achieve a high connectivity rate with a low error rate while reducing costs.

AB To improve the trajectory prediction accuracy of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with random behavior intentions, this paper presents a short-term four-dimensional (4D) trajectory prediction method based on spatio-temporal trajectory clustering. A spatio-temporal trajectory clustering algorithm is first designed to cluster the UAV trajectory segments divided by a fixed time window. Each trajectory segment is given a category label that represents some certain type of behavior characteristics, such as climbing, turning, descending, etc. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to identify the category label of a given trajectory segment by learning the behavior characteristics of different trajectory segments. Based on the long-short-term memory network (LSTM), a short-term trajectory prediction model for different categories of label trajectory segments is established. The global trajectory prediction includes several steps adopting the corresponding prediction models. Historical trajectory data of UAVs are used to validate the proposed prediction method. Experiment results indicate that the method can obtain obviously better prediction accuracy in a short prediction time range (0-3s) with acceptable efficiency compared to LSTM, GRU and velocity trend extrapolation.

AB Cameras are the primary sensor in automated driving systems. They provide high information density and are optimal for detecting road infrastructure cues laid out for human vision. Surround-view camera systems typically comprise of four fisheye cameras with 190 degrees+ field of view covering the entire 360 degrees around the vehicle focused on near-field sensing. They are the principal sensors for low-speed, high accuracy, and close-range sensing applications, such as automated parking, traffic jam assistance, and low-speed emergency braking. In this work, we provide a detailed survey of such vision systems, setting up the survey in the context of an architecture that can be decomposed into four modular components namely Recognition, Reconstruction, Relocalization, and Reorganization. We jointly call this the 4R Architecture. We discuss how each component accomplishes a specific aspect and provide a positional argument that they can be synergized to form a complete perception system for low-speed automation. We support this argument by presenting results from previous works and by presenting architecture proposals for such a system. Qualitative results are presented in the video at https://youtu.be/ae8bCOF77uY.

AB The vehicular Internet of Things (IoT) comprises enabling technologies for a large number of important applications including collaborative autonomous driving and advanced transportation systems. Due to the mobility of vehicles, strict application requirements, and limited communication resources, the conventional centralized control fails to provide sufficient quality of service for connected vehicles, so a decentralized approach is required in the vicinity to satisfy the requirements of delay-sensitive and mission-critical applications. A decentralized system is also more resistant to the single point of failure problem and malicious attacks. Blockchain technology has been attracting great interest due to its capability of achieving a decentralized, transparent, and tamper-resistant system. There are many studies focusing on the use of blockchain in managing data and transactions in vehicular environments. However, the application of blockchain in vehicular environments also faces some technical challenges. In this paper, we first explain the fundamentals of blockchain and vehicular IoT. Then, we conduct a literature review on the existing research efforts of the blockchain for vehicular IoT by discussing the research problems and technical issues. After that, we point out some future research issues considering the characteristics of both blockchain and vehicular IoT.

AB The German Aerospace Center (DLR) is currently developing the Reusability Flight Experiment (ReFEx). The successor of the already performed hypersonic flight experiments SHEFEX I and II shall be launched on a Brazilian VSB-30 sounding rocket in 2022 and shall achieve a re-entry velocity of more than Mach 5. The main goals of the project are the demonstration of a controlled autonomous re-entry flight from hypersonic velocity down to subsonic range and the testing of the key technologies required for future reusable first stage systems. Utilizing Concurrent Engineering (CE) approach the fundamental feasibility of this sophisticated flight experiment has been investigated by the entire ReFEx team. All required systems, including sensors and actuators as well as their interfaces have been defined and different options were assessed regarding matters such as the scientific output, complexity, risk and cost. The current configuration of ReFEx has a re-entry mass of about 400 kg, a length of 2.7 m and a wingspan of 1.1 m. This paper provides a system overview and addresses the Reusable Launch Vehicles (RLV) technologies Guidance, Navigation and Control as well as Flight Instrumentation. Furthermore the mission design (launch & re-entry) and the main challenges regarding the mission realization are addressed.

AB In this paper the subsumption theory is applied to flight control through composite rotations where multiple tasks can be defined as simple rotations. The tasks can then be arranged as a hierarchy, where the primary task is always fully pursued, and conflicting lower level tasks are removed by the primary rotation. The concept is applied to a group of UAVS that move through an urban terrain while avoiding collisions with the ground, the buildings and other UAVS as they track a desired waypoint.

AB When the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) lays the submarine cable in complex environment, it should balance the laying quality and its own safety. In this paper it designs an engineering modeling method under the condition of irregular obstacles and an obstacle avoidance method based on double closed loop control for AUV to lay the submarine cable. The model of irregular obstacle of bulge terrain and depression terrain are established respectively. Then the outer-loop controller based on model predictive control is designed to find the optimal path of AUV in order to avoid the unexpected obstacle. The segmented progressive optimization technique is used to keep the suspension height with the seabed. It could keep the minimal change of suspension height and obtain the shortest path. The best cabling path is designed by detecting the contour feature point and distinguishing the different work situations. The inner-loop controller based on Gaussian process is designed to reduce the influence of current interference. It compensates the control input with the mean value of Gaussian process by the outer-loop controller. Also this controller could reduce the outer-loop following error efficiently. In the simulation it compares double closed loop control with sphere model predictive control and double model predictive control respectively with the different obstacles. The result shows that double closed loop control improves the quality of the submarine cable laying and AUV's safety in the submarine complex environment effectively.

   SUBJECT
AB The current study employs a novel nonlinear robust control approach for path-following control of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with multiple uncertainties in the vertical plane. Firstly, a nonlinear underactuated AUV model is established to characterize the dynamics of AUV and path-following error. To resolve dependence on a detailed model that appeared in previous studies, the unknown time-varying attack angular velocity in the dynamic model of the path-following error is considered as the kinematic uncertainty, while the linear superposition of the external environmental disturbances, the perturbations in the internal model parameters, and other unmodeled dynamics in the dynamic model is chosen as lumped dynamic uncertainties. Several reduced-order extended state observers (ESOs) are designed for estimating both of these uncertainties. Secondly, to reduce the impact of input saturation and avoid the "explosion of complexity" associated with traditional back-stepping method, a nonlinear track differentiator (NTD) is utilized to follow the virtual control signal and its derivative. Thirdly, the constructed reduced-order ESOs and NTD are adopted to establish an augmented back-stepping controller, where its ability to stabilize the overall system is demonstrated using the Lyapunov theorem. Finally, extensive simulations and analyses in various working conditions, including the nominal working condition without disturbances, the working condition with multiple uncertainties, and the conditions which better replicate the actual environment, are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness, superiority, and robustness of the designed controller.

AB Regions worldwide are adopting and exploring low-speed automated electric shuttle (AES) service as an on-demand shared mobility service in dense geofenced urban areas. Building on this concept, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) recently developed the Automated Mobility District (AMD) toolkit. The AMD toolkit-comprising of a travel micro-simulation model and an energy estimation model-estimates the mobility and energy impacts of a given shuttle configuration within an AMD. Early-stage AMD deployments need to find optimal operational configurations that include: (a) passenger capacity of an AES, (b) time-dependent routes, and (c) fleet size (AES units) to satisfy the demand for the region. This research extends the AMD toolkit functionality by developing an optimization-based planning module that will assist in the operations of AES units. We developed a constrained mixed-integer program accounting for passenger waiting time, battery range, and passenger capacity of AES units. For scalability, we demonstrated the Tabu search-based solution technique for a real-world network-a proposed AMD deployment in Greenville, South Carolina, USA. Compared to rule-based operations, our developed solution yields higher travel time and energy savings for the network at different demand levels. The sensitivity analyses for waiting time thresholds indicate nonlinearity in the system performance, underscoring the need to meet shared-use mobility user-level expectations. The developed optimization framework can be adapted and extended to accommodate different categories of shared-use on-demand mobility services.

AB We describe a three-phase use of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Autonomous Benthic Explorer (ABE), to locate, map and photograph previously undiscovered fields of high temperature submarine hydrothermal vents. Our approach represents both a complement to and a significant advance beyond the prior state of the art. Previously, hydrothermal exploration relied upon deep-tow instruments equipped with sensors that could locate sites of active "black smoker" venting to within a few kilometers. Follow-on CTD tow-yos could then resolve the sites of seafloor venting to length scales of less than a kilometer but rarely to better than a few hundreds of meters. In our new approach ABE: (i) uses sensors to locate the center of a dispersing non-buoyant hydrothermal plume 100-400m above the seabed; (ii) makes high-resolution maps of the seafloor beneath the plume center whilst simultaneously detecting interception of any rising, buoyant hydrothermal Plumes; and (iii) dives to the seafloor to take photographs in and around any new vent site to characterize its geologic setting and reveal the nature of any chemosynthetic ecosystems it may host. By conducting all of the above under long-baseline navigation, precise sites of venting can be determined to within 5 in. Our approach can be used both to address important scientific issues in their own right and to ensure much more efficient use of other deep-submergence assets such as human occupied vehicles (HOVs) and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) during follow-on studies.

AB During the past few years, research in the field of cooperative control of swarm of robots and specially Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) has continuously increased. Towards this goal this paper identifies three problems: the development of a testbed for UAVs, the implementation of an ad hoc network and a protocol based on network control, and a consensus control algorithm for cooperative control of UAVs. Furthermore, a combination of Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) and Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) was developed to stabilize and control a fixed-wing UAV. The testbed currently enables us to perform waypoint navigation using a global positioning system (GPS) while at the same time maintains the UAV stable. Also, the control is transferable to similar UAV models with little to no change to the algorithm. The communication protocol designed for the ad hoc network has proved to be reliable for our application mid can be expanded to be used with different number of agents. The algorithm of consensus control has been analyzed and tested in simulation. Future work will allow implementing the consensus control as centralized control or distributed control.

ID SUBSIDIES; AGGLOMERATION; ECONOMIES
AB Public transport financing in Spain has generated interest due to the absence of a governing regulatory framework. There is a need for rules that help allocate public subsidies to guarantee the system's financial sustainability. Without explicit regulation, the current system for assigning and distributing public funding among Spanish cities has become unbalanced. Our goal is to identify the principal factors that explain why urban transport services in different cities require varying levels of public financing. Our results show that variables such as the passengers, number of vehicles, number of employees, autonomous community deficit, and population density are influencing factors for the needs of public subsidies.

TI MMCAN: Multi-Modal Cross-Attention Network for Free-Space Detection with

DT Article
DE autonomous vehicles; semantic segmentation; multi-spectral data fusion;
   uncalibrated sensors
AB Free-space detection plays a pivotal role in autonomous vehicle applications, and its state-of-the-art algorithms are typically based on semantic segmentation of road areas. Recently, hyperspectral images have proven useful supplementary information in multi-modal segmentation for providing more texture details to the RGB representations, thus performing well in road segmentation tasks. Existing multi-modal segmentation methods assume that all the inputs are well-aligned, and then the problem is converted to fuse feature maps from different modalities. However, there exist cases where sensors cannot be well-calibrated. In this paper, we propose a novel network named multi-modal cross-attention network (MMCAN) for multi-modal free-space detection with uncalibrated hyperspectral sensors. We first introduce a cross-modality transformer using hyperspectral data to enhance RGB features, then aggregate these representations alternatively via multiple stages. This transformer promotes the spread and fusion of information between modalities that cannot be aligned at the pixel level. Furthermore, we propose a triplet gate fusion strategy, which can increase the proportion of RGB in the multiple spectral fusion processes while maintaining the specificity of each modality. The experimental results on a multi-spectral dataset demonstrate that our MMCAN model has achieved state-of-the-art performance. The method can be directly used on the pictures taken in the field without complex preprocessing. Our future goal is to adapt the algorithm to multi-object segmentation and generalize it to other multi-modal combinations.

DT Article
ID CUSTOMER SATISFACTION; RESPONSIBILITY; PERFORMANCE; ATTRIBUTION; TRUST
AB The present study aims to examine customer responses to negative (vs. positive) service outcome with an autonomous vehicle (AV) vis-a-vis human agent. In the first study we manipulate the outcome of the service (negative vs. positive) and the type of service agent (AV vs. human) to evaluate customers' satisfaction with the service. Based on the results of the first study, in the second study we focus only on the negative outcome scenario and we examine how the perceived blame of the AV (vs. human agent) affects customers' satisfaction. Finally, in the third study we introduce another mediator, namely perceived competence, which explains why people attribute less blame to the AV (vs. human agent). Customers' satisfaction is higher for the AV only in the case of a negative service outcome, while no differences emerge when the service had a positive outcome. Additionally, AVs (vs. human agent) are perceived as less competent and blameworthy, leading to a higher customer satisfaction with the service in case of a negative outcome. These results show a customer under-reaction to negative service outcome with AVs. This has relevance for the design and policy implications related to AVs. Our results also provide insights into the psychological underpinnings of acceptance of AVs replacing human agents. This study extends previous literature by showing circumstances in which customers are more (or less) satisfied with an AVs (vs. human agents) and the psychological drivers of these asymmetrical responses.

ID SIMULATION
AB Planar motion mechanism tests have been widely used in the virtual form for ocean craft, especially for underwater vehicles. These tests involve a pre-determined sinusoidal trajectory for the AUV. While there are general guidelines for the choice of amplitude and frequency for such trajectories in existing literature, there are minimal to none for smaller submerged ocean craft such as autonomous underwater vehicles. This series of articles analyzes VPMM from the perspective of AUVs and the significance of variation in these parameters. The results in Part I of this series are discussed in terms of forces and moments reconstructed using hydrodynamic derivatives obtained through RANSE. This includes variation in forces and moments, and the possible non-linear effects that cause such variation. The resultant hydrodynamic damping derivatives show upto 50% variation based on parameters that signify pure sway and pure yaw simulations. The resultant added mass derivatives do not vary much among the various VPMM simulations attempted (<2%). The inflow angle to the craft is found to be significant in characterizing pure sway simulations.The results in Part II are discussed in terms of implemented dynamic maneuvers through RANSE and in field.

ID PIGEON-INSPIRED OPTIMIZATION
AB In this article, the automatic carrier landing problem of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is studied, where external disturbance and input constraint are considered. Deck motion prediction is necessary in classical automatic carrier landing system (ACLS), which is difficult to compensate precisely due to the motion is primarily stochastic. Thus, a relative motion model between the UAV and ideal glide path is established, by which the disturbance of the wave to the carrier is regarded as external disturbance to the model as well as the airwake to the UAV, and the problem of trajectory tracking is transformed into a stabilization problem. Moreover, nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode observer is designed to estimate disturbance, and it is proved that observed error can converge to residual in fixed time. In addition, an ACLS based on backstepping control structure is proposed, where input constraint is considered, and the closed-loop control system is proved to be stable by the Lyapunov function. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate reliability and superiority of the proposed ACLS.

AB This article presents a novel design of an attitude control system for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) based on inverse optimal control theory. The unknown disturbances and model uncertainties of the UAV system are estimated using a simple linear disturbance observer. Under reasonable assumptions and a suitable parameter design method, the estimation errors are ensured to be exponentially asymptotically stable. By appending the estimation errors to the state vector and creating a proper virtual control signal, we transformed the original system into disturbance-free linear systems. Thus, inverse optimal control theory is utilized to design an attitude controller by using the backstepping technique. With theoretical results that are mathematically proven, the proposed controller not only ensures asymptotic stability but also reduces the cost function that penalizes both stabilization errors and control inputs without solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman or Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation. Finally, simulation scenarios are set up to compare the performances of the proposed scheme with those of other techniques using sliding mode control and the classic PID controller. The simulation results show that the presented inverse optimal controller (IOC) guarantees the best performance in comparison with other approaches.

TI Collision Avoidance Decision Method for Unmanned Surface Vehicle Based
   on an Improved Velocity Obstacle Algorithm
SO JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE unmanned surface vehicle; COLREGs; velocity obstacle algorithm;
   multi-ship collision avoidance; emergency collision avoidance

AB To ensure navigation safety, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) need to have autonomous collision avoidance capability. A large number of studies on ship collision avoidance are available, and most of these papers assume that the target ships keep straight or follows the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS). However, in the actual navigation process, the target ship may temporarily turn. Based on the above reasons, this paper proposes a multi-ship collision avoidance decision method for USVs based on the improved velocity obstacle algorithm. In the basic dynamic ship domain model, a collision risk model is constructed to improve the accuracy of the risk assessment between the USV and target ships. The velocity obstacle algorithm is combined with the dynamic ship domain, and the collision avoidance timing and method are judged according to the collision risk. The simulation results show that the decision method can handle the situation that the target ship temporarily turns and has an emergency collision avoidance capability. Compared with the traditional VO algorithm, the collision avoidance time of the method is shorter, and the number of course changes is less.

AB The aim of this paper is to provide preliminary results on a traffic coordination framework based on stochastic task allocation. General trends and the predicted advent of personal aerial vehicles increase traffic rapidly, but current air traffic management methods admittedly cannot scale appropriately. A hierarchical system is proposed to overcome the problem, the middle layer of which is elaborated in this paper. This layer aims to enable stochastic control of traffic behaviour using a single parameter, which is achieved by applying distributed stochastic task allocation. The task allocation algorithm is used to allocate speeds to vehicles in a scalable way. By regulating the speed distribution of vehicles the conflict rates remain manageable. Multi-agent simulation results show that it is possible to control ensemble dynamics and together with that traffic safety and throughput via a single parameter. Using transient simulations the dynamic performance of the system is analysed. It is shown that the traffic conflict reduction problem can be transformed into a control design problem. The performance of a simple controller is also evaluated. It was shown that by applying the controller, quicker transients can be achieved for the mean speed of the system.

TI Laser-excited single crystal phosphor in white LED for wide field of
   view and high enhanced central brightness for vehicle headlights
SO AIP ADVANCES
LA English
DT Article
AB We demonstrate the generation of a laser hotspot by a laser-excited single crystal phosphor (SCP) converter layer in a white LED for producing a wide field of view (FOV) and high enhanced central brightness (ECB) for an adaptive-driving-beam (ADB) headlight. The SCP layer shows better thermal quench behavior than other phosphor converter layers because of the higher melting temperature of 1940 degrees C and larger thermal conductivity of 11 W/m degrees C. The advantage of this study is an optical design of the ADB headlight, in which the generation, mechanism, and characterization of the laser hotspot are investigated in detail. The proposed scheme enables a wide FOV of +/- 16.8 degrees and high ECB of the high beam, compliant with the Economic Commission for Europe regulation of vehicle headlights. The wide FOV provides better visibility, while the high ECB improves the long-distance illumination of the headlights. This proposed ADB headlight is a promising headlight candidate for use in the next-generation autonomous vehicle applications.

AB Aerial networks have been widely considered a crucial component for ubiquitous coverage in the next-generation mobile networks. In this scenario, mobile edge computing (MEC) and rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) are potential technologies, which are enabled at aerial platforms for computation and communication enhancements, respectively. Motivated from this vision, we proposed a high altitude platform-mounted MEC (HAMEC) system in such an RSMA environment, where aerial users (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles) can efficiently offload their tasks to the HAMEC for external computing acquisition. To this end, a joint configuration of key parameters in HAMEC and RSMA (referred to as HAMEC-RSMA) such as offloading decision, splitting ratio, transmit power, and decoding order was optimally designed for a processing cost minimization in terms of response latency and energy consumption. Subsequently, the optimization problem was transformed into a reinforcement learning model, which is solvable using the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method. To improve the training exploration of the algorithm, we employed parameter noises to the DDPG algorithm to enhance training performance. Simulation results demonstrated the efficiency of the HAMEC-RSMA system with superior performances compared to benchmark schemes.

AB Software in modern vehicles consists of multi-criticality functions, where a function can be safety-critical with stringent real-time requirements, less critical from the vehicle operation perspective, but still with real-time requirements, or not critical at all. Next-generation autonomous vehicles will require higher computational power to run multi-criticality functions and such a power can only be provided by parallel computing platforms such as multi-core architectures. However, current model-based software development solutions and related modelling languages have not been designed to effectively deal with challenges specific of multi-core, such as core-interdependency and controlled allocation of software to hardware. In this paper, we report on the evolution of the Rubus Component Model for the modelling, analysis, and development of vehicular software systems with multi-criticality for deployment on multi-core platforms. Our goal is to provide a lightweight and technology-preserving transition from model-based software development for single-core to multi-core. This is achieved by evolving the Rubus Component Model to capture explicit concepts for multi-core and parallel hardware and for expressing variable criticality of software functions. The paper illustrates these contributions through an industrial application in the vehicular domain.

DE Intent prediction; pedestrian path prediction; autonomous vehicles;

AB The problem of intent understanding between highly and fully automated vehicles and vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians in urban traffic environment has got some momentum over the past few years. Previous work has been tackling the problem using two commonapproaches, namely dynamical motion modeling and motion planning. In this paper, a novel radical end-to-end data-driven approach is proposed for long-term intent prediction of VRUs in urban traffic environment based solely on their motion trajectories. In the proposed approach, we utilized the widely adopted architecture of recurrent neural networks with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) modules to form a deep stacked LSTM network. Three common approaches used in the literature were compared against our proposed approach over two different real-world datasets involving pedestrians collected from vehicle-based stereo cameras. The results over the testing datasets showed that the proposed approach achieved higher accuracies over most of the scenarios of the testing datasets with a small mean lateral position error of 0.48 m. Moreover, the proposed approach showed also a significant generalization capability over totally unobserved testing scenes during the training phase with only 0.58 m in mean lateral position error.

AB Droop control has been extensively used by academia and industry for managing frequency fluctuations at microgrid (MG). This controller generates series of reference signals to different distributed energy sources (DES) such as diesel generator, PV, and wind system based on their respective maximum capacities. However, the combination of inertial and noninertial DES leads to frequency fluctuations at MG. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel frequency support strategy by controlling the operation of DES and controllable loads, i.e., electric vehicles (EVs). Moreover, fleet of EVs batteries maximum capacity depends upon constraints, such as state of charge (SoC), random arrival, and departure patterns. Hence, to accomodate EVs' batteries with droop controller, it has been enhanced with communication links and feedback mechanism and referred as modified droop controller (MDC). This MDC would be now able to dispatch reference signals to both DES and EVs. However, for meeting reference signal given to fleet of EVs, an aggregator (AG) is proposed. AG can alter the charging and discharging rates of EVs' thereby satisfying EVs' needs in terms of battery's SoC. Extensive simulations have been done using the proposed scheme on data available from Santa Rita Jails' MG.

AB Existing studies on data acquisition in vehicular networks often take the mobile vehicular nodes as data carriers. However, their autonomous movements, limited resources and security risks impact the quality of services. In this article, we propose a data acquisition model using stable matching of bipartite graph in cooperative vehicle-infrastructure systems, namely, DAS. Contents are distributed to roadside units, while vehicular nodes support supplementary storage. The original distribution problem is formulated as a stable matching problem of bipartite graph, where the data and the storage cells compose two sides of vertices. Regarding the factors relevant with the access ratio and delay, the preference rankings for contents and roadside units are calculated, respectively. With a multi-replica preprocessing algorithm to handle the potential one-to-many mapping, the matching problem is addressed in polynomial time. In addition, vehicular nodes carry and forward assistant contents to deliver the failed packets because of bandwidth competition. Furthermore, an incentive strategy is put forward to boost the vehicle cooperation and to achieve a fair bandwidth allocation at roadside units. Experiments show that DAS achieves a high access ratio and a small storage cost with an acceptable delay.

TI Robust monocular visual odometry for road vehicles using uncertain

DE Visual odometry; Localization; Computer vision; SLAM
AB Many emerging applications in the field of assisted and autonomous driving rely on accurate position information. Satellite-based positioning is not always sufficiently reliable and accurate for these tasks. Visual odometry can provide a solution to some of these shortcomings. Current systems mainly focus on the use of stereo cameras, which are impractical for large-scale application in consumer vehicles due to their reliance on accurate calibration. Existing monocular solutions on the other hand have significantly lower accuracy. In this paper, we present a novel monocular visual odometry method based on the robust tracking of features in the ground plane. The key concepts behind the method are the modeling of the uncertainty associated with the inverse perspective projection of image features and a parameter space voting scheme to find a consensus on the vehicle state among tracked features. Our approach differs from traditional visual odometry methods by applying 2D scene and motion constraints at the lowest level instead of solving for the 3D pose change. Evaluation both on the public KITTI benchmark and our own dataset show that this is a viable approach for visual odometry which outperforms basic 3D pose estimation due to the exploitation of the largely planar structure of road environments.

AB This paper presents positioning improvement of a laser navigation system (LNS) using the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and fuzzy inference system (FIS) for an automatic guided vehicle (AGV). The existing AGVs mainly used a magnetic system or an inductive system as a guidance system. However, those systems have high initial facility cost and are difficult to maintain according to changes of environment, and it can drive only the designated path by sensors which are installed on. The laser guidance system is developed to solve these problems, but it also has limitations which are slow response time and low accuracy. Therefore, we propose a sensor fusion method for the AGV. The sensors used in this paper are encoders, a gyro and the LNS, and they are fused by the UKF and FIS. To analyze the performance of the proposed system, we designed a fork-type AGV for ourselves and performed the experiment that was repeated 10 times under the same working conditions. In experimental results, we verified that the proposed method could improve positioning accuracy of the LNS effectively. In addition, it was appropriate to apply a real AGV system for autonomous driving. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the vertical takeoff, landing and transition between level flight and hovering of a tail-sitter vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aerial robot. The tail-sitter is suitable for micro aerial vehicles because it does not need any extra equipment for the VTOL maneuver. The developed tail-sitter aerial robot is equipped with four actuators for controlling ailerons, an elevator, a rudder and a propeller. A micro computer, various sensors and a battery are mounted on the aerial robot for autonomous flight without any support from a ground system. A transition flight strategy is constructed so that the transition finishes in the shortest time restricting an altitude change. In order to achieve the transition strategy, the reference trajectory of the pitch angle is computed offline by using an optimization technique. In the transition flight control system, a PID feedback controller is applied to attitude control, while a feedforward controller is applied to altitude control. The gain scheduling is applied to the control of the rudder and aileron. The experimental results on the transition between level flight and hovering, takeoff, and landing are presented.

AB Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) with autonomous behavior and decentralized human-machine interaction (HMI) are suitable for use in logistics. To facilitate natural interaction, HMI may involve both speech and gesture control.This paper presents a new cognitive approach based on electroencephalography (EEG) for multimodal HMI combining speech and gesture control for AGVs used in logistics. The results indicate that implicit EEG-based measures such as alertness and relaxation significantly affect speech control performance. Consequently, monitoring the user's cognitive workload during logistic operations may lead to a substantial improvement in work performance. (C) 2016 CIRP.

AB Objective: The objective of this article is to describe the characteristics of fatal crashes with bicyclists on Swedish roads in rural and urban areas and to investigate the potential of bicycle helmets and different vehicle and road infrastructure interventions to prevent them. The study has a comprehensive approach to provide road authorities and vehicle manufacturers with recommendations for future priorities. Methods: The Swedish Transport Administration's (STA) in-depth database of fatal crashes was used for case-by-case analysis of fatal cycling accidents (2006-2016) on rural (n = 82) and urban (n = 102) roads. The database consists of information from the police, medical journals, autopsy reports, accident analyses performed by STA, and witness statements. The potential of helmet use and various vehicle and road infrastructure safety interventions was determined retrospectively for each case by analyzing the chain of events leading to the fatality. The potential of vehicle safety countermeasures was analyzed based on prognoses on their implementation rates in the Swedish vehicle fleet. Results: The most common accident scenario on rural roads was that the bicyclist was struck while cycling along the side of the road. On urban roads, the majority of accidents occurred in intersections. Most accidents involved a passenger car, but heavy trucks were also common, especially in urban areas. Most accidents occurred in daylight conditions (73%). Almost half (46%) of nonhelmeted bicyclists would have survived with a helmet. It was assessed that nearly 60% of the fatal accidents could be addressed by advanced vehicle safety technologies, especially autonomous emergency braking with the ability to detect bicyclists. With regard to interventions in the road infrastructure, separated paths for bicyclists and bicycle crossings with speed calming measures were found to have the greatest safety potential. Results indicated that 91% of fatally injured bicyclists could potentially be saved with known techniques. However, it will take a long time for such technologies to be widespread. Conclusions: The majority of fatally injured bicyclists studied could potentially be saved with known techniques. A speedy implementation of important vehicle safety systems is recommended. A fast introduction of effective interventions in the road infrastructure is also necessary, preferably with a plan for prioritization.

AB Autonomous driving is predicted to play a large part in future transportation systems, providing benefits such as enhanced road usage and mobility schemes. However, self-driving cars must be perceived as safe drivers by other road users and contribute to traffic safety in addition to being operationally safe. Despite efforts to develop machine learning algorithms and solutions for the safety of automated vehicles, researchers have yet to agree upon a single approach to categorizing and accurately detecting safe and unsafe driving behaviors. This paper proposes a modified Z-score method-based autoencoder for anomalous behavior detection using multiple driving indicators. The experiments are performed on the benchmark Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) vehicle trajectories and supporting datasets to discover anomalous driving behavior to assess our proposed approach's performance. The experiments reveal that the proposed approach detected 81 anomalous driving behaviors out of 1031 naturalistic driving behavior instances (7.86%) with an accuracy of 96.31% without early stopping. With early stopping, our method successfully detected 147 anomalous driving behaviors (14.26%) with an accuracy of 95.25%. Overall, the proposed approach provides promising results for detecting anomalous driving behavior in automated vehicles using multiple driving indicators.

AB Low-latency data delivery in sparse deployment scenarios is a challenging problem. The emergence of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) provides a viable path to solve this problem. In the existing UAV-assisted IoT system, UAVs usually complete data collection through task collaboration, but there is no data relay transmission between UAVs. The main bottleneck of this mode is that the UAV responsible for the edge region of the ground sensor network needs to fly a long distance to send data to the base station, which will seriously affect the age of information (AoI) performance of the system. Therefore, in this work, we design a UAV-assisted IoT data collection mechanism based on an aerial collaborative relay and propose an AoI-sensitive data collection (ADC) scheme. In this scheme, we design a generalized AoI expectation (GAE) function to achieve iterative optimization of UAV flight paths. Extensive experimental results have shown that the proposed data collection scheme requires less deployment preparation time while obtaining better AoI performance than existing data collection schemes.

AB Lane-changing is a critical issue for autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially in complex environments. In addition, different drivers have different handling preferences. How to provide personalized maneuvers for individual drivers to increase their trust is another issue for AVs. Therefore, a framework of human-like path planning is proposed in this paper, considering driver characteristics of visual-preview, subjective risk perception, and degree of aggressiveness. In the decision making module, a model is built to select the most suitable merging spot, with respect to safety factors and the driver's degree of aggressiveness. And a novel environmental potential field (PF) suitable for arbitrary road structures is designed to describe the driver's individual risk perception. In the trajectory planning module, a model predictive control (MPC) based path planner is designed according to the decisions in coincidence with the driver's individual intentions of collision avoidance. Simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed path planner can provide with personalized trajectories for different combinations of driver preferences and steering characteristics, in scenarios of curved roads with different risks of collision.

AB Obstacle detection plays an important role in unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). The USVs operate in a highly diverse environments in which an obstacle may be a floating piece of wood, a scuba diver, a pier, or a part of a shoreline, which presents a significant challenge to continuous detection from images taken on board. This paper addresses the problem of online detection by constrained, unsupervised segmentation. To this end, a new graphical model is proposed that affords a fast and continuous obstacle image-map estimation from a single video stream captured on board a USV. The model accounts for the semantic structure of marine environment as observed from USV by imposing weak structural constraints. A Markov random field framework is adopted and a highly efficient algorithm for simultaneous optimization of model parameters and segmentation mask estimation is derived. Our approach does not require computationally intensive extraction of texture features and comfortably runs in real time. The algorithm is tested on a new, challenging, dataset for segmentation, and obstacle detection in marine environments, which is the largest annotated dataset of its kind. Results on this dataset show that our model outperforms the related approaches, while requiring a fraction of computational effort.

AB Stability is an important concern for vehicles which move heavy loads, accelerate or brake aggressively, turn at speed, or operate on sloped terrain. In many cases, vehicles face more than one of these challenges simultaneously. Some are obliged to execute these maneuvers when their high centers of gravity leave them particularly vulnerable to tipover or rollover A methodology is presented to estimate proximity to tipover for autonomous field robots that must be productive, effective, and self-reliant tinder such challenging circumstances. While the physical principles governing the computation of stability margin have been known for some time, the realization of these principles in practice raises issues which are at once similar to those of attitude estimation while contrasting heavily with inertial guidance. The problem of stability, margin estimation is posed in the fairly general case of accelerated articulating motion over tough terrain. Compatibility with and distinctions from attitude estimation lead to a proposed integrated solution to both problems based oil the fusion of inertial, articulation, and terrain relative velocity, sensing in an optimal estimation framework. An implementation of a device targeted to an industrial lift track is presented.

AB Deep ocean science is poised to enter a new millennium characterized by cooperation among scientists of many different disciplines who are seeking to gain an understanding of the complex linkages between physical, chemical, biological, and geological processes occurring at and beneath the ocean floor in the world oceans. This multidisciplinary imperative has been spurred by unprecedented advances in understanding the complexities and interdependence of these phenomena made possible through research that used deep submergence vehicles over the past two decades. Marine scientists of all disciplines are forecasting that the next decade will see et en greater linkage between oceanographic disciplines. The need to understand the temporal dimension of the processes being studied will sustain continued use of deep ocean submersibles and utilization of newly developed, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for conducting time-series and observatory-based research in the deep ocean and at the seafloor. These approaches will enable marine scientists to achieve a greater understanding of global processes and of climate change and geochemical mass balance These same approaches will enable them to grapple with intriguing problems concerning the interrelated processes of crustal generation, evolution and transport of geochemical fluids in the crust and into the oceans and origins and proliferation of life both on Earth and beyond.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB In recent years, deep learning has achieved excellent performance in a growing number of application fields. With the help of high computation and large-scale datasets, deep learning models with huge parameters constantly enhance the performance of traditional algorithms. Additionally, the AdaBoost algorithm, as one of the traditional machine learning algorithms, has a minimal model and performs well on small datasets. However, it is still challenging to select the optimal classification feature template from a large pool of features in any scene quickly and efficiently. Especially in the field of autonomous vehicles, images taken by onboard cameras contain all kinds of targets on the road, which means the images are full of multiple features. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Cascade AdaBoost model, which effectively combines the unsupervised clustering algorithm based on deep learning and the traditional AdaBoost algorithm. First, we use the unsupervised clustering algorithm to classify the sample data automatically. We can obtain classification subsets with small intra-class and large inter-class errors by specifying positive and negative samples. Next, we design a training framework for Cascade-AdaBoost based on clustering and mathematically demonstrate that our framework has better detection performance than the traditional Cascade-AdaBoost framework. Finally, experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our model performs better than the traditional Cascade-AdaBoost algorithm in terms of accuracy and time. The detection time was shortened by 30%, and the false detection rate was reduced by 20%. Meanwhile, the training time of our model is significantly shorter than the traditional Cascade-AdaBoost algorithm.

AB Lately, the integration of renewable energy sources (e.g., photovoltaic and wind generation systems) has been raised into microgrids interconnected with plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). Such intermittent generation and charging/discharging PEV profiles are challenging to ensure the secure and optimal operation of microgrids. In this article, an optimization approach is proposed to determine the optimal locations and sizes of photovoltaic and wind generation systems in microgrids with PEV-parking lots. The developed approach addresses 1) the uncertainty of generation profiles of photovoltaic and wind generation systems and loads; 2) the DSTATCOM feature of photovoltaic and wind generation systems; and 3) microgrid constraints. The feasible PEV conditions are also considered, i.e., initial and preset conditions of their state of charge, arriving and departing times, and various controlled/uncontrolled charging schemes. To solve the planning model, we have developed a bilevel metaheuristic-based approach. The upper-level and lower-level optimization tasks are to optimize the decision variables of renewable energy sources and PEVs, respectively. Both energy losses through the lines and energy from the main grid are considered as subobjectives to be minimized. Various simulations and study cases are performed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The outcomes show the efficacy of the proposed approach to simultaneously plan renewable energy sources and manage PEVs to form an autonomous microgrid.

AB The sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) fishery in the Atlantic is assessed during annual surveys by using both dredging and surface-deployed imaging techniques. In this pilot study in the Mid-Atlantic Bight, we used an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to photograph the seafloor and to evaluate its use for determining scallop density and size. During 22 surveys in 2011, 257 km of seafloor were photographed, resulting in over 203,000 color images. Using trained annotators and photogrammetric software, we determined scallop density and shell heights for 15,252 scallops. The inshore scallop grounds near Long Island (at depths < 40 m) had a density of 0.077 scallops per m(2), whereas the inshore grounds of the New York Bight had a density of 0.012 scallops per m(2). Shell heights derived from images were found to agree well with measurements from scallops collected with a commercial dredge. We show that images obtained with an AUV can be used to reliably estimate both density and shell height consistent with direct sampling from the same area. Moreover, side-scan sonar images obtained with an AUV can be used to detect dredge scars and, therefore, can provide a simultaneous, relative estimate of fishing effort in that area. AUVs provide a highly accurate suite of data for each survey site and therefore allow the design of experimental studies of fishing practices.

AB A relatively novel approach of autonomous navigation employing platform dynamics as the primary process model raises new implementational challenges. These are related to: (i) potential numerical instabilities during longer flights; (ii) the quality of model self-calibration and its applicability to different flights; (iii) the establishment of a global estimation methodology when handling different initialisation flight phases; and (iv) the possibility of reducing computational load through model simplification. We propose a unified strategy for handling different flight phases with a combination of factorisation and a partial Schmidt-Kalman approach. We then investigate the stability of the in-air initialisation and the suitability of reusing pre-calibrated model parameters with their correlations. Without GNSS updates, we suggest setting a subset of the state vector as 'considered' states within the filter to remove their estimation from the remaining observations. We support all propositions with new empirical evidence: first in model-parameter self-calibration via optimal smoothing and second through applying our methods on three test flights with dissimilar durations and geometries. Our experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in autonomous navigation quality for twelve different scenarios.

AB Navigation has been a major challenge for the successful operation of an autonomous aircraft. Although success has been achieved using active methods such as radar, sonar, lidar and the global positioning system (GPS), such methods are not always suitable due to their susceptibility to jamming and outages. Vision, as a passive navigation method, is considered as an excellent alternative; however, the development of vision-based autonomous systems for outdoor environments has proven difficult. For flying systems, this is compounded by the additional challenges posed by environmental and atmospheric conditions. In this paper, we present a novel passive vision-based algorithm which is invariant to illumination, scale and rotation. We use a three stage landmark recognition algorithm and an algorithm for waypoint matching. Our algorithms have been tested in both synthetic and real-world outdoor environments demonstrating overall good performance. We further compare our feature matching method with the speed-up robust features (SURF) method with results demonstrating that our method outperforms the SURF method in feature matching as well as computational cost.

AB Inspired by the vision of fully autonomous airside operations at Schiphol airport, this study aims to contribute to the short-term goal of automated aircraft ground handling. In this research, we design and evaluate a multi-agent system for planning of automated ground handling. There are two main components in the system: task allocation optimization and multi-agent path planning. To allocate tasks to ground support equipment (GSE) vehicles, an auction mechanism inspired by temporal sequential single item (TeSSI) auction is proposed. Ground handling tasks scheduling for GSE vehicles is modeled as several single-vehicle pickup and delivery optimization problems (SPDP), and the values of the objective functions are used to generate bids for GSE vehicle agents in the auction. Prioritized safe interval path planning for large agents (LA-SIPP) is used to plan collision-free paths for GSE vehicle agents in the model to execute tasks. The aim is to increase the success rates of allocating tasks and finding collision free paths without causing flight delays, given the limited resources such as a small number of available GSE vehicles, time windows constraints and conflicting interests of different agents. Due to the results, even for the instances with frequent flights and the most limited resources, the success rates of allocation and path planning were higher than 81% and 98%, respectively. Furthermore, periodic task allocation and path planning of the ground handling tasks for flights in three aircraft stands during a planning time window of the day, as well as replanning in case of disruptions were performed in a short CPU time. There is a lack of research dealing with the complete process of ground handling, since existing studies concerning the automation of ground handling operations involve fleet assignment or task scheduling models without an integration of detailed path planning. Our main contribution is to present a framework that combines task allocation and path planning for automation of ground handling operations and provides solutions using a multi-agent perspective. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Membership-based short-term car rental-more popularly referred to in the marketplace and popular media as "car-sharing"-has been expanding rapidly worldwide. The advent of self-driving vehicles is likely to facilitate the growth of car-sharing by addressing a couple of the current barriers, including limited dedicated parking and non-competitive access times. Despite the growing importance of this topic, however, the patterns emerging in the market penetration of automated vehicles in car-sharing programs have not received much attention in the literature because of the relative newness of the automated vehicle technologies enabling them. Towards addressing this research gap in this increasingly important area, this paper presents the results of an Australian survey with a focus on consumer preferences towards car-sharing. A stated preference (SP) methodology was adopted to elicit consumers' valuation of specified mode-choice related factors. In particular, vehicle self-driving capability, a factor rarely examined in the literature, was provided as an option to participants in the SP survey. To increase the realness of the experiment, SP tasks were pivoted from respondents' most recent trips. The travel preferences data were analyzed using a random parameter (mixed) logit model. To explore preference heterogeneity, socio-demographic and other factors were interacted with alternative-specific attributes, and their influences on marginal utilities were extracted using simulation analysis. Preference heterogeneity across individuals towards shared automated vehicles (SAVs) was identified. Consistent with the literature, consumers' experience of using car-sharing appears to have significant influence on household mode choices, increasing the probability of using a diversified mode tools (e.g., TWS and Taxi) and decreasing the likelihood of choosing to use privately owned travel tools, such as private car. Although it has been argued in the literature that females, non-drivers, and the elderly are the most likely to benefit from SAVs, the results of this study reveal that these user groups in fact hold negative opinions about SAVs. The findings highlight the challenges policymakers may encounter in maximizing the social and individual benefits of SAVs.

After formalizing the notion of scalability, we give two sufficient conditions to assess this property. Our results can be used to study leader-follower and leaderless networks and allow us to consider the case when the desired configuration of the system changes over time. We show how our conditions can be turned into design guidelines to guarantee scalability and illustrate their effectiveness via numerical examples.

DISCOVERY models mobile autonomous underwater vehicles, distributed sensor and actuator nodes, as well as multi-agent data-to-decision integration. The simulator is a real-time system using a discrete action model, fractal-based terrain modelling, with 3D visualization and an evaluation mode, allowing to compute various objective functions and metrics. The quantitative measures of multi-agent dynamics can be used as a feedback for evolving the agent behaviors. An evaluation of a simple simulated scenario with a heterogeneous team is also described.

AB Potential function methods have been applied extensively to many terrestrial and space robot control problems. This paper extends these methods to multiple robot problems for on-orbit assembly. By considering a population of free-flying robotic vehicles in orbit, capable of both rotation and translation, the potential function method reduces complex assembly problems to sets of simple translation and rotational commands. This is achieved using a potential function incorporating both collision avoidance between the free-flyers and connection constraints in the assembled structure. The method also allows a subsumptive type control architecture with the flexibility to carry out many different assembly tasks simultaneously.

AB Traffic safety technologies revolve around two principle ideas; crash avoidance and injury mitigation for inevitable crashes. The development of relevant vehicle injury mitigating technologies should consider the interaction of those two technologies, ensuring that the inevitable crashes can be adequately managed by the occupant and vulnerable road user (VRU) protection systems. A step towards that is the accurate description of the expected crashes remaining when crash-avoiding technologies are available in vehicles. With the overall objective of facilitating the assessment of future traffic safety, this study develops a method for predicting crash configurations when introducing crash-avoiding countermeasures. The predicted crash configurations are one important factor for prioritizing the evaluation and development of future occupant and VRU protection systems. By using real-world traffic accident data to form the baseline and performing counterfactual model-in-the-loop (MIL) pre-crash simulations, the change in traffic situations (vehicle crashes) provided by vehicles with crashavoiding technologies can be predicted. The method is built on a novel crash configuration definition, which supports further analysis of the in-crash phase. By clustering and grouping the remaining crashes, a limited number of crash configurations can be identified, still representing and covering the real-world variation. The developed method was applied using Swedish national- and in-depth accident data related to urban intersections and highway driving, and a conceptual Autonomous Emergency Braking system (AEB) computational model. Based on national crash data analysis, the conflict situations Same-Direction rear-end frontal (SD-ref) representing 53 % of highway vehicle-to-vehicle (v2v) crashes, and Straight Crossing Path (SCP) with 21 % of urban v2v intersection crashes were selected for this study. Pre-crash baselines, for SD-ref (n = 1010) and SCP (n = 4814), were prepared based on in-depth accident data and variations of these. Pre-crash simulations identified the crashes not avoided by the conceptual AEB, and the clustering of these revealed 5 and 52 representative crash configurations for the highway SD-ref and urban intersection SCP conflict situations, respectively, to be used in future crashworthiness studies.

ID NETWORK; MODEL
AB Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are used for vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications. They are a special type of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) that can share useful information to improve road traffic and safety. In VANETs, vehicles are interconnected through a wireless medium, making the network susceptible to various attacks, such as Denial of Service (DoS), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), or even black hole attacks that exploit the wireless medium to disrupt the network. These attacks degrade the network performance of VANETs and prevent legitimate users from accessing resources. VANETs face unique challenges due to the fast mobility of vehicles and dynamic changes in network topology. The high-speed movement of vehicles results in frequent alterations in the network structure, posing difficulties in establishing and maintaining stable communication. Moreover, the dynamic nature of VANETs, with vehicles joining and leaving the network regularly, adds complexity to implementing effective security measures. These inherent constraints necessitate the development of robust and efficient solutions tailored to VANETs, ensuring secure and reliable communication in dynamic and rapidly evolving environments. Therefore, securing communication in VANETs is a crucial requirement. Traditional security countermeasures are not pertinent to autonomous vehicles. However, many machine learning (ML) technologies are being utilized to classify malicious packet information and a variety of solutions have been suggested to improve security in VANETs. In this paper, we propose an enhanced intrusion detection framework for VANETs that leverages mutual information to select the most relevant features for building an effective model and synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE) to deal with the class imbalance problem. Random Forest (RF) is applied as our classifier, and the proposed method is compared with different ML techniques such as logistic regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The model is tested on three datasets, namely ToN-IoT, NSL-KDD, and CICIDS2017, addressing challenges such as missing values, unbalanced data, and categorical values. Our model demonstrated great performance in comparison to other models. It achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score, with a 100% accuracy rate on the ToN-IoT dataset and 99.9% on both NSL-KDD and CICIDS2017 datasets. Furthermore, the ROC curve analysis demonstrated our model's exceptional performance, achieving a 100% AUC score.

ID AUTONOMOUS EMERGENCY BRAKING
AB Government and consumer-information organizations can motivate automakers to address additional crash types through front crash prevention (FCP) testing programs. This study examined the current state of crashes potentially relevant to current and future FCP systems to provide a roadmap for the next crash types that vehicle testing programs in the United States should evaluate.Crash records from 2016 to 2020 were extracted from the Crash Report Sampling System (CRSS) and the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS). Crashes were restricted to ones involving no more than two vehicles where the striking or path-intruding vehicle was a passenger vehicle and a vehicle defect was not coded. Per-centages of police-reported crashes, nonfatal-injury crashes, and fatal crashes were computed for different crash types and circumstances.Rear-end and pedestrian crashes evaluated in existing FCP testing programs accounted for 27% of all police-reported crashes, 19% of nonfatal-injury crashes, and 18% of fatal crashes. The remaining crash types relevant to FCP accounted for 25% of police-reported crashes, 31% of nonfatal-injury crashes, and 23% of fatal crashes. A turning passenger vehicle crossing the path of an oncoming vehicle accounted for the largest proportion of the remaining police-reported (8%) and nonfatal-injury crashes (13%). Head-on crashes accounted for the largest proportion of remaining fatal crashes (9%). Most FCP-relevant police-reported crashes occurred on roads with a posted speed limit between 30 and 50 mph. Medium/heavy trucks were the crash partner in a disproportionate number of fatal head-on and rear-end crashes and motorcycles in a disproportionate number of fatal rear-end and turning crossing-path crashes. Fatal bicyclist and pedestrian crashes were overrepresented at night.The findings from this study indicate that testing organizations should evaluate FCP performance at higher speeds; with non-passenger vehicles and vulnerable road users; during the night; and in more complex head-on and turning crash scenarios to reduce crashes of all severities. Some of these conditions are currently assessed by other testing organizations and can be readily adopted by U.S. programs or possibly addressed with new ap-proaches like virtual testing.

AB This paper is devoted to solving autonomous navigation for unmanned surface vessels (USVs) in unknown environments. To overcome the deficiency of the "first planning then tracking" motion control framework, a novel simultaneous planning and control (SPC) method is developed. The developed method combines an improved artificial potential field (IAPF) and model predictive control (MPC) techniques. Improvements in the IAPF are made to deal with constraints on angular velocity. In each step of the SPC method, the IAPF is used for robust and efficient tracking in a short future. And the MPC is implemented to generate actual control commands for high-precision tracking. The IAPF and the MPC work in an alternative way to drive the USV to the prescribed target while avoiding the obstacles detected around. Simulations with static and dynamic obstacles demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The method works well when maneuvering in complex environments even crossing narrow tunnels.

AB Over the past few years, the number of fatalities and severe injuries of vulnerable road users, particularly pedestrians, has risen substantially. Clearly, the safe mobility of pedestrians is critical in our transportation system. Technology can help reduce vehicle-pedestrian crashes, fatalities, and injuries. Emerging technologies such as pedestrian crash prevention (PCP) systems utilized in on-road vehicles have the potential to mitigate pedestrian crash severity or prevent crashes. However, the reliability and effectiveness of these technologies have remained uncertain. This study contributes toward understanding the effectiveness of PCP systems utilized in on-road vehicles with a low level of automation by investigating two crossing and one longitudinal scenarios. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety field test data from 2018 to 2021 is harnessed, where several on-road vehicles and their PCP systems are evaluated in terms of safety. The large-scale experimental dataset is comprised of 3095 tests of 91 vehicles with different sizes, makes, and models. The empirical results indicate that in hazardous pedestrian-vehicle conflict situations, the performance of PCP systems has been improved during recent years. The test data shows that some pedestrians were undetected in some tests, but on average, in 70% of the tests, the PCP systems avoided pedestrian crashes. However, for the occurred crashes, PCP systems, on average, were able to mitigate impact speeds of >50%. In real-life situations, this could translate to substantial reductions in injury and fatality risk. Through rigorous analysis, the associations of key factors in the studied scenarios and the performance of PCP systems are explored and discussed in this paper. The modeling results show that increasing the maximum deceleration rate of the PCP system and lower weight of vehicles can significantly improve the performance of the PCP system by decreasing the speed at impact with pedestrians. The average maximum deceleration utilized in PCP systems has been increased over time from 7.48 m/s2 in 2018 to 9.36 m/s2 in 2021. This can be one of the reasons behind the improvement of PCP systems during recent years.

AB Decision support and decision making systems find increasingly more applications in various modes of transport. In this connection, criteria of movement safety assessment must be established for manned, unmanned, and autonomous vehicles, bearing in mind the specifics of each transport mode. Distance is one of the basic criteria. In sea transport these include the closest point of approach and ship's domain understood as an area that should remain free of other objects. The authors examine the relationship between the declared domain and the actually maintained effective domain in a restricted area. They define the coefficient describing this relationship for different ship's relative bearings in the form of a mathematical function. The formulated relationship allows determining an effective passing distance based on the declared, i.e., assumed passing distance. The determined relationship also enables identification of the declarative domain based on the effective one. These relationships may be used in decision support systems of manned ships, in remote ship control centres and decision-making systems of autonomous ships for the assessment of ship movement safety, planning collision avoidance manoeuvres and generation of safe trajectories.

AB In order to clean the surfaces of air ducts in underground facilities, recent research has been conducted on driving the control and development of an autonomous mobile duct-cleaning platform. The duct-cleaning robots removes contaminants that are inside a duct using the friction between a rotating cleaning brush and the duct surface. For the effective removal of the contaminants and stable steering control of the autonomous mobile platform, the interaction force between the brush and the duct surface needs to be measured. However, it is not possible to achieve an accurate measurement of the contact force for the duct surface and brush, which has a nonlinear deformation characteristic. Therefore, in this study, a simple and robust controller has been proposed. This controller integrates the backstepping method with an I-PD controller for the robust platform control against irregular external forces on the cleaning brush. In addition, various trajectory tracking simulations have been conducted and the results present stable trajectory tracking of the mobile platform in air duct cleaning.

AB Context: Demonstrating high reliability and safety for safety-critical systems (SCSs) remains a hard problem. Diverse evidence needs to be combined in a rigorous way: in particular, results of operational testing with other evidence from design and verification. Growing use of machine learning in SCSs, by precluding most established methods for gaining assurance, makes evidence from operational testing even more important for supporting safety and reliability claims.
   Objective: We revisit the problem of using operational testing to demonstrate high reliability. We use Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) as a current example. AVs are making their debut on public roads: methods for assessing whether an AV is safe enough are urgently needed. We demonstrate how to answer 5 questions that would arise in assessing an AV type, starting with those proposed by a highly-cited study.
   Method: We apply new theorems extending our Conservative Bayesian Inference (CBI) approach, which exploit the rigour of Bayesian methods while reducing the risk of involuntary misuse associated (we argue) with now-common applications of Bayesian inference; we define additional conditions needed for applying these methods to AVs.
   Results: Prior knowledge can bring substantial advantages if the AV design allows strong expectations of safety before road testing. We also show how naive attempts at conservative assessment may lead to over-optimism instead; why extrapolating the trend of disengagements (take-overs by human drivers) is not suitable for safety claims; use of knowledge that an AV has moved to a "less stressful" environment.
   Conclusion: While some reliability targets will remain too high to be practically verifiable, our CBI approach removes a major source of doubt: it allows use of prior knowledge without inducing dangerously optimistic biases. For certain ranges of required reliability and prior beliefs, CBI thus supports feasible, sound arguments. Useful conservative claims can be derived from limited prior knowledge.

AB This paper proposes a camera-based vehicular visible light communication system using modulated LED taillights for vehicle-to-vehicle communication. The taillights are modulated using on-off keying with a carrier frequency above the critical flicker frequency threshold to appear steady to the human eye and only a camera with a short exposure time can perceive the signal. For receiving the signal, a common camera with a recording frame rate of 30 frames per second was used for the experiments. This limits the throughput of the communication system as only one bit per frame and per individually modulated light source can be transmitted, thus the system is not suitable for transmitting time-critical data. However, the main advantage is that the transmitted data as well as the transmitting vehicle are visible in the camera image, hence we can associate the message and its origin.For the communication between two cooperative autonomous vehicles, e.g., members of a platoon, a secure wireless channel with low latency is needed. To establish an encrypted connection in this main channel our system can be used as an out-of-band channel to verify the identity of the vehicle in front by transmitting a verification code.In this paper we evaluate how the communication quality in terms of bit error rate of the raw data transmission without any error correction methods is influenced by various environmental factors, e.g., communication distance, traveling speed, weather, brightness, etc. This is done by testing our system in controlled scenarios as well as on public roads. The results show that our system is capable of transmitting data with a raw bit error rate of 1.59% on average in platooning relevant situations on the highway in dry conditions. Rain affects the system due to raindrops on the windshield, spray thrown up by vehicles in front, and the windshield wipers occluding the modulated taillights of the transmitting car. In light to medium rain conditions the mean bit error rate is between 2.7% and 6.2%, depending on the intensity.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB This research aims to assess the functionality of the VLP-32 LiDAR sensor, which serves as the principal sensor for object recognition in autonomous vehicles. The evaluation is conducted by simulating edge conditions the sensor might encounter in a controlled darkroom setting. Parameters for environmental conditions under examination encompass measurement distances ranging from 10 to 30 m, varying rainfall intensities (0, 20, 30, 40 mm/h), and different observation angles (0 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees). For the material aspects, the investigation incorporates reference materials, traffic signs, and road surfaces. Employing this diverse set of conditions, the study quantitatively assesses two critical performance metrics of LiDAR: intensity and NPC (number of point clouds). The results indicate a general decline in intensity as the measurement distance, rainfall intensity, and observation angles increase. Instances were identified where the sensor failed to record intensity for materials with low reflective properties. Concerning NPC, both the effective measurement area and recorded values demonstrated a decreasing trend with enlarging measurement distance and angles of observation. However, NPC metrics remained stable despite fluctuations in rainfall intensity.

ID IMAGE FUSION
AB Object detection is a fundamental computer vision task for many real-world applications. In the maritime environment, this task is challenging due to varying light, view distances, weather conditions, and sea waves. In addition, light reflection, camera motion and illumination changes may cause to false detections. To address this challenge, we present three fusion architectures to fuse two imaging modalities: visible and infrared. These architectures can provide complementary information from two modalities in different levels: pixel-level, feature-level, and decision-level. They employed deep learning for performing fusion and detection. We investigate the performance of the proposed architectures conducting a real marine image dataset, which is captured by color and infrared cameras on-board a vessel in the Finnish archipelago. The cameras are employed for developing autonomous ships, and collect data in a range of operation and climatic conditions. Experiments show that feature-level fusion architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art other fusion level architectures.

AB Bottom-resting capability will enable an autonomous underwater glider (AUG) to perform long-duration virtual mooring. However, the tracking control of AUG soft landing on the seabed faces a number of challenges. It is crucial that the controller is able to incorporate many important factors, e.g., model uncertainty, environmental disturbances and limited dynamic range of actuators. This study first formulates the soft landing tracking control problem of AUG for persistent virtual mooring. An adaptive robust control scheme based on sliding mode control with a nonlinear disturbance observer is proposed that can effectively solve the challenges aroused by parametric uncertainty and unknown time-varying external disturbances. Moreover, the effect of input constraints of the AUG system is analyzed for the first time and is damped through a dynamic auxiliary compensator. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superiority and inherent robustness of the proposed control scheme, in comparison with other techniques.

AB For autonomous driving, traversability analysis is one of the most basic and essential tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel LiDAR-based terrain modeling approach, which could output stable, complete, and accurate terrain models and traversability analysis results. As terrain is an inherent property of the environment that does not change with different view angles, our approach adopts a multiframe information fusion strategy for terrain modeling. Specifically, a normal distributions transform mapping approach is adopted to accurately model the terrain by fusing information from consecutive LiDAR frames. Then the spatial-temporal Bayesian generalized kernel inference and bilateral filtering are utilized to promote the stability and completeness of the results while simultaneously retaining the sharp terrain edges. Based on the terrain modeling results, the traversability of each region is obtained by performing geometric connectivity analysis between neighboring terrain regions. Experimental results show that the proposed method could run in real-time and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Depth estimation from a single RGB image has attracted great interest in autonomous driving and robotics. State-of-the-art methods are usually designed on top of complex and extremely deep network architectures, which require more computational resources. Moreover, the inherent characteristic of the backbone used by the existing approaches results in severe spatial information loss in the produced feature maps, which impairs the accuracy of depth estimation on small sized images. In this study, we aimed to design a novel and efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to address these problems. Specifically, we stacked two shallow encoder-decoder style subnetworks successively in a unified network. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the NYU depth v2, KITTI, Make3D and Unreal data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed network achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art methods that have extremely deep architectures but runs at a much faster speed on a single, less powerful GPU.

AB In this paper a novel integrated, single-chip solution for autonomous navigation inspired by the computations in the insect visuomotor system is proposed. A generalization of the theory of wide field integration (WFI) is presented which supports the use of sensors with a limited field of view, and the system concept is validated based on experiments using a prototype single-chip WFI sensor. The VLSI design implements (1) an array of Elementary Motion Detectors (EMDs) to derive local estimates of optic flow, (2) a novel mismatch compensation approach to handle dissimilarities in local motion detector units, and (3) on-chip programmable optic flow pattern weighting (Wide-Field Integration) to extract relative speed and proximity with respect to the surrounding environment. Computations are performed in the analog domain and in parallel, providing outputs at 1 kHz while consuming only 42.6 mu W of power. The resulting sensor is integrated with a ground vehicle and navigation of corridor-like environments is demonstrated.

AB As the demand for transportation through waterways continues to rise, the number of vessels plying the waters has correspondingly increased. This has resulted in a greater number of accidents and collisions between ships, some of which lead to significant loss of life and financial losses. Research has shown that human error is a major factor responsible for such incidents. The maritime industry is constantly exploring newer approaches to autonomy to mitigate this issue. This study presents the use of novel Artificial Potential Fields (APFs) to perform obstacle and collision avoidance in marine environments. This study highlights the advantage of harmonic functions over traditional functions in modeling potential fields. With a modification, the method is extended to effectively avoid dynamic obstacles while adhering to COLREGs. Improved performance is observed as compared to the traditional potential fields and also against the popular velocity obstacle approach. A comprehensive statistical analysis is also performed through Monte Carlo simulations in different congested environments that emulate real traffic conditions to demonstrate robustness of the approach.

AB Traditional concerns regarding spacecraft state estimation are exacerbated in cislunar space due to highly nonlinear dynamics, limited observational information, and increasingly overloaded Earth-based resources. These challenges motivate research into space-based navigation and observation capabilities that provide opportunities for autonomy. This paper demonstrates that relative optical measurements provide full inertial estimates of an agent and target spacecraft, while simultaneously enabling classification of unknown maneuvers in the cislunar environment. To achieve this objective two subtasks are demonstrated. First, the spacecraft-to-spacecraft absolute tracking method, which estimates the absolute state of two vehicles using relative measurements, is tested for observability and shown to produce consistent filter solutions given optical sensors. Second, maneuver classification is performed by labeling an estimated control profile generated from the optimal control based estimator. Collectively, this sequential methodology enables an agent craft to autonomously navigate itself while observing a target craft and classifying its maneuvers.

AB Computing Occupancy grids with LiDAR data, is a popular strategy for environment representation. In the last two decades, several authors have proposed different methods to render the sensed information into the grids, seeking to obtain computational efficiency or accurate environment modeling. However, no comparison regarding their performance under object detection in autonomous driving applications has been found in the literature. As a result, this work compares six representative LiDAR scan rendering strategies in a quantitative manner. To that end, a novel quantitative evaluation framework for occupancy grids is proposed. It addresses the two main steps of object detection: object segmentation and features estimation, proposing a meaningful procedure, repeatable with other OG approaches. The code of this evaluation framework is available in https://git-autopia.car.upm-csic.es/open_source/occupancy_grid_object_detection_evaluation.git.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB PaintCopter is an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) capable of spray painting on complex three-dimensional (3D) surfaces. This letter aims to make PaintCopter more user-friendly and to enable more intuitive human-robot interaction. We propose a virtual reality interface that allows the user to immerse in a virtual environment, navigate around the target surface, and paint at desired locations using a virtual spray gun. A realistic paint simulator provides a real-time previsualization of the painting activity that can either he processed right away or stored to a disk for later execution. An efficient optimization based planner uses this information to plan the painting task and execute it. The proposed planner maximizes the paint quality while respecting the spray nozzle constraints and platform dynamics. Our experiments show that the interface allows the user to make precise modifications to the target surface. Finally, we demonstrate the use of virtual reality interface to define a painting mission, and then the PaintCopter carrying out the mission to paint a desired multicolored pattern on a 3D surface.

AB The study and modeling of driver's gaze dynamics are important because, if and how the driver is monitoring the driving environment is vital for driver assistance in manual mode, for takeover requests in highly automated mode and for semantic perception of the surround in fully autonomous mode. We developed a machine vision-based framework to classify driver's gaze into context rich zones of interest andmodel driver's gaze behavior by representing gaze dynamics over a time period using gaze accumulation, glance duration, and glance frequencies. As a use case, we explore the driver's gaze dynamic patterns during maneuvers executed in freeway driving, namely, left lane change maneuver, right lane change maneuver, and lane keeping. It is shown that condensing gaze dynamics into durations and frequencies leads to recurring patterns based on driver activities. Furthermore, modeling these patterns show predictive powers in maneuver detection up to a few hundred milliseconds a priori.

AB Many classical visual odometry and simultaneous localization and mapping methods are able to achieve excellent performance, but mainly are restricted on the static scenes and suffer degeneration when there are many dynamic objects. In this paper, an efficient coarse-to-fine algorithm is proposed for moving object detection in dynamic scenes for autonomous driving. A motion-based conditional random field for this task is modeled. Particularly, for initial dynamic-static segmentation, a superpixel-based binary segmentation is processed, and further for refinement, a pixel-level object segmentation in local region is performed. Additionally, to reduce the projection noise caused by disparity estimation, an approximate Mahalanobis normalization is provided. Finally, in order to evaluate the proposed method, two relative methods are compared as baseline on the public KITTI data set for visual odometry and moving object detection separately. The experiments show the effectiveness and improvement on odometry when the dynamic region is removed and also on moving objects detection.

DE Extrinsic calibration; Point cloud; 3D data fitting
AB Autonomous navigation is an important field of research and, given the complexity of real world environments, most of the systems rely on a complex perception system combining multiple sensors on board, which reinforces the concern of sensor calibration. Most calibration methods rely on manual or semi-automatic interactive procedures, but reliable fully automatic methods are still missing. However, if some simple objects could be detected and identified automatically by all the sensors from several points of view, then automatic calibration would be possible on the fly. The idea proposed in this paper is to use a ball in motion in front of a set of uncalibrated sensors allowing them to detect its center along the successive positions. This set of centers generates a point cloud per sensor, which, by using segmentation and fitting techniques, allows the calculation of the rigid body transformation among all pairs of sensors. This paper proposes and describes such a method with results demonstrating its validity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a comparative study that explores the performance of various meta-heuristics employed for Optimal Signal Design, specifically focusing on estimating parameters in nonlinear systems. The study introduces the Robust Sub-Optimal Excitation Signal Generation and Optimal Parameter Estimation (rSOESGOPE) methodology, which is originally derived from the well-known Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Through a real-life case study involving an Autonomous Surface Vessel (ASV) equipped with three Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) and an aerial holonomic propulsion system, the effectiveness of different meta-heuristics is thoroughly evaluated. By conducting an in-depth analysis and comparison of the obtained results from the diverse meta-heuristics, this study offers valuable insights for selecting the most suitable optimization technique for parameter estimation in nonlinear systems. Researchers and experimental tests in the field can benefit from the comprehensive examination of these techniques, aiding them in making informed decisions about the optimal approach for optimizing parameter estimation in nonlinear systems.

SO IEEE ROBOTICS & AUTOMATION MAGAZINE

DE Decision making; Training; Road transportation; Reinforcement learning;
   Task analysis; Data models; Autonomous vehicles
AB Decision making is a fundamental component to ensure safe autonomous driving in highway scenarios. The mainstream architecture for this task is the classical deep Q learning network (DQN). However, there remain two major issues with the DQN: 1) because of its traditional experience replay mechanism, the model tends to learn bias from imbalanced data, and 2) for multiobjective tasks, the unitary reward function limits the model to learning representative domain knowledge. To address these problems, this article proposes a DQN model based on a prioritized experience replay (PER) mechanism with a multireward architecture (MRA) for highway driving decision making. For balanced training, the importance of memory samples is encoded with the error between the Q estimation and Q target. For more directional training, a single reward function is decomposed into three minor ones based on prior knowledge, emphasizing speed, overtaking, and lane changing. Experimental results indicate that the proposed prioritized MRA (PMRA) DQN is superior to the traditional DQN, with higher driving speeds, less lane changing, and safer overtaking.

AB Feeding the growing global population requires an annual increase in food production. This requirement suggests an increase in the use of pesticides, which represents an unsustainable chemical load for the environment. To reduce pesticide input and preserve the environment while maintaining the necessary level of food production, the efficiency of relevant processes must be drastically improved. Within this context, this research strived to design, develop, test and assess a new generation of automatic and robotic systems for effective weed and pest control aimed at diminishing the use of agricultural chemical inputs, increasing crop quality and improving the health and safety of production operators. To achieve this overall objective, a fleet of heterogeneous ground and aerial robots was developed and equipped with innovative sensors, enhanced end-effectors and improved decision control algorithms to cover a large variety of agricultural situations. This article describes the scientific and technical objectives, challenges and outcomes achieved in three common crops.

AB Autonomous landing is a fundamental aspect of drone operations which is being focused upon by the industry, with ever-increasing demands on safety. As the drones are likely to become indispensable vehicles in near future, they are expected to succeed in automatically recognizing a landing spot from the nearby points, maneuvering toward it, and ultimately, performing a safe landing. Accordingly, this paper investigates the idea of vision-based location detection on the ground for an automated emergency response system which can continuously monitor the environment and spot safe places when needed. A convolutional neural network which learns from image-based feature representation at multiple scales is introduced. The model takes the ground images, assign significance to various aspects in them and recognize the landing spots. The results provided support for the model, with accurate classification of ground image according to their visual content. They also demonstrate the feasibility of computationally inexpensive implementation of the model on a small computer that can be easily embedded on a drone.

ID SYSTEMS
AB The requirement of ideal rolling without sideways slipping for wheels imposes nonholonomic (non-integrable) constraints on the motion of the wheels and consequently on the motion of wheeled mobile robots. From the control point of view, the dynamics of nonholonomic systems can be divided in two parts: external and internal dynamics. The dimension of the external dynamics of nonholonomic systems depends on the number of inputs to the system and the dimension of the internal dynamics depends on the number of independent nonholonomic constraints. For different motion control problems of nonholonomic systems, a smooth (model based) state feedback control law only deals with the system external dynamics; therefore, the system internal dynamics must be examined separately and its stability has to be analyzed and proved.
   In this paper, the internal dynamics of a three-wheel mobile robot with front wheel steering and driving is investigated. In particular, its internal dynamics stability is analyzed for two different situations, when the mobile robot is moving and when it is stationary. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Microrover Flight Experiment (MFEX) is a NASA OACT (Office of Advanced Concepts and Technology) flight experiment which is planned to be delivered and integrated with the Mars Pathfinder (MPF) lander and spacecraft system for landing on Mars on July 4, 1997. After landing, the MFEX rover will be deployed from the lander and begin a nominal 7 sol (1 sol = 1 Martian day approximate to 24 hours, 40 min.) mission to conduct a series of technology experiments, deploy an alpha proton x-ray spectrometer (APXS) on rocks and soil, and image the lander. This mission will be conducted under the constraints of a once-per-sol opportunity for command and telemetry transmissions between the lander and earth operators. As such, the MFEX rover must be capable of carrying out its mission under supervised autonomous control, in which, for example, goal locations are commanded and the rover navigates and safely traverses to these locations. In this paper, the mission of the MFEX is described, along with the on-board and ground-based systems which provide the capability for operating the vehicle.

AB Parafoil airdrop is an important way to deliver goods and materials to area where road vehicles are not easy to reach. However, it is difficult to deliver large quantities of goods and materials to a given location with only one parafoil. Airdropping multiple parafoils is an effective choice for transporting large quantities of goods and materials. To realize the cooperative airdrop of multiple parafoils, a cooperative guidance framework is proposed. First, a trajectory planning algorithm is designed to plan the multiphase trajectory for the parafoil group. Then, a trajectory tracking algorithm is developed for the pilot parafoil in the parafoil group to reliably follow the planned trajectory. Finally, a cooperative formation guidance strategy is designed based on the leader-follower consensus theory. Under this strategy, the position and speed of the follower parafoil can be consensus with those of the leader parafoil. Lyapunov's theorem proves the stability of this strategy. We evaluate the effectiveness of this framework through simulations. The results demonstrate that our algorithms can realize the precise airdrop of massive goods and materials with upwind landing using multiple parafoils. In addition, the parafoils could be gradually gathered to a desired formation, and safe distances could be maintained between parafoils during the airdrop process. Note to Practitioners-This article was motivated by the problem of airdropping massive goods and materials. Existing methods usually adopt a single heavy parafoil, or use centralized multiparafoil systems. Both these methods have their limitations. For the former, there is an upper limit of the load capacity for a single parafoil. For the latter, the parafoils in the centralized system lack fully autonomous ability. Distributed multiparafoil systems could solve the problem effectively. However, compared to single-parafoil systems, there are still some challenges, for example, the multiparafoil gathering, collision avoidance and cooperative formation, as well as the upwind landing. Fortunately, existing parafoils are equipped with sensors, communication, and control devices, so they could be viewed as agents with autonomous capabilities. In this article, a formation guidance framework for multiple autonomous parafoils is proposed. First, we plan a trajectory for the pilot parafoil. Then, we show how to effectively track the planned trajectory. Finally, we demonstrate how multiple parafoils could coordinate with each other to accomplish airdrop tasks. The simulation results confirm the feasibility of this strategy.

AB Surround-view fisheye perception under valet parking scenes is fundamental and crucial in autonomous driving. Environmental conditions in parking lots perform differently from the common public datasets, such as the imperfect light and opacity, which substantially impacts on perception performance. Most existing networks based on public datasets may generalize suboptimal results on these valet parking scenes, also affected by the fisheye distortion. In this article, we introduce a new large-scale fisheye dataset called Fisheye Parking Dataset (FPD) to promote the research in dealing with diverse real-world surround-view parking cases. Notably, our compiled FPD exhibits excellent characteristics for different surround-view perception tasks. In addition, we also propose our real-time distortion-insensitive multi-task framework Fisheye Perception Network (FPNet), which improves the surround-view fisheye BEV perception by enhancing the fisheye distortion operation and multi-task lightweight designs. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach and the dataset's exceptional generalizability.

AB Robot navigation with noisy perception is a fundamental but challenging task. We present a framework for creating navigable space from cluttered point clouds generated by low-end sensors with high sparsity and noise. Our method incrementally seeds and creates local convex regions free of obstacle points along robot's trajectory. Then a dense version of the point cloud is reconstructed through a map point regulation process where the original noisy map points are first projected onto a series of local convex hull surfaces, after which those points falling inside the convex hulls are culled. We have tested our proposed framework using a public autonomous driving dataset and a manually built structured environment for various performance evaluation, as well as inside our research building for ground robot navigation tasks. Our results reveal that the reconstructed navigable space has small volume loss (error) comparing with the ground truth, and the method is highly efficient, allowing real-time navigation computation.

AB In this paper, we address the problem of long-term visual object tracking and we present an efficient real-time single object tracking system suitable for integration in autonomous platforms that need to encompass intelligent capabilities. We propose a novel long-term tracking framework for classification based re-detection and tracking, that incorporates state estimation, object re-identification and automated management of tracking and detection results. Our method integrates a novel object re-identification technique which efficiently filters a number of detection candidates and systematically corrects the tracking results. Through extensive experimental validation on the UAV123, UAV20L and TLP datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system and its advantage over several state-of-the art trackers. The results furthermore highlight the proposed tracker's ability to handle challenges arising from real-world and long-term scenarios, such as variations in pose, scale, occlusions and out-of-view situations. Furthermore, we propose a variant that is suitable for deployment on autonomous robots, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.

ID COMMUNICATION
AB In networks of mobile autonomous agents, e.g. for data acquisition, we may wish to maximize data transfer or to reliably transfer a minimum amount of data, subject to quality of service or energy constraints. These requirements can be guaranteed through both offline node design/specifications and online trajectory/communications design. Regardless of the distance between them, for a stationary point-to-point transmitter-receiver pair communicating across a single link under average power constraints, the total data transfer is unbounded as time tends to infinity. In contrast, we show that if the transmitter/receiver is moving at any constant speed away from each other, then the maximum transmittable data is bounded. Although general closed-form expressions as a function of communication and mobility profile parameters do not yet exist, we provide closed-form expressions for particular cases, such as ideal free space path loss. Under more general scenarios we instead give lower bounds on the total transmittable information across a single link between mobile nodes.

DT Article
DE Anomaly detection; autonomous surveillance; deep learning in robotics;
   unmanned autonomous vehicles; robot learning
AB We present a deep autoencoder-based anomaly detection method (GridNet) for indoor surveillance. Unlike similar studies, GridNet is image-agnostic by taking a specific representation of a scene as inputs instead of the raw image itself. Its input is grid representations of scene images, which indicate spatial layouts of objects in a scene. This approach allows us to isolate the anomaly detection problem from any vision-related issues, such as illumination variations. In addition to grid representations, GridNet takes a location vector of a scene as input to learn the normalities of each scene conditioned on its location. We also propose a novel loss function that increases the model's reconstruction capability for grid representations. It enables the network to increase its precision and recall throughout the reconstruction. In our experiments, we compare our method with the existing studies on simulated and real-world data. The experimental results show the superiority of our method compared to the baseline methods. The code, data, and simulation environments will be available at https://bozcani.github.io/gridnet.

AB This paper presents a novel challenging dataset that offers a new landscape of testing material for mobile robotics, autonomous driving research, and forestry operation. In contrast to common urban structures, we explore an unregulated natural environment to exemplify sub-urban and forest environment. The sequences provide two-natured data where each place is visited in summer and winter conditions. The vehicle used for recording is equipped with a sensor rig that constitutes four RGB cameras, an Inertial Measurement Unit, and a Global Navigation Satellite System receiver. The sensors are synchronized based on non-drifting timestamps. The dataset provides trajectories of varying complexity both for the state of the art visual odometry approaches and visual simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms.

AB Autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) have the potential to assist in real-life tasks involving grasping and transportation, but not before solving several difficult research challenges. In this work, we address the design, control, estimation, and planning problems for cooperative localization, grasping, and transportation of objects in challenging outdoor scenarios. We demonstrate an autonomous team of MAVs able to plan safe trajectories for manipulation of ferrous objects, while guaranteeing interrobot collision avoidance and automatically creating a map of the objects in the environment. Our solution is predominantly distributed, allowing the team to pick and transport ferrous disks to a final destination without collisions. This result is achieved using a new magnetic gripper with a novel feedback approach, enabling the detection of successful grasping. The gripper design and all the components to build a platform are clearly provided as open-source hardware for reuse by the community. Finally, the proposed solution is validated through experimental results, where difficulties include inconsistent wind, uneven terrain, and sandy conditions.

AB Self-driving cars, a quintessentially smart' technology, are not born smart. The algorithms that control their movements are learning as the technology emerges. Self-driving cars represent a high-stakes test of the powers of machine learning, as well as a test case for social learning in technology governance. Society is learning about the technology while the technology learns about society. Understanding and governing the politics of this technology means asking Who is learning, what are they learning and how are they learning?' Focusing on the successes and failures of social learning around the much-publicized crash of a Tesla Model S in 2016, I argue that trajectories and rhetorics of machine learning in transport pose a substantial governance challenge. Self-driving' or autonomous' cars are misnamed. As with other technologies, they are shaped by assumptions about social needs, solvable problems, and economic opportunities. Governing these technologies in the public interest means improving social learning by constructively engaging with the contingencies of machine learning.

   carrier phase-based receiver autonomous integrity monitoring
AB Intelligent Transport System applications require accurate and reliable positioning. When stand-alone global positioning system (GPS) is used in urban areas, the results dramatically degrade, because of signal outages and multipath. This paper unveils new signal processing techniques for carrier phase-based navigation in urban environments. The techniques identify multipath or weak signals using carrier phase based receiver autonomous integrity monitoring, and abnormal signals and situational measurements are eliminated or estimated. To estimate the carrier phase during a short time period when GPS signals is blocked, this paper uses carrier phase statistics. The performance of the proposed method is verified, through a car test. The test environment has many signal outages and multipath because of high buildings. Many abnormal signal conditions occurred during the test, and the results confirmed that the proposed method performed better than the basic stand-alone GPS approach when compared with GPS/inertial navigation system (INS) integrated navigation results.

DE Deep learning; Sensor fusion; Computer vision; Autonomous driving
AB Drivable road detection is a fundamental problem for autonomous vehicles. RGB cameras and LiDAR are the mostly used data sources in road detection. While cameras provide lots of useful visual information, LiDARs can provide precise altitude information without being affected by the ambient light. However, these sensors create images at different space and this causes a challenging fusion task when they are intended to be used together. In this study, a U-Net-based novel fusion set is developed to fuse the RGB and LiDAR images for road detection. The LiDAR images are pre-processed and transferred to the 2D image space before fusion. Then, U-NET model, which is effectively used in image segmentation applications, is adapted for three different fusion techniques: early fusion, late fusion and cross-fusion. Models are evaluated on the KITTI road detection dataset, and the developed early fusion model which fuses the RGB and altitude difference image achieved the highest MaxF score on road detection. The obtained results are also at a competitive level with state-of-the-art models.

AB Anomaly detection constitutes a fundamental step in developing self-aware autonomous agents capable of continuously learning from new situations, as it enables to distinguish novel experiences from already encountered ones. This paper combines Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) and Neural Networks (NNs) and proposes a method for detecting anomalies in video data at different abstraction levels. We use a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of video frames, and Optical Flows between subsequent images, generating a latent space that captures both visual and dynamical information and that is comparable to low-dimensional sensory data (e.g., positioning, steering angle). An Adapted Markov Jump Particle Filter is employed to predict the following frames and detect anomalies in video data. Our method's evaluation is executed using different video data from a semi-autonomous vehicle performing different tasks in a closed environment. Tests on benchmark anomaly detection datasets have additionally been conducted.

AB Public datasets are valuable for the development of the learning-based algorithms. In the field of autonomous driving, almost all the existing public datasets are collected by manually driving cars, and most of them are contributed by American and European researchers and represent the traffic scenarios typical for these countries. To diversify the public driving datasets and to provide data support for researches on the self-driving vehicles moving on bike lanes, such as wheelchairs, bikes, and some robots, we present the Chinese Driving from a Bike View (CDBV), which is a driving dataset collected by a bike in Beijing, China. The CDBV dataset contains annotated images, raw videos, and code tools. The annotations are for the object detection tasks and especially focus on the categories with Chinese characteristics, including the express tricycles, the motorbikes specializing in takeouts, the bicycle landmarks, the zebra crossings, and the traffic lights. We totally annotated 40 064 traffic elements in 13 427 images. The CDBV dataset is publicly available at http://sujingwang.name/CDBV.html.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB The localization of a radio-frequency transmitter with intermittent transmissions is considered via a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with omnidirectional received signal strength sensors. This group embarks on an autonomous patrol to localize and track the target with a specified accuracy, as quickly as possible. The challenge can be decomposed into two stages: 1) estimation of the target position given previous measurements (localization) and 2) planning the future trajectory of the tracking UAVs to get lower expected localization error given current estimation (path planning). For each stage, we compare two algorithms in terms of performance and computational load. For the localization stage, we compare a detection-based extended Kalman filter (EKF) and a recursive Bayesian estimator. For the path planning stage, we compare a steepest descent posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound path planning and a bioinspired heuristic path planning. Our results show that the steepest descent path planning outperforms the bioinspired path planning by an order of magnitude, and recursive Bayesian estimator narrowly outperforms detection-based EKF.

AB Intelligent wheelchairs (IWs) can become an important solution to the challenge of assisting individuals who have disabilities and are thus unable to perform their daily activities using classic powered wheelchairs. This article describes the concept and design of IntellWheels, a modular platform to facilitate the development of IWs through a multiagent system paradigm. In fact, modularity is achieved not only in the software perspective, but also through a generic hardware framework that was designed to fit, in a straightforward manner, almost any commercial powered wheelchair. Experimental results demonstrate the successful integration of all modules in the platform, providing safe motion to the IW. Furthermore, the results achieved with a prototype running in autonomous mode in simulated and mixed-reality environments also demonstrate the potential of our approach. Although some future research is still necessary to fully accomplish our objectives, preliminary tests have shown that IntellWheels will effectively reduce users' limitations, offering them a much more independent life.

AB Vanishing point detection is an essential component of vision-based autonomous navigation for unmanned ground vehicles and mobile robots. In this paper, we propose an accurate and robust vanishing point detection method for unstructured road scenes, where the road scenes lack clear road markings and include complex background interference. Since only the road region provides informative clues for vanishing point detection, we first introduce the manifold ranking method to estimate the road region based on background suppression. Then, we develop a series of principles for voter selection, and propose a dynamic adjustment strategy for the candidate selection that reduces the search scope of the vanishing point to perform candidate selection. Finally, we propose an effective voting strategy, in which the candidate that achieves the greatest number of votes in the voting space is considered to be the vanishing point. The experimental results on a large number of unstructured road images show that our proposed method is more accurate and robust than five existing methods.

AB Protection of wild animals relies on understanding the interaction between the animals and their environment. With the ability to rapidly access rugged areas, aerial monitoring by drones is fast becoming a viable tool for ecologists to monitor wild animals. Unfortunately, this approach results in significant disturbance to different species of wild animals. Inspired by motion camouflage, this article explores a navigation method for a drone to covertly observe a group of animals and their habitat. Unlike existing motion-camouflage navigation approaches that deceive a single target, we introduce a sliding-mode-based method that reactively navigates the drone to induce less optical flow on multiple targets' visual system. The proposed method is computationally simple and suitable for a drone to closely observe a group of moving animals with reduced visual disturbance. Computer simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.

TI A Two-Stage Data Association Approach for 3D Multi-Object Tracking
SO SENSORS
LA English
DT Article
DE multi-object tracking; data association; autonomous vehicles
AB Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is an integral part of any autonomous driving pipelines because it produces trajectories of other moving objects in the scene and predicts their future motion. Thanks to the recent advances in 3D object detection enabled by deep learning, track-by-detection has become the dominant paradigm in 3D MOT. In this paradigm, a MOT system is essentially made of an object detector and a data association algorithm which establishes track-to-detection correspondence. While 3D object detection has been actively researched, association algorithms for 3D MOT has settled at bipartite matching formulated as a Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) and solved by the Hungarian algorithm. In this paper, we adapt a two-stage data association method which was successfully applied to image-based tracking to the 3D setting, thus providing an alternative for data association for 3D MOT. Our method outperforms the baseline using one-stage bipartite matching for data association by achieving 0.587 Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (AMOTA) in NuScenes validation set and 0.365 AMOTA (at level 2) in Waymo test set.

AB In recent years, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) has been drawing extensive attention both in academia and industry because of the increasing demand for autonomous vehicles. LiDAR is believed to be the crucial sensor for autonomous driving and flying, as it can provide high-density point clouds with accurate three-dimensional information. This review presents an extensive overview of Microelectronechanical Systems (MEMS) scanning mirrors specifically for applications in LiDAR systems. MEMS mirror-based laser scanners have unrivalled advantages in terms of size, speed and cost over other types of laser scanners, making them ideal for LiDAR in a wide range of applications. A figure of merit (FoM) is defined for MEMS mirrors in LiDAR scanners in terms of aperture size, field of view (FoV) and resonant frequency. Various MEMS mirrors based on different actuation mechanisms are compared using the FoM. Finally, a preliminary assessment of off-the-shelf MEMS scanned LiDAR systems is given.

AB Precision-guided airdrop systems have shown considerable accuracy improvements over more widely used unguided systems through high-quality position, velocity, and time feedback provided by global positioning system (GPS). These systems, like many autonomous vehicles, have become solely dependent on GPS to conduct mission operations. This necessity makes airdrop systems susceptible to GPS blackout in mountainous or urban terrain due to multipathing issues or from signal jamming in active military zones. This work overcomes loss of GPS through an analysis of guidance, navigation and control (GNC) capabilities using a single radio frequency (RF) beacon located at the target. Such a device can be deployed at the target by ground crew on site to retrieve package delivery. Two novel GNC algorithms are presented, which use either range from or direction to a RF beacon. Simulation and experimental flight testing results indicated that beacon-based methods can achieve similar results as GPS-based methods. This technology provides a simple and elegant solution to GPS blackout with best method studied showing only a 21% decrease in landing accuracy in comparison to GPS-based methods.

AB Increasingly, safety-critical systems include artificial intelligence and machine learning components (i.e., learning-enabled components (LECs)). However, when behavior is learned in a training environment that fails to fully capture real-world phenomena, the response of an LEC to untrained phenomena is uncertain and therefore cannot be assured as safe. Automated methods are needed for self-assessment and adaptation to decide when learned behavior can be trusted. This work introduces a model-driven approach to manage self-adaptation of a learning-enabled system (LES) to account for run-time contexts for which the learned behavior of LECs cannot be trusted. The resulting framework enables an LES to monitor and evaluate goal models at run time to determine whether or not LECs can be expected to meet functional objectives and enables system adaptation accordingly. Using this framework enables stakeholders to have more confidence that LECs are used only in contexts comparable to those validated at design time.

TI Autonomous Trajectory Planning for Rendezvous and Proximity Operations
   by Conic Optimization
SO JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID POWERED-DESCENT GUIDANCE; POINT
AB Autonomous rendezvous and proximity operations of spacecraft require the capability of onboard planning and executing highly constrained trajectories without ground support. This paper presents a general and rigorous methodology and algorithmic procedure toward this goal with a target vehicle that can be in an arbitrary orbit. The rendezvous and proximity operations problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimal control problem, subject to various state and control inequality constraints and equality constraints on interior points and terminal conditions. By a lossless relaxation technique, a relaxed problem is formed, the solution of which is proven to be equivalent to that of the original rendezvous and proximity operations problem. The relaxed problem is then solved by a novel successive solution process, in which the solutions of a sequence of constrained subproblems with linear, time-varying dynamics are sought. After discretization, each of these problems becomes a second-order cone programming problem. Their solutions, if they exist, are guaranteed to be found by a primal-dual interior-point algorithm. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is strongly supported by numerical experiments.

AB The visualization of riverbeds and surface facilities on the banks is crucial for systems that analyze conditions, safety, and changes in this environment. Hence, in this paper, we propose collecting, and processing data from a variety of sensors-sonar, LiDAR, multibeam echosounder (MBES), and camera-to create a visualization for further analysis. For this purpose, we took measurements from sensors installed on an autonomous, unmanned hydrographic vessel, and then proposed a data fusion mechanism, to create a visualization using modules under and above the water. A fusion contains key-point analysis on classic images and sonars, augmentation/reduction of point clouds, fitting data and mesh creation. Then, we also propose an analysis module that can be used to compare and extract information from created visualizations. The analysis module is based on artificial intelligence tools for the classification tasks, which helps in further comparison to archival data. Such a model was tested using various techniques to achieve the fastest and most accurate visualizations possible in simulation and real case studies.

AB Path planning is one of the key technologies in the research of autonomous surface vessels (ASVs). In this paper, an improved artificial fish swarm algorithm (IAFSA) is proposed. The algorithm is modified from four perspectives: (1) A directional operator is introduced to improve the efficiency. (2) To avoid local optimum, a probability weight factor is proposed to adjust the frequency of executing random behaviour. (3) An adaptive operator has been applied aims at better convergence performance. (4) The waypoint modifying path smoother is used to improve the path quality. A comparative study has been carried out between IAFSA and the other state-of-the-art algorithms, and the results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the others in both efficiency and path quality. Finally, IAFSA is integrated into the GNC system in a model ship. A computer-based sea trial around the Nan Hai area has been conducted, and environmental disturbances including wind, waves, and currents are considered. The results have shown that IAFSA is suitable for practical application.

DT Article
ID DYNAMICS; FLIGHT
AB This paper discusses the development of a single-lift and dual-lift helicopter underslung load transportation system for practical applications. A control law is developed to damp the load swing and stabilize the oscillation while performing the transportation task. For the dual-lift system, the load transportation is achieved by using a load distribution controller, developed for this purpose, to maintain equal load distribution among the vehicles. The load damping and load distribution controllers require accurate measurement of load states, which is achieved through the design and development of innovative, simple, and lightweight sensors units, namely, load tension measurement unit (LTMU) and load swing measurement unit (LSMU). LTMU sensor consists of a unique design that utilizes a flexi-force sensor, capable of measuring compressive load, for measurement of cable tension. The cable inclination in the longitudinal and lateral directions is measured by the LSMU sensor. These units are integrated with the helicopter autopilot for autonomous flight. The performance of the developed system is experimentally validated in the outdoor environment with single and dual-lift systems.

AB The problem of vision-guided control of miniature mobile robots is investigated. Untethered mobile robots with small physical dimensions of around 10 cm or less do not permit powerful onboard computers because of size and power constraints. These challenges have, in the past, reduced the functionality of such devices to that of a complex remote control vehicle with fancy sensors. With the help of a computationally more powerful entity such as a larger companion robot, the control loop can be closed. Using the miniature robot's video transmission or that of an observer to localize it in the world, control commands can be computed and relayed to the inept robot. The result is a system that exhibits autonomous capabilities. The framework presented here solves the problem of climbing stairs with the miniature Scout robot. The robot's unique locomotion mode, the jump, is employed to hop one step at a time. Methods for externally tracking the Scout are developed. A large number of real-world experiments are conducted and the results discussed.

AB Unmanned tractors are widely adopted in agricultural operations as autonomous driving technol-ogy progresses. The current path tracking control methods are limited by the unstructured farmland, the accuracy and anti-interference ability needed to be improved. This paper presents a novel adaptive second-order sliding mode (ASOSM) control method to tackle the aforementioned problems in practi-cal implementation. First, we introduce a preview lateral offset model based on the preview kinematic and tractor dynamic model, which helps solve the under-actuated problem in path tracking. Then, the ASOSM controller is designed using the revamped adding a power integrator (API) and adaptive mech-anism, which ensures that the sliding variable is converged to zero within the finite time. Meanwhile, the chattering problem in traditional sliding mode control is relieved. Finally, a high-fidelity and full -car model is established under Simulink/Carsim environment, and comparative simulations conrm the superiority of the designed control method.(c) 2023 The Franklin Institute.

AB This review aims to present recent developments in modeling and control of multiagent systems. A particular focus is set on crowd dynamics characterized by complex interactions among agents, also called social interactions, and large-scale systems. Specifically, in a crowd each individual agent interacts with a field generated by the other agents and the environment. These systems can be modeled at the microscopic scale by ordinary differential equations, while an alternative description at the mesoscopic scale is given by a partial differential equation for the propagation of the probability density of the agents. Control actions can be applied at the individual level as well as at the level of the corresponding fields. This article presents and compares different control types, and the specific application to multilane, multiclass traffic is developed in some detail, showing the main tools at work in a hybrid setting with relevant impacts on autonomous driving.

AB This paper proposes a novel method for an AI powered improvement of the estimation of a distance between the camera and an imaged object using image-plane homography. The method exploits the homography between two planes, the image plane and the rail tracks plane, and an artificial neural network that reduces the estimation error based on collected experimental data. The SMART multi-sensory onboard obstacle detection system has 3 vision sensors - an RGB camera, a thermal vision camera and a night vision camera, in order to achieve greater reliability and robustness. Although the methodology presented in this paper is applicable for each vision sensor, the proposed method was tested with the thermal camera and in impaired visibility scenarios. The validation of estimated distances is done with respect to real measured distances from the camera stand to the objects (humans) involved in the experiments. Distances are estimated with a maximum error of 2% and the proposed AI powered system can provide a reliable distance estimation in impaired visibility conditions.

AB Curb detection and tracking is an essential component of autonomous vehicle operation in urban environments. Detecting curbs is a particularly challenging task in urban environments that contain countless dynamic objects. Previous studies have approached curb detection using different types of sensor such as cameras, radar, and LIDAR. Among these, LIDAR sensors have superior advantages in regard to detecting curbs because of their robustness in different weather conditions and they can provide accurate distance measurements. Previous methods based on LIDAR have exploited high-resolution 3D point clouds using high- cost LIDARs. However, the processing of large volumes of information is inefficient for autonomous driving technologies because of real time constraints. This paper presents a novel real-time curb detection and tracking algorithm that makes use of a low-resolution LIDAR. The proposed method consists of three steps. First is the extraction of curb candidates based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). Second is the selection of the optimal candidate using an optimization framework. Lastly is the tracking of the detected curbs. In the tracking module, we use a combination of spatial consistency and validation gate to track the curb in the occlusion region with dynamic objects. Experiments on a public dataset show that the proposed method achieved 91.54% and 89.76% F1 score on the straight and curved road while running at about 18 ms per frame, thereby outperforming the state-of-the-art by a large margin. In addition, we integrated the proposed method with the localization module of our autonomous driving platform. The localization module integrated with the proposed method reduces the positional and lateral root mean square (RMS) error of the vehicle localization by 3.58% and 6.68% respectively. In addition, we compare this method with a deep neural network based method from the perspective of a safety-critical system such as self-driving cars.

TI Real-Time LiDAR Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving

DT Article

ID NETWORKS
AB LiDAR has been widely used in autonomous driving systems to provide high-precision 3D geometric information about the vehicle's surroundings for perception, localization, and path planning. LiDAR-based point cloud semantic segmentation is an important task with a critical real-time requirement. However, most of the existing convolutional neural network (CNN) models for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation are very complex and can hardly be processed at real-time on an embedded platform. In this study, a lightweight CNN structure was proposed for projection-based LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation with only 1.9 M parameters that gave an 87% reduction comparing to the state-of-the-art networks. When evaluated on a GPU, the processing time was 38.5 ms per frame, and it achieved a 47.9% mIoU score on Semantic-KITTI dataset. In addition, the proposed CNN is targeted on an FPGA using an NVDLA architecture, which results in a 2.74x speedup over the GPU implementation with a 46 times improvement in terms of power efficiency.

ID IMPLEMENTATION; DESIGN
AB We present in this work the development of a novel hybrid unmanned aircraft platform, U-Lion, which has both vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) and cruising flight capabilities. Our design is in tail-sitter structure with reconfigurable wings, which combines the advantages of a fixed-wing plane and a rotor helicopter effectively. This allows it to transit from vertical take-off to hovering, before flying in cruise mode for efficient long duration flight. The propulsion comes from two coaxial contra-rotating motors fixed on a gimbal mechanism, which can change the direction of the motors for the required thrust. This thrust-vectored propulsion system primarily provides control in the VTOL mode but also enhances flight capabilities in the cruise mode. The hybrid aircraft is equipped with GPS and airspeed sensors, and has an onboard avionic system with advanced flight control algorithms to perform fully autonomous VTOL and cruising flights, in addition to transiting effectively between VTOL and cruising flight modes. The overall design has been successfully verified by actual flight experiments.

TI Design of a UAV for Autonomous RFID-Based Dynamic Inventories Using

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and radio frequency identification (RFID) technology are becoming very popular in the era of Industry 4.0, especially for retail, logistics, and warehouse management. However, the autonomous navigation for UAVs in indoor map-less environments while performing an inventory mission is, to this day, an open issue for researchers. This article examines the method of leveraging RFID technology with UAVs for the problem of the design of a fully autonomous UAV used for inventory in indoor spaces. This work also proposes a solution for increasing the performance of the autonomous exploration of inventory zones using a UAV in unexplored warehouse spaces. The main idea is to design an indoor UAV equipped with an onboard autonomous navigation system called RFID-based stigmergic and obstacle avoidance navigation system (RFID-SOAN). RFID-SOAN is composed of a computationally low cost obstacle avoidance (OA) algorithm and a stigmergy-based path planning and navigation algorithm. It uses the same RFID tags that retailers add to their products in a warehouse for navigation purposes by using them as digital pheromones or environmental clues. Using RFID-SOAN, the UAV computes its new path and direction of movement based on an RFID density-oriented attraction function, which estimates the optimal path through sensing the density of previously unread RFID tags in various directions relative to the pose of the UAV. We present the results of the tests of the proposed RFID-SOAN system in various scenarios. In these scenarios, we replicate different typical warehouse layouts with different tag densities, and we illustrate the performance of the RFID-SOAN by comparing it with a dead reckoning navigation technique while taking inventory. We prove by the experiments results that the proposed UAV manages to adequately estimate the amount of time it needs to read up-to 99.33% of the RFID tags on its path while exploring and navigating toward new zones of high populations of tags. We also illustrate how the UAV manages to cover only the areas where RFID tags exist, not the whole map, making it very efficient, compared to the traditional map/way-points-based navigation.

AB An Intelligent IoT Environment (iIoTe) is comprised of heterogeneous devices that can collaboratively execute semi-autonomous IoT applications, examples of which include highly automated manufacturing cells or autonomously interacting harvesting machines. Energy efficiency is key in such edge environments, since they are often based on an infrastructure that consists of wireless and battery-run devices, e.g., e-tractors, drones, Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV)s and robots. The total energy consumption draws contributions from multiple iIoTe technologies that enable edge computing and communication, distributed learning, as well as distributed ledgers and smart contracts. This paper provides a state-of-the-art overview of these technologies and illustrates their functionality and performance, with special attention to the tradeoff among resources, latency, privacy and energy consumption. Finally, the paper provides a vision for integrating these enabling technologies in energy-efficient iIoTe and a roadmap to address the open research challenges.

AB In this article, we present a path planning approach that is capable of generating a feasible trajectory for stable robotic wheelchair navigation in the environment with slope way. Firstly, the environment is modeled by a lightweight navigation map, with which the proposed sampling-based path planning scheme with a modified extension function can generate a feasible path. Then, the path is further optimized by the proposed utility function involving the human comfort and the path cost. To improve the searching efficiency of an optimal trajectory, we present an adaptive weighting Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based sampling strategy. Particularly, the weights of the components in GMM are adjusted adaptively in the planning process. It is also worth noting that the proposed sampling-based planning paradigm can indicate the unsafe regions in the navigation map, which forms a traversable map and further guarantees the safety of the wheelchair robot navigation. Furthermore, the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed path planning method are verified in both simulation and real-world experiments.

AB This paper discusses the design and software-in-the-loop implementation of adaptive formation controllers for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with parametric uncertainty in their structure, namely uncertain mass and inertia. In fact, when aiming at autonomous flight, such parameters cannot assumed to be known as they might vary during the mission (e.g. depending on the payload). Modeling and autopilot design for such autonomous fixed-wing UAVs are presented. The modeling is implemented in Matlab, while the autopilot is based on Ardu-Pilot, a popular open-source autopilot suite. Specifically, the ArduPilot functionalities are emulated in Matlab according to the Ardupilot documentation and code, which allows us to perform software-in-the-loop simulations of teams of UAVs embedded with actual autopilot protocols. An overview of realtime path planning, trajectory tracking and formation control resulting from the proposed platform is given. The software-inthe-loop simulations show the capability of achieving different UAV formations while handling uncertain mass and inertia.

DE Underwater glider; Dynamic model; Spiral motion; Dynamic stability
AB An autonomous underwater glider (AUG) is a self-propelled vehicle whose motion is controlled by shifting its centre of buoyancy and gravity with wings to convert vertical motion into horizontal motion. In this paper, the dynamic motion of a newly developed AUG, including a spiral motion, with rectangular and tapered wing is analysed. The dynamics of the glider, including its hydrodynamic derivatives, is modelled based on the Newton-Euler approach. This model is subsequently used, with a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control technique, to analyse the glider motion along the sagittal plane, its steady state spiral gliding motion in the vertical plane, and its stability. Results show that the glider has a stable dynamic response and a satisfactory glide performance. Specifically, the external control surface i.e. wings, influence the linear velocity and steady turning radius of glider. Furthermore, it was found that the rectangular winged glider has more dynamic stability because of a higher pitch moment. Additionally, a rectangular winged glider has a smaller spiral turning radius i.e. better manoeuvrability.

AB The science and technologies of emulsion droplets have been a long-term focus of extensive research endeavors for their practical utility across a breadth of industries, including pharmaceutical products, oil recovery processes, and the food sciences. However, with advances in materials chemistry and characterization tools, new emerging areas are arising with a focus on "smart droplets". The versatility of emulsion droplets across is based on their ability to partition and create isolated systems with properties defined by the liquid-liquid interface, while preparative routes allow manipulation of droplet size, stability, and encapsulated contents. As described in this article, significant efforts are being devoted to creating new types of droplets by "activating" this interface through the incorporation of reactive structures that trigger droplet response to applied or environmental stimuli (e.g., pH, temperature, salt, or external fields). Moreover, parallels between droplets and live cells inspire efforts to conceive systems that resemble biological motifs or that can produce cellular behaviors that imitate biology (e.g., swarming, communication, or motion). The authors highlight recent advances in smart droplets, with emphasis on organic, polymer, and/or particle surfactants that give rise to inter-droplet communication (via aggregation, fusion, division, or mass transfer), droplet vehicles for controlled delivery, autonomous droplet motion, and tunable emulsion inversion. Especially emphasized is the macromolecular design to produce reactive and functional surfactants, which are crucial to responsive droplet behavior and their underlying mechanisms. More generally, the exquisite interplay between materials science and biology inspires the review of this research area that provides unique opportunities for insight and inspiration into the capabilities of new droplet designs.
   The ability to stabilize droplets with reactive, functional surfactants opens a wealth of opportunities to create "smart" fluidic structures that exhibit autonomous or responsive properties. This review highlights the impact of advances at the interface of surfactant design and droplet science, including inter-droplet communication (i.e., aggregation, fusion, division, etc.), droplet vehicles for controlled delivery, autonomous motion, and tunable inversion.image

AB Object detection in autonomous driving applications implies the detection and tracking of semantic objects that are commonly native to urban driving environments, as pedestrians and vehicles. One of the major challenges in state-of-the-art deep-learning based object detection are false positives which occur with overconfident scores. This is highly undesirable in autonomous driving and other critical robotic-perception domains because of safety concerns. This paper proposes an approach to alleviate the problem of overconfident predictions by introducing a novel probabilistic layer to deep object detection networks in testing. The suggested approach avoids the traditional Sigmoid or Softmax prediction layer which often produces overconfident predictions. It is demonstrated that the proposed technique reduces overconfidence in the false positives without degrading the performance on the true positives. The approach is validated on the 2D-KITTI objection detection through the YOLOV4 and SECOND (Lidar-based detector). The proposed approach enables interpretable probabilistic predictions without the requirement of re-training the network and therefore is very practical.

AB Cinematography with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is an emerging technology promising to revolutionize media production. On the one hand, manually controlled drones already provide advantages, such as flexible shot setup, opportunities for novel shot types and access to difficult-to-reach spaces and/or viewpoints. Moreover, little additional ground infrastructure is required. On the other hand, enhanced UAV cognitive autonomy would allow both easier cinematography planning (from the Director's perspective) and safer execution of that plan during actual filming; while integrating multiple UAVs can additionally augment the cinematic potential. In this paper, a novel multiple-UAV software/hardware architecture for media production in outdoor settings is proposed. The architecture encompasses mission planning and control under safety constraints, enhanced cognitive autonomy through visual analysis, human-computer interfaces and communication infrastructure for platform scalability with Quality-of-Service provisions. Finally, the architecture is demonstrated via a relevant subjective study on the adequacy of UAV and camera parameters for different cinematography shot types, as well as with field experiments where multiple UAVs film outdoor sports events.

AB Autonomous delivery robot (ADR) technology for last-mile freight deliveries is a valuable step towards low-carbon logistics. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has put a global spotlight on ADRs for contactless package deliveries, and tremendous market interest has been pushing ADR developers to provide large-scale operation in several US cities. The deployment and penetration of ADR technology in this emerging marketplace calls for collection and analysis of consumer preference data on ADRs. This study addresses the need for research on public acceptance of ADRs and offers a detailed analysis of consumer preferences, trust, attitudes, and willingness to pay (WTP) using a representative sample of 483 consumers in Portland. The results reveal six underlying consumer segments: Direct Shoppers, E-Shopping Lovers, COVID Converts, Omnichannel Consumers, E-Shopping Skeptics, and Indifferent Consumers. By identifying the WTP determinants of these latent classes, this study provides actionable guidance for fostering mass adoption of low-carbon deliveries in the last-mile.

AB Automatic guided vehicles have become an important part of transporting goods in dynamic environments, and how to design an efficient path planning method for multiple AGVs is a current research hotspot. Due to the complex road conditions in dynamic environments, there may be dynamic obstacles and situations in which only the target point is known but a complete map is lacking, which leads to poor path planning and long planning time for multiple automatic guided vehicles (AGVs). In this paper, a two-level path planning method (referred to as GA-KL, genetic KL method) for multi-AGVs is proposed by integrating the scheduling policy into global path planning and combining the global path planning algorithm and local path planning algorithm. First, for local path planning, we propose an improved Q-learning path optimization algorithm (K-L, Kohonen Q-learning algorithm) based on a Kohonen network, which can avoid dynamic obstacles and complete autonomous path finding using the autonomous learning function of the Q-learning algorithm. Then, we adopt the idea of combining global and local planning by combining the K-L algorithm with the improved genetic algorithm; in addition, we integrate the scheduling policy into global path planning, which can continuously adjust the scheduling policy of multi-AGVs according to changes in the dynamic environment. Finally, through simulation and field experiments, we verified that the K-L algorithm can accomplish autonomous path finding; compared with the traditional path planning algorithm, the algorithm achieved improves results in path length and convergence time with various maps; the convergence time of the algorithm was reduced by about 6.3%, on average, and the path length was reduced by about 4.6%, on average. The experiments also show that the GA-KL method has satisfactory global search capability and can effectively avoid dynamic obstacles. The final experiments also demonstrated that the GA-KL method reduced the total path completion time by an average of 12.6% and the total path length by an average of 8.4% in narrow working environments or highly congested situations, which considerably improved the efficiency of the multi-AGVs.

AB The current standard for large-volume (thousands of cubic meters) zooplankton sampling in the deep sea is the MOCNESS, a system of multiple opening-closing nets, typically lowered to within 50 m of the seabed and towed obliquely to the surface to obtain low-spatial-resolution samples that integrate across 10 s of meters of water depth. The SyPRID (Sentry Precision Robotic Impeller Driven) sampler is an innovative, deep-rated (6000 m) plankton sampler that partners with the Sentry Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to obtain paired, large-volume plankton samples at specified depths and survey lines to within 1.5 m of the seabed and with simultaneous collection of sensor data. SyPRID uses a perforated Ultra-High-Molecular-Weight (UHMW) plastic tube to support a fine mesh net within an outer carbon composite tube (tube-within-a-tube design), with an axial flow pump located aft of the capture filter. The pump facilitates flow through the system and reduces or possibly eliminates the bow wave at the mouth opening. The cod end, a hollow truncated cone, is also made of UHMW plastic and includes a collection volume designed to provide an area where zooplankton can collect, out of the high flow region. SyPRID attaches as a saddle-pack to the Sentry vehicle. Sentry itself is configured with a flight control system that enables autonomous survey paths to low altitudes. In its verification deployment at the Blake Ridge Seep (216Q m) on the US Atlantic Margin, SyPRID was operated for 6 h at ansaltitude of 5 m. It recovered planVon samples, including delicate living larvae, from the near-bottom stratum that is seldom sampled by a typical MOCNESS tow. The prototype SyPRID and its next generations will enable studies of plankton or other particulate distributions associated with localized physico-chemical strata in the water column or above patchy habitats on the seafloor.

AB This paper presents a novel framework for customised modular bus systems that leverages travel demand prediction and modular autonomous vehicles to optimise services proactively. The proposed framework addresses two prediction scenarios with different forward-looking operations: optimistic operation and pessimistic operation. A mixed integer programming model in a space-time-state network is developed for the optimistic operation to determine module routes, schedules, formations and passenger-to-module assignments. For the pessimistic case, a two-stage optimisation procedure is introduced. The first stage involves two formulations (i.e., deterministic and robust) to generate cost-saving plans, and the second stage adapts plans with control strategies periodically. A Lagrangian heuristic approach is proposed to solve formulations efficiently. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using smartcard data from Beijing and two state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Results indicate that the proposed framework outperforms the real-time approach in operating costs and highlights the role of module capacity and time dependency.

TI Automotive interference statistics and their effect on radar detector
SO IET RADAR SONAR AND NAVIGATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Millimetre-wave frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars are at present widely deployed in the autonomous vehicles. The growing usage of such sensors, as a vital part of a robust future autonomous sensing system, sees the potential for significant increase in mutual interference and adverse effects on sensor operation. Effective target detection in the background of interference requires knowledge of the interference statistics. In the case that such statistics are found to be similar to that of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), then classical well-established detection techniques can be applied. Conversely, if statistics are found to be different, traditional techniques (matched filtering) will not be optimal. Here, a statistical analysis of mutual interference within an FMCW victim radar is presented. The majority of cases show a low correlation between the interference pulses received at the victim radar, with close to a Gaussian distribution. Some specific cases show a high correlation between the interference pulses in the victim radar chirps with a sinusoidal-like distribution, which degrades the victim radar's detection performance. The presented analysis is validated by experimental data for various interference cases.

AB With the increasing interest in leveraging mobile robotics for fire detection and monitoring arises the need to design recognition technology systems for these extreme environments. This work focuses on evaluating the sensing capabilities and image processing pipeline of thermal imaging sensors for fire detection applications, paving the way for the development of autonomous systems for early warning and monitoring of fire events. The contributions of this work are threefold. First, we overview image processing algorithms used in thermal imaging regarding data compression and image enhancement. Second, we present a method for data-driven thermal imaging analysis designed for fire situation awareness in robotic perception. A study is undertaken to test the behavior of the thermal cameras in controlled fire scenarios, followed by an in-depth analysis of the experimental data, which reveals the inner workings of these sensors. Third, we discuss key takeaways for the integration of thermal cameras in robotic perception pipelines for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based fire surveillance.

AB Road surfaces experience fatigue stress and loading, which often lead to cracks on the surface. The cracks might cause serious damage, and therefore, early detection can reduce the road maintenance cost. Traditional inspection methods are carried out by humans and are slow, costly and hazardous. To improve accuracy and reduce the hazards of current crack detection methods, this paper proposes a new autonomous crack detection system (ACDS) that can be used in any autonomous vehicles (UAVs). ACDS consists of three stages: image acquisition, image processing, and classification. The image processing stage consists of five parallel filtering methods, which remove noise and extract features from the images. In the classification stage, five deep belief network (DBN) classifiers separately analyse the images to detect cracks. The dataset used in this paper contains 15,000 RGB and infrared images, with or without cracks. The results show the high precision of the proposed system.

AB The past years have shown a remarkable growth in use-cases for micro aerial vehicles (MAVs). Conceivable indoor applications require highly robust environment perception, fast reaction to changing situations, and stable navigation, but reliable sources of absolute positioning such as global navigation satellite system (GNSS) or compass measurements are unavailable during indoor flights. We present a high-performance autonomous inventory MAV for operation inside warehouses. The MAV navigates along warehouse aisles and detects the placed stock in the shelves alongside its path with a multimodal sensor setup containing an radio-frequency identification (RFID) reader and two high-resolution cameras. We describe in detail the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) pipeline based on a three-dimensional lidar, the setup for stock recognition, the mission planning and trajectory generation, as well as a low-level routine for avoidance of dynamical or previously unobserved obstacles. Experiments were performed in an operative warehouse of a logistics provider, in which an external warehouse management system provided the MAV with high-level inspection missions that are executed fully autonomously.

AB Autonomous landing is an essential function for micro air vehicles (MAVs) for many scenarios. We pursue an active perception strategy that enables MAVs with limited onboard sensing and processing capabilities to concurrently assess feasible rooftop landing sites with a vision-based perception system while generating trajectories that balance continued landing site assessment and the requirement to provide visual monitoring of an interest point. The contributions of the work are twofold: (1) a perception system that employs a dense motion stereo approach that determines the 3D model of the captured scene without the need of geo-referenced images, scene geometry constraints, or external navigation aids; and (2) an online trajectory generation approach that balances the need to concurrently explore available rooftop vantages of an interest point while ensuring confidence in the landing site suitability by considering the impact of landing site uncertainty as assessed by the perception system. Simulation and experimental evaluation of the performance of the perception and trajectory generation methodologies are analyzed independently and jointly in order to establish the efficacy and robustness of the proposed approach.

AB This article describes a new method to perform fault detection and isolation for a closed-loop-controlled autonomous aircraft. This vehicle is equipped with standard sensors and actuators, and its dynamics is non-linear. It is assumed that a guidance law and a control loop have been designed to achieve a given mission. The diagnosis method uses the resulting control objectives to generate residuals indicative of the presence of faults. Two classical guidance laws are considered, leading to different control constraints and diagnosis signals. A structural sensitivity analysis shows that all sensor and actuator faults can be detected and all sensor faults isolated, for both laws. The fault diagnosis procedure does not require the costly integration of the model of the system, and the closed-loop scheme makes it robust to model uncertainty. Realistic simulation results with strong model and measurement uncertainty demonstrate the potential of the approach. A theoretical analogy with observer-based fault diagnosis is also derived.

AB Most advanced autonomous driving systems (ADS) today rely on the prior creation of high-definition maps (HD maps). This process is expensive and needs to be performed frequently to keep up with the changing conditions of the road environment. Creating accurate navigation maps online is an alternative to reduce the cost and broaden the current operational design domains (ODD) of modern ADS. This paper offers a snapshot of the state of the art in drivable area estimation, which is an essential technology to deploy ADS in ODDs where HD maps are limited or unavailable. The proposed review introduces a novel architecture breakdown that fits learning-based and non-learning-based techniques and allows the analysis of a set of impactful and recent drivable area algorithms. In addition to that, complimentary information for practitioners is provided: (i) an assessment of the influence of modern sensing technologies on the task under study and (ii) a selection of relevant datasets for evaluation and benchmarking purposes.

AB The ability to detect lane markings under varying lighting conditions is essential for autonomous mobile robots and automatic vehicle driving assistance systems. Because the object color information is subject to illumination variation, this article presents a novel and computationally efficient algorithm based on the extremum-seeking method to achieve illumination-resilient lane detection and path-following tasks for autonomous driving. Lane detection is performed in the hue-saturation-value color space by distinguishing the colored lane marks from the background. The system's inputs are the upper and lower thresholds in each of the hue, saturation, and value channels. We define a cost function as the combination of detection accuracy and lane coverage to evaluate the algorithm performance. Two extremum-seeking schemes, one with fixed dither amplitudes and another with adaptive dither amplitudes, are designed to adjust the system inputs to minimize the cost function. The two proposed methods are validated and compared through video-based simulation studies and scaled-car field experimental tests.

AB In this article, we present a novel machine learning based angle estimation and field of view (FoV) enhancement techniques for mmWave FMCW radars operating in the frequency range of 77 - 81 GHz. Field of view is enhanced in both azimuth and elevation. The Elevation FoV enhancement is achieved by keeping the orientation of antenna elements in elevation. In this orientation, radar focuses the beam in vertical direction there by enhancing the elevation FoV. An Azimuth FoV enhancement is achieved by mechanically rotating the radar horizontally, which has antenna elements in the elevation. With the proposed angle estimation technique for such rotating radars, root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.56 degrees is achieved. These proposed techniques will be highly useful for several applications in cost-effective and reliable autonomous systems such as ground station traffic monitoring and control systems for both on ground and aerial vehicles.

AB In this paper, a position measurement system, including drogue's landmark detection and position computation for autonomous aerial refueling of unmanned aerial vehicles, is proposed. A multitask parallel deep convolution neural network (MPDCNN) is designed to detect the landmarks of the drogue target. In MPDCNN, two parallel convolution networks are used, and a fusion mechanism is proposed to accomplish the effective fusion of the drogue's two salient parts' landmark detection. Considering the drogue target's geometric constraints, a position measurement method based on monocular vision is proposed. An effective fusion strategy, which fuses the measurement results of drogue's different parts, is proposed to achieve robust position measurement. The error of landmark detection with the proposed method is 3.9%, and it is obviously lower than the errors of other methods. Experimental results on the two KUKA robots platform verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed position measurement system for aerial refueling.

AB This paper describes the design and performance analysis of a control system for rotorcraft with an emphasis on the requirements called for by autonomous guidance. To be able to track trajectories, such as those generated by a guidance system, a path following controller is used in combination with a velocity control augmentation. The path following system is motivated by nonlinear stability analysis. The velocity control augmentation follows a loop-shaping design for the inner-loop attitude control and a dynamic inversion velocity control design for the outer-loop. The identified model of the dynamics along with the uncertainties is used to determine the robustness and performance of the velocity control system. Finally, the paper presents a novel method to evaluate the overall performance of the control system in terms of the tracking error statistics. These results are then used to determine a tracking error model, which can be used to predict the tracking error for a given reference. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To enable testing and performance evaluation of new connected and autonomous driving functions, it is important to characterize packet losses caused by degradation in vehicular (V2X) communication channels. In this paper we suggest an approach to constructing packet loss models based on the so-called Pseudo-Markov chains (PMC). The PMC-based model needs only short training sequences, has low computational complexity, and yet provides more precise approximations than known techniques. We show how to learn PMC models from either empirical records of packet receptions, or from analytical models of fluctuations in the received signal strength. In particular, we validate our approach by applying it on: 1) V2X packet reception data collected from an active safety test run, which used the LTE network of the AstaZero automotive testing site in Sweden, and 2) variants of the Rician fading channel models corresponding to two models of correlations of packet losses. We also show that initializing the Baum-Welch algorithm with a second order PMC model leads to a high accuracy model.

AB One of the major goals of the SUNRISE FP7 project is to make the Underwater Internet of Things a reality. In this context, the LOON-DOCK project presented here extends the existing Litoral Ocean Observatory Network testbed with a Docking Station tailored to the Spares II AUV. The docking system allows a remote user to program survey-like missions through a web-based interface as well as to retrieve the data gathered by the AUV once a mission finalizes. To enable the autonomous docking of the AUV, two complementary and cost-effective localization systems have been developed. The first one implements a range-only localization algorithm to approach the docking station while the second, based on active light beacons, provides high accuracy at short ranges to complete the docking maneuver. The system has been extensively tested, in different trials from a controlled water tank environment to more realistic sea operation conditions proving its viability despite very poor water visibility conditions.

AB Advanced internal combustion engine technologies have afforded an increase in the number of controllable variables and the ability to optimize engine operation. Values for these variables are determined during engine calibration by means of a tabular static correlation between the controllable variables and the corresponding steady-state engine operating points to achieve desirable engine performance, for example, in fuel economy, pollutant emissions, and engine acceleration. In engine use, table values are interpolated to match actual operating points. State-of-the-art calibration methods cannot guarantee continuously the optimal engine operation for the entire operating domain, especially in transient cases encountered in the driving styles of different drivers. This article presents brief theory and algorithmic implementation that make the engine an autonomous intelligent system capable of learning the required values of controllable variables in real time while operating a vehicle. The engine controller progressively perceives the driver's driving style and eventually learns to operate in a manner that optimizes specified performance criteria. A gasoline engine model, which learns to optimize fuel economy with respect to spark ignition timing, demonstrates the approach. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4000819]

AB The provision of spacecraft servicing to a space station comprises the tasks of assembly, resupply, repair and maintenance of manufactured space parts in-orbit. Servicing tasks use rendezvous and docking operations to accomplish their objectives. Autonomous servicing relies on intelligent fly control systems to perform fast, soft, and precise docking operations. This paper proposes the use of a fuzzy logic control system, mounted on an active chaser vehicle which wants to dock with a big passive space station in orbit around the Earth. The gene-fuzzy controller is a knowledge-based controller that performs the closed-loop operations autonomously. It produces smooth control actions in the proximity of the target and during the docking, to avoid disturbance torques in the final assembly orbit. The use of a genetic algorithm tool to optimise the controller so as to reduce docking time and fuel consumption is analyzed. It performs the optimization by finding the best fuzzy sets of the controller membership functions, and the most suitable rule data base. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI An Object Detection Method Based on Feature Uncertainty Domain
   Adaptation for Autonomous Driving
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
LA English
DT Article
DE object detection; domain adaptation; uncertainty
AB The environment perception algorithm in autonomous driving is trained in the source domain, leading to domain drift and reduced detection accuracy in the target domain due to shifts in background feature distribution. To address this issue, a domain adaptive object detection algorithm based on feature uncertainty is proposed, which can improve the detection performance of object detection algorithms in unlabeled data. Firstly, a local alignment module based on channel information is proposed, which can obtain the model's uncertainty about different domain data based on the feature channels obtained through the feature extraction network, achieving adaptive dynamic local alignment. Secondly, an instance-level alignment module guided by local feature uncertainty is proposed, which can obtain the corresponding instance-level uncertainty through ROI mapping. To improve the domain invariance of bounding box regression, a multi-class, multi-regression instance-level uncertainty alignment module is proposed, which can achieve spatial decoupling of classification and regression tasks, further improving the model's domain adaptive ability. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated on Cityscapes, KITTI, and real vehicle data.

AB In this paper, an enhanced visual servoing method is designed for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based on virtual plane image moments, under underactuation and tight coupling constraints of UAV kinematics. Moreover, in order to make the UAV search visual targets autonomously in target vicinity during flight, a flexible flight system is developed with stages of take-off, target searching, and image-based visual servoing (IBVS). With dual-camera sensor configuration, the UAV system searches targets from given directions while making localization. A virtual image plane is constructed and image moments are adopted to decouple UAV lateral movement. For a non-horizonal target, homography is utilized to construct the target plane and transform it into a horizonal plane. Backstepping techniques are used to derive the nonlinear controller to realize the IBVS strategy. Stability analysis proves global asymptotic performance of the closed-loop system. Experimental verification shows feasibility of the overall flight system and effectiveness of the visual servoing controller.

AB This work presents a novel landing assistance system (LAS) capable of locating a drone for a safe landing after its inspection mission. The location of the drone is achieved by a fusion of ultra-wideband (UWB), inertial measurement unit (IMU) and magnetometer data. Unlike other typical landing assistance systems, the UWB fixed sensors are placed around a 2 x 2 m landing platform and two tags are attached to the drone. Since this type of set-up is suboptimal for UWB location systems, a new positioning algorithm is proposed for a correct performance. First, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm is used to calculate the position of each tag, and then both positions are combined for a more accurate and robust localisation. As a result, the obtained positioning errors can be reduced by 50% compared to a typical UWB-based landing assistance system. Moreover, due to the small demand of space, the proposed landing assistance system can be used almost anywhere and is deployed easily.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-or drones-present compelling new opportunities for airborne gas sensing in applications such as environmental monitoring, hazardous scene assessment, and facilities' inspection. Instrumenting a UAV for this purpose encounters trade-offs between sensor size, weight, power, and performance, which drives the adoption of lightweight electrochemical and photo-ionisation detectors. However, this occurs at the expense of speed, selectivity, sensitivity, accuracy, resolution, and traceability. Here, we report on the design and integration of a broadband Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer with an autonomous UAV, providing ro-vibrational spectroscopy throughout the molecular fingerprint region from 3 - 11 mu m (3333 - 909 cm(-1)) and enabling rapid, quantitative aerial surveys of multiple species simultaneously with an estimated noise-limited performance of 18 ppm (propane). Bayesian interpolation of the acquired gas concentrations is shown to provide both localization of a point source with approximately one meter accuracy, and distribution mapping of a gas cloud, with accompanying uncertainty quantification.

AB We present a sampling-based control approach that can generate smooth actions for general nonlinear systems without external smoothing algorithms. Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control has been utilized in numerous robotic applications due to its appealing characteristics to solve non-convex optimization problems. However, the stochastic nature of sampling-based methods can cause significant chattering in the resulting commands. Chattering becomes more prominent in cases where the environment changes rapidly, possibly even causing the MPPI to diverge. To address this issue, we propose a method that seamlessly combines MPPI with an input-lifting strategy. In addition, we introduce a new action cost to smooth control sequence during trajectory rollouts while preserving the information theoretic interpretation of MPPI, which was derived from non-affine dynamics. We validate our method in two nonlinear control tasks with neural network dynamics: a pendulum swing-up task and a challenging autonomous driving task. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the MPPI baselines with additionally applied smoothing algorithms.

AB Driven by the demand to develop self-driving cars, automotive radars evolve rapidly at this time. Current high end radars therefore have very little in common with the radars that were developed just a few years ago and are being built into today's car series. Anyway, since at least two decades such sensors are referred to as imaging radars, although the set of possible applications has changed significantly. This study displays the leap in the evolution of automotive imaging radars on the example of the Astyx HiRes radar and elucidates the additional information that becomes available for autonomous driving functions like freespace modelling and target classification. In particular, it will be shown that the image quality of a modern high end radar suffices to apply computer vision techniques that were reserved for optical or light detection and ranging (LIDAR) images until now.

AB Underwater activities, such as surveying or interventions, carried out by autonomous robots, can benefit greatly from using a vision system. Optics based systems provide information at a spatial and temporal resolution higher than their acoustic counterparts. At present, they are the best option when high precision maneuvering and manipulation is needed, if there is good visibility. This paper presents a new system designed to provide visual information in submarine tasks such as navigation, surveying, mapping and intervention. The main advantages of our system, called Fugu-f (Fugu flexible), are its robustness in both the mechanical structure and the software components, its flexibility, since it is installed as an external module and is adaptable to different vehicles and missions, and its capacity to operate in real-time. Experiments of surveying and object manipulation carried out in real conditions in the context of the TRIDENT project show the suitability of the system and its scientific and industrial potential applications.

ID ROBUST
AB In order to improve the safety of autonomous flight of quadrotor in three-dimensional complex environments, this letter proposes a speed adaptive motion planning method by limiting the distance between two adjacent control points based on the derivative property of B-Spline curve. First the initial B-Spline curve control points and the speed constraints based on derivative property are efficiently obtained by the front-end search that is divided into the shortest safe path search and reasonable step targeted expansion satisfying dynamic constraints. Then the back-end optimization assigns the corresponding safe flight corridor to the local trajectories according to the stage of the initial control points and uses MINVO basis (Tordesillas and How, 2022) to limit the simplexes with minimum volume enclosing local trajectories. The trajectory generation is finally formulated as a Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program (QCQP) which can be solved efficiently. Both simulations and real-world experiments validate the efficiency and performance of this method in generating safe, smooth, speed adaptive trajectories.

AB This article presents a multirotor system with an integrated net mechanism for autonomous object detection and collection from water surfaces utilizing only onboard sensors. The task of object collection on water surfaces is challenging due to the following reasons: 1) propeller outwash alters the object's dynamics; 2) unpredictable current flows, 3) extreme reflection and glare off water surfaces affect the object detection; and 4) noisy height measurements over water surface. A two-phase object-detection algorithm is developed with a linearized polarization filter and specularity removal algorithm to eliminate reflections and an edge-based contour detector for detection of objects on water surface. Subsequently, a boundary layer sliding-mode control is implemented to ensure the system is robust to modeling uncertainties. A dynamic sliding surface is designed based on constrained linear model predictive control. The efficacy of the proposed collection system is validated by multiple outdoor tests. Multiple objects of different shapes and sizes are collected with an overall success rate of 91.6%.

DT Article
AB Although robotic helicopters have received increasing interest from university, industry, and military research groups, their flight envelope in autonomous operations remains extremely limited. The absence of high-fidelity simulation models has prevented the use of well-established multivariable control techniques for the design of high-bandwidth control systems. Existing controllers are of low bandwidth and cover only small portions of the vehicle's flight envelope. The results of the synergic use of high-fidelity integrated modeling strategies and robust multivariable control techniques for the rapid and reliable design of a high-bandwidth controller for robotic helicopters are presented. The project implemented and flight tested an H-infinity loop shaping controller on the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Yamaha R-50 robotic helicopter. During the flight tests, the CMU R-50 flew moderate-speed coordinated maneuvers with a level of tracking performance that exceeds performance reported in the publicly available literature. The authors believe that the results open the road to the implementation on robotic helicopters of full-flight-envelope control systems for complex autonomous missions.

AB Nowadays Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are being employed in a wide range of industrial technologies for a variety of sectors, such as medical, automotive, aviation, agriculture, space, etc. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in both the field of CNNs for image classification and object detection and Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) in a synergetic way. Layer-based details of CNNs along with parameter and floating-point operation number calculations are outlined. Using an evolutionary approach, the majority of the outstanding image classification CNNs, published in the open literature, is introduced with a focus on their accuracy performance, parameter number, model size, and inference speed, highlighting the progressive developments in convolutional operations. Results of a novel investigation of the convolution types and operations commonly used in CNNs are presented, including a timing analysis aimed at assessing their impact on CNN performance. This extensive experimental study provides new insight into the behaviour of each convolution type in terms of training time, inference time, and layer level decomposition. Building blocks for CNN-based object detection are also discussed, such as backbone networks and baseline types, and then representative state-of-the-art designs are outlined. Experimental results from the literature are summarised for each of the reviewed models. This is followed by an overview of recent ADSs related works and current industry activities, aiming to bridge academic research and industry practice on CNNs and ADSs. Design approaches targeted at solving problems of automakers in achieving real-time implementations are also proposed based on a discussion of design constraints, human vs. machine evaluations and trade-off analysis of accuracy vs. size. Current technologies, promising directions, and expectations from the literature on ADSs are introduced including a comprehensive trade-off analysis from a human-machine perspective.

AB Applying reinforcement learning to autonomous driving entails particular challenges, primarily due to dynamically changing traffic flows. To address such challenges, it is necessary to quickly determine response strategies to the changing intentions of surrounding vehicles. This letter proposes a new policy optimization method for safe driving using graph-based interaction-aware constraints. In this framework, the motion prediction and control modules are trained simultaneously while sharing a latent representation that contains a social context. To reflect social interactions, we illustrate the movements of agents in graph form and filter the features with the graph convolution networks. This helps preserve the spatiotemporal locality of adjacent nodes. Furthermore, we create feedback loops to combine these two modules effectively. As a result, this approach encourages the learned controller to be safe from dynamic risks and renders the motion prediction robust to abnormal movements. In the experiment, we set up a navigation scenario comprising various situations with CARLA, an urban driving simulator. The experiments show state-of-the-art performance on navigation strategy and motion prediction compared to the baselines.

AB Vibration isolation technology is one of the main methods for controlling the vibration and noise of underwater vehicles. This paper presents a vibration analysis and vibration isolator component design method of the power system in autonomous underwater gliders (AUGs). The dynamic models of the single-layer and double-layers vibration isolation systems of the power system of the AUG are established to analyze the force transfer rate in the system. A reasonable stiffness range of the vibration isolation system is obtained according to the results of the dynamic model. To validate the vibration isolation performances of the presented vibration isolation systems, the finite element (FE) models of single-layer and double-layers vibration isolation systems are established. The vi-bration responses and vibration isolation performances of the system with and without the rubber isolation systems are compared. Moreover, the effect of stiffness on the vibration isolation performances of the system is discussed. The presented results can provide some guidance for the design method of the vibration isolation system in the power system of AUGs.

AB This work presents the application of an aerial manipulation robot for the semi-autonomous installation of clip-type bird flight diverters on overhead power line cables. A custom-made prototype is designed, developed, and experimentally validated. The proposed solution aims to reduce the cost and risk of current procedures carried out by human operators deployed on suspended carts, lifts, or manned helicopters. The system consists of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a custom-made tool. This tool allows the high force required for the diverter installation to be generated; however, it is isolated from the aerial robot through a passive joint. Thus, the aerial robot stability is not compromised during the installation. This paper thoroughly describes the designed prototype and the control system for semi-autonomous operation. Flight experiments conducted in an illustrative scenario validate the performance of the system; the tests were carried out in an indoor testbed using a power line cable mock-up.

AB Ride-sourcing, the use of private cars to provide on-demand mobility services, first appeared in San Francisco around the year 2010. Since then, transportation network companies (TNCs) who offer ride-sourcing services have expanded all around the world. By examining three case cities (San Francisco, Mexico City, Paris) we explain what facilitated this growth and how the regulation of TNCs differs. Subsequently, an economic analysis discusses the current expansionary strategy of TNCs and their future. We show that TNCs adapt their strategies to local contexts, with first priority to establish themselves in the market, if necessary, using gray regulatory areas, even if they face resistance from city authorities, taxi drivers and other groups, and despite being unprofitable. Our economic model explains this. We show that an unregulated ride-sourcing market leads to monopolistic situations once autonomous vehicles become available. We hence conclude that city authorities need to develop a regulatory framework to maximize social welfare.

AB Automotive millimeter-wave (MMW) radar is essential in autonomous vehicles due to its robustness in all weather conditions. Traditional commercial automotive radars are limited by their resolution, which makes the object classification task difficult. Thus, the concept of a new generation of four-dimensional (4D) imaging radar was proposed. It has high azimuth and elevation resolution and contains Doppler information to produce a high-quality point cloud. In this paper, we propose an object classification network named Radar Transformer. The algorithm takes the attention mechanism as the core and adopts the combination of vector attention and scalar attention to make full use of the spatial information, Doppler information, and reflection intensity information of the radar point cloud to realize the deep fusion of local attention features and global attention features. We generated an imaging radar classification dataset and completed manual annotation. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieved an overall classification accuracy of 94.9%, which is more suitable for processing radar point clouds than the popular deep learning frameworks and shows promising performance.

AB A row-following system based on machine vision for a picking robot was designed in our previous study. However, the visual perception could not provide reliable information during headland turning according to the test results. A complete navigation system for a picking robot working in an orchard needs to support accurate row following and headland turning. To fill this gap, a headland turning method for an autonomous picking robot was developed in this paper. Three steps were executed during headland turning. First, row end was detected based on machine vision. Second, the deviation was further reduced before turning using the designed fast posture adjustment algorithm based on satellite information. Third, a curve path tracking controller was developed for turning control. During the MATLAB simulation and experimental test, different controllers were developed and compared with the designed method. The results show that the designed turning method enabled the robot to converge to the path more quickly and remain on the path with lower radial errors, which eventually led to reductions in time, space, and deviation during headland turning.

DE Optimal sensor coverage; Distributed control of multi-agent systems
ID COLLECTIVE MOTION; SENSOR NETWORKS; PATHS
AB This work examines the cooperative motion of a group of autonomous vehicles in a fast flow environment. The magnitude of the flow velocity is assumed to be greater than the available actuation to each agent. Collectively, the agents wish to maximize total coverage area defined as the set of points reachable by any agent within T time. The reachable set of an agent in a fast flow is characterized using optimal control techniques. Specifically, this work addresses the complementary cases where the static flow field is smooth, and where the flow field is piecewise constant. The latter case arises as a proposed approximation of a smooth flow that remains analytically tractable. Furthermore, the techniques used in the piecewise constant flow case enable treatment for obstacles in the environment. In both cases, a gradient ascent method is derived to maximize the total coverage area in a distributed fashion. Simulations show that such a network is able to maximize the coverage area in a fast flow.

AB Purpose - This paper aims to present a hybrid path planning algorithm which is designed for use of autonomous vehicles in indoor environments. The approach mainly contributes the ability of generating a safe and smooth collision avoidance path for attaining a desired position in an unknown and obstructed environment.
   Design/methodology/approach - The hybrid planner is based on potential field method and Voronoi diagram approach, and it is represented with the ability of concurrent map building and autonomous navigation.
   Findings - The possibility of controlling the look-ahead distance allows the mobile robotto smartly control the velocity for creating a smooth trajectory autonomously. The dead-lock problem is solved by defining necessary sub-goals between targets on the constructed map.
   Originality/value - The system controller (look-ahead control) with the potential field method allows the robot to generate a smooth and safe path for an expected position. Only essential exploration of unknown environment is performed since the approach constrains the mobile robot to explore a safe and sub-optimal route towards a destination.

AB Accurate information of path followed by vehicles at several real-life scenarios is essential for modeling and testing the optimal path for autonomous vehicles, analyzing the lateral dynamics such as lane-changing and overtaking, vehicle dynamics at the horizontal curves, intersections, and roundabouts. Recently, the availability of such data is plenty, thanks to the advancements in drone and computer-vision technologies. Nevertheless, extracting useful information from the observed data requires certain pre-processing that can handle the noises added at several stages of the data collection. The adequacy of the existing off-the-shelf smoothing techniques (e.g., Moving average, Savitzky-Golay, Kalman filter) for denoising the trajectory data of the modern era is certainly a question. The motivation for the present study is twofold. Firstly, the challenges of contemporary trajectory data collection and associated error patterns are relatively unknown, and thus an appropriate denoising technique needs to be developed. Secondly, many of the existing smoothing techniques have chosen invariant parameters across all the vehicle paths, even though the error patterns are dissimilar across the vehicles and, in the longitudinal and lateral directions. Thus, an adaptive smoothing needs to be applied for each observed vehicle path and its components. The present study proposes an adaptive, and data-driven path smoothing technique that can be universally applied to the video-based path data obtained from any camera platform (either drone or fixed camera setup). The proposed reconstruction framework works in three-stages; in the first stage, the data is prepared by resampling any missing data. Also, any outlier in the observed path data is identified and removed at this stage. In the second stage, a Recursively Ensembled Low-Pass (RELP) filter is proposed to handle the 'heavily tailed' noise found in the video-processing based trajectory data, particularly for drone videos. A robust adaptive Gaussian kernel smoothing is applied in the third stage to have a localized reconstruction. For Kernel smoothing, the smoothing parameters such as the optimal bandwidth and polynomial order are estimated using the proposed grid-search algorithm. The parameter estimation process ensures that the bias and variance are perfectly traded-off to achieve a smooth vehicle path. The performance evaluation of the proposed method shows an internally and physically consistent trajectory reconstruction.

AB Self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) has great potential for deployment in a wide range of applications, including virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. Nevertheless, most previous studies focused on complex architectures to pursue better performance in MDE. In this letter, we aim to develop a lightweight yet highly effective self-supervised MDE model that can deliver competitive performance in edge devices. We introduce a novel MobileViT-based depth (MViTDepth) network that can effectively capture both local features and global information by leveraging the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a vision transformer (ViT). To further compress the proposed MViTDepth model, we employ knowledge distillation, which leads to improved depth estimation performance. Specifically, the self-supervised MDE MonoViT is used as a teacher model to construct the knowledge distillation loss for optimizing a student model. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MViTDepth significantly outperforms Monodepth2 in terms of parameters and accuracy, thereby indicating its superiority in application to edge devices.

AB For autonomous vehicles (AVs), visual perception techniques based on sensors like cameras play crucial roles in information acquisition and processing. In various computer perception tasks for AVs, it may be helpful to match landmark patches taken by an onboard camera with other landmark patches captured at a different time or saved in a street scene image database. To perform matching under challenging driving environments caused by changing seasons, weather, and illumination, we utilize the spatial neighborhood information of each patch. We propose an approach, named RobustMat, which derives its robustness to perturbations from neural differential equations. A convolutional neural ODE diffusion module is used to learn the feature representation for the landmark patches. A graph neural PDE diffusion module then aggregates information from neighboring landmark patches in the street scene. Finally, feature similarity learning outputs the final matching score. Our approach is evaluated on several street scene datasets and demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art matching results under environmental perturbations.

AB Since designing efficient tactile sensors for autonomous robots is still a challenge, this paper proposes a perceptual system based on a bioinspired triboelectric whisker sensor (TWS) that is aimed at reactive obstacle avoidance and local mapping in unknown environments. The proposed TWS is based on a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and mimics the structure of rat whisker follicles. It operates to generate an output voltage via triboelectrification and electrostatic induction between the PTFE pellet and copper films (0.3 mm thickness), where a forced whisker shaft displaces a PTFE pellet (10 mm diameter). With the help of a biologically inspired structural design, the artificial whisker sensor can sense the contact position and approximate the external stimulation area, particularly in a dark environment. To highlight this sensor's applicability and scalability, we demonstrate different functions, such as controlling LED lights, reactive obstacle avoidance, and local mapping of autonomous surface vehicles. The results show that the proposed TWS can be used as a tactile sensor for reactive obstacle avoidance and local mapping in robotics.

AB While cars, by definition and necessity, have always been (auto)mobile, they are not often considered, or studied, as media. In light of this, the present article seeks to elucidate the technological, political, and economic forces that have converged to transform cars into mobile spatial media. This article provides a framework to contextualize the nodal role of navigation in creating the conditions for a large-scale disruption in automobile technologies with potentially far-reaching impacts: autonomous navigation. The arguments at the core of this article bring together, and build on, recent theoretical developments in (a) locative media, (b) automobiles as mobile media, and (c) new mapping technologies, practices, and spatial media to provide a coherent perspective of cars as mobile spatial media. Informed by a geographical political economy of navigation, this perspective contributes to our understanding of cars in the context of digital and informational capitalism as these vehicles undergo qualitative transformations catalyzed by increased digital interconnections and comprehensive automation.

AB We describe a biodegradable, self-propelled bovine serum albumin/poly-l-lysine (PLL/BSA) multilayer rocket as a smart vehicle for efficient anticancer drug encapsulation/delivery to cancer cells and near-infrared light controlled release. The rockets were constructed by a template-assisted layer-by-layer assembly of the PLL/BSA layers, followed by incorporation of a heat-sensitive gelatin hydrogel containing gold nanoparticles, doxorubicin, and catalase. These rockets can rapidly deliver the doxorubicin to the targeted cancer cell with a speed of up to 68 mu m/s, through a combination of biocatalytic bubble propulsion and magnetic guidance. The photothermal effect of the gold nanoparticles under NIR irradiation enable the phase transition of the gelatin hydrogel for rapid release of the loaded doxorubicin and efficient killing of the surrounding cancer cells. Such biodegradable and multifunctional protein-based microrockets provide a convenient and efficient platform for the rapid delivery and controlled release of therapeutic drugs.

AB We describe a system for the semi-autonomous in situ measurement of lake chemical properties, with high temporal resolution and the potential to map chemical properties in 3 dimensions. The system comprises both fixed sensor locations on moored buoys and one (or potentially more) autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) serving as mobile underwater sensor platforms. Sensors include conventional water quality multiprobes and thermistor strings and the NEREUS underwater mass spectrometer for measurement of dissolved metabolic gases such as methane as well as permanent gases. Data are delivered to a shore station via a network that includes acoustic modems for communication with the AUV and a radio network operating in the license-free ISM (industrial, scientific, and medical) band operating under the IEEE 802.11b protocol. The system is designed to use low-cost commercial hardware and open-source software wherever possible. We constructed a prototype system of 3 buoys, 1 AUV, and a shore station, and field tests have demonstrated its ability to measure and remotely display lake chemical data in real time.

AB The objective of this study was to develop an automatic guidance system capable of navigating an autonomous vehicle travelling between tree rows in a real-time application. The study focused solely on straight line recognition of the tree rows using a laser scanner as a navigation sensor. A 52 kW agricultural tractor was used as the platform on which the laser scanner was mounted. A Hough transform was used as the algorithm to recognise the tree row. An auto-regression method eliminated the white Gaussian noise in the laser scanner data. A calibration method was used to select the offset position of the laser scanner and to correct the heading and lateral error evaluation. An appropriate speed for tractor was also determined. By obtaining an accuracy of 0.11 m lateral error and 1-5 degrees heading error, it was possible to navigate the robot tractor autonomously between the orchard row crops. (c) 20,06 IAgrE.

AB Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) that interact with each other to achieve common goals are known as collaborative CPSs. Collaborative CPSs can achieve complex goals that individual CPSs cannot achieve on their own. One of the examples of collaborative CPSs is the vehicular cyber-physical systems (VCPSs), which integrate computing and physical resources to interact with each other to improve traffic safety, situational awareness, and efficiency. The perception system of individual VCPS has limitations on its coverage and detection accuracy. For example, the autonomous vehicle's sensor cannot detect occluded objects and obstacles beyond its field of view. The VCPS can combine its own data with other collaborative VCPSs to enhance perception, situational awareness, accuracy, and traffic safety. This paper proposes a collaborative perception system to detect occluded objects through the camera sensor's image fusion and stitching technique. The proposed collaborative perception system combines the perception of surrounding autonomous driving systems (ADSs) that extends the detection range beyond the field of view. We also applied logistic chaos map-based encryption in our collaborative perception system in order to avoid the phantom information shared by malicious vehicles and improve safety in collaboration. It can provide the real-time perception of occluded objects, enabling safer control of ADSs. The proposed collaborative perception can detect occluded objects and obstacles beyond the field of view that individual VCPS perception systems cannot detect, improving the safety of ADSs. We investigated the effectiveness of collaborative perception and its contribution toward extended situational awareness on the road in the simulation environment. Our simulation results showed that the average detection rate of proposed perception systems was 45.4% more than the perception system of an individual ADS. The safety analysis showed that the response time was increased up to 1 s, and the average safety distance was increased to 1.2 m when the ADSs were using collaborative perception compared to those scenarios in which the ADSs were not using collaborative perception.

AB This paper deals with the prediction of the future location of vehicles, which is attracting attention in the era of the fourth industrial revolution and is required in various fields, such as autonomous vehicles and smart city traffic management systems. Currently, vehicle traffic prediction models and accident prediction models are being tested in various places, and considerable progress is being made. However, there are always errors in positioning when using wireless sensors due to various variables, such as the appearance of various substances (water, metal) that occur in the space where radio waves exist. There have been various attempts to reduce the positioning error in such an Internet of Things environment, but there is no definitive method with confirmed performance. Of course, location prediction is also not accurate. In particular, since a vehicle moves rapidly in space, it is increasingly affected by changes in the environment. Firstly, it was necessary to develop a spatial positioning algorithm that can improve the positioning accuracy. Secondly, for the data generated by the positioning algorithm, a machine learning method suitable for position prediction was developed. Based on the above two developed algorithms, through experiments, we found a means to reduce the error of positioning through radio waves and to increase the accuracy of positioning. We started with the idea of changing the positioning space itself from a three-dimensional space into a two-dimensional one. With changes in the time and space of radio wave measurement, the location was measured by transforming the spatial dimension to cope with environmental changes. This is a technology that predicts a location through machine learning on time series data using a direction angle classification technique. An experiment was conducted to verify the performance of the proposed technology. As a result, the accuracy of positioning was improved, and the accuracy of location prediction increased in proportion to the learning time. It was possible to confirm the prediction accuracy increase of up to 80% with changes. Considering that the accuracy result for location prediction presented by other researchers is 70%, through this study, the result was improved by 10% compared to the existing vehicle location prediction accuracy. In conclusion, this paper presents a positioning algorithm and machine learning methodology for vehicle positioning. By proving its usefulness through experiments, this study provides other researchers with a new definition of space for predicting the location of a vehicle, and a machine learning method using direction angles.

AB Electric mobility is emerging all around the world to minimize environmental impacts, reduce dependency on petroleum, and diversify energy sources for transportation. Any emerging technology comes with uncertainties in terms of its environmental, economic, and social impacts on the global society, and history has shown that some technological changes have led also to great societal transformation thus shaping our future as humanity. Understanding, perceiving, and anticipating the potential changes are essential to managing as well as internalizing maximum benefits out of these technological advancements for a sustainable global community. In the literature, life cycle assessment approaches are mainly used to assess the potential environmental impacts of electric vehicles. Considering the potential impacts of emerging transportation technologies, traditional life cycle assessment is not sufficient to analyze economic and social impacts, ripple, side, or rebound effects, macro-economic impacts, and global-supply chain related impacts. In response to these knowledge gaps, traditional environmental life cycle assessment approaches are evolving into new more integrated, and broader approaches (e.g., life cycle sustainability assessment). This research aims to reveal research gaps in the sustainability assessment of electric vehicles and provide an outlook of the current state of knowledge, perspectives on research gaps, and potential ways for the adoption of integrated life-cycle modeling approaches. We conducted a comprehensive literature review focusing on sustainability assessment studies for emerging electric vehicle technologies for the period between 2009 and 2020 using the Scopus database. A total of 138 life cycle assessment studies focusing on electric and autonomous (electric) vehicles are analyzed. The reviewed studies are classified and analyzed based on sustainability indicators, life cycle approaches, life cycle phases, data sources and regions, and vehicle technology and class. We also compared the global warming potential of battery electric vehicles of different class sizes. According to the literature review, five major knowledge gaps are identified; 1) lack of socioeconomic assessment, 2) lack of integrated modeling approaches and macro-level assessment; 3) limited consideration of end-of-life management and circular economy applications, 4) underrepresented developing world; 5) underrepresented emerging technologies. The findings of this review can help researchers worldwide to overview the state-of-art and state-of-practice in the field of sustainability assessment of emerging technologies and electric vehicles.

AB Oil spills within the marine environment are undesirable events caused by unavoidable economic activities of huge sea lane traffics. A tremendous effort has been made to tackle this problem within academia and industries; among them, the concept of autonomous vehicles for oil spill combating seems to provide a promising solution. This paper mainly proposes a cooperative deployment framework for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to perform oil spill cleanup missions with dispersant spraying. An appropriate oil density function is introduced by applying a Gaussian mixture model based on NOAA's advanced oil spill model (General NOAA Operational Modeling Environment). UAVs are then deployed to cover oil spills for spraying operations. This deployment problem is formulated as a coverage problem based on centroidal Voronoi tessellation to determine UAVs' optimal location. By transforming the coverage control problem into a target tracking one, an Integral Terminal Super Twisting Sliding Mode Control is provided to drive the UAVs to the optimal configuration. Furthermore, a novel spraying adjustment strategy is also designed to target the oil spills more accurately at the appropriate dosage. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is studied through a case study in the Abuzar oil field in the Persian Gulf. The results verify the performance of the cooperative oil spill cleanup framework in conjunction with advanced oil spill modeling. Moreover, it is concluded that the oil spill can be more effectively dispersed if the proposed spraying adjustment strategy is implemented.

AB One of the main challenges in autonomous racing is to design algorithms for motion planning at high speed, and across complex racing courses. End-to-end trajectory synthesis has been previously proposed where the trajectory for the ego vehicle is computed based on camera images from the racecar. This is done in a supervised learning setting using behavioral cloning techniques. In this paper, we address the limitations of behavioral cloning methods for trajectory synthesis by introducing Differential Bayesian Filtering (DBF), which uses probabilistic Bezier curves as a basis for inferring optimal autonomous racing trajectories based on Bayesian inference. We introduce a trajectory sampling mechanism and combine it with a filtering process which is able to push the car to its physical driving limits. The performance of DBF is evaluated on the DeepRacing Formula One simulation environment and compared with several other trajectory synthesis approaches as well as human driving performance. DBF achieves the fastest lap time, and the fastest speed, by pushing the racecar closer to its limits of control while always remaining inside track bounds.

AB In this article, we physically demonstrate a reactive sensorimotor architecture for mobile robots whose behaviors are generated by motivation dynamics. Motivation dynamics uses a continuous dynamical system to reactively compose low-level control vector fields using valuation functions that capture the potentially competing influences of external stimuli relative to the system's own internal state. We show that motivation dynamics naturally accommodates external stimuli through standard signal processing tools, and can effectively encode a repetitive higher level task by composing several low-level controllers to achieve a limit cycle in which the robot repeatedly navigates toward two alternatively valuable goal locations in a commensurately alternating order. We show that these behaviors are robust to perturbations, including imperfect models of robot kinematics, sensor noise, and disturbances, resulting from the need to traverse difficult terrain. We argue that motivation dynamics can provide a useful alternative to controllers based on hybrid automata in situations where the control operates at a low level close to the physical hardware.

AB Autonomous motion planning (AMP) of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is aimed at enabling a UAV to safely fly to the target without human intervention. Recently, several emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have been employed to address the AMP problem in some simplified environments, and these methods have yielded good results. This paper proposes a multiple experience pools (MEPs) framework leveraging human expert experiences for DRL to speed up the learning process. Based on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, a MEP-DDPG algorithm was designed using model predictive control and simulated annealing to generate expert experiences. On applying this algorithm to a complex unknown simulation environment constructed based on the parameters of the real UAV, the training experiment results showed that the novel DRL algorithm resulted in a performance improvement exceeding 20% as compared with the state-of-the-art DDPG. The results of the experimental testing indicate that UAVs trained using MEP-DDPG can stably complete a variety of tasks in complex, unknown environments.

AB Tipover issue is an important problem in autonomous mobile manipulators. This issue is becoming more important in new generation of mobile robots where their size and weight are reduced, and they are designed, to work on uneven terrains with higher speeds. Estimating the distance from the tipover stability margin would enhance the capability of the mobile manipulators in correcting their motion. For a valid estimation of the tipover margin one must take into account the full dynamic interaction between the vehicle and its manipulator. In mobile manipulators with several degrees of freedom a huge amount of time is needed to solve equations of motion while real-time tipover control needs a fast And on-line access to the data. The proposed approach is a neufal-network-based algorithm that enables autonomous mobile manipulator to detect its instable situations. This method greatly reduces the observer calculation time and is fast enough to be used as an observer for real-time tipover control. Accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by an example. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The increasing computing demands of autonomous driving applications have driven the adoption of multicore processors in real-time systems, which in turn renders energy optimizations critical for reducing battery capacity and vehicle weight. A typical energy optimization method targeting traditional real-time systems finds a critical speed under a static deadline, resulting in conservative energy savings that are unable to exploit dynamic changes in the system and environment. We capture emerging dynamic deadlines arising from the vehicle's change in velocity and driving context for an additional energy optimization opportunity. In this article, we extend the preliminary work for uniprocessors [66] to multicore processors, which introduces several challenges. We use the state-of-the-art real-time gang scheduling [5] to mitigate some of the challenges. However, it entails an NP-hard combinatorial problem in that tasks need to be grouped into gangs of tasks, gang formation, which could significantly affect the energy saving result. As such, we present EASYR, an adaptive system optimization and reconfiguration approach that generates gangs of tasks from a given directed acyclic graph for multicore processors and dynamically adapts the scheduling parameters and processor speeds to satisfy dynamic deadlines while consuming as little energy as possible. The timing constraints are also satisfied between system reconfigurations through our proposed safe mode change protocol. Our extensive experiments with randomly generated task graphs show that our gang formation heuristic performs 32% better than the state-of-the-art one. Using an autonomous driving task set from Bosch and real-world driving data, our experiments show that EASYR achieves energy reductions of up to 30.3% on average in typical driving scenarios compared with a conventional energy optimizationmethod with the current state-of-the-art gang formation heuristic in real-time systems, demonstrating great potential for dynamic energy optimization gains by exploiting dynamic deadlines.

AB The rapid development of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) increases the requirement for the accurate prediction of objects in the vicinity to guarantee safer journeys. For effectively predicting objects, sensors such as Three-Dimensional Light Detection and Ranging (3D LiDAR) and cameras can be used. The 3D LiDAR sensor captures the 3D shape of the object and produces point cloud data that describes the geometrical structure of the object. The LiDAR-only detectors may be subject to false detection or even non-detection over objects located at high distances. The camera sensor captures RGB images with sufficient attributes that describe the distinct identification of the object. The high-resolution images produced by the camera sensor benefit the precise classification of the objects. However, hindrances such as the absence of depth information from the images, unstructured point clouds, and cross modalities affect assertion and boil down the environmental perception. To this end, this paper proposes an object detection mechanism that fuses the data received from the camera sensor and the 3D LiDAR sensor (OD-C3DL). The 3D LiDAR sensor obtains point clouds of the object such as distance, position, and geometric shape. The OD-C3DL employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for further processing point clouds obtained from the 3D LiDAR sensor and the camera sensor to recognize the objects effectively. The point cloud of the LiDAR is enhanced and fused with the image space on the Regions of Interest (ROI) for easy recognition of the objects. The evaluation results show that the OD-C3DL can provide an average of 89 real-time objects for a frame and reduces the extraction time by a recall rate of 94%. The average processing time is 65ms, which makes the OD-C3DL model incredibly suitable for the AVs perception. Furthermore, OD-C3DL provides mean accuracy for identifying automobiles and pedestrians at a moderate degree of difficulty is higher than that of the previous models at 79.13% and 88.76%.

AB Why develop polar robots? Logistics costs predominate polar-science budgets to maintain safe human operations in extreme environments. Robots could reduce this logistics burden and thus expand research opportunities in the Polar Regions.
   With the funding from the National Science Foundation, we have developed first ground vehicle specifically designed to conduct long-duration autonomous science campaigns over terrestrial ice sheets. The 60-kg, solar-powered Cool Robot measures 1.2 x 1.2 x 1 in and can carry or tow 20-80 kg science payloads. A low-profile, four-wheel-drive chassis supports a five-sided, lightweight box of solar cells that capture significant reflected sunlight from the snowfield. The robot is zero emissions, so it can conduct clean snow and air measurements without being trailed by its own pollutants. A fleet of Cool Robots could support many other polar science projects, including biological sampling, glaciology surveys, and upper atmosphere or magnetosphere observations using broadly spaced instrument arrays.
   We present here revisions to the Cool Robot's solar-power input model to account for the effects of diffuse-sky radiation, a significant source of radiation for cloudy conditions common in Greenland. The main effect of increasing diffuse-sky radiation, for fixed global radiation, is to increase the diurnal variation in solar-power input to the robot. The revised model agrees well with irradiance measurements and the robot's measured power budget during a long-duration test conducted in Greenland. It thus allows us to adapt the Cool Robot to the specific needs of polar science campaigns with some confidence. For two-month science campaigns in Antarctica or Greenland, the Cool Robot has sufficient power margin to carry a 20-kg payload, or tow an 80-kg sled, over 1000 km per month. Under most conditions, 100-300 W are available to power the payload. The robot must yet demonstrate reliable long-distance operation. Nevertheless, results to date suggest it holds the potential to conduct significant autonomous science campaigns in Antarctica and Greenland. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper treats the question of servoregulation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the yaw plane using pectoral-like mechanical fins. The fins attached to the vehicle have oscillatory swaying and yawing motion. The bias angle of the angular motion of the fin is used for the purpose of control. Of course, the design approach considered here is applicable to AUVs for other choices of oscillation patterns of the fins, which produce periodic forces and moments. It is assumed that the vehicle parameters, hydrodynamic coefficients, as well the fin forces and moments are unknown. For the trajectory control of the yaw angle, a sampled-data indirect adaptive control system using output (yaw angle) feedback is derived. The control system has a modular structure, which includes a parameter identifier and a stabilizer. For the control law derivation, an internal model of the exosignals (reference signal (constant or ramp) and constant disturbance) is included. Unlike the direct adaptive control scheme, the derived control law is applicable to minimum as well as nonminimum phase biorobotic AUVs (BAUVs). This is important, because for most of the fin locations on the vehicle, the model is a nonminimum phase. In the closed-loop system, the yaw angle trajectory tracking error converges to zero and the remaining state variables remain bounded. Simulation results are presented which show that the derived modular control system accomplishes precise set point yaw angle control and turning maneuvers in spite of the uncertainties in the system parameters using only yaw angle feedback.

AB Robust sampling of animals is necessary for understanding ocean ecology, but evaluating the effectiveness of our samplers is a challenge. Scientific echosounders were added to two robotic platforms carrying video imaging systems: a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The vehicles were used to quantitatively sample midwater life in Monterey Bay along horizontal transects at incremental depths ranging from 25 to 1000 m. The echosounders allowed the bulk behavioral responses of animals to be observed up to 200 m forward of each platform. These responses observed included no response, continual avoidance, avoidance to a fixed range resulting in a patch, and attraction. There were strong and interacting effects of depth and platform type on behavioral responses. Measurements of acoustic backscatter showed that animals responded more strongly to the AUV than the ROV. During AUV surveys, there were effects of day/night and the use of artificial illumination on animal responses. Behavioral responses to our sampling were both species- and context-dependent. These data inspired the expansion of an existing mathematical framework that formalized the processes affecting the sampling of motile ocean organisms. Originally developed for net sampling, we generalized the equations to be platform- and sensor-agnostic and incorporated animal decision-making processes to allow for behaviors consistent with the full range of responses we observed. These results and the framework can help move toward more effective sampling of motile animals in the ocean.

AB The pervasive use of unmanned aerial vehicles for both commercial and military operations has undergone rapid development in the recent past. When designing unmanned aerial vehicles, it is highly desirable for them to be able to complete their missions with minimal human intervention. Reaching full autonomy requires a reliable and efficient control algorithm that can handle all flight conditions. Due to the confidential nature of UAV design and development, there is a lack of comprehensive literature on the subject. When it comes to the practical application of the ideas presented in the literature, the situation is even bleaker. This research not only examines the flight phases in which controllers and estimators are used for UAVs but also provides an in-depth analysis of the most recent and state-of-the-art control and estimate techniques for UAVs. Research opportunities and challenges specific to UAVs were also examined in this study in an effort to raise the bar for UAV design as a whole and smooth the way for researchers to go from simulation-based research to practical applications. This review paper establishes a foundation that not only investigates the inherent flight dynamics, control architecture, and Kalman estimators utilized in the development of UAVs but also points out the shortcomings that currently exist in research. A number of design considerations for realistic applications and potential studies are presented in the conclusion.

AB Whether the public feels psychologically safe about intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) is crucial for this new technology to prevail. While researchers have realized the importance of perceived safety, a direct and psychometrically sound measure is still needed. This paper aimed to develop and validate a scale to measure the perceived safety of ICVs. In Study 1, an 8-item scale of the perceived safety was developed based on a literature review and used with a sample from Beijing (n = 373), among the people who are very likely to be the first wave of users. Exploratory factor analysis retained six items and found that a two-dimensional model (three items for cognitive safety and three items for emotional safety) best suited the data. Correlational analyses suggested that the two components may have unique causes and consequences. In Study 2, using a different sample from Shenzhen (n = 352), confirmatory factor analysis consolidated the two-factor model. Further correlational analyses showed that the scale had good criterion-related validity. Across two studies, cognitive safety was related to perceived controllability, the tendency to seek new technologies, ICV driving experience, perceived government support, drive intention and intention to be other road users. Emotional safety was correlated with social support, familiarity, benefit perception, purchase and recommend intention. These results suggest that the scale developed in this study is a useful and reliable tool to measure perceived safety. Implications for future studies and relevant policies are discussed.

AB In this paper, a high-precision ultra-wideband (UWB) based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) localisation approach is proposed for applications in extremely confined environments. It is motivated by the emerging demand on autonomous inspection in such environments that are hard or impossible for humans to access. Instead of the traditional localisation techniques such as global positioning system (GPS), vision based or other localisation techniques, the UWB based localisation technique is adopted for precise UAV positioning due to its high accuracy, implementation simplicity and suitability in such environments. To avoid the requirement on strict synchronisation between sensor nodes and provide decimetre-level accuracy, the proposed algorithm combined the two-way time-of-flight (TW-TOF) localisation scheme with the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method. This differs from applications in other environments, the number and deployment area of anchor nodes are highly restricted in such environments. Therefore, an in-depth investigation for the anchor deployment strategies is presented to find the most suitable geometry configurations with accurate and robust performance. Finally, extensive simulations, static experiments and flight tests have been conducted to validate the localisation performance under different deployment strategies. The experiments show that average localisation error and standard deviation (STD) under 0.2 m and 0.07 m are obtainable by using our proposed approach under three different geometry configurations of anchor nodes. This is suitable for different applications in extremely confined environments.

AB Unintentional lane departure accidents are one of the biggest reasons for the causalities that occur due to human errors. By incorporating lane-keeping features in vehicles, many accidents can be avoided. The lane-keeping system operates by auto-steering the vehicle in order to keep it within the desired lane, despite of changes in road conditions and other interferences. Accurate steering angle prediction is crucial to keep the vehicle within the road boundaries, which is a challenging task. The main difficulty in this regard is to identify the drivable road area on heterogeneous road types varying in color, texture, illumination conditions, and lane marking types. This strenuous problem can be addressed by two approaches, namely, 'computer-vision-based approach' and 'imitation-learning-based approach'. To the best of our knowledge, at present, there is no such detailed review study covering both the approaches and their related optimization techniques. This comprehensive review attempts to provide a clear picture of both approaches of steering angle prediction in the form of step by step procedures. The taxonomy of steering angle prediction has been presented in the paper for a better comprehension of the problem. We have also discussed open research problems at the end of the paper to help the researchers of this area to discover new research horizons.

AB Simulations and agent-based modelling (ABM) have gained momentum as techniques in the transport, energy, and technology diffusion literature to analyse the mobility transition as a complex emergent phenomenon. This study systematically reviews the application of the ABM paradigm in 86 mobility transition studies. The study reveals several research gaps and proposes avenues for future research. Our review highlights that (i) the field has considerably matured in studying the diffusion of electric vehicles, (ii) both price-based and preference-based scenarios for mobility transition should be considered in future research, (iii) most of the empirical model calibrations have been confined to Western countries. Not only will the literature benefit from similar research in other Western regions, but also from non-Western nations with their unique mobility transition pathways, (iv) the conceptual modelling framework of studies can be divided into the two categories of theory-driven and heuristic models. The theory-driven models, which include psychological and non-psychological (e.g., activitybased travel) models, tend to use well-established behavioural rules, (v) most of the models have used the random utility maximization concept, social psychological models, and other simple assumptions/thresholds for the decision-making process of agents, (vi) half of the studies did not validate their models, and (vii) two-thirds of studies omitted to discuss interaction topology among agents. Major remaining challenges and gaps are identified in the review.

AB The Cask and Plug Remote Handling System (CPRHS) is one of the remote handling systems that will operate in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), transporting heavy and highly activated in-vessel components between the Tokamak Building and the Hot Cell Building, the two main buildings of the nuclear facility. The CPRHS has similar dimensions as an autobus, maximum weight of 100 tons, with kinematics of a rhombic-like vehicle (two drivable and steerable wheels) and has to move in cluttered environments. Two main approaches for trajectory optimization were developed and implemented aiming at providing smooth paths that maximize the clearance to obstacles taking into account the flexibility of rhombic-like vehicles: line guidance (same path for both wheels) and free roaming (different paths for each wheel). The line guidance approach includes maneuvers when necessary and the ability of maximizing the common parts of different paths used in the most of the nominal operations. Free roaming is mainly used when line guidance is not possible, namely in rescue operations. Both approaches were implemented in a standalone application that receives 2D CAD models of the buildings and returns the best trajectories, including a report of the most risky points of collision and the swept volume of the vehicle along the missions. This paper also presents the main results of these approaches applied in the models of the real scenarios, crucial to proceed with the construction of the Tokamak Building. Conclusions and future work are presented and discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based 3-D LiDAR mapping has received increasing interest from both the research community and industrial operations for the 3-D reconstruction of large and dangerous environments. When a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor is rigidly mounted to a UAV, one usually orients it, such that the LiDAR's upward direction coincides with the UAV's flight direction. For a spinning LiDAR, this fully specifies the mounting orientation because of circular symmetry. However, we argue, in this article, that this configuration is suboptimal, especially when the LiDAR's full horizontal field of view is not important, either because of a limited field of view of other sensors in case of sensor fusion or because the scene to (swath) map via LiDAR is less wide than the LiDAR's field of view. Indeed, in this situation, many of the points the LiDAR samples are not of interest. Additionally, in the usual configuration, the UAV's movement can compensate for the limited elevation resolution of the LiDAR, but much less so for the azimuth resolution. For a simplified theoretical model, we introduce a quality metric for mounting angles. Using a simulation, we then derive the optimal mounting angle, which we validate via real world flights. We suggest to rotate this standard mounting orientation over an angle of -84.5 degrees over the UAV's vertical direction.

AB The growing variety and complexity of marine research and application oriented tasks requires unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to operate fully autonomously over long time horizons even in environments with significant civilian traffic. In order to address this challenge, we have developed a lattice-based 5D trajectory planner for USVs. The planner estimates collision risk and reasons about the availability of contingency maneuvers to counteract unpredictable behaviors of civilian vessels. The planner also incorporates avoidance behaviors of the vessels into the search for a dynamically feasible trajectory to minimize collision risk. In order to be computationally efficient, it dynamically scales the control action primitives of a trajectory based on the distribution and concentration of civilian vessels while preserving the dynamical feasibility of the primitives. We present a novel congestion metric to compare the complexity of different scenarios when evaluating the performance of the planner. Our results demonstrate that the basic version of the risk and contingency-aware planner (RCAP) significantly decreases the number of collisions compared to a baseline, velocity obstacles based planner, especially in complex scenarios with a high number of civilian vessels. The adaptive version of the planner (A-RCAP) improves the computational performance of RCAP by 500 %. This leads to a high replanning rate, which allows shorter traversal distances and smaller arrival times, while ensuring comparable incidence of collisions.

AB Challenges related to automated driving are no longer focused on just the construction of such automated vehicles (AVs) but also on assuring the safety of operation. Recent advances in Level 3 and Level 4 autonomous driving have motivated more extensive study in safety guarantees of complicated AV maneuvers, which aligns with the goal of ISO 21448 (Safety of the Intended Functions or SOTIF), i.e., minimizing unsafe scenarios both known and unknown, as well as Vision Zero - eliminating highway fatalities by 2050. A majority of approaches used in providing safety guarantees for AV motion control originate from formal methods, especially reachability analysis (RA), which relies on mathematical models for the dynamic evolution of the system to provide guarantees. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there have been no review papers dedicated to describing and interpreting state-of-the-art of formal methods in the context of AVs. In this work, we provide both an overview of the safety verification, validation, and certification process, as well as a review of formal safety techniques that are best suited to AV applications. We also propose a unified scenario coverage framework that can provide either a formal or sample-based estimate of safety verification for full AVs. Finally, challenges and future opportunities beyond the scope of current published research for assured AV safety are presented.

AB Connected vehicles (CVs), be they autonomous vehicles or a fleet of cargo carriers or Uber, are a matter of when they become a reality and not if. It is not unreasonable to think that CV technology may have a far-reaching impact, even to the genesis of a completely new traffic pattern. To this end, the literature has yet to address the routing behavior of the CVs, namely traffic assignment problem (TAP) (perhaps it is assumed, they ought to follow the traditional shortest possible paths, known as user equilibrium [UE]). It is possible that real-time data could be derived from the vehicles' communications that in turn could be used to achieve a better traffic circulation. In this article, we propose a mathematical formulation to ensure the CVs are seeking the system optimal (SO) principles, while the remainder continue to pursue the old-fashioned UE pattern. The model is formulated as a nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP). This article contributes to the literature in three distinct ways: (i) mathematical formulation for the CVs' routing, stated as a mixed UE-SO traffic pattern, is proposed; (ii) a variety of realistic features are explicitly considered in the solution to the TAP including road capacity, elastic demand, multiclass and asymmetric travel time; and (iii) formal proof of the existence and uniqueness of the solutions are also presented. The proposed methodology is applied to the networks of Sioux-Falls and Melbourne.

AB This paper develops a strategy to coordinate the charging of autonomous plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) using concepts from non-cooperative games. The foundation of the paper is a model that assumes PEVs are cost-minimizing and weakly coupled via a common electricity price. At a Nash equilibrium, each PEV reacts optimally with respect to a commonly observed charging trajectory that is the average of all PEV strategies. This average is given by the solution of a fixed point problem in the limit of infinite population size. The ideal solution minimizes electricity generation costs by scheduling PEV demand to fill the overnight non-PEV demand "valley". The paper's central theoretical result is a proof of the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium that almost satisfies that ideal. This result is accompanied by a decentralized computational algorithm and a proof that the algorithm converges to the Nash equilibrium in the infinite system limit. Several numerical examples are used to illustrate the performance of the solution strategy for finite populations. The examples demonstrate that convergence to the Nash equilibrium occurs very quickly over a broad range of parameters, and suggest this method could be useful in situations where frequent communication with PEVs is not possible. The method is useful in applications where fully centralized control is not possible, but where optimal or near-optimal charging patterns are essential to system operation.

AB As technical realization of highly and fully automated vehicles draws closer, attention is being shifted from sheer feasibility to the question of how an acceptable driving style and thus comfort can be implemented. It is increasingly important to determine, how highly automated vehicles should drive to ensure driving comfort for the now passive drivers. Thus far, only little research has been conducted to examine this issue. In order to lay a basis on how automated vehicles should drive to ensure passenger comfort, different variations of three central maneuvers were rated and analyzed. A simulator study (N = 72) was conducted in order to identify comfortable driving strategies. Three variations of lane changes, accelerations and decelerations were configured by manipulating acceleration and jerk, and thus the course of each maneuver. Furthermore, the influence of personality traits and self-reported driving style on preferences of differently executed automated maneuvers was analyzed. Results suggest keeping acceleration and jerk as small as possible for acceleration maneuvers. For lane changes, both small accelerations as well as an early motion feedback are advisable. Interestingly, decelerating as a manual driver would is rejected compared to two artificial alternatives. Moreover, no influence of personality traits on maneuver preference was found. Only self-reported driving style had a marginal effect on participants' preferences. In conclusion, a recommendation for an automated driving style can be given, which was perceived as comfortable by participants regardless of their personality. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Hybrid aerial underwater vehicles (HAUVs) that are capable of autonomously operating in both the aerial and underwater environments with repeated rapid transitions have received great interest in recent years. Current HAUV prototypes cannot fully cope with the unstructured, harsh, and hazardous ocean environments considering the high-pressure and the strong hydrodynamic perturbations. This work reports on the HAUV, Nezha-IV, with all basic functions validated in a real ocean environment. Nezha-IV has four aerial propellers and eight underwater thrusters. It is not only capable of maneuvering delicately during flight and underwater but can also perform dynamic transitions under rough sea conditions. We present the design, construction, control, and oceanic testing of Nezha-IV and demonstrate reliability and robustness, especially during the transition phases. Performance estimation and results gathered from tests in the South China Sea show that Nezha-IV can operate at various depths ranging from 0 to 50 m at a velocity of 1 kt for 22 min and hover in the air for 15 min or cruise at a velocity of 10 m/s for 7.2 km in 12 min. This project contributes to the field of HAUV with (i) a HAUV capable of dynamic locomotion with high stability in both media and during transitions; (ii) identification of challenges during water-air transition in harsh sea conditions, and a reliable transition strategy that helps the development of fully autonomous HAUVs; (iii) a modular, foldable, and impact-resistant HAUV structure; (iv) vehicle's capability proved by extensive tests in dynamic ocean environment.

AB Purpose To reflect the future traffic environment, the authors simultaneously incorporate the electronic throttle (ET) and traffic jerk into the traditional continuum model. The authors derive the stability criterion of the enhanced continuum model via the perturbation method. Design/methodology/approach To facilitate insight into the propagation and evolution mechanism of traffic jam near the stability condition, the authors use the nonlinear stability analysis method to derive the KdV-Burgers equation of proposed continuum model. Finally, the numerical example verified that the new item of ET opening angle and traffic jerk have a positive impact on suppressing traffic congestion and improving road robustness. Findings The new item of ET opening angle and traffic jerk have a positive impact on suppressing traffic congestion and improving road robustness. Originality/value To better reflect the real traffic environment, a extend continuum model taking into account the ET opening angle and traffic jerk effect is presented. The stability criterion of the extended model is got based on perturbation method. The evolution characteristics and propagation mechanism of the traffic jam near the neutral stability condition are further received by deriving the KdV-Burgers equation in the nonlinear stability analysis. From simulation, we found that the ET opening angle information and traffic jerk have a significant effect on the traffic jam.

AB Previous studies used an adaptive time gap strategy to stabilise the head-to-tail string stability by connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). However, this strategy can bring an adverse effect on traffic throughput. Moreover, at a lower market penetration rate of CAVs, it is also difficult to implement a larger adaptive time gap to dampen the unstable traffic conditions. To this end, this study proposes cooperative control strategies to improve the mixed traffic throughput and stabilise the head-to-tail string stability in an intelligent road system (IRS) environment. The mixed traffic was composed of autonomous vehicles (AVs) with string instability/stability, and CAVs with low penetration. The feasible stable control parameters of AVs and CAVs are computed and implemented into the cooperative control strategies. The results show that the cooperative control strategies have better performances in improving traffic throughput and stabilising the overall head-to-tail string stability. Moreover, analytical solutions and simulation experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies subject to exogenous disturbances. The cooperative control strategies can be potentially applied to alleviate the mixed traffic problems, with the advanced connection and automation technologies in an IRS environment.

TI Robust Outdoor Visual Localization Using a Three-Dimensional-Edge Map
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
ID ODOMETRY; VEHICLE; VISION; SLAM
AB Visual localization systems that are practical for autonomous vehicles in outdoor industrial applications must perform reliably in a wide range of conditions. Changing outdoor conditions cause difficulty by drastically altering the information available in the camera images. To confront the problem, we have developed a visual localization system that uses a surveyed three-dimensional (3D)-edge map of permanent structures in the environment. The map has the invariant properties necessary to achieve long-term robust operation. Previous 3D-edge map localization systems usually maintain a single pose hypothesis, making it difficult to initialize without an accurate prior pose estimate and also making them susceptible to misalignment with unmapped edges detected in the camera image. A multihypothesis particle filter is employed here to perform the initialization procedure with significant uncertainty in the vehicle's initial pose. A novel observation function for the particle filter is developed and evaluated against two existing functions. The new function is shown to further improve the abilities of the particle filter to converge given a very coarse estimate of the vehicle's initial pose. An intelligent exposure control algorithm is also developed that improves the quality of the pertinent information in the image. Results gathered over an entire sunny day and also during rainy weather illustrate that the localization system can operate in a wide range of outdoor conditions. The conclusion is that an invariant map, a robust multihypothesis localization algorithm, and an intelligent exposure control algorithm all combine to enable reliable visual localization through challenging outdoor conditions.

AB Mobility as we know it is rapidly changing. With the move towards autonomous and connected vehicles, the whole automotive industry is undergoing important changes faster than ever. One of the areas largely affected by these changes is the electric/electronics architecture and the in-vehicle network. This is because the number of sensors and actuators required to achieve the new goals has increased notoriously, and the exchange of information between them needs to happen in a deterministic, safe and reliable way. One of the central pieces of the new concept for vehicular networks is the gateway controller, since it is the one in charge of the exchange of information between the different elements of the network. In this work, we analyze the implications of the changes in the vehicular network architecture from the perspective of applications processing. This analysis shows the rationale behind the integration of new technologies that are required in future gateway controllers. Then, we evaluate the novel Elastic Gateway (eGW) System on Chip (SoC) as a high performance network processor that enables the integration of the wide variety of technologies required, supporting future vehicular networks. We also present the framework used to emulate the vehicular network as well as the methodology used for the deployment and validation of the Proof of Concept (PoC) for the different use cases. Finally, we demonstrate through experimental results how our PoC for eGW is able to meet the requirements of future network processing devices.

ID ALGORITHM
AB The overall safety of a building can be effectively evaluated through regular inspection of the indoor walls by unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). However, when the UGV performs line patrol inspections according to the specified path, it is easy to be affected by obstacles. This paper presents an obstacle avoidance strategy for unmanned ground vehicles in indoor environments. The proposed method is based on monocular vision. Through the obtained environmental information in front of the unmanned vehicle, the obstacle orientation is determined, and the moving direction and speed of the mobile robot are determined based on the neural network output and confidence. This paper also innovatively adopts the method of collecting indoor environment images based on camera array and realizes the automatic classification of data sets by arranging cameras with different directions and focal lengths. In the training of a transfer neural network, aiming at the problem that it is difficult to set the learning rate factor of the new layer, the improved bat algorithm is used to find the optimal learning rate factor on a small sample data set. The simulation results show that the accuracy can reach 94.84%. Single-frame evaluation and continuous obstacle avoidance evaluation are used to verify the effectiveness of the obstacle avoidance algorithm. The experimental results show that an unmanned wheeled robot with a bionic transfer-convolution neural network as the control command output can realize autonomous obstacle avoidance in complex indoor scenes.

AB To reduce the impact of offshore launching platform motion and swaying on the self-alignment accuracy of a launch vehicle, a rapid self-alignment strategy, which involves an optimal combination of anti-swaying coarse alignment (ASCA), backtracking navigation, and reverse Kalman filtering is proposed. During the entire alignment process, the data provided by the strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) are stored and then applied to forward and backtrack self-alignment. This work elaborates the basic principles of coarse alignment and then analyzes the influence of ASCA time on alignment accuracy. An error model was built for the reverse fine alignment system. The coarse alignment was carried out based on the above work, then the state of the alignment system was retraced using the reverse inertial navigation solution and reverse Kalman filtering with the proposed strategy. A cycle-index control function was designed to approximate strict backtracking navigation. Finally, the attitude error was compensated for after the completion of the first and the last forward navigation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, numerical simulations were carried out in a scenario of launch vehicle motion and swaying. The proposed strategy can maximize the utilization of SINS data and hence improve the alignment accuracy and further reduce the alignment time. The results show that the fully autonomous alignment technology of the SINS can replace the complex optical aiming system and realize the determination of the initial attitude of a launch vehicle before launch.

AB Active pedestrian collision avoidance (APCA) systems can significantly reduce road injuries and thus have attracted considerable attention from both the automobile and the transportation industries. Numerous studies have focused on APCA; however, it remains challenging to model variable and complex scenarios in a safe, efficient and low-cost way. For this purpose, this paper proposes a novel multipedestrian collision risk assessment framework comprising a motion prediction module, a collision checking module and a collision risk assessment module. First, the motion of the ego vehicle (EV) is predicted through a constant-acceleration (V-CA) model and a constant-turn-rate and constant-velocity (V-CTRV) model in different scenarios. Next, the pedestrian motion is estimated using Kalman filter (KF) approaches based on a constant-velocity (PCV) model and a constant-acceleration (P-CA) model. Then, the potential collision area (PCA) is defined according to the predicted motions of the EV and pedestrian, and the time-to collision (TTC) is selected to conduct collision checking. Finally, the most dangerous pedestrian is identified as the target with the minimum TTC in a multipedestrian scenario, and field tests are conducted on an autonomous vehicle platform. Comparative simulations indicate that the P-CA-based KF is more accurate and robust in variable-velocity scenarios than the P-CV-based KF. Furthermore, multipedestrian scenario simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

AB One of the indispensable functions of a self-driving vehicle is to estimate its dynamic world, which includes various traffic participants within complex driving scenarios. The estimation mechanism has to be flexible, fast, and robust; however, achieving these requirements is still challenging. Dynamic grid maps are one of the possible ways to combine and estimate multisensory information at an intermediate level. In this article, we present a particle filter (PF)-based grid map estimation that addresses several challenges. First, we propose a multilayer PF-based tracking solution that uses two measurement grid channels as inputs: an occupancy grid and a semantic grid. Second, we introduce the concept of structuring the particle population into batches, where each batch represents an individual tracklet. Rather than using one PF for estimating the entire grid, we employ multiple individual PFs (tracklets) that share the same world. Third, a concept of "self-localizing" tracklets is presented. Similar to simultaneous localization and mapping approaches, in our tracking solution, every particle state is extended with a small set of landmarks. This allows a tracklet to "selflocalize" itself with respect to a tracked-object boundary and leads to a more precise velocity estimation. Finally, we introduce an advanced tracklet-management mechanism that allows executing some specific PF operations at the tracklet level. This optimization provides multiple advantages. Experimental results with ground-truth data show improvement in estimation accuracy when compared to similar techniques.

AB Smart cities are ecosystems where novel ideas and emerging technologies meet to improve economy, environment, governance, living, and mobility. One of the pillars of smart cities is transport, with the improvement of mobility and the reduction of traffic accidents being some of the current key challenges. With this purpose, this manuscript reviews the state-of-the-art of communications and applications in which different actors of the road are involved. Thus, the objectives of this survey are intended to determine who, when, and about what is being researched around smart cities. Particularly, the goal is to situate the focus of scientific and industrial progress on V2X, I2X, and P2X communication to establish a taxonomy that reduces ambiguous acronyms around the communication between vehicles, infrastructure, and pedestrians, as well as to determine what the trends and future technologies are that will lead to more powerful applications. To this end, this literature review article presents a comprehensive study including a representative collection of the 100 most cited papers and patents published in the literature together with a statistical bibliometric analysis of 14,364 keywords over 3422 contributions between 1997 and 2018. As a result, this work provides a technological profile considering different dimensions along the paper, such as the type of communication, use case, country, organization, terminology, and year.

AB Numerous studies have emerged on the external human-machine interface (eHMI) to facilitate the communication between automated vehicles (AVs) and other road users. However, it remains to be determined which eHMI modality and location are proper for the pedestrian-AV interaction. Therefore, a video-based, eye-tracking study was performed to investigate how pedestrians responded to AVs with eHMIs in different modalities (flashing text, smiley, light band, sweeping pedestrian icon, arrow, and light bar) and locations (grill, windshield, and roof). Moreover, the effects of pedestrian-related factors (e.g., gender, sensation-seeking level, and traffic accident involvement) were also included and evaluated. The dependent variables included pedestrians' clarity-rating scores towards these eHMI concepts, road-crossing decision time, and gaze-based metrics (e.g., fixation counts, dwell time, and first fixation duration). The results showed that the text, icon, and arrow-based eHMIs resulted in the shortest decision time, highest clarity scores, and centralized visual attention. The light strip-based eHMIs yielded no significant decrease in decision time yet longer fixation time, indicating difficulties in comprehension of their meaning without learning. The eHMI location had no effect on pedestrians' decision time but a substantial influence on their visual searching strategy, with a roof eHMI contradicting pedestrians' inherent scanning pattern. These findings provide implications for the standardized design of future eHMIs.

AB With the expected increase in the availability of trajectory-level information from connected and autonomous vehicles, issues of lane changing behavior that were difficult to assess with traditional freeway detection systems can now begin to be addressed. This study presents the development and application of a lane change detection algorithm that uses trajectory data from a low-cost GPS-equipped fleet, supplemented with digitized lane markings. The proposed algorithm minimizes the effect of GPS errors by constraining the temporal duration and lateral displacement of a lane change detected using preliminary lane positioning. The algorithm was applied to 637 naturalistic trajectories traversing a long weaving segment and validated through a series of controlled lane change experiments. Analysis of naturalistic trajectory data revealed that ramp-to-freeway trips had the highest number of discretionary lane changes in excess of 1 lane change/vehicle. Overall, excessive lane change rates were highest between the two middle freeway lanes at 0.86 lane changes/vehicle. These results indicate that extreme lane changing behavior may significantly contribute to the peak-hour congestion at the site. The average lateral speed during lane change was 2.7 fps, consistent with the literature, with several freeway-freeway and ramp-ramp trajectories showing speeds up to 7.7 fps. All ramp-to-freeway vehicles executed their first mandatory lane change within 62.5% of the total weaving length, although other weaving lane changes were spread over the entire segment. These findings can be useful for implementing strategies to lessen abrupt and excessive lane changes through better lane pre-positioning.

AB In contrast to the traditional pneumatic braking system, the electronic-controlled pneumatic braking system of commercial vehicles is a new system and can remedy the defects of the conventional braking system, such as long response time and low control accuracy. Additionally, it can adapt to the needs and development of autonomous driving. As the key pressure regulating component in electronic-controlled pneumatic braking system of commercial vehicles, automatic pressure regulating valves can quickly and accurately control the braking pressure in real time through an electronic control method. By aiming at improving driving comfort on the premise of ensuring braking security, this paper took the automatic pressure regulating valve as the research object and studied the pressure change rate during the braking process. First, the characteristics of the automatic pressure regulating valve and the concept of the pressure change rate were elaborated. Then, with the volume change of automatic pressure regulating valve in consideration, the mathematical model based on gas dynamics and the association model between pressure change rate and vehicle dynamic model was established in MATLAB/Simulink and analyzed. Next, through the experimental test of a sample product, the mathematical models have been verified. Finally, the key structure parameters affecting the pressure change rate of the automatic pressure regulating valve and the influence law have been identified; therefore, appropriate design advice and theoretical support have been provided to improve driving comfort.

AB Deploying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as mobile edge computing (MEC) servers has been attracting significant attention, since the UAVs' inherent maneuverability and mobility can further reduce the distance between the users and computational functionalities. In the UAV-assisted MEC systems, the caching and offloading decision optimization, subject to the computation and energy constraints of the UAVs, is one of the key design issues. Against this backdrop, in this paper, we propose a novel cloud-edge framework to facilitate MEC in the UAV networks. Specifically, in our framework, the edge UAVs (EUAVs), together with the cloud, provide caching and computing services for the terrestrial users. In order to minimize the weighted sum cost of latency and energy consumption, we jointly optimize the caching and offloading decisions, the EUAV deployment, the radio and computation resource allocation, while simultaneously satisfying the UAVs' cache and computation capacity constraints, as well as the users' latency and energy consumption constraints. To solve this NP-hard problem, we propose a sequential convex programming (SCP) and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) based deep Q-learning (SS-DQN) algorithm. The proposed algorithm allows the system to adaptively adjust caching and offloading decisions with the EUAV deployment scheme and the resource allocation scheme obtained by SCP and SQP algorithms, respectively. Simulation results verify the superiority of our proposed algorithm compared to two benchmark schemes, and demonstrate how the combination of DRL and convex optimization can improve the system performance significantly.

AB The development of autonomous driving poses significant demands on computing resource, which is challenging to resource-constrained vehicles. To alleviate the issue, Vehicular edge computing (VEC) has been developed to offload real-time computation tasks from vehicles. However, with multiple vehicles contending for the communication and computation resources at the same time for different applications, how to efficiently schedule the edge resources toward maximal system welfare represents a fundamental issue in VEC. This article aims to provide a detailed analysis on the delay and cost of computation offloading for VEC and minimize the delay and cost from the perspective of multi-objective optimization. Specifically, we first establish an offloading framework with communication and computation for VEC, where computation tasks with different requirements for computation capability are considered. To pursue a comprehensive performance improvement during computation offloading, we then formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize both the delay and cost by jointly considering the offloading decision, allocation of communication and computation resources. By applying the game theoretic analysis, we propose a particle swarm optimization based computation offloading (PSOCO) algorithm to obtain the Pareto-optimal solutions to the multi-objective optimization problem. Extensive simulation results verify that our proposed PSOCO outperforms counterparts. Based on the results, we also present a comprehensive analysis and discussion on the relationship between delay and cost among the Pareto-optimal solutions.

AB With the advent of future vehicles, passengers expect to travel in comfort, and the free leg space between facingseats could be an issue due to the unsuitability for all people, according to their anthropometric variability. A previous investigation survey showed the need to increase the leg-space between facing seats and, if installed, to improve the surface of the table placed in between. So, four different distances between seat-pans front edges of facing seats have been set-up and tested (44 cm, 51 cm, 58 cm, 65 cm) with a table in between. 13 couples of participants with different heights took part to experiments. The aim was to investigate the relationship between facing-seat distances and passenger wellbeing in terms of postural comfort and social interaction. Postural comfort has been analysed through optical tracking (for postural angles overtime) and questionnaires (perceived comfort). Social interaction feelings have been investigated with questionnaires. Experiment results showed the suitable distance could be 51 cm keeping the same table surface; otherwise, the 65 cm one could be ideal changing the table surface.
   Relevance to industry: With the advent of autonomous driving, vehicle manufacturers and designers are working hard to define new paradigms of public transportation in terms of seat layout, passenger wellbeing and interiors' design. This paper contributes to increasing the general knowledge on the effects of distance between facing seats on postural comfort and social interaction.

AB This study evaluated whole body vibration (WBV), non-driving task performance, muscle activity, and self-reported discomfort and motion sickness between different seat suspension systems in a simulated vehicle environment. In a repeated-measures laboratory experiment where field-measured 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) passenger vehicle vibration was replicated on a 6-DOF motion platform, we measured WBV, non-driving task (pointing, typing, web-browsing, and reading) performance, low back (erector spinae), shoulders (trapezius) and neck (splenius capitis and sternocleido-mastoid) muscle activity, and self-reported discomfort and motion sick-ness from three different seats: a vertical (z-axis) active suspension, multi-axial active suspension [vertical (z -axis) + lateral (y-axis)], and a static suspension-less seat (current seat type in all passenger cars). Both the vertical and multi-axial active suspension seats significantly reduced the vertical WBV exposure (p 0.0001). However, no significant differences were found in non-driving task performance (p 0.30), muscle activity (p > 0.22), self-reported discomfort (p > 0.07), and motion sickness (p = 0.53) across three different seats. These findings indicate that the active suspension seats may have potential to future reduce the vertical and total WBV exposures, respectively. However, none of the suspension seats demonstrate any significant benefits on the non-driving task performance, muscle activity, self-reported discomfort and motion sickness measures in a simulated vehicle environment.

TI Marine heterogeneous multirobot systems at the great Eastern Japan
   Tsunami recovery
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB This field report describes two deployments of heterogeneous unmanned marine vehicle teams at the 2011 Great Eastern Japan Earthquake response and recovery by the Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue (USA) in collaboration with the International Rescue System Institute (Japan). Four remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) were fielded in Minamisanriku and Rikuzentakata from April 18 to 24, 2011, for port clearing and victim recovery missions using sonar and video. The ROVs were used for multirobot operations only 46% of the time due to logistics. The teleoperated ROVs functioned as a dependent team 86% of the time to avoid sensor interference or collisions. The deployment successfully reopened the Minamisanriku New Port area and searched areas prohibited to divers in Rikuzentakata. The IRS-CRASAR team planned to return from October 18 to 28, 2011, with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), and an ROV to conduct debris mapping for environmental remediation missions. The intent was to investigate an interdependent strategy by which the UAV and AUV would rapidly conduct low-resolution scans identifying areas of interest for further investigation by the ROV. The UAV and AUV could not be used; however, the ROV was able to cover 80,000 m2 in 6 h, finding submerged wreckage and pollutants in areas previously marked clear by divers. The field work (i) showed that the actual and planned multirobot system configurations did not fall neatly into traditional taxonomies, (ii) identified a new measure, namely perceptual confidence, and (iii) posed five open research questions for multirobot systems operating in littoral regions.

TI Autonomous safety and reliability features of the K-1 avionics system
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB Kistler Aerospace Corporation is developing the K-1, a fully reusable, two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle. Both stages return to the launch site using parachutes and airbags. Initial flight operations will occur from Woomera, Australia. K-I guidance is performed autonomously. Each stage of the K-I employs a triplex, fault tolerant avionics architecture, including three fault tolerant computers and three radiation hardened Embedded GPS/INS units with a hardware voter. The K-1 has an Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) system on each stage residing in the three vehicle computers based on similar systems in commercial aircraft. During first-stage ascent, the IVHM system performs an Instantaneous Impact Prediction (IIP) calculation 25 times per second, initiating an abort in the event the vehicle is outside a predetermined safety corridor for at least 3 consecutive calculations. In this event, commands are issued to terminate thrust, separate the stages, dump all propellant in the first-stage, and initiate a normal landing sequence. The second-stage flight computer calculates its ability to reach orbit along its state vector, initiating an abort sequence similar to the first stage if it cannot. On a nominal mission, following separation, the second-stage also performs calculations to assure its impact point is within a safety corridor.
   The K-1's guidance and control design is being tested through simulation with hardware-in-the-loop at Draper Laboratory. Kistler's verification strategy assures reliable and safe operation of the K-1. (C) 2003 Kistler Aerospace Corporation. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications are an integral part of the realization of autonomous and connected vehicles. Due to the large amount of data generated by the vehicles, the stringent delay requirements, and the sheer size of V2X applications, these applications are decomposed into several components that need to be placed in close proximity to requesting vehicles. Mobile-edge Computing (MEC) has been envisioned as a promising solution for vehicular task offloading. Despite the desirable properties of MEC, which can potentially satisfy the delay requirements, edge servers have limited computational capability and have a high cost. They also have availability concerns that should be taken into account. In this regard, Application Service Providers (ASPs) strive for a solution that can both satisfy the delay requirements of V2X applications and cut their expenses, which is reflected by the utilization of edge resources. To that end, this work formulates a Binary Linear Program (BLP) that minimizes the ratio of the experienced to the tolerable delay threshold and the utilization of edge resources under resource and V2X applications' availability constraints. To investigate the trade-off between these two objectives, they are parametrized by a coefficient that reflects their relative priorities. Additionally, the delay and the resource objectives are studied in light of different V2X applications' availability constraints. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach. On average, the delays of all V2X applications are satisfied with an acceptable level of edge server utilization.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Intelligent traffic monitoring provides information support for autonomous driving, which is widely used in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). A method for estimating vehicle moving target parameters based on millimeter-wave radars is proposed to solve the problem of low detection accuracy due to velocity ambiguity and Doppler-angle coupling in the process of traffic monitoring. First of all, a MIMO antenna array with overlapping elements is constructed by introducing them into the typical design of MIMO radar array antennas. The motion-induced phase errors are eliminated by the phase difference among the overlapping elements. Then, the position errors among them are corrected through an iterative method, and the angle of multiple targets is estimated. Finally, velocity dis-ambiguation is performed by adopting the error-corrected phase difference among the overlapping elements. An accurate estimation of vehicle mov-ing target angle and velocity is achieved. Through Monte Carlo simulation experiments, the angle error is 0.1 and the velocity error is 0.1 m/s. The simulation results show that the method can be used to effectively solve the problems related to velocity ambiguity and Doppler-angle coupling, mean-while the accuracy of velocity and angle estimation can be improved. An improved algorithm is tested on the vehicle datasets that are gathered in the forward direction of ordinary public scenes of a city. The experimental re-sults further verify the feasibility of the method, which meets the real-time and accuracy requirements of ITSs on vehicle information monitoring.

AB Safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF) of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is very challenging due to heterogeneous performance limitations and complex uncertainties in real road environments. In this paper, a cooperative robust non-fragile fault tolerant control (CRNFTC) strategy is presented to reduce the risks caused by multi-vehicle performance limitations of perception and actuation systems for ensuring SOTIF of cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC). First, an intermediate based cooperative robust estimation method is proposed, by combining ego and cooperative information, system states, matched disturbances, performance limitations of perception and actuation of the vehicles in the platoon are simultaneously esti-mated. Existence conditions of estimators are given with respect to predecessor following (PF) and bi-directional (BD) communication network topologies. Then, based on the estimation, a distributed robust non-fragile fault tolerant H infinity control method is proposed, such that compen-sation of the effects of heterogeneous performance limitations and matched disturbances, and suppression of the remaining unmatched disturbances can be achieved. The sufficient condition and optimal solution of the proposed CRNFTC are obtained by using Lyapunov theory with explicit consideration of the system uncertainty and controller perturbation. The efficacy and superiority of the proposed CRNFTC for ensuring SOTIF of the CACC of PF and BD communication network topologies with complex uncertainties are substantiated via a series of simulations and quantitative comparisons.

AB This paper explores deep learning (DL) methods that are used or have the potential to be used for traffic video analysis, emphasising driving safety for both autonomous vehicles and human-operated vehicles. A typical processing pipeline is presented, which can be used to understand and interpret traffic videos by extracting operational safety metrics and providing general hints and guidelines to improve traffic safety. This processing framework includes several steps, including video enhancement, video stabilisation, semantic and incident segmentation, object detection and classification, trajectory extraction, speed estimation, event analysis, modelling, and anomaly detection. The main goal is to guide traffic analysts to develop their own custom-built processing frameworks by selecting the best choices for each step and offering new designs for the lacking modules by providing a comparative analysis of the most successful conventional and DL-based algorithms proposed for each step. Existing open-source tools and public datasets that can help train DL models are also reviewed. To be more specific, exemplary traffic problems are reviewed and required steps are mentioned for each problem. Besides, connections to the closely related research areas of drivers' cognition evaluation, crowd-sourcing-based monitoring systems, edge computing in roadside infrastructures, automated driving systems-equipped vehicles are investigated, and the missing gaps are highlighted. Finally, commercial implementations of traffic monitoring systems, their future outlook, and open problems and remaining challenges for widespread use of such systems are reviewed.

AB Miniature aerial vehicles (MAVs) are finding applications in a number of civilian domains in which their autonomous operations are desirable. Applications of miniature aerial vehicles in different areas are growing exponentially due to technological advancement in areas such as computing, sensing, and communication, and due to advantages offered by these vehicles in terms of safe and economic operations. Due to the drive to keep cost of MAVs low, or lack of available technology and accurate sensors, exact measurement of pertinent signals and states of these kinds of nonlinear systems is not always possible. This necessitates the development of algorithmic tools such as observers that can be used to enhance the performance of sensors and measurement devices. The more complex a control system becomes, the more difficult it becomes to measure the states of the system accurately, which inherently makes the development of observers more challenging. In this paper, state observer and control system design for a small coaxial helicopter are presented. The states are observed with three different methods and compared for designing a classical pole-placement controller (based on a linearized model of the plant) and applied to a coaxial helicopter. The observer design methods used in this paper are based on Kalman filter and full-and reduced-order Luenberger observers. Numerical simulations have been carried out to illustrate the proposed techniques. Comparison of the three proposed methods confirms the intuitive notion that, in case of noisy systems, using Kalman filter method yields more accurate results as compared with the Luenberger methods.

AB Drivers of commercial vehicles are invariably subject to chronic diseases such as back pain as a result of exposure to severe cabin excitations. In this paper, a six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) coupled human-body and seat suspension system is modeled in order to reduce the vibrations transmitted to the head, seat, and the relative seat and cabin floor displacement. The contributions of the present paper are: 1) two significant but inherently conflicting control objectives are employed, namely the seat acceleration and the relative displacement between seat and cabin floor to account for the effect of seat endstops, 2) A novel learning rate gradient descent based neural network approximator algorithm coupled to an adaptive indirect type-2 fuzzy neural network (T2FNN) controller to converge the controller to the ideal parameters of the uncertain model. 3) The controller model takes into account the seat suspension nonlinearities due to the nonlinear asymmetric piecewise damper and the cubic hardening of the suspension spring. The proposed controller employs the principle of type-2 fuzzy systems with interval membership function and unknown specifications. The effectiveness of the closed-loop system is validated regarding the uncertainties compared to observer-based sliding mode controller (SMC) and a high-fidelity virtual lab MSC.ADAMS-Simulink platform to validate the results in practical scenarios.

AB Flight control of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) requires reliable measurements of UAV's position and attitude. Optical flow sensor is able to detect UAV's motion with respect to the ground, and thus, it can be incorporated in the integrated navigation system to enhance the positioning accuracy. However, the commonly used measurement model of optical flow sensor is actually fit for continuous-time condition only, since it defines the optical flow as the instantaneous velocity of a pixel on the image plane. For commercial optical flow sensors that work under discrete-time condition, a novel measurement model is proposed in this article, which gives a vectorized symmetrical description of the optical flow measurement between every two successive frames in the image sequence. Moreover, a cubature transform-based data fusion scheme is also presented in this article, which can directly augment the UAV's position estimation with optical flow data rather than extracting UAV's velocity information from optical flow for dead-reckoning, and hence, it can be easily added to the UAV's navigation system without changing the existing algorithm flow. Flight tests are conducted using a quadcopter UAV that equipped with PIXHAWK autopilot and PX4Flow optical flow sensor, and the test results prove that the proposed optical flow model and data fusion scheme can effectively improve the accuracy of UAV position estimation in various outdoor environments.

AB The local path planning, as one of the navigation stages, plays a significant role in the energy consumption of Self-Guided Vehicles (SGV). Since SGV must operate for several hours on a single battery charge to transport loads, its energy consumption is a critical issue. Therefore, this article puts forward an approach for boosting the energy efficiency of the local path planning stage using load position. Unlike other similar works which solely use robots' kinematic and kinetic constraints to develop energy-efficient local path planners, this article considers the effect of load position on SGV's dynamic. In this regard, first, the kinetic model of the differential drive SGV is developed to consider the change of SGV's Center of Mass (CoM) affected by load properties. Second, machine learning methods are used to create two learning models for online estimation of the position of CoM (PoCoM) and prediction of required energy of sample trajectories. Hence, the generated SGV's kinetic model is used to train the learning models. Finally, estimated parameters are employed to add a new constraint to extend the cost function of the local path planner. The outcomes of the study show that the proposed planner generates smoother and shorter paths to pass obstacles and corridors than a general one. Thus, SGV's energy consumption decreases by considering the load effect.

AB This article addresses the distributed path maneuvering of underactuated unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) with collision avoidance and connectivity preservation. The USVs are guided by the multiple virtual leaders moving along the multiple parameterized paths and only a fraction of USVs have access to the virtual leaders. An observer-based finite-time control method is proposed to achieve a containment formation. Specifically, a finite-time extended state observer is employed to recover the unmeasured linear/angular velocities and estimate the total disturbances consisting of model uncertainties as well as ocean disturbances at first. Then, observer-based finite-time guidance laws using the information of neighbors are designed based on a containment scheme. An artificial potential field is incorporated into the distributed guidance law design to avoid collision and preserve connectivity. Finally, antidisturbance kinetic control laws are devised based on the finite-time convergent observers and nonlinear tracking differentiators. It is proven that all error signals in the closed-loop system are ultimately uniformly bounded, and the distributed path maneuvering formation pattern can be achieved in a finite time when USVs outside the collision avoidance and connectivity preservation region. Simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed output feedback control method for the distributed path maneuvering of multiple USVs with position-yaw measurements only.

AB Objective: The aim of this paper was to synthesize the experimental research on factors that affect takeover performance during conditionally automated driving.
   Background: For conditionally automated driving, the automated driving system (ADS) can handle the entire dynamic driving task but only for limited domains. When the system reaches a limit, the driver is responsible for taking over vehicle control, which may be affected by how much time they are provided to take over, what they were doing prior to the takeover, or the type of information provided to them during the takeover.
   Method: Out of 8446 articles identified by a systematic literature search, 48 articles containing 51 experiments were included in the meta-analysis. Coded independent variables were time budget, non-driving related task engagement and resource demands, and information support during the takeover. Coded dependent variables were takeover timing and quality measures.
   Results: Engaging in non-driving related tasks results in degraded takeover performance, particularly if it has overlapping resource demands with the driving task. Weak evidence suggests takeover performance is impaired with shorter time budgets. Current implementations of information support did not affect takeover performance.
   Conclusion: Future research and implementation should focus on providing the driver more time to take over while automation is active and should further explore information support.
   Application: The results of the current paper indicate the need for the development and deployment of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) services and driver monitoring.

AB Introduction: In conditionally automated driving, drivers are allowed to engage in non-driving related tasks (NDRTs) and are occasionally requested to take over vehicle control in situations that the automation system cannot handle. Drivers may not be able to adequately perform such requests if they have limited driving experience. This study investigates the influence of driving experience on takeover performance in conditionally automated driving. Method: Nineteen subjects participated in this driving simulator study. The NDRTs consisted of three tasks: writing business emails (working condition), watching videos (entertaining condition), and taking a break with eyes closed (resting condition). These three NDRTs require drivers to invest high, moderate, and low levels of mental workload, respectively. The duration of engagement in each NDRT before a takeover request (TOR) was either 5 minutes (short interval) or 30 minutes (long interval). Results: Drivers' driving experience and performance during the control period are highly correlated with their TOR performance. Furthermore, the type and duration of NDRT influence TOR performance, and inexperienced drivers exhibit poorer TOR performance than experienced drivers. Conclusions and Practical Applications: These findings have relevance for the types of NDRTs that ought to be permitted during automated driving, the design of automated driving systems, and the formulation of regulations regarding the responsible use of automated vehicles.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB With development of emerging intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UVAs) are gaining growing attention to achieve UAV-assisted VANETs for improving performance of data dissemination. However, in UAV-assisted VANETs, the performance of data dissemination can be significantly compromised by the limited bandwidth resource of UAVs. In this paper, we propose a scheduling strategy to provide efficient data dissemination. In particular, first, we take into account a scenario with either unavailable or overloaded infrastructure, where a UAV is employed to provide data dissemination. Furthermore, considering the limited bandwidth resource of the UAV, we formulate a coding-based cooperative caching data dissemination (C3D2) problem which makes use of the cooperative effect between network coding and vehicular caching with the objective of maximizing the bandwidth efficiency of UAVs. Meanwhile, the NP-hardness of the C3D2 problem is proved by constructing a polynomial time reduction from the simultaneous matrix completion problem. Based on the effectiveness of the binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) framework in solving the complex problems, we propose a BPSO-based cooperative caching scheduling (BPSO_C2S) algorithm consisting of a series of strategies, such as particle representation, particle evaluation, particle update and infeasible solution amendment. In addition, we analyze the computational complexity of the BPSO_C2S. Finally, we build the simulation model and give a comprehensive performance evaluation through the real-world map and taxi trajectories. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed solution.

AB The accurate and rapid detection of buildings in rural areas is crucial in preventing illegal construction. The detection of newly constructed buildings can considerably reduce the cost associated with illegal construction management. However, because the number of newly constructed buildings is limited, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images cannot be obtained from identical viewpoints and heights, inducing differences in the appearance and size of buildings. Thus, the detection of newly constructed buildings using multiform UAV images is the focus of this study. Herein, a multiscale fusion network is proposed to address the challenges associated with the diversity of UAV images and the limited number of newly constructed buildings. First, an adaptive weight channel attention network is used to optimize the building features obtained from UAV images. Then, the multiscale spatial pyramid network is used to realize feature fusion. Thereafter, a new dataset is created that includes 1590 images of various objects with high-quality annotation and a resolution of 1000 x 1000. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves an average detection speed of 23.18 frames per second, an accuracy of 72.8% for newly constructed buildings, an accuracy of 88.3% for completely constructed buildings, and an average precision of 80.6%. The accuracy of the proposed approach outperforms those of the baseline (increases of 40.9%, 2.1%, and 21.5%).

AB This paper presents a hierarchical framework with novel analytical and neural physics-driven models, to enable the online planning and tracking of minimum-time maneuvers, for a vehicle with partially-unknown parameters. We introduce a lateral speed prediction model for high-level motion planning with economic nonlinear model predictive control (E-NMPC). A low-level steering controller is developed with a novel feedforward-feedback physics-driven artificial neural network (NN). A longitudinal dynamic model is identified to tune a low-level speed-tracking controller. The high- and low-level control models are identified with an automatic three-step scheme, combining open-loop and closed-loop maneuvers to model the maximum acceleration G-G-v performance constraint for E-NMPC, and to capture the effect of the longitudinal acceleration on the lateral dynamics. The proposed framework is used in a simulation environment, for the online closed-loop control of a highly detailed sedan vehicle simulator, whose parameters are partially-unknown. Two different circuits are adopted to validate the approach, and a robustness analysis is performed by varying the vehicle mass and the load distribution. A minimum-time optimal control problem is solved offline and used for a comparison with the closed-loop results. A video demonstrating both the automatic three-step identification scheme and the motion planning and control results is available at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ_T96IjGP8.

AB In vehicular <italic>ad hoc</italic> networks, autonomous vehicles generate a large amount of data prior to support in-vehicle applications. So, big storage and high computation platform are needed. On the other hand, the computation for vehicular networks at the cloud platform requires low latency. Applying edge computation (EC) as a new computing paradigm has potentials to provide computation services while reducing the latency and improving the total utility. We propose a three-tier EC framework to set the elastic calculating processing capacity and dynamic route calculation to suitable edge servers for real-time vehicle monitoring. This framework includes the cloud computation layer, EC layer, and device layer. The formulation of the resource allocation approach is similar to an optimization problem. We design a new reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to deal with the resource allocation problem assisted by cloud computation. By integration of EC and software-defined networking (SDN), this study provides a new SDN edge (SDNE) framework for resource assignment in vehicular networks. The novelty of this work is to design a multiagent RL-based approach using experience reply. The proposed algorithm stores the users communication information and the network tracks state in real time. The results of simulation with various system factors are presented to display the efficiency of the suggested framework. We present results with a real-world case study.

AB Despite the rapid advances in autonomous guidance and navigation techniques for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems, there are still many challenges in finding an optimal path planning algorithm that allows outlining a collision-free navigation route from the vehicle's current position to a goal point. The challenges grow as the number of UAVs involved in the mission increases. Therefore, this work provides a comprehensive systematic review of the literature on the path planning algorithms for multi-UAV systems. In particular, the review focuses on biologically inspired (bio-inspired) algorithms due to their potential in overcoming the challenges associated with multi-UAV path planning problems. It presents a taxonomy for classifying existing algorithms and describes their evolution in the literature. The work offers a structured and accessible presentation of bio-inspired path planning algorithms for researchers in this subject, especially as no previous review exists with a similar scope. This classification is significant as it facilitates studying bio-inspired multi-UAV path planning algorithms under one framework, shows the main design features of the algorithms clearly to assist in a detailed comparison between them, understanding current research trends, and anticipating future directions. Our review showed that bio-inspired algorithms have a high potential to approach the multi-UAV path planning problem and identified challenges and future research directions that could help improve this dynamic research area.

AB Due to their flexibility and low cost deployment, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) will most likely act as base stations and backhaul relays in the next generation of wireless communication systems. However, these UAVs-in the untethered mode-can only operate for a finite time due to limited energy they carry in their batteries. In free-space optical communications, one solution is to transport both data and energy from the source to the UAV through the laser beam-a concept known as simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer (SLIPT). In this study, we have analyzed the SLIPT scheme for laser-powered decode-and-forward UAV relays in an optical wireless backhaul. The major goal of this study is to optimally allocate the received beam energy between the decoding circuit, the transmitting circuit and the rotor block of the relay in order to maximize a quality-of-service metric such as maximum achievable rate, outage or error probabilities. As expected, we note that the optimal power allocation depends heavily on the source-relay and relay-destination channel conditions. In the final part of this study, we have maximized the operational time of the UAV relay given that the maximum achievable rate stays above a certain threshold in order to meet a minimum quality-of-service requirement.

AB Aithough extensive research in emergency collision avoidance has been carried out for straight or curved roads in a highway scenario, a general method that could be implemented for all road environments has not been thoroughly explored. Moreover, most current algorithms don't consider collision mitigation in an emergency. This functionality is essential since the problem may have no feasible solution. We propose a safe controller using model predictive control and artificial potential function to address these problems. A new artificial potential function inspired by line charge is proposed as the cost function for our model predictive controller. The vehicle dynamics and actuator limitations are set as constraints. The new artificial potential function considers the shape of all objects. In particular, the artificial potential function we proposed has the flexibility to fit the shape of the road structures, such as the intersection. We could also realize collision mitigation for a specific part of the vehicle by increasing the charge quantity at the corresponding place. We have tested our methods in 192 cases from 8 different scenarios in simulation with two different models. The simulation results show that the success rate of the proposed safe controller is 20% higher than using HJ-reachability with system decomposition by using a unicycle model. It could also decrease 43% of collision that happens at the pre-assigned part. The method is further validated in a dynamic bicycle model.

AB Cyber attacks have become more common and sophisticated in the new age of technology. Intrusion detection systems were designed to detect attacks while they are being carried out and many applications have been deployed in IoT, showing great effectiveness to identify anomalies. However, almost all of them are built under a conventional scheme where network traffic is generated by services based on a client-server architecture. Pure Zigbee networks are distinguished by the connection between end devices and do not generate this kind of network traffic because Zigbee protocol stack is limited. Because of this, many of the variables presented in related works to train machine learning algorithms are not present in such a network. This would generate effects such as data theft, identity theft, permanent loss of information and even manipulation of devices, something significantly serious in the area of unmanned vehicles.
   The purpose of this article is to expose variables obtained from pure Zigbee in a distributed environment can be used to identify intrusions in a simulated test case such as the connection between unmanned vehicles. In this way, a new identification approach is introduced, within end devices are focused instead network traffic only to identify anomalies. It is intended to demonstrate that CPU and RAM variables analysis directly from end devices allow an effective identification in packet storm denial of service attacks and that they would be a considerable option to avoid end effects.

DT Article
DE Traffic command recognition; Orientation classification; Skeleton-based;
   Intelligent vehicle; Human-computer interaction
AB Understanding traffic officer commands is a fundamental perception task for intelligent vehicles in driver assistance and autonomous driving. Previous studies have emphasized explicit traffic command gesture recognition but have not considered situations where the traffic officer is controlling the subjects in other directions, which would also influence decision-making of the ego vehicle. To fill in the gap, this article aims to research visual skeleton-based recognition of traffic commands occurring at road intersections, where both command directions and gestures should be determined. Specifically, a two-stage recognition framework for four cross-shaped directions and eight command gestures is proposed. Two kinds of handcrafted features, including upper-body geometric features and keypoint co-occurrence features, are established with estimated 2D human keypoint coordinates and heatmaps and further combined into a deep learning network. The first stage handles human body orientation classification, while the second stage addresses command gesture recognition with extra usage of the output from the first stage. Combining the recognized body orientation and command gesture, the type of traffic command can ultimately be inferred. For training and validation, a dataset termed the Chinese Traffic Command at Intersections (CTCX) is built. The proposed method gains an outperforming edit accuracy of 89.67% on the CTCX test set, demonstrating its effectiveness. This work provides a foundation in this area and is expected to inspire more research on traffic command recognition with directions in the near future.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Navigation systems are the basis of trajectory tracking and autonomous vehicle motion control for intelligent vehicles. A fully constrained integrated navigation system (FC-NS) provides a complete constraint to an inertial navigation system (INS). However, the performance of FC-NSs with conventional information-sharing schemes worsens as faults appear. Taking the fusion of INS and multiple global navigation satellite systems (multi-GNSSs) as an example, this paper proposes a fault-tolerant method to improve the navigation performance of FC-NS under fault conditions. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, a conditional reset information-sharing scheme, which was introduced based on analyzing the shortcomings of traditional schemes, prevents federate filters from error tracking, and variance amplification is proposed. Second, a novel fault detection algorithm to improve the fault detection performance is designed. Based on the residual topology extracted by a self-organizing incremental neural network (SOINN), a rough surface for the detection of abnormal measurements is constructed through primary neurons and the maximum distance between them. The simulation results indicate that the proposed conditional reset scheme realizes FC-NS data fusion in normal conditions and achieves a 23% higher fault detection ratio than classic schemes under large faults. The fault detection ratios of the proposed fault detection algorithm are 8.5, 60.5 and 12.5% higher than those of the chi-square test under 30, 40 and 50 m faults, respectively, which obviously improves the positioning accuracy of FC-NS.

AB Quadcopter is a type of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that offers excellent flight ability albeit with relatively low payload. Despite its widespread use for transportation, improving its robustness against disturbances and carrying capacity has been challenging. Thus, this study proposed a cable suspended multi-UAVs transportation system with a controller and disturbance observer that is highly robust against disturbances. The primary objective of this study is to design a robust controller and disturbance observer by considering the effect of the cable-suspended payload on the UAV as a part of the disturbance. Consequently, reducing the complexity of the problem and allowing a range of algorithms to be used. A controller and disturbance observer are designed based on backstepping control and the extended state of the model, respectively, to control the flight of the multiple UAVs while carrying a cable-suspended payload. Further, to exploit the agility of quadcopters and avoid obstacles, a virtual structure based leader-follower dynamic formation scheme is introduced to change the formation geometry during the flight with cable suspended payload. This scheme does not make any assumption regarding the status of cable tension during the flight and thus no feedback measurement is required from payload. Moreover, the stability analysis of the proposed system is verified theoretically based on Lyapunov stability and through indoor experiments.

AB The decreasing cost of radar and camera sensory technology has established advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to the standard equipment of modern vehicles. ADAS employ semi-autonomous interventions in longitudinal (e.g., adaptive cruise control, ACC) and lateral (e.g., lane-keeping aid, LKA) direction. ACC and LKA constitute the milestones of ADAS technology and have shown to correspondingly reduce driving effort and unintended lane-drifts. ADAS and driver share the vehicle control; this in-turn creates a nonfinite number of test cases that have to be tested-verified so-as to enable safe software (SW) release. Adjacent to ADAS, vehicle dynamics-related systems, such as the antilock braking system and the dynamic-stability and traction control, have also to undergo through an exhaustive SW verification. Distilling the previous statements, this paper cultivates the concept of virtual SW verification by evaluating Volvo's production and a concept driver steering override (DSO) for LKA systems. The DSO concept addresses the driver's interaction with the LKA system and adapts the intervention level. The driver's activation is quantified though the steering torque and road/vehicle information. Two different test-runs per DSO strategy are presented and the real-car (physical) testing results are reproduced in simulation. Both the real and postprocessed simulation results show: 1) the importance of the override strategy on the LKA benefits; and 2) the importance of computer-aided engineering for studying/designing ADAS.

AB Aerial access infrastructures have been considered a compulsory component of the sixth-generation (6G) networks, where airborne vehicles play the role of mobile access points to service ground users (GUs) from the sky. In this scenario, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is one of the promising technologies associated with airborne vehicles for coverage extensions and throughput improvements, a.k.a., flying IRS (F-IRS). This study considers a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) F-IRS system, where the F-IRS reflects downlink signals from ground base stations (BSs) to users located at underserved areas where direct communications are unavailable. To achieve the system sum-rate maximization, we proposed a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm named FlyReflect to jointly optimize the flying trajectory and IRS phase shift matrix. First, end-to-end communications from a BS to its GUs via the F-IRS are analyzed to identify environmental and operational factors that impact achievable system sum rate. Subsequently, the system is transformed into a DRL model, which is resolvable by the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. To improve the action decision accuracy of the DDPG algorithm, we proposed a mapping function to guarantee that all constraints are satisfied regardless of noise additions in the exploration process. Simulation results showed that our proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in multiple scenarios.

AB Recently, research into the development of hybrid and electric vehicles has been vigorously undertaken, indicating a trend toward the replacement of internal combustion engine vehicles. However, while high efficiency and light weight are crucial in the development of vehicles, they increase the excitation force of the engine. In addition, sensor placement in future mobility is very important since it causes malfunctioning of autonomous driving systems when the location and orientation of sensors are changed due to excessive vehicle vibration. To reduce the structure-borne noise and vibration caused by engine excitation, an active engine mounting system must be installed in an optimal location. Thus, in this study, to determine the optimal location for an active engine mounting system applied to a beam structure, a series of simulations with two different methodologies are performed. The overall beam structure with two active mounting systems is modeled based on the lumped parameter model. To determine the optimal position of the active mounting system, it is moved to equal intervals, and the force and phase of the active mounts at each location combination are calculated based on static and dynamic methods. The optimal position is suggested such that the vibration reduction is maximized, while the applied force is minimized. Additionally, a feasibility experiment is conducted to validate the proposed criteria and confirm the simulation results. The results demonstrate that the optimal location of the active engine mounting system with a minimized force requirement and maximized vibration reduction can be identified.

AB This paper presents PANTHER, a real-time perception-aware (PA) trajectory planner for multirotor-UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) in dynamic environments. PANTHER plans trajectories that avoid dynamic obstacles while also keeping them in the sensor field of view (FOV) and minimizing the blur to aid in object tracking. The rotation and translation of the UAV are jointly optimized, which allows PANTHER to fully exploit the differential flatness of multirotors to maximize the PA objective. Real-time performance is achieved by implicitly imposing the underactuated dynamics of the UAV through the Hopf fibration. PANTHER is able to keep the obstacles inside the FOV 7.9 and 1.5 times more than non-PA approaches and PA approaches that decouple translation and yaw, respectively. The projected velocity (and hence the blur) is reduced by 18% and 34%, respectively. This leads to average success rates three times larger than state-of-the-art approaches in multi-obstacle avoidance scenarios. The MINVO basis is used to impose low-conservative collision avoidance constraints in position and velocity space. Finally, extensive hardware experiments in unknown dynamic environments with all the computation running onboard are presented, with velocities of up to 5.8 m/s, and with relative velocities (with respect to the obstacles) of up to 6.3 m/s. The only sensors used are an IMU, a forward-facing depth camera, and a downward-facing monocular camera.

AB In recent years, the takeover process of conditional automated driving has attached a great deal of attention. However, most of the existing research has focused on the effects of human-machine interactions or driver-related features (e.g., non-driving-related tasks), while there is little knowledge about the compatibility between the takeover process and existing road geometric design. As there is a high possibility that drivers must take over the vehicle before they diverge from the mainline of the highway, this explanatory study aimed to examine the compatibility between the takeover process and the current deceleration lane geometric design. The distribution range of existing deceleration lanes' lengths were obtained through a geo-based survey. Nine scenarios were recreated in the driving simulator which were designed with various deceleration lane lengths and driving modes (different takeover time budgets and manual driving as the baseline group). A total of 31 participants were recruited to take part in the experiment, their gaze behaviors were recorded simultaneously. Results showed that, compared with manual driving, both drivers' horizontal and vertical gaze dispersion increased, while drivers adopted higher deceleration in the mainline and merged into the deceleration lane later under takeover conditions. Moreover, a longer deceleration lane could benefit vehicle control. However, its marginal effect was reduced with the increase of deceleration lane length. These findings can help automated vehicle manufacturers design dedicated takeover schemes for different deceleration lane lengths.

AB Vehicular delay-tolerant networks follow a store-carry-forward mechanism to overcome the state of broken links between source and destination, which is crucial for autonomous vehicle networks. These networks depend upon the mobility of vehicular-relay nodes, which can adopt the store-carry-forward arrangement and provide consent to utilize their resources for packet forwarding. In reality, vehicular-relay nodes drop packets because of a lack of resources and selfish behavior, leading to potential failures in networks. The reason for this failure in performance is the absence of an efficient relay node selection strategy. Typically, vehicular delay networks can provide communication solutions in challenging conditions when other traditional networks fail to perform due to disconnection. However, if the routing strategy does not consider nodes' selfish nature and relay nodes' inefficiency, packet drops continue, and the approach will fail to perform. This paper proposes a routing strategy, known as the best-choice vehicular-relay selection strategy for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) transmission, to overcome this breakdown situation. The proposed strategy selects the best-performing vehicular-relay nodes and restricts the packet replication to low-performing vehicular nodes. The proposed routing strategy selects the best-choice relay nodes based on their past performance. Numerical analysis and our simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms some of the leading routing strategies in its class by increasing the delivery probability, decreasing the overhead ratio, average latency, and the number of dropped packets in the vehicular network.

AB The potential for automated vehicles (AVs) to reduce parking in central cities has generated much excitement among urban planners. AVs could drop-off (DO), and pick-up (PU) passengers in areas where parking costs are high: personal AVs could return home or park in less expensive locations, and shared AVs could serve other passengers. Reduced on-street and off-street parking present numerous opportuni- ties for redevelopment that could improve the livability of cities, for example, more street and sidewalk space for pedestrian and bicycle travel. However, reduced demand for parking would be accompanied by increased demand for curbside DO/PU space with related movements to enter and exit the flow of traffic. This change could be particularly challenging for traffic flows in downtown urban areas during peak hours, where high volumes of DOs and PUs are likely to occur. Only limited research examines the travel effects of a shift from parking to DO/PU travel and the impact of changes in parking supply. Our study uses a microscopic road traffic model with local travel activity data to simulate personal AV parking scenarios in San Francisco's downtown central business district (CBD). In these scenarios, we vary (1) the demand for DO and PU travel versus parking, (2) the supply of on-street and off-street parking, and (3) the total demand for parking and DO/PU travel due to an increase in the cost to travel to the CBD.

ID COMPOSITES
AB The functionality of products increases when more sensors are used. This trend also affects future automobiles and becomes even more relevant in connected and autonomous applications. Concerning automotive lightweight design, carbon fibre-reinforced polymers (CFRP) are suitable materials. However, their drawbacks include the relatively high manufacturing costs of CFRP components in addition to the difficulty of recycling. To compensate for the increased expenditure, the integration of automotive sensors in CFRP vehicle structures provides added value. As a new approach, established sensors are integrated into fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) structures. The sensors are usually mounted to the vehicle. The integration of sensors into the structure saves weight and space. Many other approaches specifically develop new sensors for integration into FRP structures. With the new approach, there is no need for elaborate development of new sensors since established sensors are used. The present research also showed that the range of applications of the sensors can be extended by the integration. The present paper outlines the functional behaviour of the integrated sensor utilized for crashing sensing. First of all, the integration quality of the sensor is relevant. Different requirements apply to the usual mounting of the sensor. The self-sensing structure must fulfil those requirements. Moreover, unfamiliar characteristics of the new surrounding structure might affect the sensing behaviour. Thus, the sensing behaviour of the self-sensing composite was analyzed in detail. The overarching objective is the general integration of sensors in products with reasonable effort.

AB Autonomous collision detection and avoidance is a crucial requirement for the safe navigation of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in maritime traffic situations. Automatic identification system (AIS) is used to obtain the motion information of surrounding ships and their dimensional specifications. With AIS information, appropriate collision risk assessment between two ships can be performed; further, collision avoidance can be achieved by defining a safe radius of avoidance, which can be determined considering the shape parameters of a target ship. However, AIS data are often unreliable and some commercial fishing vessels intentionally turn off the public tracking system to hide their location. Under these circumstances, marine radars are used to detect and estimate the motion information of nearby ships. However, most existing target tracking studies model the target as a point object without any spatial extent, and thus, its physical dimensions cannot be identified. In this paper, a target tracking method that uses a marine radar is proposed to simultaneously estimate the motion states (i.e., position, course, and speed) of a target ship and its geometric parameter (length) in the framework of an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The proposed approach enhances collision avoidance by providing the kinematic and length parameters to evaluate collision risk and generate an appropriate collision-free path. Real-sea experiments using a developed USV system were conducted to verify and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm; the results are presented and discussed in this paper.

TI A Fractional Derivative-Based Lateral Preview Driver Model for
   Autonomous Automobile Path Tracking
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB The concept of focus point preview is proposed, and fractional calculus is introduced to driver model to build focus point preview driver model. A formula for calculating lateral error is given, where the weight coefficients of fractional calculus are designed to imitate the driver's focus preview property. The relationship between the speed and the order of fractional calculus is studied. A driver-vehicle-road simulation system is set up to illustrate the performances of the proposed preview model. The S-type road is used to test the model in the case of continuous small curvature turns and the Shanghai F1 track model is used as the case that automobile passing large curvature curve. The performances are evaluated from two aspects: path tracking effect and vehicle dynamic responses. It is concluded that, as the speed of the vehicle increases, the optimal order of fractional integral increases, so that the order is seen as the degree of driver's attention. What is more, in the case of large curvature, the path tracking performance is improved by increasing the corresponding fractional order. Simulations results also show that, compared with the single-point preview model, the performances of the focus point preview model are better. On the one hand, the proposed driver model can be used to control the vehicle steering and path tracking. On the other hand, fractional calculus is used to reveal the driver preview property and the order is given a certain physical meaning, which is conducive to the development of fractional calculus applications.

AB Automated driving technology is considered a disruptive innovation. Mixed traffic composed of level-3 auto-mated vehicles (L3 AVs) and non-AVs will exist long before fully automated driving arrives. During this tran-sition, drivers will be the first to use L3 AVs, so studying drivers' behavioural intentions to use L3 AVs is vital. This paper focuses on the influence of social conformity and gender on drivers' intentions to drive L3 AVs. Three hundred one participants completed an online questionnaire containing 1) demographic information, 2) a scale based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) under two scenarios (large-group scenario: 80% of drivers are driving AVs in the road, small-group scenario: 20% of drivers are driving AVs in the road), and 3) a scale measuring conformity tendency and personal innovativeness in information technology. In the large-group scenario, drivers have stronger intentions to drive L3 AVs, and there is no significant gender difference. In the small-group scenario, the male drivers' driving intentions were significantly higher than those of the female drivers. The predictive model based on the TPB explained 81.1% and 64.8% of the variance in driving intention in the two scenarios, respectively. The three traditional variables (attitude, subjective norm, perceived behaviour control) of the TPB appeared to be the main predictors for the model. The results of this study provide some practical implications for manufacturers of AVs.

AB Remote sensing by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is significantly important in emergency rescue applications and operations. Particularly, the on-site images from UAVs can provide valuable information for hazard identification and disaster assessment. In this study, the authors propose a novel method by using back propagation neural networks with feature fusion to detect landslides from UAV images. Specifically, the authors first construct a fundamental shape model of landslides and devise a scale-invariant feature transform algorithm for feature matching and transformation. By fusing the spatial shape features and spectral features of the landslide, the suspected landslide object from UAV images can be detected initially. Next, the change features of a pre/post-landslide object are extracted by using the satellite sensing images (before landslide) and the UAV image (after landslide). The authors further feed the change features into the proposed model to enhance the precision and accuracy of landslide detection. They conduct numerous experimental studies with aerospace remote sensing data in two real-world landslide scenarios. The evaluation results show that the proposed method outperforms baseline algorithms by achieving over 91% accuracy in landslide detection.

AB The automotive industry is undergoing probably the most far-reaching changes that have ever affected it. The outward manifestations of change are the emergence of the connected vehicle as the norm rather than the province of up-market cars competing on the presence of innovative ICT-driven features, the race to develop fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) and the switch to more environmentally sustainable alternative fuel vehicles. The main enabler of these fundamental developments is technological change. But technology is also a driver of change, this is nowhere more obvious than in the application of ICTs in the transport arena. But technological changes of this magnitude also lead to changes in industry structure, a shift in the basis of competition from features and performance to functionalities, and a growing reliance on knowledge that is new to the traditional industry. This paper addresses one aspect of this milieu of developments, that is the emergence of cybersecurity threats to the modern highly-computerised vehicle. Countering such problems requires a high degree of knowledge sharing in the industry and particularly between car manufacturers and their supply networks. This article collects, synthesises and analyses some primary evidence from cybersecurity experts in the industry. The overall conclusion reached is that, in the view of auto-cybersecurity specialists, the level of knowledge-sharing is inadequate. The article presents a number of potential explanations for this phenomenon; the common feature of these explanations is the existence of significant tensions and lack of trust in the knowledge environment.

AB Vehicle platooning is of great importance in future autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems, due to its advantages in road safety, traffic efficiency, energy consumption and exhaust emissions. This paper focuses on the scalability performance of platooning control, which aims to achieve long platoon size under the premise of ensuring consensus behavior of the platooning vehicles. However, in classical platooning schemes such as ACC (adaptive cruise control) and CACC (cooperative adaptive cruise control), as the number of platoon members increases, the communication range of the leader and the cascaded sensor delay affect the scalability of platoon. In this paper, a scalable platooning scheme, CACC-granulation, is proposed to improve the scalability of platooning based on a novel information flow topology. The granulating method is used to solve the problem of limited communication range of leader for CACC by forwarding their own information to platoon members through some vehicles. The CACC-granulation granulates platoon information flow topology and enhances the platoon scalability by reducing information flow topology matrix. Simulation experiments are conducted to verify the consensus and scalability performance of CACC-granulation. Compared with other two platooning schemes which can get long platoon size, i.e., ACC-cascade and ACC-CACC-integration, the simulation results indicate the performance advantages of the proposed CACC-granulation, which not only meets the consensus of platooning control, but also enhances the scalability of platooning control.

AB Recognition of brake light status in vehicles is crucial for anticipating speed changes and preventing rear-end collisions for autonomous driving systems. Existing literature presents two types of methods for brake light detection: hand-crafted feature-based methods and deep learning-based methods. However, hand-crafted methods often struggle to capture brake light characteristics accurately in reallife conditions. In contrast, deep learning-based systems can adapt to diverse brake light variations across different vehicle types and environments. Nevertheless, manually designing Deep Neural Network (DNN) models requires expertise and is prone to errors. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that leverages Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to automatically generate optimal DNN architectures for object detection tasks, specifically for brake light detection. In contrast to the existing NAS approaches that focus on classification models, our technique explores NAS for object detection tasks. We employ a modified Differential Evolution algorithm, incorporating evaluation correction-based selection for mutation and species protection-based selection to identify the optimal DNN backbone architecture with optimal training parameters. The proposed approach achieved mean accuracy of 89.73 %, and 88.90 % on four-wheeler datasets CaltechGraz and UC Merced Vehicle Rear Signal datasets, respectively, and it has achieved 97.97 % on the proposed two-wheeler NITW-MBS dataset. The proposed approach's generalization capability and practical applicability are ascertained through cross-dataset evaluation and experiments on real-world traffic video.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been extensively applied to goods delivery and in-situ sensing. It becomes increasingly probable that multiple UAVs are delivering goods and carrying out sensing tasks at the same time. The destinations of the UAVs are usually required to jointly design their trajectories and sensing selections, leading to privacy concerns for the UAVs. This paper presents a new game-theoretic routing framework for joint goods delivery and sensing of multiple cellular-connected UAVs, where the UAVs minimize their energy consumption and connectivity outage, maximize their sensing reward, and ensure timely goods delivery and trajectory privacy by optimizing their trajectories and sensing task selections in a decentralized manner. The key idea is that we unify routing and sensing in a single task selection process, which is further transformed into routing on a task-time graph. Another important aspect is that we design a non-cooperative potential game for the routing on the task-time graph. A distributed strategy is developed, where each UAV only reports its sensing task selections and withholds its destination information and its best response produced by the Bellman-Ford algorithm. By this means, the destination and trajectory privacy of the UAVs are protected. Simulations show that the new game-theoretic approach can ensure timely delivery and achieve close-to-optimal solutions with significantly lower complexity compared to a centralized brute-force approach.

AB The Automated City Shuttles (ACSs) aim to shape the future public transportation and provide more effi-cient and accessible mobility in smart cities. With the absence of a driver, such mini-busses process the sensors' inputs and exchanged data with other vehicles and intelligent transport systems to achieve a real time assimilation of its surroundings. Consequently, the technologies supporting the driverless function-alities ushered new cybersecurity risks and data privacy breaches. Unfortunately, several studies mostly focus on individual Connected-Automated Vehicles (CAV), though intrinsic underpinnings of the ACS's threat vectors remain unexplored. In the present paper, we considerably extend that investigation by proposing a comprehensive state of the art with farsighted analyses addressing security threats and data privacy concerns from both technical and legal perspectives to thwart potential attacks. Moreover, as ex-isting approaches have not provided yet a clear road map about ACS's security standards, the present work sheds light on recent and up to date standards and standardisation bodies dealing with cyberse-curity and privacy issues in the automated driving ecosystem. This paper presents an analysis debating the trade-off between maximising the ACS benefits and minimising the associated security vulnerabilities and attacks through an overview of technical and legal mitigation strategies. .(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB Big promotions of online retailers in different shopping festivals often lead to an overwhelming demand surge in parcel delivery. Besides using its own distribution capacity, online retailers usually adopt capacity sharing to cope with the demand surge. Because of the low cost of unmanned distribution, online retailers can adopt unmanned vehicle distribution (UVD) capability sharing. We examine an online retailer?s UVD capacity sharing strategies with a logistics firm under demand surge. We develop sharing models under the unilateral and bidirectional option contracts, from which we derive the optimal ex-ante and ex-post sharing strategies and the corresponding initial, option, and total sharing quantities. We find that if the online retailer wants to secure more UVD capacity in advance, it should use the bidirectional option; otherwise, the unilateral option. Moreover, both the initial sharing and total sharing quantities under the unilateral option are greater than those under the bidirectional option, which however can increase the flexibility of the online retailer. We conduct numerical studies to ascertain the effects of the model parameters on the optimal outcomes. The numerical results show that the degree of demand fluctuation has a greater impact on the initial and total sharing quantities under the unilateral option, and has a greater impact on the option sharing quantity under the bidirectional option. Finally, comparing self-built UVD capacity and UVD capacity sharing, we generate insights to provide guidance for the operations of online retailers.

ID PEDESTRIAN-DETECTION
AB In this paper, we present a novel vision-based detection system able to extend the detection range of vehicles or mobile robots. The proposed system is used to detect and track moving targets from near-to-far ranges and covers a wide range of more than 130 m without decreasing detection accuracy. Typical examples of targets include traffic signs, vehicles, animals, and pedestrians. In this paper, the detection and tracking of moving pedestrians from near-to-far ranges is investigated. The proposed system is composed of two identical cameras. The first camera is equipped with a short focal length lens to detect and track pedestrians in near-to-mid range, and the second camera with a long focal length lens is used to detect and track pedestrians in mid-to-far range. To synchronize the detection results of both cameras and to eliminate repeated measurements, two synchronization algorithms were developed. The tracking process is applied after the detection, and it is used to track and predict the future motion and direction of pedestrian. To prevent vehicle-target collisions, two algorithms that generate alert and danger warnings are developed. A mathematical model based on the fundamental physics of the camera and lens is developed to illustrate the feasibility of our work. Finally, we conducted many experiments in large open-air parking lots and on Ottawa roads to show the applicability of our system.

AB Large area mapping at high resolution underwater continues to be constrained by sensor-level environmental constraints and the mismatch between available navigation and sensor accuracy. In this paper advances are presented that exploit aspects of the sensing modality, and consistency and redundancy within local sensor measurements to build high-resolution optical and acoustic maps that are a consistent representation of the environment. This work is presented in the context of real-world data acquired using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) working in diverse applications including shallow water coral reef surveys with the Seabed AUV a forensic survey of the RMS Titanic in the North Atlantic at a depth of 4100 m using the Hercules ROV and a survey of the TAG hydrothermal vent area in the mid-Atlantic at a depth of 3600 m using the Jason II ROV Specifically, the focus is on the related problems of structure from motion from underwater optical imagery assuming pose instrumented calibrated cameras. General wide baseline solutions are presented for these problems based on the extension of techniques from the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), photogrammetric and the computer vision communities. It is also examined how such techniques can be extended for the very different sensing modality and scale associated with multi-beam bathymetric mapping. For both the optical and acoustic mapping cases it is also shown how the consistency in mapping can be used not only for better global mapping, but also to refine navigation estimates.

AB Lane detection is essential for autonomous vehicles, and vision-based lane detection is widely used in the field of intelligent driving cars because of its low cost. Aiming to solve the problem of false detection caused by surrounding vehicles during lane detection, a new multi-lane detection method with strong anti-interference ability is proposed. The main contribution of this work is the utilization of object detection neural network which is applied to remove vehicles from road images as much as possible. Compared with the traditional feature-based detection algorithms, this method can preserve lane line features more accurately and effectively. Firstly, binarization of global optimal threshold method is utilized to extract the basic features of lanes. In order to further remove non-lane line noises and extract lane features as clear as possible, YOLOv4-tiny object detection network is introduced to detect and filter vehicles on the road. Then the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm with denoising function is applied to cluster the different lane features. Finally, an improved RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) method is used to perform quadratic curve fitting on the clustered features. The experimental results on dataset show that consumed time of a single frame image is only 0.119 second and the precision of the proposed method can reach 94.4%. Compared with other detection algorithms, the proposed algorithm has good real-time performance, stability and robustness in a variety of complex scenarios.

AB In this paper we present a bionic multi-sensor anavigation and control system for unmanned ground vehicles to complete the homing task. The system consists of the pixelated polarized sensor, a Micro Inertial Measurement Unit (MIMU), and a monocular camera. To compensate for the installation error, we provide a joint calibration method for multiple sensors. Utilizing the measurements of pixelated polarized vision sensor, we firstly propose an adaptive integrated method with the Visual-Inertial System. The integrated algorithm can not only solve the ambiguity problem of polarized orientation and reduce the cumulative error of the system, but also increase the navigation output rate and enhance the robustness of the system. We present a homevector-based strategy for the goal-directed navigation and control of the unmanned ground vehicles. When the external data link is interrupted, the unmanned vehicles can return to the starting point autonomously, which benefits for improving the survivability of the system. Finally, we design various experiments to verify the algorithm proposed in this paper. The experimental results of the calibration demonstrate that the RMSE of the orientation after calibration is only 0.014 degrees. In the navigation and homing experiment, the RMSE of the position error is 0.64m, and the minimum homing error is only 0.49m (1.09% of the travelled distance). Finally, we discuss interesting insights gained with respect to future work in multi-sensor integration and robot control strategies.

AB The dynamic event-triggered cooperative formation control problem for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) subject to time-varying disturbances is studied. A single UAV is described by a second-order kinematical model and the desired formation is constructed by utilising the leader-follower framework, in which the leader UAV provides the desired trajectory for each follower. Unknown external disturbances are assumed to be composed of multiple frequency waves and appropriate disturbance observers are designed. A dynamic event-triggered mechanism is proposed with its triggering threshold being dynamically adjustable rather than a fixed constant, which can reduce data transmissions more effectively and meanwhile avoid the Zeno behaviour. Then a distributed event-triggered control scheme is developed for the UAV formation and two sufficient conditions on asymptotical stability of the resulting closed loop system are derived. Furthermore, controller gains, observer gains, and triggering parameters can be jointly obtained by solving the desired linear matrix inequality (LMI). Finally, a simulated example is given to illustrate the obtained results.

AB The goal of this study is to assess and quantify the potential employment accessibility benefits of shared-use automated vehicle (AV) mobility service (SAMS) modes across a large diverse metropolitan region considering heterogeneity in the working population. To meet this goal, this study proposes employing a welfare-based (i.e. logsum-based) measure of accessibility, obtained via estimating a hierarchical work destination-commute mode choice model. The employment accessibility logsum measure incorporates the spatial distribution of worker residences and employment opportunities, the attributes of the available commute modes, and the characteristics of individual workers. The study further captures heterogeneity of workers using a latent class analysis (LCA) approach to account for different worker clusters valuing different types of employment opportunities differently, in which the socio-demographic characteristics of workers are the LCA model inputs. The accessibility analysis results in Southern California indicate: (i) the accessibility benefit differences across latent classes are modest but young workers and lowincome workers do see higher benefits than high- and middle-income workers; (ii) there are substantial spatial differences in accessibility benefits with workers living in lower density areas benefiting more than workers living in high-density areas; (iii) nearly all the accessibility benefits come from the SAMS-only mode as opposed to the SAMS+Transit mode; and (iv) the SAMS cost per mile assumption significantly impacts the magnitude of the overall employment accessibility benefits.

AB Sooner or later, the practices we call "green" will have to expand from the token gestures we make today (turning down the thermostat and driving hybrids) to a nearly universal avoidance of oxidizing fossil carbon. In terms of aviation, it's time to start thinking about how to move people and goods, in commercial quantities, with a zero-carbon footprint; Indeed there are several schemes afoot.
   The pioneering Boeing and Lange/DLR fuel-cell prototype airplanes are an encouraging sign up to a point, but It seems more than bold to suggest that these models can be scaled up to commercial adequacy. The USAF/DARPA high-altitude Intel blimp provides ample carrying capacity and a ceiling of 65,000 feet, but again, not much of a useful turn of speed. Popular Science has reported on multiple-gas vehicles like the Sanswire STS-111 Stratellite and airship concepts such as Igor Pasternak's Aeroscraft. Of these, only the last seems to be well-targeted toward the goal, according to some accounts.
   This undertakes to apply some of the perennial concerns participants to a global fleet of dirigibles featuring fuel-cell-powered propulsion. That is, it adopts a global-system view taking the development of suitable vehicles for granted, rather than focusing on the vehicle innovations as their developers must primarily do. Discussions include performance and safety requirements for the airships, new terminal area concepts, collaborative-autonomous situational awareness and collision avoidance, weather considerations, in-flight refueling and towing, and intermodal possibilities.

AB In direct line with the evolution of technology, but also with the density of vehicles that create congestion and often road accidents, traffic monitoring systems are parts that integrate intelligent transport systems (ITS). This is one of the most critical elements within transport infrastructures, an aspect that involves extremely important financial investments in order to collect and analyze traffic data with the aim of designing systems capable of properly managing traffic. Technological progress in the field of wireless communications is advancing, highlighting new traffic monitoring solutions, and the need for major classification, but proposing a real-time analysis model to guide the new systems is a challenge addressed in this manuscript. The involvement of classifiers and computerized detection applied to traffic monitoring cameras can outline extremely vital systems for the future of logistic transport. Analyzing and debating vehicle classification systems, examining problems and challenges, as well as designing a software project capable of being the basis of new developments in the field of ITS systems are the aim of this study. The outline of a method based on intelligent algorithms and improved YOLOv3 can have a major impact on the effort to reduce the negative impact created by chaotic traffic and the outline of safety protocols in the field of transport. The reduction of waiting times and decongestion by up to 80% is a valid aspect, which we can deduce from the study carried out.

AB The use of electrical vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft to provide efficient, high-speed, on-demand air transportation within a metropolitan area is a topic of increasing interest, which is expected to bring fundamental changes to the city infrastructures and daily commutes. NASA, Uber, and Airbus have been exploring this exciting concept of Urban Air Mobility (UAM), which has the potential to provide meaningful door-to-door trip time savings compared with automobiles. However, the ability to manage many of these eVTOL aircraft safely in a congested urban area presents a challenge unprecedented in air traffic management. In order to enable safe and efficient autonomous on-demand free flight operations in UAM, a computational guidance algorithm with collision avoidance capability is designed and analyzed. The approach proposed in this paper is to formulate this problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solve it using an online algorithm Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For illustration, a high-density free flight airspace simulator is created to test the proposed algorithm's performance. Numerical experiment results show that this proposed algorithm has fewer conflicts and near mid-air collisions than Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA), a state-of-the-art collision avoidance strategy.

TI A self-rotating, single-actuated UAV with extended sensor field of view
   for autonomous navigation
SO SCIENCE ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) rely heavily on visual sensors to perceive obstacles and explore environments. Current UAVs are limited in both perception capability and task efficiency because of a small sensor field of view (FoV). One solution could be to leverage self-rotation in UAVs to extend the sensor FoV without consuming extra power. This natural mechanism, induced by the counter-torque of the UAV motor, has rarely been exploited by existing autonomous UAVs because of the difficulties in design and control due to highly coupled and nonlinear dynamics and the challenges in navigation brought by the high-rate self-rotation. Here, we present powered-flying ultra-underactuated LiDAR (light detection and ranging) sensing aerial robot (PULSAR), an agile and self-rotating UAV whose three-dimensional position is fully controlled by actuating only one motor to obtain the required thrust and moment. The use of a single actuator effectively reduces the energy loss in powered flights. Consequently, PULSAR consumes 26.7% less power than the benchmarked quadrotor with the same total propeller disk area and avionic payloads while retaining a good level of agility. Augmented by an onboard LiDAR sensor, PULSAR can perform autonomous navigation in unknown environments and detect both static and dynamic obstacles in panoramic views without any external instruments. We report the experiments of PULSAR in environment exploration and multidirectional dynamic obstacle avoidance with the extended FoV via self- rotation, which could lead to increased perception capability, task efficiency, and flight safety.

AB The autonomous navigation of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) relies heavily on the navigation sensors. The UAV?s level of autonomy depends upon the various navigation systems, such as state measurement, mapping, and obstacle avoidance. Selecting the correct components is a critical part of the design process. However, this can be a particularly difficult task, especially for novices as there are several technologies and components available on the market, each with their own individual advantages and disadvantages. For example, satellite-based navigation components should be avoided when designing indoor UAVs. Incorporating them in the design brings no added value to the final product and will simply lead to increased cost and power consumption. Another issue is the number of vendors on the market, each trying to sell their hardware solutions which often incorporate similar technologies. The aim of this paper is to serve as a guide, proposing various methods to support the selection of fit-for-purpose technologies and components whilst avoiding system layout conflicts. The paper presents a study of the various navigation technologies and supports engineers in the selection of specific hardware solutions based on given requirements. The selection methods are based on easy-to-follow flow charts. A comparison of the various hardware components specifications is also included as part of this work.

TI iADA*-RL: Anytime Graph-Based Path Planning with Deep Reinforcement
   Learning for an Autonomous UAV
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL

DT Article
DE reinforcement learning; anytime path planning
ID ROBOTICS
AB Path planning algorithms are of paramount importance in guidance and collision systems to provide trustworthiness and safety for operations of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Previous works showed different approaches mostly focusing on shortest path discovery without a sufficient consideration on local planning and collision avoidance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid path planning algorithm that uses an anytime graph-based path planning algorithm for global planning and deep reinforcement learning for local planning which applied for a real-time mission planning system of an autonomous UAV. In particular, we aim to achieve a highly autonomous UAV mission planning system that is adaptive to real-world environments consisting of both static and moving obstacles for collision avoidance capabilities. To achieve adaptive behavior for real-world problems, a simulator is required that can imitate real environments for learning. For this reason, the simulator must be sufficiently flexible to allow the UAV to learn about the environment and to adapt to real-world conditions. In our scheme, the UAV first learns about the environment via a simulator, and only then is it applied to the real-world. The proposed system is divided into two main parts: optimal flight path generation and collision avoidance. A hybrid path planning approach is developed by combining a graph-based path planning algorithm with a learning-based algorithm for local planning to allow the UAV to avoid a collision in real time. The global path planning problem is solved in the first stage using a novel anytime incremental search algorithm called improved Anytime Dynamic A* (iADA*). A reinforcement learning method is used to carry out local planning between waypoints, to avoid any obstacles within the environment. The developed hybrid path planning system was investigated and validated in an AirSim environment. A number of different simulations and experiments were performed using AirSim platform in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system for an autonomous UAV. This study helps expand the existing research area in designing efficient and safe path planning algorithms for UAVs.

TI Estimating the Potential Modal Split of Any Future Mode Using Revealed
   Preference Data
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION

AB Mode choice behaviour is often modelled by discrete choice models, in which the utility of each mode is characterized by mode-specific parameters reflecting how strongly the utility of that mode depends on attributes such as travel speed and cost, and a mode-specific constant value. For new modes, the mode-specific parameters and the constant in the utility function of discrete choice models are not known and are difficult to estimate on the basis of stated preferences data/choice experiments and cannot be estimated on the basis of revealed preference data. This paper demonstrates how revealed preference data can be used to estimate a discrete mode choice model without using mode-specific constants and mode-specific parameters. This establishes a method that can be used to analyze any new mode using revealed preference data and discrete choice models and is demonstrated using the OViN 2017 dataset with trips throughout the Netherlands using a multinomial and nested logit model. This results in a utility function without any alternative specific constants or parameters, with a rho-squared of 0.828 and an accuracy of 0.758. The parameters from this model are used to calculate the future modal split of shared autonomous vehicles and electric steps, leading to a potential modal split range of 24-30% and 37-44% when using a multinomial logit model, and 15-20% and 33-40% when using a nested logit model. An overestimation of the future modal split occurs due to the partial similarities between different transport modes when using a multinomial logit model. It can therefore be concluded that a nested logit model is better suited for estimating the potential modal split of a future mode than a multinomial logit model. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that the future modal split of shared autonomous vehicles and electric steps has been calculated using revealed preference data from existing modes using an unlabelled mode modelling approach.

ID ENERGY
AB Bathymetric mapping with Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) receives increased attentions in recent years. AUVs offer a lower operational cost and smaller carbon footprint with reduced ship usage, and they can provide higher resolution data when surveying the seabed at a closer distance if compared to ships. However, advancements are still needed to improve the data quality of AUV-based surveys. Unlike mobile robots with deterministic mapping performance, multibeam sonars used in AUV-based bathymetric mapping often yields inconsistent swath width due to the varied seabed elevation and surficial properties. As a result, mapping voids may exist between planned lawnmower transects. Although this could be solved by planning closer lawnmower paths, mission time increases proportionally. Therefore, an onboard path planner is demanded to assure the defined survey objective, i.e., coverage rate. Here in this paper, we present a new data-driven coverage path planning (CPP) method, in which the vehicle automatically updates the waypoints intermittently based on an objective function constructed using the information about the exploration preference, sonar performance, and coverage efficiency. The goal of the proposed method is to plan a cost-effective path on-the-fly to obtain high quality mapping result meeting the requirements in coverage rate and uncertainty. The proposed CPP method has been evaluated in a simulated environment with a 6DOF REMUS AUV model and a realistic seafloor topography. A series of trials has been conducted to investigate the performance affected by the parameters in the objective function. We also compared the proposed method with traditional lawnmower and spiral paths. The results show that the weight assignment in the objective function is critical as they affect the overall survey performance. With proper weight settings, the AUV yields better survey performance, coverage rate and coverage efficiency, compared to traditional approaches. Moreover, the proposed method can be easily adjusted or modified to achieve different coverage goals, such as rapid data gathering of the entire region, survey of irregular workspace, or maintaining real time path planning.

AB Steering has more potential than braking to prevent rear-end collisions at higher relative velocities. A path tracking controller based on multi-input multi-output (MIMO) model predictive control (MPC) is proposed to enhance the handling performance of autonomous emergency steering in this paper. A six-state MIMO bicycle model including actuator dynamics of steering and differential braking is used for model prediction. Two control inputs are front wheel steering angle and direct yaw moment. Two model outputs are lateral displacement and heading angle. According to the work load ratios at four wheels, control allocation is used to determine the optimal braking force distribution to prevent tire force saturation. The performance of a single-input single-output (SISO) MPC that uses only steering angle control to track the lateral displacement of the desired path is employed to benchmark the performance of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that both SISO MPC and MIMO MPC can track the path on nominal road surface with high road friction coefficient of 0.9. For a road surface with medium road friction coefficient of 0.7, the SISO MPC is unable to track the path and loses directional stability. However, the MIMO MPC can still track the path and demonstrate robust path tracking and handling enhancement against model uncertainty due to reduced road friction.

AB The probe-and-drogue autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) docking suffers the multiwind disturbances leading to the low accuracy of receiver position control and drogue relative position estimation. This article proposes a bionic visual navigation control system in a hardware-in-loop simulation environment and further develops an AAR outfield experiment platform for promoting the success of probe-and-drogue AAR docking. The drogue region and markers are detected by the biological method imitating the eagle-eye color vision mechanism. The different visual navigation methods based on the ellipse fitting, marker matching, and marker prediction are, respectively, applied to the three possible situations in AAR docking for precise pose estimation. Moreover, a relative position control scheme of the receiver, which is constructed by back-stepping design technique and gain-adaptive equivalent sliding mode control, is proposed to compensate multi-wind disturbances and model uncertainties. Fuzzy logic position strategy is designed to compensate swing of the drogue caused by the multiwind disturbances. The AAR outfield experiment platform contains two unmanned aerial vehicles to verify a part of the proposed navigation control method. Extensive experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the bionic visual navigation control system for the high accuracy of the visual navigation and antidisturbance position control.

AB Deaths and serious injuries caused by traffic accidents is a concerning public health problem. However, the problem can be mitigated by the Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) system, which can avoid the impact. The market penetration of AEB is exponentially growing, and non-impact situations are expected to become more frequent. Thus, new injury patterns must be analysed, and the neck is particularly sensitive to sudden acceleration changes. Abrupt braking would be enough to be a potential risk for cervical spine injury. There is controversy about whether or not there are differences in cervical behaviour depending on whether passengers are relaxed or contract their muscles before the imminent accident. In the present manuscript, 18 volunteers were subjected to two different levels of awareness during an emergency braking test. Cervical muscles (sternocleidomastoid and trapezius) were analysed by the sEMG signal captured by means of a low-cost system. The differences observed in the muscle response according to gender and age were notable when passengers are warned. Gender differences were more significant in the post-braking phase. When passengers were relaxed, subjects older than 35 registered higher sEMG values. Meanwhile, when passengers contract their muscles, subjects who were younger than or equal to 35 years old experienced an increment in the values of the sEMG signals.

AB A key challenge in autonomous mobile manipulation is the ability to determine, in real time, how to safely execute complex tasks when placed in unknown or changing world. Addressing this issue for Intervention Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (I-AUVs), operating in potentially unstructured environment is becoming essential. Our research focuses on using motion planning to increase the I-AUVs autonomy, and on addressing three major challenges: (a) producing consistent deterministic trajectories, (b) addressing the high dimensionality of the system and its impact on the real-time response, and (c) coordinating the motion between the floating vehicle and the arm. The latter challenge is of high importance to achieve the accuracy required for manipulation, especially considering the floating nature of the AUV and the control challenges that come with it. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrate experimental results performing manipulation in unknown environment. The Multirepresentation, Multiheuristic A* (MR-MHA*) search-based planner, previously tested only in simulation and in a known a priori environment, is now extended to control Girona500 I-AUV performing a Valve-Turning intervention in a water tank. To this aim, the AUV was upgraded with an in-house-developed laser scanner to gather three-dimensional (3D) point clouds for building, in real time, an occupancy grid map (octomap) of the environment. The MR-MHA* motion planner used this octomap to plan, in real time, collision-free trajectories. To achieve the accuracy required to complete the task, a vision-based navigation method was employed. In addition, to reinforce the safety, accounting for the localization uncertainty, a cost function was introduced to keep minimum clearance in the planning. Moreover a visual-servoing method had to be implemented to complete the last step of the manipulation with the desired accuracy. Lastly, we further analyzed the approach performance from both loose-coupling and clearance perspectives. Our results show the success and efficiency of the approach to meet the desired behavior, as well as the ability to adapt to unknown environments.

TI A multirobot system for autonomous deployment and recovery of a blade

SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

AB Offshore wind farms will play a vital role in the global ambition of net zero energy generation. Future offshore wind farms will be larger and further from the coast, meaning that traditional human-based operations and maintenance approaches will become infeasible due to safety, cost, and skills shortages. The use of remotely operated or autonomous robotic assistants to undertake these activities provides an attractive alternative solution. This paper presents an autonomous multirobot system which is able to transport, deploy and retrieve a wind turbine blade inspection robot using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The proposed solution is a fully autonomous system including a robot deployment interface for deployment, a mechatronic link-hook module (LHM) for retrieval, both installed on the underside of a UAV, a mechatronic on-load attaching module installed on the robotic payload and an intelligent global mission planner. The LHM is integrated with a 2-DOF hinge that can operate either passively or actively to reduce the swing motion of a slung load by approximately 30%. The mechatronic modules can be coupled and decoupled by special maneuvers of the UAV, and the intelligent global mission planner coordinates the operations of the UAV and the mechatronic modules for synchronous and seamless actions. For navigation in the vicinity of wind turbine blades, a visual-based localization merged with the location knowledge from Global Navigation Satellite System has been developed. A proof-of-concept system was field tested on a full-size decommissioned wind-turbine blade. The results show that the experimental system is able to deploy and retrieve a robotic payload onto and from a wind turbine blade safely and robustly without the need for human intervention. The vicinity localization and navigation system have shown an accuracy of 0.65 and 0.44 m in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. Furthermore, this study shows the feasibility of systems toward autonomous inspection and maintenance of offshore windfarms.

ID OBJECT; ALGORITHM
AB The problem of pose estimation arises in many areas of computer vision, including object recognition, object tracking. site inspection and updating, and autonomous navigation when scene models are available. We present a new algorithm, called SoftPOSIT, for determining the pose of a 3D object from a single 2D image when correspondences between object points and image points are not known. The algorithm combines the iterative softassign algorithm (Gold and Rangarajan, 1996; Gold et al., 1998) for computing correspondences and the iterative POSIT algorithm (DeMenthon and Davis, 1995) for computing object pose under a full-perspective camera model. Our algorithm, unlike most previous algorithms for pose determination, does not have to hypothesize small sets of matches and then verify the remaining image points. Instead, all possible matches are treated identically throughout the search for an optimal pose. The performance of the algorithm is extensively evaluated in Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic data under a variety of levels of clutter, occlusion, and image noise. These tests show that the algorithm performs well in a variety of difficult scenarios, and empirical evidence suggests that the algorithm has an asymptotic run-time complexity that is better than previous methods by a factor of the number of image points. The algorithm is being applied to a number of practical autonomous vehicle navigation problems including the registration of 3D architectural models of a city to images, and the docking of small robots onto larger robots.

AB Absolute positioning is an essential factor for the arrival of autonomous driving. At present, GNSS is the indispensable source that can supply initial positioning in the commonly used high definition map-based LiDAR point cloud positioning solution for autonomous driving. However, the non-light-of-sight (NLOS) reception dominates GNSS positioning performance in super-urbanized areas. The recent proposed 3D map aided (3DMA) GNSS can mitigate the majority of the NLOS caused by buildings. However, the same phenomenon caused by moving objects in urban areas is currently not modeled in the 3D geographic information system (GIS). Therefore, we present a novel method to exclude the NLOS receptions caused by a double-decker bus, one of the symbolic tall moving objects in road transportations. To estimate the dimension and orientation of the double-decker buses relative to the GNSS receiver, LiDAR-based perception is utilized. By projecting the relative positions into GNSS Skyplot, the direct transmission path of satellite signals blocked by the moving objects can be identified and excluded from positioning. Finally, GNSS positioning is estimated by the weighted least square (WLS) method based on the remaining satellites after the NLOS exclusion. Both static and dynamic experiments are conducted in Hong Kong. The results show that the proposed NLOS exclusion using LiDAR-based perception can greatly improve the GNSS single point positioning (SPP) performance.

AB Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) integration with autonomous PV/Wind hybrid power system becomes, currently, an interesting option for the improvement of the storage units' reliability and the life cycle assessment. In this paper, a new method for optimally sizing of HESS based on a statistical approach is proposed. This approach aims to exploit the capacity distribution of hybrid supercapacitor-battery system in an autonomous PV/Wind power generation system. This hybridization, of both slow and fast dynamics, aims to eliminate the power peaks caused by the load consumption. For the power distribution for all coordinated components of the storage system, a frequency management control and a hysteresis strategy are used in order to accomplish two goals: firstly, to delimit this exchanged power for not exceeding the maximum value and, secondly, to keep the States Of Charge (SOC) of the batteries-supercapacitors in a suitable range. Moreover, statistical analysis of several cumulative levels was performed to examine their contribution on the HESS optimal sizing. The obtained results prove that the integration of supercapacitor takes advantage of the complementary characteristics of the batteries, improves the exchanged power flow, extends the battery life cycle and affects on storage system sizing through accommodate the fast power fluctuations.

AB Plans for establishing a long-term human presence on the Moon will require substantial increases in robot autonomy and multirobot coordination to support establishing a lunar outpost. To achieve these objectives, algorithm design choices for the software developments need to be tested and validated for expected scenarios such as autonomous in situ resource utilization, localization in challenging environments, and multirobot coordination. However, real-world experiments are extremely challenging and limited for extraterrestrial environment. Also, realistic simulation demonstrations in these environments are still rare and demanded for initial algorithm testing capabilities. To help some of these needs, the NASA Centennial Challenges program established the Space Robotics Challenge Phase 2 (SRC2), which consist of virtual robotic systems in a realistic lunar simulation environment, where a group of mobile robots were tasked with reporting volatile locations within a global map, excavating and transporting these resources, and detecting and localizing a target of interest. The main goal of this article is to share our team's experiences on the design tradeoffs to perform autonomous robotic operations in a virtual lunar environment and to share strategies to complete the mission requirements posed by NASA SRC2 competition during the qualification round. Of the 114 teams that registered for participation in the NASA SRC2, team Mountaineers finished as one of only six teams to receive the top qualification round prize.

AB This paper presents an overview of the state of the art for safety-critical optimal control of autonomous systems. Optimal control methods are well studied, but become computationally infeasible for real-time applications when there are multiple hard safety constraints involved. To guarantee such safety constraints, it has been shown that optimizing quadratic costs while stabilizing affine control systems to desired (sets of) states subject to state and control constraints can be reduced to a sequence of Quadratic Programs (QPs) by using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs). The CBF method is computationally efficient, and can easily guarantee the satisfaction of nonlinear constraints for nonlinear systems, but its wide applicability still faces several challenges. First, safety is hard to guarantee for systems with high relative degree, and the above mentioned QPs can easily be infeasible if tight or time-varying control bounds are involved. The resulting solution is also sub-optimal due to its myopic solving approach. Finally, this method works conditioned on the system dynamics being accurately identified. The authors discuss recent solutions to these issues and then present a framework that combines Optimal Control with CBFs, hence termed OCBF, to obtain near-optimal solutions while guaranteeing safety constraints even in the presence of noisy dynamics. An application of the OCBF approach is included for autonomous vehicles in traffic networks.

AB This study presents the baseline design for the autonomous subsea vehicle capable of traveling at a lower speed of 1 m/s with an operating range of 400 km. Owing to UiS subsea-freight glider's (USFG) exceedingly economical and unique propulsion system, it can transport various types of cargo over variable distances. The primary use-case scenario for the USFG is to serve as an autonomous transport vessel to carry CO2 from land-based facilities to subsea injection sites. This allows the USFG to serve as a substitute for weather-dependent cargo tankers and underwater pipelines. The length of the USFG is 50.25 m along with a beam of 5.50 m, which allows the vessel to carry 518 m(3) of CO2 while serving the storage needs of the carbon capture and storage (CCS) ventures on the Norwegian continental shelf. The USFG is powered by battery cells, and it only consumes a little less than 8 kW of electrical power. Along with the mechanical design of the USFG, the control design is also presented in the final part of the paper. The maneuvering model of the USFG is presented along with two operational case studies. For this purpose, a linear quadratic regulator (LQR)- and proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-based control system is designed, and a detailed comparison study is also shown in terms of tuning and response characteristics for both controllers.

AB This paper presents an autonomous robotic system, an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), for in-field soil sampling and analysis of nitrates. Compared to standard methods of soil analysis it has several advantages: each sample is individually analyzed compared to average sample analysis in standard methods; each sample is georeferenced, providing a map for precision base fertilizing; the process is fully autonomous; samples are analyzed in real-time, approximately 30 min per sample; and lightweight for less soil compaction. The robotic system has several modules: commercial robotic platform, anchoring module, sampling module, sample preparation module, sample analysis module, and communication module. The system is augmented with an in-house developed cloud-based platform. This platform uses satellite images, and an artificial intelligence (AI) proprietary algorithm to divide the target field into representative zones for sampling, thus, reducing and optimizing the number and locations of the samples. Based on this, a task is created for the robot to automatically sample at those locations. The user is provided with an in-house developed smartphone app enabling overview and monitoring of the task, changing the positions, removing and adding of the sampling points. The results of the measurements are uploaded to the cloud for further analysis and the creation of prescription maps for variable rate base fertilization.

AB Practical formation-containment tracking issues for the multiple autonomous surface vessels system with multiple leader vessels are considered. The follower vessels' states are designed to track the convex combination of the leader vessels' states, which are required to actualise the predefined time-varying formation tracking. Firstly, this study establishes the dynamic models of the multiple vessels system, where the outer-loop kinematic model and inner-loop dynamic model are considered simultaneously. Then, the practical formation-containment tracking protocols are devised based on distributed extended state observers, where the mismatched uncertainties and leader vessels' control input signals are estimated and compensated. Thirdly, an algorithm is presented to give the procedures for designing the control protocols, in which the feasible time-varying formations of leader's vessels are raised. A series of linear matrix inequalities are solved for obtaining the control parameters. Sufficient conditions for actualising the practical formation-containment tracking are derived. Finally, numerical simulation results reveal the effectiveness of the acquired theories.

AB Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems are advanced IoT systems composed of sensor devices supported with dynamic objects such as smart vehicles and drones. The collaboration among static and heterogeneous mobile objects makes the topologies of IIoT systems dynamic and complex. This dynamic topology is also partially due to the fact that the static devices are typically partitioned into categories of collaborating sensors (called swarms) managed by side servers. However, existing authentication techniques for IIoT systems do not consider realistic system models simultaneously hosting different types of dynamic objects. For such scenarios, there is a need for a protocol that guarantees a secure Entity-to-Entity (E2E) communication, thus ensuring a smooth and safe production process.In this paper, for IIoT with swarms (SIIoT), we propose a novel key agreement and authentication protocol, HASAO (Honey-list Authentication for SIIoT with Autonomous Objects). HASAO enables efficient and secure E2E communication between devices in the same or different swarms. HASAO fills the gap of considering a realistic system model simultaneously hosting different types of dynamic objects. We employ Honey lists (lists with algorithms used to prevent guessing passwords) and mutual authentication technologies in HASAO to guarantee its security against different attacks, even in public-channel communication scenarios. Using the well-established Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, we proved the security of HASAO in detail. We also provide a prototype implementation of HASAO in the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. This tool confirms the results of our theoretical proofs, thus verifying the security of HASAO. We also carried out a detailed comparative study of HASAO against existing related authentication techniques. Compared to these techniques, HASAO offers more functionality (serving more types of dynamic objects) and superior security (via proving backup plans for session key establishment). Finally, we prove that HASAO is practical by implementing it in a well-known network simulator, Omnet++.

AB Autonomous mobile service robots are used to complete many tasks, such as cleaning, trans-porting goods and monitoring. Such tasks usually require uninterrupted and continuous service. However, the battery of the robot is limited and must be charged frequently. For a large number of robots, it is essential to select a suitable charging pile. For this issue, we propose a path planning model for robots to intelligently access a limited number of charging piles distributed on the map. The traditional path planning model mainly considers the shortest path criterion to generate the path. Different from this, the path planning model in this paper not only considers the shortest path, but also the service position of the robot after charging, the remaining power of the robot, the state of the charging pile and the position of the robot in the map. Our path planning assigns the most suitable charging pile to the robot that needs charging. To solve the problem of high memory consumption and slow search speed when traditional A(*) algorithm is used for path planning, we propose local memorial path planning (LMPP) algorithm to quickly generate effective paths. The simulation results show that the proposed robot charging path planner can improve the robot service satisfaction and plan the effective path to the available charging piles.

AB Although most people are aware of the harmful CO2 emissions produced by the transport sector threatening life on earth now and in the future, they do not eco-drive. Eco-driving improves the vehicle's fuel or energy economy and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. We investigated the motivational predictors of eco-driving based on the theory of self-concordance (i.e., the consistency between a behavior/goal with the person's pre-existing values and interests). Data from a cross-sectional online survey with 536 German drivers revealed that self-reported eco-driving was significantly predicted by sustained effort towards eco-driving, which in turn was predicted by self-concordance variables. Therefore, individuals pursuing eco-driving out of strong interest or deep personal beliefs (i.e., autonomous motivation) as opposed to external forces or internal pressures (i.e., controlled motivation) reported greater effort towards this behavior. Furthermore, biospheric striving coherence, i.e., the coherence between personal valuable biopsheric values (i. e., values addressing the well-being of the environment/biosphere) and eco-driving, significantly predicted effort towards eco-driving. In sum, our results suggest that autonomous rather than controlled motives and coherence between behavior and intrinsic rather than extrinsic values are relevant predictors for eco-driving. We discuss implications for future strategies and interventions fostering eco-driving in the long term.

AB In this paper, a multilevel humanlike motion planning approach is proposed for indoor mobile robots. Compared with existing approaches, the novelty of this paper is twofold: 1) the proposed path planning framework is multilevel and humanlike to ensure both foreseeability and flexibility, wherein functions of human brain, eyes, and legs are corresponding to global path planning, sensor-level path planning, and action-level path planning, respectively, and 2) along the planned path, a new velocity-adjustable trajectory planning algorithm is put forward which is provably complete and time optimal considering multiple constraints from both the robot and the environment. Experimental results show that the proposed approach has a better performance in terms of efficiency, smoothness, foreseeability, and flexibility, and autonomous navigation is realized in largescale, dynamic, partially unknown, and unstructured indoor environments.
   Note to Practitioners-This paper was motivated by the motion planning problem for mobile robots in complex indoor environments. Existing approaches generally implement a two-level planning scheme, namely, global path planning and local trajectory planning. This paper proposes a novel multilevel humanlike motion planning approach, which is able to guarantee efficiency, smoothness, foreseeability, and flexibility in the presence of kinematic and environmental constraints. Experimental results show that autonomous navigation with the proposed approach is realized in large-scale, dynamic, partially unknown, and unstructured indoor environments, but human motion prediction has not yet been incorporated. In the future research, we will concentrate on human-robot interaction and environment-adaptive planning.

AB Current approaches of applied in urban focus on decoupling the perception training from the driving policy training. The main reason is to avoid training a convolution encoder alongside a policy network, which is known to have issues related to sample efficiency, degenerated feature representations, and catastrophic self-overfitting. However, this paradigm can lead to representations of the environment that are not aligned with the downstream task, which may result in suboptimal performances. To address this limitation, this paper proposes RLAD, the first method applied in the urban ad domain. We propose several techniques to enhance the performance of an rlfp algorithm in this domain, including: 1) an image encoder that leverages both image augmentations and layers; 2) WayConv1D, which is a waypoint encoder that harnesses the 2D geometrical information of the waypoints using 1D convolutions; and 3) an auxiliary loss to increase the significance of the traffic lights in the latent representation of the environment. Experimental results show that RLAD significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art rlfp methods on the NoCrash benchmark. We also present an infraction analysis on the NoCrash-regular benchmark, which indicates that RLAD performs better than all other methods in terms of both collision rate and red light infractions. The source code of RLAD is available at https://github.com/DanielCoelho112/rlad.

AB In future transportation systems, the charging behavior of electric autonomous mobility on demand (AMoD) fleets, i.e., fleets of electric self-driving cars that service on-demand trip requests, will likely challenge power distribution networks (PDNs), causing overloads or voltage drops. In this article, we show that these challenges can be significantly attenuated if the PDNs' operational constraints and exogenous loads (e.g., from homes or businesses) are accounted for when operating an electric AMoD fleet. We focus on a system-level perspective, assuming full coordination between the AMoD and the PDN operators. From this single entity perspective, we assess potential coordination benefits. Specifically, we extend previous results on an optimization-based modeling approach for electric AMoD systems to jointly control an electric AMoD fleet and a series of PDNs, and analyze the benefit of coordination under load balancing constraints. For a case study of Orange County, CA, USA, we show that the coordination between the electric AMoD fleet and the PDNs eliminates 99% of the overloads and 50% of the voltage drops that the electric AMoD fleet would cause in an uncoordinated setting. Our results show that coordinating electric AMoD and PDNs can help maintain the reliability of PDNs under additional electric AMoD charging load, thus significantly mitigating or deferring the need for PDN capacity upgrades.

AB Deployment of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in various sectors such as disaster hit environments, industries, agriculture, etc., not only improves productivity but also reduces human intervention resulting in sustainable benefits. In this regard, we present a model for autonomous navigation and collision avoidance of UAVs in GPS-denied corridor environments. In the first stage, we suggest a fast procedure to estimate the set of parallel lines whose intersection would yield the position of the vanishing point (VP) inside the corridor. A suitable measure is then formulated based on the position of VP on the intersecting lines in reference to any of the image boundary axes. The knowledge of VP location alongside the formulated mechanism govern the necessary set of commands to safely navigate the UAV avoiding any collision with the side walls. Furthermore, the relative Euclidean distance scale expansion of matched scale-invariant keypoints in a pair of frames is taken into account to estimate the depth of a frontal obstacle; usually a wall at the end of the corridor. However, turbulence in the UAV arising due to its rotors or other external factors such as wind may introduce uncertainty in depth estimation. It is rectified with the help of a constant velocity aided Kalman filter model. Necessary set of control commands are then generated to avoid the frontal wall before collision. Exhaustive experiments in different corridors reveal the efficacy of the proposed scheme.

AB We propose a solution towards the problem of autonomous flight in man-made indoor environments with a micro aerial vehicle (MAV), using a frontal camera, a downward-facing sonar, and odometry inputs. While steering an MAV towards distant features that we call vistas, we build a map of the environment in a parallel tracking and mapping fashion to infer the wall structure and avoid lateral collisions in real-time. Our framework overcomes the limitations of traditional monocular SLAM approaches that are prone to failure when operating in feature-poor environments and when the camera purely rotates. First, we overcome the common dependency on feature-rich environments by detecting Wall-Floor Features (WFFs), a novel type of low-dimensional landmarks that are specifically designed for man-made environments to capture the geometric structure of the scene. We show that WFFs not only reveal the structure of the scene, but can also be tracked reliably. Second, we cope with difficult robot motions and environments by fusing the visual data with odometry measurements in a principled manner. This allows the robot to continue tracking when it purely rotates and when it temporarily navigates across a completely featureless environment. We demonstrate our results on a small commercially available quad-rotor platform flying in a typical feature-poor indoor environment. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Beam steering devices represent an essential part of an advanced optics toolbox and are needed in a spectrum of technologies ranging from astronomy and agriculture to biosensing and networked vehicles. Diffraction gratings with strain-tunable periodicity simplify beam steering and can serve as a foundation for light/laser radar (LIDAR/LADAR) components of robotic systems. However, the mechanical properties of traditional materials severely limit the beam steering angle and cycle life. The large strain applied to gratings can severely impair the device performance both in respect of longevity and diffraction pattern fidelity. Here, we show that this problem can be resolved using micromanufactured kirigami patterns from thin film nanocomposites based on high-performance stiff plastics, metals, and carbon nanotubes, etc. The kirigami pattern of microscale slits reduces the stochastic concentration of strain in stiff nanocompo sites including those made by layer-by-layer assembly (LBL). The slit patterning affords reduction of strain by 2 orders of magnitude for stretching deformation and consequently enables reconfigurable optical gratings with over a 100% range of period tunability. Elasticity of the stiff nanocomposites and plastics makes possible cyclic reconfigurability of the grating with variable time constant that can also be referred to as 4D kirigami. High-contrast, sophisticated diffraction patterns with as high as fifth diffraction order can be obtained. The angular range of beam steering can be as large as 6.5 degrees for a 635 nm laser beam compared to similar to 1 degrees in surface-grooved elastomer gratings and similar to 0.02 degrees in MEMS gratings. The versatility of the kirigami patterns, the diversity of the available nano composite materials, and their advantageous mechanical properties of the foundational materials open the path for engineering of reconfigurable optical elements in LIDARs essential for autonomous vehicles and other optical devices with spectral range determined by the kirigami periodicity.

AB This paper investigates the tracking control of the autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) with the time-varying disturbances. While the echo state network (ESN) accounts for the unknown dynamics in the model, a model-based event-triggered control (MBETC) scheme is presented by using the compound learning technique, which combines the learning of the ESN and the estimation of the compound disturbance. Different from the existing compound learning, the proposed scheme updates the estimates of the ESN weights and the compound disturbances in an event-triggered manner, in which two novel prediction errors are involved in their update laws. The values of prediction errors are obtained by using the online-recorded data during the inter-event time. To solve the recently proposed problem of ''jumps of virtual control laws'' arising in the backstepping-based event-triggered control (ETC), an event-triggered adaptive model is established to generate the continuous estimates of the states and direct the control laws. By the merit of ETC, the proposed scheme can importantly reduce the communication traffic in the measurement network compared with its continuous substitutes. By the merit of online-recorded-data-based compound learning, the proposed scheme can achieve the good understanding of synthetic uncertainties. All the errors in the closed-loop system are proved to be semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Finally, a numerical example corroborates the proposed scheme.

AB We present a practical approach to global motion planning and terrain assessment for ground robots in generic three-dimensional (3D) environments, including rough outdoor terrain, multilevel facilities, and more complex geometries. Our method computes optimized six-dimensional trajectories compliant with curvature and continuity constraints directly on unordered point cloud maps, omitting any kind of explicit surface reconstruction, discretization, or topology extraction. We assess terrain geometry and traversability on demand during motion planning, by fitting robot-sized planar patches to the map and analyzing the local distribution of map points. Our motion planning approach consists of sampling-based initial trajectory generation, followed by precise local optimization according to a custom cost measure, using a novel, constraint-aware trajectory optimization paradigm. We embed these methods in a complete autonomous navigation system based on localization and mapping by means of a 3D laser scanner and iterative closest point matching, suitable for both static and dynamic environments. The performance of the planning and terrain assessment algorithms is evaluated in offline experiments using recorded and simulated sensor data. Finally, we present the results of navigation experiments in three different environments-rough outdoor terrain, a two-level parking garage, and a dynamic environment, demonstrating how the proposed methods enable autonomous navigation in complex 3D terrain.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; AVOIDANCE
AB Sampling-based model predictive control (MPC) optimization methods, such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI), have recently shown promising results in various robotic tasks. However, it might produce an infeasible trajectory when the distributions of all sampled trajectories are concentrated within high-cost even infeasible regions. In this study, we propose a new method called log-MPPI equipped with a more effective trajectory sampling distribution policy which significantly improves the trajectory feasibility in terms of satisfying system constraints. The key point is to draw the trajectory samples from the normal log-normal (NLN) mixture distribution, rather than from Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, this work presents a method for collision-free navigation in unknown cluttered environments by incorporating the 2D occupancy grid map into the optimization problem of the sampling-based MPC algorithm. We first validate the efficiency and robustness of our proposed control strategy through extensive simulations of 2D autonomous navigation in different types of cluttered environments as well as the cartpole swing-up task. We further demonstrate, through real-world experiments, the applicability of log-MPPI for performing a 2D grid-based collision-free navigation in an unknown cluttered environment, showing its superiority to be utilized with the local costmap without adding additional complexity to the optimization problem. A video demonstrating the real-world and simulation results is available at https://youtu.be/_uGWQEFJSN0.

DE side-scan sonar; segmentation; CNN; large kernel; multi-channel
AB The AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) navigation process relies on the interaction of a variety of sensors. The side-scan sonar can collect underwater images and obtain semantic underwater environment information after processing, which will help improve the ability of AUV autonomous navigation. However, there is no practical method to utilize the semantic information of side scan sonar image. A new convolutional neural network model is proposed to solve this problem in this paper. The model is a standard codec structure, which extracts multi-channel features from the input image and then fuses them to reduce parameters and strengthen the weight of feature channels. Then, a larger convolution kernel is used to extract the features of large-scale sonar images more effectively. Finally, a parallel compensation link with a small-scale convolution kernel is added and spliced with features extracted from a large convolution kernel in the decoding part to obtain features of different scales. We use this model to conduct experiments on self-collected sonar data sets, which were uploaded on github. The experimental results show that ACC and MIoU reach 0.87 and 0.71, better than other classical small-order semantic segmentation networks. Furthermore, the 347.52 g FOLP and the number of parameters around 13 m also ensure the computing speed and portability of the network. The result can extract the semantic information of the side-scan sonar image and assist with AUV autonomous navigation and mapping.

AB A Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) helps vehicles send and receive environmental and traffic information, making it a crucial component towards fully autonomous roads. For VANETs to serve their purpose, there has to be sufficient coverage, even in areas where there is less demand. Moreover, a lot of the safety information is time-sensitive; excessive delay in data transfer can increase the risk of fatal accidents. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be used as mobile base-stations to fill in gaps of coverage. The placement of these UAVs is crucial towards how well the system performs. We are particularly interested in the placement of mobile base-stations for a rural highway with sparse traffic, as it represents the worst-case scenario for vehicular communication. Instead of heuristic or linear programming methods for optimal placement, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). The main benefit of MARL is that it allows the agents to learn model-free through experience. We propose a variation of the traditional Deep Independent Q-Learning. The modifications include an observation function augmented with information directly shared between neighbouring agents as well a shared policy scheme. We also implement a custom sparse highway simulator that is used for training and testing our algorithm. Our testing shows that the proposed MARL algorithm is able to learn the placement policies that produce the maximum rewards for different scenarios while adapting to the dynamic road densities along the service area. Our experiments show that our model is scalable, allowing the number of agents to increase without any modifications to the code. Finally, we show that our model can be generalized as the algorithm can be directly used on an industry standard simulator with similar performance. Future experiments can be performed to improve the realism and complexity of the highway models as well as to test the method on real-world data.

ID TRACKING
AB The spatial information provided by 3-D object detection is critical for autonomous driving. Although visual-based object detection has made significant progress in 2-D/3-D in recent years, nonvisual sensors such as 3-D light detection and ranging (LiDAR) still have inherent advantages in the accuracy (ACC) of object localization. However, the challenge still lies in the interpretability of the sparse point clouds it generates and the difficulty of being manually annotated. In this article, we propose an online transfer learning framework based on multimodal sensor systems for 3-D object detection of urban road participants including pedestrians, cyclists, and cars. The framework aims to automatically and efficiently transfer object detection capabilities from 2-D monocular camera to 3-D LiDAR through a multitarget tracker-based pipeline, enabling knowledge transfer between sensors of different modalities. Furthermore, online random forest (ORF), an inherently fast and multiclass learning method, is innovatively integrated into our system. Experiments on two very different datasets, including KITTI and Waymo, demonstrate that the proposed framework not only rapidly builds 3-D detection capabilities about road participants in a single dataset but also maintains this capability across datasets. This reveals that the proposed framework is particularly suitable for in situ deployment of unmanned vehicles and can also solve the problem of insufficient generalization ability of current offline-trained detectors.

AB The use of UAVs in areas ranging from agriculture over urban services to entertainment or simply as a hobby has rapidly grown over the last years. Regarding serious/commercial applications, UAVs have been considered in the literature, especially as mobile sensing/actuation platforms (i.e., as a delivery platform for an increasingly wide range of sensors and actuators). With regard to timely, cost-effective and very rich data acquisition, both, NEC Research as well as TNO are pursuing investigations into the use of UAVs and swarms of UAVs for scenarios where high-resolution requirements, prohibiting environments or tight time constraints render traditional approaches ineffective. In this review article, we provide a brief overview of safety and security-focused application areas that we identified as main targets for industrial and commercial projects, especially in the context of intelligent autonomous systems and autonomous/semi-autonomously operating swarms. We discuss a number of challenges related to the deployment of UAVs in general and to their deployment within the identified application areas in particular. As such, this article is meant to serve as a review and overview of the literature and the state-of-the-art, but also to offer an outlook over our possible (near-term) future work and the challenges that we will face there.

AB The autonomous driving technology based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been confirmed as one of the most cutting-edge research fields worldwide. The agent is enabled to achieve the goal of making independent decisions by interacting with the environment and learning driving strategies based on the feedback from the environment. This technology has been widely used in end-to-end driving tasks. However, this field faces several challenges. First, developing real vehicles is expensive, time-consuming, and risky. To further expedite the testing, verification, and iteration of end-to-end deep reinforcement learning algorithms, a joint simulation development and validation platform was designed and implemented in this study based on VTD-CarSim and the Tensorflow deep learning framework, and research work was conducted based on this platform. Second, sparse reward signals can cause problems (e.g., a low-sample learning rate). It is imperative for the agent to be capable of navigating in an unfamiliar environment and driving safely under a wide variety of weather or lighting conditions. To address the problem of poor generalization ability of the agent to unknown scenarios, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) decision-making and planning method was proposed in this study in accordance with a multi-task fusion strategy. The main task based on DRL decision-making planning and the auxiliary task based on image semantic segmentation were cross-fused, and part of the network was shared with the main task to reduce the possibility of model overfitting and improve the generalization ability. As indicated by the experimental results, first, the joint simulation development and validation platform built in this study exhibited prominent versatility. Users were enabled to easily substitute any default module with customized algorithms and verify the effectiveness of new functions in enhancing overall performance using other default modules of the platform. Second, the deep reinforcement learning strategy based on multi-task fusion proposed in this study was competitive. Its performance was better than other DRL algorithms in certain tasks, which improved the generalization ability of the vehicle decision-making planning algorithm.

ID SHORT-RANGE LEAKAGE; FMCW RADAR; TRANSCEIVERS
AB The first approaches to improve vehicle safety were so-called passive safety systems, which did not directly interfere with the driving process but protected the occupants during a crash. In contrast, the first assistance system was the antilock braking system (ABS) successfully introduced in the early 1970s. This active system was developed to avoid an accident by automatically intervening in the braking behavior of the car. At about the same time, the first automotive radar prototype was presented. Since the invention of this very unwieldy radar system, organizations all around the world spent significant efforts in pushing the development of automotive radar systems forward. Today, radar sensors together with ultrasound sensors, lidar, and cameras form the backbone of advanced driver assistant systems (ADASs) as well as autonomous driving (AD), which is in the prototype stage. In particular, because of their robustness against adverse lighting and weather conditions, radar sensors are considered a key technology for modem vehicle safety and comfort systems. Along with the trend toward higher automation, more cars will be equipped with radar sensors in the near future. Because ADASs directly influence the vehicle dynamics, new regulating functional safety (FuSa) requirements, such as the ISO 26262 standard, were introduced. These requirements are mandatory to protect the road users.
   Modern automotive radar systems make use of the frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) principle. Despite many advantages to pulse-based radars, one of the most limiting factors of an FMCW radar is the phase noise (PN) contained in the transmit (Tx) signal, which significantly affects the sensitivity and range. To fulfill the ISO 26262 standard, it is thus of high importance to monitor the PN of a radar system throughout its whole lifecycle. In this article, we present the most common PN measurement and estimation techniques for CW signals. Further, we address the problem of estimating the PN of an FMCW signal, which is of particular relevance for automotive FMCW radars and the aforementioned monitoring to fulfill the FuSa requirements. Finally, we present state-of-the-art methods for PN estimation and monitoring in automotive FMCW radar systems.

AB Structure from motion (SFM), a research hotspot in the intelligent transportation field (including autonomous driving, environmental perception and augmented reality (AR) for artificial intelligence terminals), can automatically recover ego-motion state estimations and 3D scene reconstructions from multiple images or video sequences. Most existing vision methods operate offline in indoor scenes, and their reconstruction accuracies greatly depend on the tracking lifetimes and accuracies of feature points. Reprojection matrix and redundant regression noise computations are exponential disasters for the calculation and reconstruction drift of large-scale scenes. This paper proposes a quadruple tripatch-wise modular architecture (QTMA) for autonomous vehicle stereo image sequences that decomposes rigid scenes into nonrigid motion-segmented pieces for reconstruction. An advanced energy function for salient image features is established by combining multiple feature types with weighted finite-element mesh. Closed quadruple annular matching and relocation are performed via multiresolution pyramid images. The proposed incremental integral-mapping calculation method and unique tree-like stacked storage containers prolong the tracking lifetimes of consecutive frames and ensure the spatiotemporal consistency and robustness of the homonymous image features in different subsequences. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of this architecture for different transportation scenes; the frame rate processing speed reaches 30 fps, the calculation accuracy regarding the path distance difference reaches 99.49%, and the estimation results regarding the maximum speeds of motion are closer to the ground truth. The translation error of the motion pose is 0.0136%, and the rotation error is 0.0035 [deg/m], which has more yaw stability than the existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, in the reconstructed point cloud quality demonstration, the mean value of roughness is reduced by 40.127%, the mean value of density is improved by 27.701%, and the accuracy reaches 91.149% within a certain distance tolerance. This paper has significant theoretical research value and application potential for positioning, path tracking, and navigation in adaptive cruise control (ACC) and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).

AB We survey research on self-driving cars published in the literature focusing on autonomous cars developed since the DARPA challenges, which are equipped with an autonomy system that can be categorized as SAE level 3 or higher. The architecture of the autonomy system of self-driving cars is typically organized into the perception system and the decision-making system. The perception system is generally divided into many subsystems responsible for tasks such as self-driving-car localization, static obstacles mapping, moving obstacles detection and tracking, road mapping, traffic signalization detection and recognition, among others. The decision-making system is commonly partitioned as well into many subsystems responsible for tasks such as route planning, path planning, behavior selection, motion planning, and control. In this survey, we present the typical architecture of the autonomy system of self-driving cars. We also review research on relevant methods for perception and decision making. Furthermore, we present a detailed description of the architecture of the autonomy system of the self-driving car developed at the Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo (UFES), named Intelligent Autonomous Robotics Automobile (IARA). Finally, we list prominent self-driving car research platforms developed by academia and technology companies, and reported in the media.

AB Living labs (LLs) are identified as innovation ecosystems to test and facilitate the diffusion of complex technological innovation, rising attention especially on cutting-edge automotive technologies. Autonomous and connected vehicles are indeed expected to deeply affect the automotive industry and the society in the coming years, by involving important technological, political, social, and legal issues. In such a complex framework, where different fields and stakeholders are deeply intertwined, new modes of interaction between multiple actors are necessary to support such technological innovation. By focusing on the case of the Modena Automotive Smart Area, an urban LL located within the Italian Motor Valley, we analyze the evolution of roles and relationships among the involved government, academia and industry actors. More specifically, by adopting the lens of Triple Helix model in practice, the purpose of the paper is to analyze how the actors contribute to and relate within the knowledge, consensus and innovation spaces, in a time span from before the formal inception of the LL to three years after. Results highlight how actors' collaboration and participation unfold in the creation of the LL when complex innovative technologies are tested in real urban environment, hence contributing to burgeoning literature on LL and the current academic debate on triple helix model. Policy and practical implications are also derived

AB The integration of artificial intelligence and wireless communication technologies in communicant autonomous vehicles (CAVs) enables coordinating the movement of CAV platoons at signal-free intersections. The capacity of signal-free intersections can be significantly improved by adjusting traffic variables at a macroscopic scale; however, the resulting improvement in the capacity does not necessarily have a positive impact on the energy consumption of CAVs at the network level. In this research, we develop an analytical model to enhance energy efficiency by optimizing macroscopic traffic variables in signal-free networks. To this end, we adopt a macro-scopic modeling approach to estimate the operational capacity by accounting for the stochasticity resulting from the error in synchronizing the arrival and departure of consecutive platoons in crossing directions at in-tersections. We also develop a macrolevel analytical model to estimate expected energy loss during the accel-eration/deceleration maneuver required for resynchronization at intersections as a function of synchronization success probability. We then maximize energy efficiency by minimizing expected energy loss and maximizing expected capacity in a biobjective optimization framework. We solve the energy efficiency problem using an analytical approach to derive a closed-form solution for the optimal traffic speed and the length of the marginal gap between the passage of consecutive platoons in crossing directions through intersections for a (general) normal distribution of the operational error. Having the closed-form solution of the energy efficiency problem, we balance the trade-off between energy loss and operational capacity at a large scale by extending the analytical model to the network level using the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) concept. The results of our two -ring simulation model indicate the accuracy of the proposed analytical model in estimating the macroscopic relationship between the expected energy loss at intersections and the vehicular density in signal-free networks. Our numerical results also show that optimizing the traffic speed and marginal gap length can improve energy efficiency by 31% at the cost of a 16% decrease in maximum capacity.

AB The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) has been applied to many areas, e.g., the autonomous ground vehicle, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), precision agriculture, smart city, and the GNSS-reflectometry (GNSS-R), being of considerable significance over the past few decades. Unfortunately, the GNSS signal performance has the high risk of being reduced by the environmental interference. The vector tracking (VT) technique is promising to enhance the robustness in high dynamics as well as improve the sensitivity against the weak environment of the GNSS receiver. However, the time-correlated error coupled in the receiver clock estimations in terms of the VT loop can decrease the accuracy of the navigation solution. There are few works present dealing with this issue. In this work, the Allan variance is accordingly exploited to specify a model which is expected to account for this type of error based on the 1st-order Gauss-Markov (GM) process. Then, it is used for proposing an enhanced Kalman filter (KF) by which this error can be suppressed. Furthermore, the proposed system model makes use of the innovation sequence so that the process covariance matrix can be adaptively adjusted and updated. The field tests demonstrate the performance of the proposed adaptive vector-tracking time-correlated error suppressed Kalman filter (A-VTTCES-KF). When compared with the results produced by the ordinary adaptive KF algorithm in terms of the VT loop, the real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning and code-based differential global positioning system (DGPS) positioning accuracies have been improved by 14.17% and 9.73%, respectively. On the other hand, the RTK positioning performance has been increased by maximum 21.40% when compared with the results obtained from the commercial low-cost U-Blox receiver.

ID VISUALIZATION
AB In recent years, end-to-end imitation learning-based deep neural networks (DNN) have been successfully applied to several autonomous driving tasks. Meanwhile, however, the large uncertainties with respect to the reliability of the DNN's decision-making mechanism significantly limit the application of DNN-based approaches in the safety-critical domain of autonomous driving. In this work, a comprehensive analytical method of the DNN's decision-making mechanism is proposed for developing a reliable imitation learning-based end-to-end visual solution for automated lane keeping on the highway in a co-simulation environment. During the mechanism analysis, three progressive and crucial questions covering from the DNN's decision-making basis to decision itself can be explicitly answered using the modified algorithms of Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and the theoretical knowledge of vehicle dynamics; During the model development, the DNN's architecture is stepwise improved based on the intermediate analytical and test results in the imperfect and failure cases, aimed at increasing the DNN's lane keeping imitation accuracy and robustness from a superficial point of view as well as enhancing the reliability of the DNN's decision-making mechanism from an essential point of view. The DNN's lane keeping performance is quantitatively evaluated based on a proposed evaluation method considering 3 vital perspectives regarding vehicle dynamics. The ultimate test results show that the final proposed DNN model, which has a reliable decision-making mechanism, achieves a satisfactory lane keeping performance with a high imitation accuracy and robustness, and outperforms the state-of-the-art lane keeping approaches based on the end-to-end DNN models and the traditional modular solution.

ID VISUAL PLACE RECOGNITION
AB Place recognition and loop closure detection are critical steps in the process of Simultaneous Localiza-tion and Mapping (SLAM). Indeed, the ability to determine whether an Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) has returned to a previously visited place is highly important in the context of building a reliable SLAM system. In order to build a consistent global map and to localize the AGV with high confidence in an unknown environment, it is crucial to reduce the cumulative error generated by pose estimation. Although multiple approaches using various data sources have been proposed in order to provide an accurate pose estimation, fewer studies have focused on the integration of a multimodal process to detect loop closure. In this work, we present a novel approach to leverage multiple modalities for a robust and reliable loop closure detection. Our method is based on Similarity-Guided Particle Filtering (SGPF) for the search and validation of Loop Closure Candidates (LCCs). We validate the proposed Multimodal Loop Closure (MMLC) by using two perception modalities based on Bag-of-Words and Scan Context techniques for camera-based and LiDAR-based place recognition, respectively. The efficiency of our method has been evaluated on both KITTI and a self-collected dataset. Compared to the classical loop closure used in ORB-SLAM2, the suggested approach reduces the Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by up to 54% and the cumulative error during run-time by up to 62.63%. Finally, 100% of the loops are accurately detected and the ground truth distance between the current pose and the LC is less than 3 m in 98% of the cases. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The soft package lithium-ion battery has been used as AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle) power supply because of its advantages such as high safety, high energy density and low self-discharge rate. However, the discharge mechanism of the cell at high hydrostatic pressure is still not clear. In this paper, the electrochemical performance of cells at different hydrostatic pressures (0.1 MPa, 30 MPa, 60 MPa, 90 MPa) was investigated comprehensively, and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was used to evaluate the lithium ions diffusion rate in the solid phase of the LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 electrode at different pressures. The internal resis-tance of the cell was quantitatively measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and the parameter values of each impedance in the equivalent circuit were obtained. The results showed that the high hydrostatic pressure can improve the electrochemical performance of the cell by increasing the diffusion rate of lithium ions in the initial cycle stage. In addition, the hydrostatic pressure alleviates the overpotential loss caused by con-centration polarization, and improves the cell closed circuit voltage and discharge capacity. Unfortunately, in the late cycle stage of the test, the cell capacity at high hydrostatic pressure declines seriously and the cell capacity degradation mechanism was further revealed by scanning electron microscopy and ex-situ X-ray diffraction. The prediction model of capacity loss (Qloss) was established at high hydrostatic pressure based on Arrhenius law. The findings on the electrochemical performance and capacity degradation mechanism at high hydrostatic pressure can provide reference for reliability analysis of the battery pack of deep-sea AUV.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with onboard sensors empower end-users to collect data within a wide range of civil engineering applications such as structural condition assessment. While UAVs have been used primarily as mobile sensing platforms to obtain imagery or other data, their mobility can also be used to deploy sensor networks. In this study, the feasibility of using an autonomous UAV to deploy wireless sensors in structural monitoring applications is proposed. While GPS-based waypoint navigation is available for automating UAV flight operations, this approach does not provide the accuracy necessary for the precision placement of sensor payloads on structures. Computer vision-based pose estimation is proposed to improve the accuracy of UAV localization for sensor placement. Variably sized fiducial markers integrated into a single pattern are applied to the surface of the structure and adopted as navigation and precision landing targets that identify sensor placement locations. Visual and inertial measurements are fused by means of a discrete Kalman filter to further increase the robustness of the relative position estimation algorithm that is included in the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control law used for UAV landing. Outdoor experiments under realistic operational conditions are conducted to validate the proposed vision-aided control of the UAV for sensor placement; the UAV is able to land on a predefined landing point within 10 cm. A UAV moving a wireless accelerometer to locations on a beam is used to experimentally show the validity of automating UAV sensor placement for modal analysis using reconfigurable sensor network topologies.

AB In a complex underwater environment, finding a viable, collision-free path for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is a challenging task. The purpose of this paper is to establish a safe, real-time, and robust method of collision avoidance that improves the autonomy of AUVs. We propose a method based on active sonar, which utilizes a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the processed sonar information to navigate the AUV in an uncertain environment. We compare the performance of double deep Q-network algorithms with that of a genetic algorithm and deep learning. We propose a line-of-sight guidance method to mitigate abrupt changes in the yaw direction and smooth the heading changes when the AUV switches trajectory. The different experimental results show that the double deep Q-network algorithms ensure excellent collision avoidance performance. The effectiveness of the algorithm proposed in this paper was verified in three environments: random static, mixed static, and complex dynamic. The results show that the proposed algorithm has significant advantages over other algorithms in terms of success rate, collision avoidance performance, and generalization ability. The double deep Q-network algorithm proposed in this paper is superior to the genetic algorithm and deep learning in terms of the running time, total path, performance in avoiding collisions with moving obstacles, and planning time for each step. After the algorithm is trained in a simulated environment, it can still perform online learning according to the information of the environment after deployment and adjust the weight of the network in real-time. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach has significant potential for practical applications.

AB This paper presents a path planner solution that makes it possible to autonomously explore underground mines with aerial robots (typically multicopters). In these environments the operations may be limited by many factors like the lack of external navigation signals, the narrow passages and the absence of radio communications. The designed path planner is defined as a simple and highly computationally efficient algorithm that, only relying on a laser imaging detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensor with Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) capability, permits the exploration of a set of single-level mining tunnels. It performs dynamic planning based on exploration vectors, a novel variant of the open sector method with reinforced filtering. The algorithm incorporates global awareness and obstacle avoidance modules. The first one prevents the possibility of getting trapped in a loop, whereas the second one facilitates the navigation along narrow tunnels. The performance of the proposed solution has been tested in different study cases with a Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulator developed for this purpose. In all situations the path planner logic performed as expected and the used routing was optimal. Furthermore, the path efficiency, measured in terms of traveled distance and used time, was high when compared with an ideal reference case. The result is a very fast, real-time, and static memory capable algorithm, which implemented on the proposed architecture presents a feasible solution for the autonomous exploration of underground mines.

AB Advancement in the fields of electrification, automation, and digitalisation and emerging social trends are fuelling the transformation of road transport resulting in the introduction of various innovative mobility solutions. Yet the reaction of people to many of the new solutions is still vastly unknown. This creates an unprecedented quandary for transport planners who are requested to design future transport systems and create the related investment plans without fully validated models to base the assessment upon. As some evidence on citizens' behaviour concerning new mobility solutions starts to be progressively made available, first attempts to update the existing models begin to emerge. Nevertheless, a lot more is needed as some of the transpiring mobility solutions have not yet reached the market, making the corresponding behaviour changes imponderable. In this context, the main purpose of this paper is to provide a review on how travel behaviour changes linked to the deployment of new mobility solutions have been considered in travel demand models. The new mobility solutions studied include carsharing, dynamic ridesharing, micromobility sharing services, and personal and shared autonomous vehicles. An overview and comparison of relevant studies implementing activity or trip-based demand models and other methodologies are presented. The analysis shows that the results of the different studies heavily depend on the extent to which behavioural changes are considered. The results of the review thus point to the need for holistic demand models that carefully mimic the urban reality with everything it has to offer and account for the importance of individual traits in the decision-making processes. Such models need an in-depth understanding of the microscopic mechanisms leading to the travel behaviour shifts linked to the most innovative mobility solutions. To achieve this level of detail, mobility living labs and their real-life experiments and experience with citizens, which are flourishing in Europe, are suggested to play a crucial role in the years to come.

AB The security of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has always been a concern. The constantly changing IoV data under varying traffic conditions made it unsuitable for the IoV to adopt traditional anti-attack techniques. In the absence of protections, attackers can use in-car communication as a target to compromise the safety of passengers, hence the instancy to detect the security state of the IoV. However, currently available solutions require modifications to the original hardware of the IoV and are therefore very limited in applicability. In this paper, we propose a security assessment method for IoV based on Microcontroller Unit (MCU) chip temperature, called SAMCT. Specifically, we first record the MCU chip temperatures of IoV device in different security states and analyze the relationship between them. Second, the fingerprint dataset is built using the temperature residuals. Third, to forecast the security standing of IoV devices, an integration regression model based on Self-Encoders is suggested. Lastly, in order to facilitate the effectiveness of the SAMCT, a Cloud-Edge-End framework is designed with the technology of model adaptive partitioning. Results from the experiments, which were carried out on the Raspberry Pi 4B and Stm32 hardware platforms, demonstrate that the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the SAMCT is only 0.00104 and that the execution efficiency improvement under the Cloud-Edge-End framework is significant. Note to Practitioners-This paper was inspired by security concerns in Internet of Vehicles communication systems. The core of this work is to provide a novel security assessment method for IoV devices based on MCU temperature, which can detect the security status of IoV devices in real-time without modifying the original hardware. To this end, the different skills from scheme design to detection and validation are explained. One crucial part of this work is to regard the MCU temperature of the IoV device as a security reference and fully integrate the critical techniques in deep learning. In addition, the proposed scheme is universal and can be applied to various scenarios such as the autonomous driving and the industrial internet of things.

AB This paper presents a method which can effectively acquire free space on a plane for moving forward in safety by using height information of objects. This method can be applied to free space extraction on a road, and, in short, it is a road extraction method for an autonomous vehicle. Since a road area can be assumed to be a sequence of flat planes in Front of a vehicle, it is effective to apply the inverse perspective projection model to the ground plane. However, conventional methods using this model have a drawback in that some areas on the road plane are wrongly detected as obstacle areas since these methods are sensitive to the error of the camera geometry with respect to the assumed plane. In order to overcome this drawback, the proposed approach named the Planar Projection Stereopsis (PPS) method supplies, to the road extraction method using the inverse perspective projection model, a contrivance for removing these erroneous areas effectively. Since PPS uses the inverse perspective projection model, both left and right images are projected to the road plane and obstacle areas are detected by examining the difference between these projected images. Because detected obstacle areas include a lot of erroneous areas, PPS examines the shapes of the obstacle areas and eliminates falsely detected areas on the road plane by using the following properties: obstacles whose heights are different from the road plane are projected to the shapes falling backward from the location where the obstacles touch the road plane; and the length of shapes falling backward depends on the location of obstacles in relation to the stereoscopic cameras and the height of obstacles in relation to the road plane. Experimental results for real road scenes have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method. The quantitative evaluation of the results has shown that on average 89.3% of the real road area can be extracted and the average of the falsely extracted ratio is 1.4%. Since the road area can be extracted by simple projection of images and subtraction of projected images from a set of stereo images, our method can be applied to realtime operation.

This competitive factor of 9 is optimal. We investigate the case where the target is known to be within a fixed distance, r, of the start point, and determine the optimum competitive factor, C(r) < 9, that can be achieved by a competitive strategy S(r), under this additional assumption.

AB 3D visual recognition is a prerequisite for most autonomous robotic systems operating in the real world. It empowers robots to perform a variety of tasks, such as tracking, understanding the environment, and human-robot interaction. Autonomous robots equipped with 3D recognition capability can better perform their social roles through supportive task assistance in professional jobs and effective domestic services. For active assistance, social robots must recognize their surroundings, including objects and places to perform the task more efficiently. This article first highlights the value-centric role of social robots in society by presenting recently developed robots and describes their main features. Instigated by the recognition capability of social robots, we present the analysis of data representation methods based on sensor modalities for 3D object and place recognition using deep learning models. In this direction, we delineate the research gaps that need to be addressed, summarize 3D recognition datasets, and present performance comparisons. Finally, a discussion of future research directions concludes the article. This survey is intended to show how recent developments in 3D visual recognition based on sensor modalities using deep-learning-based approaches can lay the groundwork to inspire further research and serves as a guide to those who are interested in vision-based robotics applications.

AB Objective: This study proposed a model to predict passenger motion sickness under the presence of a visual-vestibular conflict and assessed its performance with respect to previously recorded experimental data.
   Background: While several models have been shown useful to predict motion sickness under repetitive motion, improvements are still desired in terms of predicting motion sickness in realistic driving conditions. There remains a need for a model that considers angular and linear visual-vestibular motion inputs in three dimensions to improve prediction of passenger motion sickness.
   Method: The model combined the subjective vertical conflict theory and human motion perception models. The proposed model integrates visual and vestibular sensed 6 DoF motion signals in a novel architecture.
   Results: Model prediction results were compared to motion sickness data obtained from studies conducted in motion simulators as well as on-road vehicle testing, yielding trends that are congruent with observed results in both cases.
   Conclusion: The model demonstrated the ability to predict trends in motion sickness response for conditions in which a passenger performs a task on a handheld device versus facing forward looking ahead under realistic driving conditions. However, further analysis across a larger population is necessary to better assess the model's performance.
   Application: The proposed model can be used as a tool to predict motion sickness under different levels of visual-vestibular conflict. This can be leveraged to design interventions capable of mitigating passenger motion sickness. Further, this model can provide insights that aid in the development of passenger experiences inside autonomous vehicles.

AB Visible light communication (VLC) provides an alternative underwater wireless connectivity solution with its low latency and high data rates albeit at relatively shorter distances in the order of tens of meters. In the context of underwater sensor networks (USNs), VLC is particularly suitable to establish connectivity between "data mule" autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and sensor nodes since communications is enabled only when the sensor node and mule AUV are in close proximity. In this paper, we consider a USN scenario where a solar-powered AUV gathers data from the sensor nodes using VLC signaling. We formulate a three-dimensional trajectory optimization for solar-powered AUVs with the goal of maximizing the harvested energy under constraints imposed by the data transmission. The optimization constraints include the minimum required data transfer rate, therefore a corresponding transmission distance, between the sensors and the AUV. We formulate the problem as a bilevel optimization problem. The lower-level objective function is in the form of traveling salesman problem which determines the optimum sequence order of the sensor nodes to be visited while the upper-level objective function is the optimization of the trajectory between each pair of adjacent nodes for the given order of node visits. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed trajectory significantly prolongs the mission time and autonomous operation of the AUV without the need to return to home base. Furthermore, since the proposed trajectory optimization is reactive to ocean currents, it brings reductions in the energy consumption of the AUVs.

AB Use of the object proposal method as a preprocessing step for object detection of vision sensors has improved computational efficiency in recent years. Good object proposal methods require high object detection recall, low computational cost, good localization accuracy, and repeatability. However, existing methods cannot always achieve a good balance of performance. To solve this problem, we propose a fast and high-performance object proposal algorithm. First, we propose a construction method to enhance frequency features that are combined with a linear classifier to learn and generate a set of proposal boxes. Second, we propose a strategy of binarizing frequency features and classifiers to accelerate the calculation. Last, we propose a merging strategy to improve the localization quality of the proposal boxes. Empirically, for the VOC2007 and MSCOCO2017 datasets using the intersection over union (IOU) threshold of 0.5 and 10(4) proposals, our method achieves 99.3% object detection recall, 81.1% mean average best overlap, and 80% mean repeatability with an average time of 0.0014 seconds per image. The average time is three times faster than the current fastest method, and the mean repeatability is 11% higher than that of the region proposal network (RPN) method. We applied our method to the target detection of autonomous vehicles, and in the experiment with the Oxford RobotCar dataset, we achieved 95.6% detection precision and 91.2% detection recall. This work could provide a new way to improve real-time performance and detection accuracy in the object detection of visual sensors.

LA English

AB As oil and gas exploration goes toward deeper fields in the Brazilian industry scenario, offloading operations emerge as the most viable option to drain production. However, these operations demand expensive resources, such as shuttle tankers and support boats; operational risks, which despite being managed, limited, and mitigated to be as low as reasonably possible, are still present in some stages (i.e., ship's approximation to the oil rig, mooring, hose connection, and so forth); and environment limiting parameters (i.e., wave height, surface-current direction, wind speed and direction, and so forth). Therefore, in this paper, we propose using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in an autonomous mode to carry out the messenger line from the shuttle tanker to the floating, production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) unit or the floating storage and offloading unit (FSO) instead of line-handling (LH) boats (for conventional operations that use those resources) or the messenger-cable-launching guns (for dynamic positioning operations). This represents a viable alternative solution to reducing costs and risks in these tasks and a possibility to eliminate some meteorologic and oceanographic limiting conditions to operations, because the UAV will be susceptible only to wind conditions, and not to sea and visibility conditions, like LHs are. We present the simulated results of the proposed methodology using a robotic operating system (ROS) and the economic gain [derived from cash-flow-cost reducing of operations, payoff time of the investment, net present value (NPV), and internal rate of return] of applying this technology, evaluating its use in a realistic scenario based on a real deepwater oil field in Brazil. The developed controller behaves very well, and simulations showed robust results. In addition, the economic study presents the proposal's attractiveness.

AB The tidally modulated outflow of brackish water from a sea loch forms a thin surface layer that propagates into the coastal ocean as a buoyant gravity current, transporting nutrients and sediments, as well as fresh water, heat and momentum. The fresh intrusion both propagates into and generates a strongly stratified environment which supports trains of nonlinear internal waves (NLIWs). NLIWs are shown to propagate ahead of this buoyancy input in response to propagation of the outflow water into the stratified environment generated by the previous release as well as in the opposing direction after the reflection from steep bathymetry. Oblique aerial photographs were taken and photogrammetric rectification led to the identification of the buoyant intrusion and the subsequent generation of NLIWs. An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) was deployed on repeated reciprocal transects in order to make simultaneous CTD, ADCP, and microstructure shear measurements of the evolution of these phenomena in conjunction with conventional mooring measurements. AUV-based temperature and salinity signals of NLIWs of depression were observed together with increased turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates of over 2 orders of magnitude within and in the wake of the NLIWs. Repeated measurements allow a unique opportunity to investigate the horizontal structure of these phenomena. Simple metric scaling demonstrates that these processes are likely to be feature of many fjordic systems located on the west coast of Scotland but may also play a key role in the assimilation of the outflow from many tidally dominated fjordic systems throughout the world.

AB For environmental perception, autonomous vehicles and intelligent roadside infrastructure systems contain multiple sensors, that is, radio detection and ranging (radar), light detection and ranging (lidar), and camera sensors with the aim to detect, classify, and track multiple road users. Data from multiple sensors are fused together to enhance the perception quality of the sensor system because each sensor has strengths and weaknesses, for example, resolution, distance measurement, and dependency on weather conditions. For data fusion, it is necessary to transform the data from the different sensor coordinates to a common coordinate frame. This process is referred to as multisensor calibration and is a challenging task, which is mostly performed manually. This article introduces a new method for autocalibrating 3-D radar, 3-D lidar, and red-green-blue (RGB) mono-camera sensors using a static multitarget-based system. The proposed method can be used with sensors operating at different frame rates without time synchronization. Furthermore, the described static multitarget system is cost-effective, easy to build, and applicable for short- to long-distance calibration. The experimental results for multiple sets of measurements show good results with projection errors measured as maximum root mean square error (RMSE) of (u, v) = (2.4, 1.8) pixels for lidar-to-camera calibration, RMSE of (u, v) = (2.2, 3.0) pixels for 3-D radar-to-camera calibration, and RMSE of (x, y, z) = (2.6, 2.7, 14.0) centimeters for 3-D radar-to-lidar calibration.

AB Efficient low-speed Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) could adopt a propulsion mechanism with a biomimetic approach of caudal fin propulsion. The developments of the biomimetic AUV have very little attention to the systematic enhancement scheme of the fin performance. Therefore, many unclear relations of the parameters in thrust generation and efficiency of the various types of biomimetic fins. The present study proposes a systematic enhancement scheme of the static and dynamic performances of the biomimetic fins in a low-speed regime. This scheme involves rigid, cupping, and flexible single-joint fins of the acceleration-reaction fin mechanism and a high aspect ratio lunate shape two-joint fin of the lift-based fin mechanism. Average net-force and Thrust-to-Power Ratio evaluated the static performance, while the estimated cruising speed characterized the dynamic performance. The present study shows that the flexible single-joint fin improved the maximum values of the rigid fin performance by three times in average net-force, five times in thrust-to-power ratio, and two and a half times in estimated cruising speed. The two-joint fin enhanced the static and dynamic performances of the flexible fin by three times in average net-force, four times in thrust-to-power ratio, and one and a half times in estimated cruising speed. The present study suggests that flexibility has a role as a thrust vectoring factor. Furthermore, the lift-based mechanism in the two-joint fin provides effective and efficient thrust generation. In the present study, the two-joint fin was the effective and efficient fin propulsion mechanism in a lowspeed regime.

AB Accurately tracking and predicting behaviors of surrounding objects are key prerequisites for intelligent systems such as autonomous vehicles to achieve safe and high-quality decision making and motion planning. However, there still remain challenges for multi-target tracking due to object number fluctuation and occlusion. To overcome these challenges, we propose a constrained mixture sequential Monte Carlo (CMSMC) method in which a mixture representation is incorporated in the estimated posterior distribution to maintain multi-modality. Multiple targets can be tracked simultaneously within a unified framework without explicit data association between observations and tracking targets. The framework can incorporate an arbitrary prediction model as the implicit proposal distribution of the CMSMC method. An example in this paper is a learning-based model for hierarchical time-series prediction, which consists of a behavior recognition module and a state evolution module. Both modules in the proposed model are generic and flexible so as to be applied to a class of time-series prediction problems where behaviors can be separated into different levels. Finally, the proposed framework is applied to a numerical case study as well as a task of on-road vehicle tracking, behavior recognition, and prediction in highway scenarios. Instead of only focusing on forecasting trajectory of a single entity, we jointly predict continuous motions for interactive entities simultaneously. The proposed approaches are evaluated from multiple aspects, which demonstrate great potential for intelligent vehicular systems and traffic surveillance systems.

AB This paper presents a prototype system that enables an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to autonomously track and follow a shark that has been tagged with an acoustic transmitter. The AUV's onboard processor handles both real-time estimation of the shark's two-dimensional planar position, velocity, and orientation states, as well as a straightforward control scheme to drive the AUV toward the shark. The AUV is equipped with a stereo-hydrophone and receiver system that detects acoustic signals transmitted by the acoustic tag. The particular hydrophone system used here provides a measurement of relative bearing angle to the tag, but it does not provide the sign (+ or ) of the bearing angle. Estimation is accomplished using a particle filter that fuses bearing measurements over time to produce a state estimate of the tag location. The particle filter combined with a heuristic-based controller allows the system to overcome the ambiguity in the sign of the bearing angle. The state estimator and control scheme were validated by tracking both a stationary tag and a moving tag with known positions. Offline analysis of these data showed that state estimation can be improved by optimizing diffusion parameters in the prediction step of the filter, and considering signal strength of the acoustic signals in the resampling stage of the filter. These experiments revealed that state estimate errors were on the order of those obtained by current long-distance shark-tracking methods, i.e., manually driven boat-based tracking systems. Final experiments took place in SeaPlane Lagoon, Los Angeles, where a 1-m leopard shark (Triakis semifasciata) was caught, tagged, and released before being autonomously tracked and followed by the proposed AUV system for several hours.

AB This paper examines the potential effectiveness of the following three precollision system (PCS) algorithms: 1) forward collision warning only; 2) forward collision warning and precrash brake assist; and 3) forward collision warning, precrash brake assist, and autonomous precrash brake. Real-world rear-end crashes were extracted from a nationally representative sample of collisions in the United States. A sample of 1396 collisions, corresponding to 1.1 million crashes, were computationally simulated as if they occurred, with the driver operating a precollision-system-equipped vehicle. A probability-based framework was developed to account for the variable driver reaction to the warning system. As more components were added to the algorithms, greater benefits were realized. The results indicate that the exemplar PCS investigated in this paper could reduce the severity (i.e., Delta V) of the collision between 14% and 34%. The number of moderately to fatally injured drivers who wore their seat belts could have been reduced by 29% to 50%. These collision-mitigating algorithms could have prevented 3.2% to 7.7% of rear-end collisions. This paper shows the dramatic reductions in serious and fatal injuries that a PCS, which is one of the first intelligent vehicle technologies to be deployed in production cars, can bring to highway safety when available throughout the fleet. This paper also presents the framework of an innovative safety benefits methodology that, when adapted to other emerging active safety technologies, can be employed to estimate potential reductions in the frequency and severity of highway crashes.

TI Vision-based autonomous land vehicle guidance in outdoor road
   environments using combined line and road following techniques
SO JOURNAL OF ROBOTIC SYSTEMS
LA English

ID COMPUTER VISION; CMU NAVLAB; NAVIGATION; SYSTEM; PERCEPTION
AB An intelligent approach to autonomous land vehicle (ALV) guidance in outdoor road environments using combined line and road following and color information clustering techniques is proposed. Path lines and road boundaries are selected as reference models, called the line-model and the road-model, respectively. They are used to perform line-model matching (LMM) and road-model matching (RMM) to locate the ALV for line and road following, respectively. If there are path lines in the road, the LMM process is used to locate the ALV because it is faster than the RMM process. On the other hand, if no line can be found in the road, the RMM process is used. To detect path lines in a road image, the Hough transform is employed, which does not take much computing time because bright pixels in the road are very few. Various color information on roads is used for extracting path lines and road surfaces. And the ISODATA clustering algorithm based on an initial-center-choosing technique is employed to solve the problem caused by great changes of intensity in navigations. The double model matching procedure combined with the color information clustering process enables the ALV to navigate smoothly in roads even if there are shadows, cars, people, or degraded regions on roadsides. Some intelligent methods to speed up the model matching processes and the Hough transform based on the feedback of the previous image information are also presented. Successful navigations show that the proposed approach is effective for ALV guidance in common roads. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Security of such accelerators is a major challenge, especially when being deployed in safety-critical systems such as autonomous vehicles. In this letter, we present novel Hardware Trojan (HT) attacks on two DNN hardware accelerators, which modifies the activation parameters of the DNN in a field-programmable gate array-based accelerator implementation. The proposed HT is agnostic to the detailed architecture of the DNN. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HT is extremely stealthy, and when activated can result in significant degradation in inference accuracy.

AB This paper presents a speed-adjustment method for avoiding obstacles during multivehicle missions. This method enables multiple autonomous agents to cooperatively avoid collision against popup moving obstacles while at the same time guaranteeing intervehicle safety. The collision-avoidance algorithm assumes knowledge of a nominal trajectory for the obstacle and takes into account bounded deviations in the speed profile. Observing such deviations, the algorithm varies the pace of the mission accordingly, guaranteeing collision avoidance. A rigorous mathematical analysis based on Lyapunov stability theory is performed to provide performance bounds and safety guarantees of the algorithm. Finally, simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the efficacy of the method in realistic multivehicle mission scenarios.

DE Street-level image; Automated driving; Instance segmentation;
   Multi-scale feature enhancement; Correlation extraction
AB Instance segmentation of street-level images is an important part of road perception for autonomous vehicles. Different from traditional indoor or outdoor scenes, the segmentation of street-level images needs to ensure the segmentation speed and improve the accuracy as much as possible. The deep learning-based street-level images' segmentation can achieve high accuracy. However, the complexity and speed of the model are difficult to accept for the development and implementation of autonomous driving system. It is a challenge to design neural networks with higher accuracy while maintaining processing speed. To address this issue, we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of Polar-Mask algorithm, and propose a Polar-Mask-based fully densely linked and strongly correlated instance segmentation network (FCSIS-Polar) which achieves a good balance between precision and speed. Specifically, the original cascaded convolutional layers in Polar-Mask are densely connected to enhance the multi-scale feature extraction. In addition, the category features are co-encoded with the original mask prediction results as a priori information to establish a contour-category correlation. We test our algorithm on the challenging Cityscapes dataset (resolution of 1028 x 728). Experimental results confirm its performance; even in small images, it can achieve 26.4% Mask-mAP segmentation accuracy, which is 2.1% higher than the original model and the mean FPS (Frames Per Second) is 14.2. The proposed algorithm significantly improves the Mask-mAP while ensuring the segmentation speed, which is suitable for the environment perception of vehicles at low speed. At the same time, it can be used in auxiliary driving functions such as automatic parking and collision warning.

AB This paper presents fast non-sampling based methods to assess the risk for trajectories of autonomous vehicles when probabilistic predictions of other agents' futures are generated by deep neural networks (DNNs). The presented methods address a wide range of representations for uncertain predictions including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian mixture models to predict both agent positions and control inputs conditioned on the scene contexts. We show that the problem of risk assessment when Gaussian mixture models of agent positions are learned can be solved rapidly to arbitrary levels of accuracy with existing numerical methods. To address the problem of risk assessment for non-Gaussian mixture models of agent position, we propose finding upper bounds on risk using nonlinear Chebyshev's Inequality and sums-of-squares programming; they are both of interest as the former is much faster while the latter can be arbitrarily tight. These approaches only require higher order statistical moments of agent positions to determine upper bounds on risk. To perform risk assessment when models are learned for agent control inputs as opposed to positions, we propagate the moments of uncertain control inputs through the nonlinear motion dynamics to obtain the exact moments of uncertain position over the planning horizon. To this end, we construct deterministic linear dynamical systems that govern the exact time evolution of the moments of uncertain position in the presence of uncertain control inputs. The presented methods are demonstrated on realistic predictions from DNNs trained on the Argoverse and CARLA datasets and are shown to be effective for rapidly assessing the probability of low probability events.

AB Distinguishing obstacles from ground is an essential step for common perception tasks such as object detection-and-tracking or occupancy grid maps. Typical approaches rely on plane fitting or local geometric features, but their performance is reduced in situations with sloped terrain or sparse data. Some works address these issues using Markov Random Fields and Belief Propagation, but these rely on local geometric features uniquely. This article presents a strategy for ground segmentation in LiDAR point clouds composed by two main steps: (i) First, an initial classification is performed dividing the points in small groups and analyzing geometric features between them. (ii) Then, this initial classification is used to model the surrounding ground height as a Markov Random Field, which is solved using the Loopy Belief Propagation algorithm. Points are finally classified comparing their height with the estimated ground height map. On one hand, using an initial estimation to model the Markov Random Field provides a better description of the scene than local geometric features commonly used alone. On the other hand, using a graph-based approach with message passing achieves better results than simpler filtering or enhancement techniques, since data propagation compensates sparse distributions of LiDAR point clouds. Experiments are conducted with two different sources of information: nuScenes's public dataset and an autonomous vehicle prototype. The estimation results are analyzed with respect to other methods, showing a good performance in a variety of situations.

AB Terrain-aided navigation (TAN) is a localisation method which uses bathymetric measurements for bounding the growth in inertial navigation error. The minimisation of navigation errors is of particular importance for long-endurance autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). This type of AUV requires simple and effective on-board navigation solutions to undertake long-range missions, operating for months rather than hours or days, without reliance on external support systems. Consequently, a suitable navigation solution has to fulfil two main requirements: (a) bounding the navigation error, and (b) conforming to energy constraints and conserving on-board power. This study proposes a low-complexity particle filter-based TAN algorithm for Autosub Long Range, a long-endurance deep-rated AUV. This is a light and tractable filter that can be implemented on-board in real time. The potential of the algorithm is investigated by evaluating its performance using field data from three deep (up to 3,700 m) and long-range (up to 195 km in 77 hr) missions performed in the Southern Ocean during April 2017. The results obtained using TAN are compared to on-board estimates, computed via dead reckoning, and ultrashort baseline (USBL) measurements, treated as baseline locations, sporadically recorded by a support ship. Results obtained through postprocessing demonstrate that TAN has the potential to prolong underwater missions to a range of hundreds of kilometres without the need for intermittent surfacing to obtain global positioning system fixes. During each of the missions, the system performed 20 Monte Carlo runs. Throughout each run, the algorithm maintained convergence and bounded error, with high estimation repeatability achieved between all runs, despite the limited suite of localisation sensors.

AB Energy optimization is a critical issue in three-dimensional (3D) underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs). Intelligent path planning can be applied to extend the lifetime of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) which has attracted many researchers' attention as a key component of UASNs in recent years. In this paper, we put forward an algorithm of distance evolution nonlinear particle swarm optimization (DENPSO), aiming at finding an energy-efficient stable path forAUVs in 3DUASNs. First, in order to ensure that the particles fully explore the 3D underwater environment during the evolution process, we convert the inertia weighting factor and learning factor from linearity to nonlinearity. Second, to avoid particles falling into local optimum regions, the particles of the poor search regions are randomly perturbed by the distance evolution factor. Third, we apply the penalty function to describe the energy optimization goal under the obstacles and ocean currents. To quantify the role of obstacle avoidance in the penalty function, each path is divided into several micro-element points based on the cubic spline interpolation method. Then, we propose a degree value factor to measure the micro-element points falling within the obstacle coverage regions. Finally, simulations are finished in 3D underwater environment and the real environment based on regional ocean model system (ROMS). The results show that DENPSO can avoid the obstacles along the eddy current direction, where the energy consumption of algorithm DENPSO is, respectively, reduced by 2.1514e+C03 J and 1.049e+C07 J compared with the algorithm LPSO in the above-mentioned environment.

AB We have developed an underwater gravity measurement system that uses an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for exploration of seafloor mineral deposits. An improved air/sea gravimeter mounted on a gimbal mechanism in a pressure capsule 50 cm in diameter was installed in the AUV Urashima. We carried out 11 AUV dives in Sagami Bay as well as in deep-sea mineral deposit areas offshore Japan. The AUV was navigated at a constant speed of 2 knots and at either constant depth or constant altitude above the sea bottom. We obtained high-resolution Bouguer anomaly data through processing of gravity data, water pressure data, and the AUV's navigational data, including pitch and roll motion. In addition to a vertical acceleration correction using a precise pressure meter with an in situ conversion factor from pressure to depth, three additional corrections were made to the gravimeter data: corrections for the effects of a spatial separation and a time delay between the depth sensor and the gravimeter, and an adjustment to the conversion from pressure increments to depth increments. These new corrections allowed us to obtain high-resolution data in a constant-depth survey of the southern Izena Hole at a depth of approximately 1550 m. The data had a 0.1 mGal rms crossover difference after leveling. This survey revealed two high Bouguer anomaly areas with amplitudes of 1-2 mGal. A model calculation suggested that the anomalies result from the presence of two buried cylindrical high-density mineral deposits. Our data processing method allows the detection of mineral deposits located at or just beneath the seafloor using gravity data collected aboard AUVs. However, further improvements in resolution are desirable, particularly for surveys in areas with rugged topography.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB The purpose of this study was to explore a novel approach to power hybridization in relation to its effectiveness in an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). This hybridization method is modeled after the power distribution methods found in living organisms, which utilize glycogen stores and adipose tissue to optimize power and energy density strengths and weaknesses. A UGV rover was constructed with an appropriate distribution of power storage elements creating separate power buffers. The primary buffer consisted of a 10 W solar panel array and a 600 F, 5.4 V supercapacitor bank, and the secondary buffer consisted of a 3.7 V 6 Ah lithium-ion battery pack. The primary buffer provided virtually limitless charge cycles with a superior power density juxtaposed with a secondary buffer that provided superior energy density and volumetric versatility. The design of this rover is presented in this paper; it was tested under manual and autonomous modes. The rover was found to be capable of effectively operating solely on the primary power buffer in high to low luminous conditions while being able to carry out basic extravehicular activities. The rover could travel roughly 22 km without any input power on a full charge of both buffers, and could smoothly switch between its own power buffers during operation, all while transmitting live first person video (FPV) and network data. The introduction of control algorithms on the onboard microcontroller unit (MCU) was also explored in both manual and autonomous configurations. The latter integrated linear regression to intelligently manage power and locomotion based on sensory data from photoresistors.

AB Energy efficiency is one of the most important parameters in transportation electrification. It allows to improve the production rate due to longer operation without charging or decrease the cost related to transportation. To provide collision-free operation in unknown or various environment, the local path planning algorithm should be considered. An Artificial Potential Field (APF) algorithm is commonly used for this task, however it provides unsmooth and oscillating motion of autonomous ground vehicle (AGV), and is prone to being trapped in a local minimum, e.g, dead-end. In such a case, the energy used to achieve the goal position is higher than necessary. In this paper, the energy-efficient local path planning algorithm is proposed. Future movement prediction has been introduced to APF to allow AGV to bypass obstacles in advance. A novel method for local minimum avoidance is introduced. It is based on placement of virtual obstacles called top quarks in critical areas. These obstacles provide additional repulsive force for the APF based path planner. Considering the predicted stagnation-free path of the AGV, the new temporary goal for APF is selected. Such a combination allows to reduce traveled route length, improve its smoothness, and bypass local minima. The proposed Predictive Artificial Potential Field (PAPF) algorithm has been examined using Husarion ROSbot 2.0 PRO mobile robot, and the obtained results in form of videos are also attached as supplementary files. In comparison to original APF, the proposed path planning algorithm allows to reduce the used electric power by 21.4 %. PAPF provided a shorter path by up to 8.73 % and shorter time to reach the goal position by up to 40.23 %. The movement of the AGV is also much smoother in a case of usage of the proposed algorithm, and the proposed top quarks-based local minimum avoidance mechanism allows to bypass the local minima.

AB In order to enhance the energy efficiency of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) during flight operations in mountainous terrain, this research paper proposes an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm-based optimal energy path planning method, which effectively reduces the non-essential energy consumption of UAV during the flight operations through a reasonable path planning method. First, this research designs a 3D path planning method based on the PSO optimization algorithm with the goal of achieving optimal energy consumption during UAV flight operations. Then, to overcome the limitations of the classical PSO algorithm, such as poor global search capability and susceptibility to local optimality, a parameter adaptive method based on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is introduced. This parameter adaptive method dynamically adjusts the main parameters of the PSO algorithm by monitoring the state of the particle swarm solution set. Finally, the improved PSO algorithm based on parameter adaptive improvement is applied to path planning in mountainous terrain environments, and an optimal energy-consuming path-planning algorithm for UAVs based on the improved PSO algorithm is proposed. Simulation results show that the path-planning algorithm proposed in this research effectively reduces non-essential energy consumption during UAV flight operations, especially in more complex terrain scenarios.

AB The applications of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled visual monitoring span the areas of public security, nature resilience, and disaster rescue. Covertness can play an indispensable role in applications demanding UAVs to be unnoticeable by targets, e.g., tailing and interception and police surveillance. This article discusses the types and technical challenges of visual camouflage for UAV-based surveillance. A particular interest is given to an agile disguising method, which adopts both distance keeping and elevation changing and confuses the target by constantly changing its relative position in the target's view. The path design of the UAV monitor is nonstraightforward under this disguising approach due to nonconvex disguise objectives, UAV propulsion power, and control dynamics. A new control framework is presented to plan and refine the trajectory of the UAV monitor online. The framework employs model predictive control (MPC) to decompose the control decisions between slots, mitigating the impact of the inaccurate prediction of the target's path and allowing the planned trajectory to be refined online. Simulations validate the merits of the new framework over the benchmark approach with no camouflage and demonstrate the different performances of fixed-wing and rotary-wing UAVs on a covert video surveillance mission.

AB Future roadways will have a mix of autonomous and automated vehicles with regular vehicles that require human operators. To ensure the safety of all the road users in such a network, it is necessary to enhance the performance of the present Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) for lower classes of vehicles. Real-time driving safety risk prediction is an essential element of an ADAS. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven approach to predict traffic safety risk that can he customized for individual drivers by including driver-specific variables. In particular, we have used the elastic net regularized multinomial logistic regression and data from the Second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2) naturalistic driving study to build the predictive models. This paper rigorously examines the variables in the data set and performs data preparation and feature engineering steps to enhance the prediction performance with respect to model predictors. The model produces good results, and model adaptation/extensions for further improvements are discussed in the conclusion section. Two versions of the model are presented according to the level of warnings that the model can generate based on driving conditions. This paper provides a brief overview of the potential applications of the work.

AB Vision cues play an important role in states feedback in motion control. However, the existing driver steering models consider little about vision cues utilized by human drivers during their steering procedure. This paper presents a novel steering control strategy based on two preview points (far point and near point). The far point is used to compensate the steering wheel by predicting the upcoming curvature change with respect to the lane, while the near point as vision feedback, which is used to tune the steering wheel by estimating the errors of vehicle states and lane center. To obtain much smoother lateral acceleration during steering, a forward internal model is established using a second-order yaw dynamics system that captures the influence of yaw angular acceleration caused by steering wheel angle. The input parameter of the second-order system is the vision cues of both the near and far points, and the output parameters are the ideal yaw angle and yaw rate. To calculate suitable the steering wheel angle, an adaptive controller is designed using fuzzy sliding technology, which is used as the input of the vehicle system dynamics. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed method performs better than the existing driver steering models in case of imitating human drivers' behavior, and exhibits excellent adaption to the lane curvature change.

AB In this paper, an innovative method for the detection and avoidance of obstacles is presented. This is based on image registration techniques. The aim of this method is the detection of the possible obstacles that could be in the route where VERDINO (an autonomous electrical vehicle which is going to work in the surroundings of a bioclimatic urbanization as part of the SAGENIA project) navigates. The obstacle detection is one of the most critical parts of the prototype. It is responsible for the detection and later avoidance of the pedestrians, cars, etc. that can damage it or be damaged by the prototype. The algorithm is able to work in real time, with good detection rates and a fast response. It also includes a dynamical database that will allow the vehicle to learn adaptively the current state of the environment, rejecting old images. With this, some of the typical problems related to the image registration techniques are removed. Some examples and results are provided, corroborating the good behavior of the algorithm, which has been tested in simulated and real conditions. The method is also applicable to other tasks, like surveillance for non-stationery cameras or other applications over very different kinds of images. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The system under investigation is the hydraulically driven autonomous large scale-combined legged and wheeled vehicle, the Anthropomorphically Legged and Wheeled Duisburg Robot (ALDURO). In this paper a complete mechatronic simulation model, realized in the object-oriented programming language C++, is presented. It contains the mechanical system including an explicit solution of the kinematic loops, a model of the ground contact. and the dynamics of the complete hydraulic system, as well as a force-based motion control concept based on an exact input-output linearization using decentralized force controllers. Some simulation results are shown to demonstrate the function of the simulation model and the control concept presented.

AB Fiber optic gyroscopes (FOG) based on the Sagnac effect are a valuable tool in sensing and navigation and enable accurate measurements in applications ranging from spacecraft and aircraft to self-driving vehicles such as autonomous cars. As with any classical optical sensors, the ultimate performance of these devices is bounded by the shot-noise limit (SNL). Quantum-enhanced interferometry allows us to overcome this limit using non-classical states of light. Here, we report on an entangled-photon gyroscope that uses path-entangled NOON-states (N = 2) to provide super-resolution and phase sensitivity beyond the shot-noise limit.

AB Remotely sensing an object with light is essential for burgeoning technologies, such as autonomous vehicles. Here, an object's rotational orientation is remotely sensed using light's orbital angular momentum. An object is illuminated by and partially obstructs a Gaussian light beam. Using an SLM, the phase differences between the partially obstructed Gaussian light beam's constituent OAM modes are measured analogous to Stokes polarimetry. It is shown that the phase differences are directly proportional to the object's rotational orientation. Comparison to the use of a pixelated camera and implementation in the millimeter wave regime are discussed.

AB Presently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have a broad spectrum of applications, in which regular monitoring of critical infrastructure assets is an important risk mitigation usage. This paper presents a novel approach for modeling leakage from natural gas pipelines using machine learning algorithms operating on the gas leakage detection (Methane) data collected using an UAV having a gas sensor and a light detecting and ranging (LiDAR) payload. The detection system has a lightweight design along with a small form factor to ensure compatibility with most autonomous mobile platforms like UAVs or wheeled robots. Two experiments were conducted to collect the gas leakage detection data at various loitering heights in real atmospheric conditions before applying the estimation algorithms. The first experiment measured natural gas leakage data in varying loitering radiuses and altitudes for leakage pressures around one pound per square inch (PSI), while the second experiment did the same for leakage pressures around two PSI. Real atmospheric conditions were incorporated along with additional aspects of propeller down-wash and environmental air movements that can influence leakage detection. Two estimation algorithms, viz., reduced support vector machine (RSVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) were applied to the leakage data collected from the UAV experiments. It was found that the ANN approach resulted in more faster and accurate detection than RSVM that heavily depended on the kernel function for its performance. The efficacy of leakage detection of natural gas using a UAV payload was demonstrated, which is a faster and cost-effective alternative to the manual inspection process.

AB Nowadays, computer vision with 3D (dimension) object detection and 6D (degree of freedom) pose assumptions are widely discussed and studied in the field. In the 3D object detection process, classifications are centered on the object's size, position, and direction. And in 6D pose assumptions, networks emphasize 3D translation and rotation vectors. Successful application of these strategies can have a huge impact on various machine learning-based applications, including the autonomous vehicles, the robotics industry, and the augmented reality sector. Although extensive work has been done on 3D object detection with a pose assumption from RGB images, the challenges have not been fully resolved. Our analysis provides a comprehensive review of the proposed contemporary techniques for complete 3D object detection and the recovery of 6D pose assumptions of an object. In this review research paper, we have discussed several proposed sophisticated methods in 3D object detection and 6D pose estimation, including some popular data sets, evaluation matrix, and proposed method challenges. Most importantly, this study makes an effort to offer some possible future directions in 3D object detection and 6D pose estimation. We accept the autonomous vehicle as the sample case for this detailed review. Finally, this review provides a complete overview of the latest in-depth learning-based research studies related to 3D object detection and 6D pose estimation systems and points out a comparison between some popular frameworks. To be more concise, we propose a detailed summary of the state-of-the-art techniques of modern deep learning-based object detection and pose estimation models.

AB Deep reef assemblages in south-eastern Australia are poorly described, and have been surveyed by only a few studies conducted over small spatial scales. Here, we characterise the composition of deep(similar to 30-90 m depth) sessile invertebrate communities from sub-tropical (27 degrees S) to temperate eastern Australia (43 degrees S). We estimated the cover of 51 preselected invertebrate types from over 1700 seafloor images collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle from >105 km of transects across the study region. Seafloor images were assessed using 3 alternative schemes reflecting different resolution of benthic invertebrate groupings, including the broadlevel Collaborative and Automated Tools for Analysis of Marine Imagery project ('CATAMI') classification recently developed as a generic scoring approach for seafloor imagery. Ordination using canonical analysis of principal coordinates indicated a clear latitudinal gradient in benthic community composition and, particularly when based on individual morphotypes, 3 distinct community types (sub-tropical, warm temperate and cool temperate). Changes in community structure mostly correlated with primary productivity and the temperature climatology, while local-scale variability in community composition was most related to depth. Along with the gradual shift in deep reef community composition across latitudes, region-specific sessile invertebrates might serve as useful indicators of change in these deep benthic communities under future changes in ocean climate in the region, which has been identified as a global hotspot for ocean warming. Our methodological approach has general applicability for large-scale surveying and monitoring of benthic communities using underwater imagery.

AB The inspection of condition of underwater pipelines (UPs) based on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) requires high accuracy of positioning while the AUV is moving along to the object being examined. Currently, acoustic, magnetometric, and visual means are used to detect and track UPs with AUVs. Compared to other methods, visual navigation can provide higher accuracy for local maneuvering at short distances to the object. According to the authors of the present article, the potential of video information for these purposes is not yet fully utilized, and, therefore, the study focused on the more efficient use of stereo images taken with an AUV's video camera. For this, a new method has been developed to address inspection challenges, which consists in the highlighting of visible boundaries and the calculation of the UP centerline using algorithms for combined processing of 2D and 3D video data. Three techniques for initial recognition of the direction of UP upon its detection were analyzed: on the basis of a stereo-pair of images using point features of the surface; using tangent planes to the UP in one of the stereo-pair; and using the UP median planes in both images of the stereo-pair. Approaches for determining the parameters of the relative positions of the AUV and the UP during the subsequent tracking are also considered. The technology proposed can be of practical use in the development of navigation systems to be applied for UP inspection without deploying additional expensive equipment, either separately or in combination with measurements from other sensors.

AB Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf (FRIS) is the world's largest ice shelf by volume. It helps regulate Antarctica's contribution to global sea level rise, and water mass transformations within the sub-ice-shelf cavity produce globally important dense water masses. Rates of ice shelf basal melting are relatively low, however, as the production of cold (-1.9 degrees C) and dense High Salinity Shelf Water over the Weddell Sea continental shelf isolates the ice shelf from large-scale inflow of warm water. Nevertheless, a narrow inflow of relatively warm (-1.4 degrees C) Modified Warm Deep Water (MWDW) that hugs the western flank of Berkner Bank is observed to reach Ronne Ice Front, although the processes governing its circulation and fate remain uncertain. Here we present the first observations taken within the ice shelf cavity along this warm water inflow using the Autosub Long Range autonomous underwater vehicle. We observe a core of MWDW with a south-westward velocity of 4 cm s(-1) that reaches at least 18 km into the sub-ice cavity. The hydrographic properties are spatially heterogeneous, giving rise to temporal variability that is driven by tidal advection. The highest rates of turbulent dissipation are associated with the warmest MWDW, with the vertical eddy diffusivity reaching 10(-4) m(2) s(-1) where the water column is fully turbulent. Mixing efficiency is close to the canonical value of 0.2. Modeling studies suggest MWDW may become the dominant water mass beneath FRIS in our changing climate, providing strong motivation to understand more fully the dynamics of this MWDW inflow.

TI Ride-Hailing Platforms: Competition and Autonomous Vehicles
SO M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE game theory; service operations
AB Problem definition: Ride-hailing platforms, which are currently struggling with profitability, view autonomous vehicles (AVs) as important to their long-term profitability and prospects. Are competing platforms helped or harmed by platforms' obtaining access to AVs? Are the humans who participate on the platforms-driver-workers and rider-consumers (hereafter, agents)-collectively helped or harmed by the platforms' access to AVs? How do the conditions under which access to AVs reduces platform profits, agentwelfare, and social welfare depend on the AV ownership structure (i.e., whether platforms or individuals own AVs)? Academic/practical relevance: AVs have the potential to transform the economics of ride-hailing, with welfare consequences for platforms, agents, and society. Methodology: We employ a game-theoretic model that captures platforms' price, wage, and AV fleet size decisions. Results: We characterize necessary and sufficient conditions under which platforms' access to AVs reduces platform profit, agent welfare, and social welfare. The structural effect of access to AVs on agent welfare is robust regardless of AV ownership; agent welfare decreases if and only if the AV cost is high. In contrast, the structural effect of access to AVs on platform profit depends on who owns AVs. The necessary and sufficient condition under which access to AVs decreases platform profit is high AV cost under platform-owned AVs and low AV cost under individually owned AVs. Similarly, the structural effect of access to AVs on social welfare depends on who owns AVs. Access to individually owned AVs increases social welfare; in contrast, access to platform-owned AVs decreases social welfare-if and only if the AV cost is high. Managerial implications: Our results provide guidance to platforms, labor and consumer advocates, and governmental entities regarding regulatory and public policy decisions affecting the ease with which platforms obtain access to AVs.

AB Underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) have attracted considerable attention due to the increasing demands on the Internet of Underwater Things. The monitored underwater data are disseminated by anchored nodes in UASNs through multihop transmissions. In the military applications, some underwater spy robots are probably dispatched by the enemy to invade the UASNs, and these underwater spy robots seek to steal the data messages disseminated by anchored nodes. In this article, the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are taken as the ferries for the data message dissemination of some vulnerable anchored nodes, so as to reduce the risk of data messages being stolen by the spy robots. To this end, an index dissemination vulnerability is first introduced to measure the risk of data messages being stolen around anchored nodes, and the network topology is specially investigated to ameliorate the dissemination vulnerabilities of anchored nodes. An AUV-aided message ferry approach (AMFA) is proposed for the UASNs invaded by underwater spy robots. In AMFA, the anchored nodes set the initial communication ranges according to a power law distribution, and then, the communication ranges of anchored nodes are updated to achieve the required topology connectivity. Especially, some AUVs are assigned to ferry the data messages of the anchored nodes with the largest dissemination vulnerabilities. The simulation results demonstrate the preferable performance of AMFA, i.e., AMFA ameliorates the dissemination vulnerabilities of anchored nodes considerably while the required topology connectivity can be guaranteed.

AB The rapid development and progress in deep machine-learning techniques have become a key factor in solving the future challenges of humanity. Vision-based target detection and object classification have been improved due to the development of deep learning algorithms. Data fusion in autonomous driving is a fact and a prerequisite task of data preprocessing from multi-sensors that provide a precise, well-engineered, and complete detection of objects, scene or events. The target of the current study is to develop an in-vehicle information system to prevent or at least mitigate traffic issues related to parking detection and traffic congestion detection. In this study we examined to solve these problems described by (1) extracting region-of-interest in the images (2) vehicle detection based on instance segmentation, and (3) building deep learning model based on the key features obtained from input parking images. We build a deep machine learning algorithm that enables collecting real video-camera feeds from vision sensors and predicting free parking spaces. Image augmentation techniques were performed using edge detection, cropping, refined by rotating, thresholding, resizing, or color augment to predict the region of bounding boxes. A deep convolutional neural network F-MTCNN model is proposed that simultaneously capable for compiling, training, validating and testing on parking video frames through video-camera. The results of proposed model employing on publicly available PK-Lot parking dataset and the optimized model achieved a relatively higher accuracy 97.6% than previous reported methodologies. Moreover, this article presents mathematical and simulation results using state-of-the-art deep learning technologies for smart parking space detection. The results are verified using Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV computer simulation frameworks.

AB The integrated navigation of strap-down inertial navigation system (SINS) and Doppler velocity log (DVL) has a common application in the positioning of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). However, DVL may be interrupted for a short time when part of the beam cannot receive the reflected signal and DVL measurement information is easily affected by underwater complex environment and contains outliers. To solve the above problems, a Doppler shift-aided coupled method of SINS/DVL integrated navigation with pare of DVL beam measurements outages based on dual adaptive factors is proposed. In this article, a tightly coupled approach for SINS/DVL based on Doppler shifts is proposed to solve the short-term failure problem caused by the lack of part measurement in DVL. Then, a chi-square detection-aided dual factors' adaptive filter is used to suppress the outliers. The dual factors are used to adjust the influence of imprecise information of dynamic model and observation model error. The chi-square detection is used to judge the outliers of measurements and the result of judgment is regarded as the precondition of factor selection. In order to verify the robustness of the proposed algorithm to outliers, simulation and Yangtze River experiments are carried out. The results of simulation and river experiments indicate that the tightly coupled approach obtains higher accuracy compared with the loosely coupled model and the proposed adaptive filter can effectively suppress the outliers. The method proposed in this article can achieve greater robustness in AUV underwater complex environment.

AB Introduction By removing the need for a driver, autonomous vehicles (AV) are expected to substantially reduce rates of drink-driving. However, this benefit may be accompanied by an unintended negative consequence in the form of greater overall alcohol consumption due to increased availability of affordable and convenient transport. Aims To assess: (i) the extent to which drinkers may choose to use AVs after consuming alcohol; (ii) the extent to which drinkers may consume more alcohol if they are using an AV afterwards; and (iii) whether demographic, alcohol-related and AV-related factors are associated with the likelihood of engaging in these behaviours. Design and Methods A total of 1334 Australians of legal driving age who consume alcohol completed an online survey. Two regression models were used to calculate whether the analysed respondent characteristics were associated with intentions to use AVs after drinking and to consume more alcohol if using an AV afterwards. Results Around half of the respondents (49%) reported being likely to use an AV after consuming alcohol, and over one-third (37%) reported being likely to consume more alcohol if using an AV afterwards. Younger age, more frequent alcohol consumption, a positive attitude to AVs and a preference for using 'ride-share' AVs were associated with a greater likelihood of engaging in these behaviours. Discussion and Conclusions The results suggest that the introduction of AVs is likely to reduce drink-driving rates while facilitating greater participation in heavy episodic drinking. This will constitute a challenge to policymakers in their efforts to minimise alcohol-related harms.

AB This paper reports on an operation framework for autonomous rice harvesting. We developed an integrated algorithm for robotic operation and cooperation with farmworkers to automate each subsection of the harvesting and unloading process and of the processes that bridge them (homing and restarting). The algorithm was installed into a head-feeding combine robot. The robot followed a target path based on its absolute position and orientation, planning a counterclockwise spiral path in a rectangular paddy field, and returned to a position close to a farm road when its grain tank was filled to a specified level. The grain unloading operation was automated using a machine vision system. As the restarting process (return to harvesting) was also automated, the combine robot was able to harvest a rectangular field autonomously by cyclically repeating the harvesting, homing, unloading, and restarting operations. Under field conditions, the robot was able to follow the target path within tolerable lateral and azimuth errors while harvesting rice successfully, and to unload the harvested grain into a wagon without spillage. The root mean square error of the lateral and azimuth errors during harvesting were 0.04m and 2.6 degrees, respectively. In the homing operation, the robot returned to a given line within +/- 0.1 m and aligned its heading to the direction of the line within +/- 4. The robot recognized the arbitrarily parked wagon and positioned its auger spout at the target point with a respective horizontal and vertical accuracy of +/- 0.2 m and +/- 0.3 m. Harvesting time accounted for 50%-60% of the entire robotic operation. Homing scheduling and dispatch control for the wagon were found to be of importance for developing a more efficient robotic operation. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB Road extraction is a crucial task that requires high-resolution remote sensing images with wide-ranging applications in urban planning, navigation, and autonomous vehicles. However, this task is challenged by complex road structures and the need to capture long-range dependencies. RoadTransNet is a new road extraction architecture that aims to solve these problems that making the power of the Swin Transformer and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) while introducing Transformer-like attention mechanisms. RoadTransNet combines a robust convolutional backbone, inspired by the Swin Transformer, with an FPN to capture multi-scale features effectively. The Transformer-like attention mechanisms, including multi-head self-attention and cross-attention, enable the network to represent context information on a local and global scale, ensuring accurate road extraction. The skip connections facilitate gradient flow, preserving fine details, and decoding layers transform extracted features into precise road predictions. Our experiments are conducted using the RoadTransNet, which is subject to rigorous assessment on the following datasets: the DeepGlobe road extraction challenge Dataset and the CHN6-cUG roads dataset. The outcomes indicate its superior performance in achieving high-level metrics of precision and recall, as well as achieving high F1 scores and IoU. The comparative evaluations performed against traditional methods showcase RoadTransNet's ability to capture complex road structures and long-range dependencies. The RoadTransNet stands as a comprehensive solution for the extraction of roads in high-resolution remote sensing images, offering promising opportunities for improving urban planning, navigation systems, and autonomous vehicle technologies. Its success lies in the synergy of convolutional and transformer-based architectures, paving the way for advanced remote sensing applications in smart cities and others.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based wireless networks have received increasing research interest in recent years and are gradually being utilized in various aspects of our society. The growing complexity of UAV applications such as disaster management, plant protection, and environment monitoring, has resulted in escalating and stringent requirements for UAV networks that a single UAV cannot fulfill. To address this, multi-UAV wireless networks (MUWNs) have emerged, offering enhanced resource-carrying capacity and enabling collaborative mission completion by multiple UAVs. However, the effective operation of MUWNs necessitates a higher level of autonomy and intelligence, particularly in decision-making and multi-objective optimization under diverse environmental conditions. Reinforcement Learning (RL), an intelligent and goal-oriented decision-making approach, has emerged as a promising solution for addressing the intricate tasks associated with MUWNs. As one may notice, the literature still lacks a comprehensive survey of recent advancements in RL-based MUWNs. Thus, this paper aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive review of RL-based approaches in the context of autonomous MUWNs. We present an informative overview of RL and demonstrate its application within the framework of MUWNs. Specifically, we summarize various applications of RL in MUWNs, including data access, sensing and collection, resource allocation for wireless connectivity, UAV-assisted mobile edge computing, localization, trajectory planning, and network security. Furthermore, we identify and discuss several open challenges based on the insights gained from our review.

AB The study presents an energy performance improvement measure for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) carrying oceanographic equipment for collecting scientific data from the ocean. The required electric energy for the on-board equipment is harvested from tidal energy by using twin horizontal axis turbines which are integrated with thin-wall diffusers to enhance their energy capturing performance. The main focus and hence objective of the paper is the optimal design of the diffusers by using Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes Equations (RANSE) based Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method and the validation of the design using physical model tests.
   A goal-driven optimisation procedure is used to achieve a higher power coefficient for the turbine while keeping the size and the drag of the diffuser as practically minimum as possible. TIN main parameters of the optimisation are selected, the outlet diameter and the expansion section length of the diffusers, which are optimised for the highest flow acceleration ratio at the diffuser throat and for the minimum drag of the integrated diffuser and turbine system which is called as "Diffuser Augmented Tidal Turbine" (DATT) system.
   The numerical optimisation is validated by two sets of physical model tests conducted with a single turbine without diffuser and the same turbine integrated with the diffuser (DATT) in a cavitation tunnel and a circulating water channel. These tests demonstrated a performance enhancement for the turbine with the optimal diffuser by almost doubling the power coefficient of the turbine without the diffuser. However, the performance enhancement was dependent upon the pitch angle of the turbine. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The establishment, spread, and impact of the invasive bivalve Corbicula fluminea (C. fluminea), in Lake Tahoe threatens native species distribution in the lake and, potentially, has long-term implications for water clarity. In 2009, UBC-Gavia, an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), was used as a platform to collect georeferenced imagery of the benthic regions of Lake Tahoe to determine the lake-wide distribution of C. fluminea. Images were collected in water depths less than 10 m at an approximately constant height above the bottom of 2 m. Images were processed using a semi-automated procedure to determine the ratio of the lakebed covered by exposed C. fluminea shells. A visual review was conducted on a subset of the images to determine presence of filamentous algae that has been observed in association with C. fluminea. Nearly 100 km of shoreline was covered over a 7-d period, and C. fluminea presence was reconfirmed in 4 regions and additional 10 regions identified. In regions where the presence of C. fluminea was confirmed, C. fluminea depth distribution was validated by comparing image detection counts and results from a benthic sediment grab sample survey. Three regions around the lake were identified to have filamentous green algae or charophyte species. It was impossible to identify species of the known filamentous algal taxa (Cladophora glomerata, Spirogyra spp., and Zygnema spp.). The collected imagery provides a synoptic view on species distribution within the lake that can be used for efficient monitoring of invasive species in freshwater and saltwater bodies.

AB Armed and autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms are a new type of aerial threat due to their numerical superiority and cooperative communication, and existing countermeasures cannot completely eliminate whole swarms. In this letter, we design an algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning called GCPDDQN to find the optimal attack sequence for large-scale UAV swarm, so as to achieve the purpose of decomposing the network into small pieces and destroying swarm communications. Numerical simulations show that GCPDDQN can speed up the collapse of the network using only the simplest features and network architectures which are changeable to adjust to different scenarios.

AB This paper presents a trajectory planning method for automated parking that makes use of multiresolution roadmaps. The proposed roadmap generation algorithm takes as an input manually designed geometric information of a parking lot consisting of parking space layout, obstacle configuration, and a set of geometric features called guidelines. It constructs a roadmap by dividing the guidelines in multiple resolutions until it achieves enough coverage over the set of safe trajectories satisfying vehicle kinematics, curvature limit, and collision-avoidance. Using this roadmap, a complex parking trajectory composed of both forward and reverse motions can be computed with small online computation cost. The proposed method is evaluated in both numerical simulations and real experiments.

AB By providing ultra-high transmission data rate, millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) communications are promising to enable backhaul data transmission in cellular connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. In such networks, with little or no human assistance, connected autonomous UAVs (CA-UAV) can build air-ground networks and achieve seamless wide-area coverage. With the usage of high frequency (i.e., mmWave/THz), radio/radar sensing function is expected to be achieved in wireless networks, which can be used to track UAV for beam tracking in mmWave/THz communications and motion control of UAV. However, it is extremely difficult to jointly design sensing, communication, and motion control since they have been developing in relatively parallel with limited intersections. In this paper, we propose a new integrated scheduling method of sensing, communication, and control for mmWave/THz communications in UAV networks to enable data transmission of the backhaul from UAV to the ground base station (BS). In the proposed method, we first analyze the interactions among sensing, communication, and motion control, where sensing and motion control are strongly coupled to form the sensing-control pattern. Then, we provide a new definition from motion control perspective, i.e., state-to-noise-ratio, which links the relationship between sensing-control pattern activation and data rate determined by beam alignment in mmWave/THz communications. Finally, a closed-form expression is obtained for data rate triggered sensing-control pattern activation design, where both data rate requirement in mmWave/THz communications and motion control performance of UAV are guaranteed. Simulation results show remarkable performance of the proposed method.

AB To improve the traveling experience, researchers have been analyzing the role of attitudes in travel behavior modeling. Although most researchers use closed-ended surveys, the appropriate method to measure attitudes is debatable. Topic Modeling could significantly reduce the time to extract information from open-ended responses and eliminate subjective bias, thereby alleviating analyst concerns. Our research uses Topic Modeling to extract information from open-ended questions and compare its performance with closed-ended responses. Furthermore, some respondents might prefer answering questions using their preferred questionnaire type. So, we propose a modeling framework that allows respondents to use their preferred questionnaire type to answer the survey and enable analysts to use the modeling frameworks of their choice to predict behavior. We demonstrate this using a dataset collected from the USA that measures the intention to use Autonomous Vehicles for commute trips. Respondents were presented with alternative questionnaire versions (open-and closed-ended). Since our objective was also to compare the performance of alternative questionnaire versions, the survey was designed to eliminate influences resulting from statements, behavioral framework, and the choice experiment. Results indicate the suitability of using Topic Modeling to extract information from openended responses; however, the models estimated using the closed-ended questions perform better compared to them. Besides, the proposed model performs better compared to the models used currently. Furthermore, our proposed framework will allow respondents to choose the questionnaire type to answer, which could be particularly beneficial to them when using voice-based surveys.

AB In a GPS-denied environment, even the combination of GPS and Inertial Navigation System (INS) cannot provide location reliably and accurately. We propose a new denoised stereo Visual Odometry VO/INS/GPS integration system for autonomous navigation based on tightly coupled fusion. The presented navigation system can estimate the location of the vehicle in either GPS-denied or low-texture environments. Because of the random walk characteristics of the drift error of the inertial measurement units (IMU), the errors of the states grow with time. To correct these growing errors, a continuous update of observations is necessary. For this purpose, the system state vector is augmented with the extracted features from a stereo camera. Consequently, we utilize the measurements of extracted features from consecutive frames and GPS-derived information to make these updates. Moreover, we apply the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) technique before data fusion to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the inertial sensor measurements and attenuate high-frequency noises while conserving significant information like vehicle motion. To verify the performance of the proposed method, we utilize four flight benchmark datasets with top speeds of 5 m/s, 10 m/s, 15 m/s, and 17.5 m/s, respectively, collected over an airport runway by a quad rotor. The results demonstrate that the proposed VO/INS/GPS navigation system has a superior performance and is more stable than the VO/INS and GPS/INS methods in either GPS-denied or low-texture environments; it outperforms them by approximately 66% and 54%, respectively.

AB In underwater wireless sensor networks, routing play a vital role in selecting an optimal path for packet forwarding. In routing scheme, most of the existing work is suffering from both load balancing and void node issue. This is due to the environmental interference, overloaded data, energy depletion, random deployment and mobility of the nodes. However, it causes loss of packet, high energy depletion and bad network quality. We have resolved this issue by implementing load balancing and void healing routing using cuckoo search optimization (CSO) scheme. In this scheme, first we placed the parent node and identify their child node within the transmission range in each level of the network. Then, we applied load balancing with priority based packet forwarding to maintain the uneven distribution of the load and reduces the end-to-end delay. Next, void healing routing with CSO scheme is addressed to recover the convex and concave void issue in the network. A novel multi-objective fitness function is also formulated for selecting the optimal number of nodes. In packet routing, each child node is responsible for receiving the packets from their neighbor nodes and transferred to the parent node. After receiving the packets at parent node, autonomous underwater vehicle is used for collecting the relevant packets from each parent node through minimum travelling time and send towards the base station. The performance evaluation of proposed scheme shows better network quality, packet delivery ratio, less energy consumption and delay over the existing solutions.

AB Cooperative positioning (CP) is considered as a promising positioning method for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (multi-AUVs), because CP is characterized by low cost and high precision. In this research, a novel autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) CP algorithm is proposed to enhance the global localization accuracy of the follower AUV. However, in traditional CP algorithm, the positioning error is large under the condition that the outlier data exists in the observation, which happens commonly. So in this research, a novel CP algorithm based on the factor graph and maximum correntropy(FGMC) for AUV is proposed to enhance the global localization accuracy of the AUV. Different from the traditional algorithms, this presented FGMC-based CP algorithm implements mathematically the Bayes filter by converting the global function estimation problem into the local one. And furthermore, the maximum correntropy is used as the cost function in the factor graph to estimation problem, this can reduce the influence of outliers on positioning accuracy. FGMC based cooperative positioning algorithm is established to mathematically implement the Bayes filter by converting the global function estimation problem into local function estimation problem. Furthermore, the maximum correntropy is used as the cost function in the factor graph to estimate the variables. To demonstrate and verify the proposed algorithm, simulation and real tests in different scenarios are performed in this research. Compared with the traditional CP algorithms, the positioning error of the proposed FGMC cooperative positioning algorithm is obviously smaller than that of the other algorithms.

TI Quantifying Spatiotemporal Greenhouse Gas Emissions Using Autonomous

SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

ID METHANE EMISSIONS; WATER; EBULLITION
AB Accurately quantifying total greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., methane) from natural systems such as lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands requires the spatial and temporal measurement of both diffusive and ebullitive (bubbling) emissions. Ebullitive emissions exhibit high spatial and temporal variability and as such are difficult to measure. Traditional manual measurement techniques provide only limited localized assessment of methane flux, often introducing significant errors when extrapolated to the whole-of-system. This is further exacerbated when whole-of-region estimates are developed for inclusion in global greenhouse gas inventories. In this paper, we directly address these current sampling limitations by comparing two robot boat-based sampling systems with complementary sensing modalities to directly measure in real time the spatiotemporal release of methane to atmosphere across inland waterways. The first system consists of a single Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) fitted with an Optical Methane Detector with algorithms to exploit the robot's mobility and transect repeatability for the accurate detection and quantification of methane bubbles across whole-of-system. The second system consists of multiple networked ASVs capable of persistent operation and scalable to whole-of-region monitoring. Each ASV carries a novel automated chamber-based gas sampling system to allow simultaneous real-time measurement of methane across the waterway. These ASV systems provide a foundation for persistent large-scale spatiotemporal sampling allowing scientists to develop whole-of-region greenhouse gas estimates and greatly improve global inventory budgets. An overview of the single and multi-robot sampling systems is presented, including their automated methane detection and sampling methodologies for the spatiotemporal quantification of greenhouse gas release to atmosphere. Experimental results are shown demonstrating each system's ability to autonomously navigate, detect, and quantify methane release to atmosphere across an entire inland reservoir.

TI Estimation of Volumetric Oxygen Concentration in a Marine Environment

SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

ID BIOLUMINESCENCE; SENSORS; OPTODE
AB Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration is a key indicator of the health and productivity of an aquatic ecosystem. This paper presents a new method for high-resolution characterization of DO as a function of both space and time. The implementation of a new oxygen optode in an Iver2 autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is described, which enables the system to measure both absolute oxygen concentration and percentage saturation. Also described are details of AUV missions in Hopavagen Bay, Norway, which consisted of a series of repeated undulating lawnmower patterns that covered the bay. Through offline postprocessing of data, sensor characteristic models were developed, as well as a 3D lattice time series model. The model was constructed by estimating DO at each 3D lattice node location using a 1D Kalman filter that fused local measurements obtained with the AUV. By repeating model construction for several missions that spanned 24 h, estimates of DO as a function of space and time were calculated. Results demonstrated (1) the AUVs ability to repeatedly gather high-spatial-resolution data (2) significant spatial and temporal variation in DO in the water body investigated, and (3) that a 3D model of DO provides better estimates of total DO in a volume than extrapolating from only a single 2D plane. Given the importance of oxygen within an ecosystem, this new method of estimating the quantity of DO per volume has the potential to become a reliable test for the health of an underwater ecosystem. Also, it can be refined for detecting and monitoring a range of soluble gases and dispersed particles in aquatic environments, such as dissolved O2 and CO2 around production facilities such as fish farms, or dispersed hydrocarbons and other pollutants in fragile ecosystems.

AB The forthcoming 6G networks are expected to provide a vision of overlapping aerial-ground-underwater wireless networks. Meanwhile, the rapid development of the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUTs) brings forth many categories of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)-assisted Underwater Wireless Networks (UWNs). In this paper, we argue that the AUV-assisted UWNs can be intelligently utilized to track underwater pollution. To perform smart underwater pollution tracking, we propose the paradigm of AUV flock-based networking system and Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-enabled AUV flock Networking System (SDN-AUVNS). We introduce the concept of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) into the control of SDN-AUVNS and propose the upgrade of the control plane of the SDN-AUVNS to with the multi-tier edge computing ability. By the proposed system architecture, we adopt the artificial potential field theory to construct the network controlling model. And we present the underwater tracking model for SDN-AUVNS, especially for the underwater pollution equipotential line of a particular concentration. Furthermore, to provide accurate path planning for the equipotential line tracking, we utilize the linearizability mechanism to optimize and revise the control input for the SDN-AUVNS. Lastly, we give a fast united control algorithm that can intelligently schedule the SDN-AUVNS to track underwater pollution equipotential lines. In particular, we propose a smart approach with the name of 'Inverse Distance Weighting' to optimize the detection sample of the SDN-AUVNS. Evaluation results indicate that our proposal is able to track/survey the equipotential lines within a satisfactory error.

ID RADIATED NOISE
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) provide a unique and cost-effective platform for conducting ocean acoustic measurements and surveys such as marine mammal monitoring, extensive area seafloor topography survey, and fish stock survey. The small and medium-sized AUVs combine load-carrying capability, motion, and range and allow for timescale observations that are difficult to achieve with traditional acoustic observation platforms. However, self-noise is still an unavoidable challenge for AUVs when applied in passive acoustic monitoring. This paper presents the acoustic observation application of the Petrel acoustic AUV in marine monitoring. The layout design of a Petrel acoustic AUV and acoustic sensor integration are described in detail, and the self-noise characteristics of Petrel acoustic AUVs are evaluated by simulation and testing. The results showed that the self-noise level of Petrel acoustic AUVs is effectively controlled with its optimized design, and the maximum noise of the propulsion system is only 75 dB in the low-frequency band. Therefore, the Petrel acoustic AUV can be used as an ideal acoustic observation platform to carry out diverse observation tasks. Finally, a solution of fixed-depth motion is proposed to address the problem that frequent attitude adjustment affects the quality of acoustic data in fixed-depth navigation. According to a sea trial in the South China Sea, the method can significantly reduce the attitude adjustment frequency and, thus, provide an ideal environment for acoustic observation. This method also applies to other underwater mobile observation platforms. This study provides a reference for the acoustic integration design of underwater equipment such as long-range AUVs or hybrid-driven underwater gliders.& nbsp;Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

AB This work is part of an ongoing research project to develop an unmanned flying social robot to monitor dependants at home in order to detect the person's state and bring the necessary assistance. In this sense, this paper focuses on the description of a virtual reality (VR) simulation platform for the monitoring process of an avatar in a virtual home by a rotatory-wing autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). This platform is based on a distributed architecture composed of three modules communicated through the message queue telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol: the UAV Simulator implemented in MATLAB/Simulink, the VR Visualiser developed in Unity, and the new emotion recognition (ER) system developed in Python. Using a face detection algorithm and a convolutional neural network (CNN), the ER System is able to detect the person's face in the image captured by the UAV's on-board camera and classify the emotion among seven possible ones (surprise; fear; happiness; sadness; disgust; anger; or neutral expression). The experimental results demonstrate the correct integration of this new computer vision module within the VR platform, as well as the good performance of the designed CNN, with around 85% in the F1-score, a mean of the precision and recall of the model. The developed emotion detection system can be used in the future implementation of the assistance UAV that monitors dependent people in a real environment, since the methodology used is valid for images of real people.

AB This paper proposes a two-dimensional car-following model to tackle traffic flow problems where considering continuum lateral distances enables a simpler or more natural mathematical formulation compared to traditional car-following models. These problems include (i) the effects of lateral friction often observed in HOV lanes and diverge bottlenecks, (ii) the relaxation phenomenon at merge bottlenecks, (iii) the occurrence of accidents due to lane changing, and (iv) traffic models for autonomous vehicles (AVs). We conjecture that traditional car-following models, where the lateral dimension is discretized into lanes, struggle with these problems and one has to resort to ad-hoc rules conceived to directly achieve the desired effect, and that are difficult to validate.
   We argue that the distance maintained by drivers in order to avoid collisions in all directions plays a fundamental role in all these problems. To test this hypothesis, we propose a simple two-dimensional microscopic car-following model based on the social force paradigm, and build simulation experiments that reproduce these phenomena. These phenomena are reproduced as an indirect consequence of the model's formulation, as opposed to ad-hoc rules, thus shedding light on their causes.
   A better understanding of the behavior of human drivers in the lateral dimension can be translated to improving autonomous driving algorithms so that they are human-friendly. In addition, since AV technology is proprietary, we argue that the proposed model should provide a good starting point for building AV traffic flow models when real data becomes available, as these data come from sensors that cover two-dimensional regions.

AB The autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) frequently operates in harsh underwater environments, and timely fault diagnosis of the AUV can prevent mission failure and equipment loss. Data-driven methods based on a single data source have been widely utilized for fault diagnosis of the AUV because they do not require the construction of complex mechanism models and have high fault diagnosis accuracy. However, these methods face challenges in accomplishing complex fault diagnosis tasks because the single data source provides very restricted fault features. To address this issue, an attention mechanism-based multisensor data fusion neural network (MDFNN) for AUV fault diagnosis is proposed in this work. First, a feature extraction layer based on the two-dimensional (2D) convolutional method with a 1D kernel is introduced to extract features from each sensor data separately, significantly optimizing the model architecture. Second, an efficient channel attention mechanism-based feature fusion layer is proposed to reassign weights to the features of each sensor data, enabling the model to focus more on crucial features. Finally, the fused features are input to the fully connected layers and softmax layer to realize the fault diagnosis of multisensor data. In the end, the diagnostic performance of the proposed MDFNN is evaluated utilizing real AUV experimental data. The experiment shows that the proposed MDFNN has a very fast convergence speed and 98.37% fault diagnosis accuracy, demonstrating its excellent fault diagnosis performance. The proposed MDFNN provides a generalized and simply structured fault diagnosis framework for the AUV with multiple types of sensor data, providing significant engineering value.

DE vehicle-infrastructure cooperative autonomous driving; roadside 3D

AB Infrastructure 3D Object Detection is a pivotal component of Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperated Autonomous Driving (VICAD). As turning objects account for a high proportion of traffic at intersections, anchor-free representation in the bird's-eye view (BEV) is more suitable for roadside 3D detection. In this work, we propose CetrRoad, a simple yet effective center-aware detector with transformer-based detection head for roadside 3D object detection with single LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). CetrRoad firstly utilizes a voxel-based roadside LiDAR feature encoder module that voxelizes and projects the raw point cloud into BEV with dense feature representation, following a one-stage center proposal module that initializes center candidates of objects based on the top N points in the BEV target heatmap with unnormalized 2D Gaussian. Then, taking attending center proposals as query embedding, a detection head with multi-head self-attention and multi-scale multi-head deformable cross attention can refine and predict 3D bounding boxes for different classes moving/parked at the intersection. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DAIR-V2X-I benchmark with an acceptable training time cost, especially for Car and Cyclist. CetrRoad also reaches comparable results with the multi-modal fusion method for Pedestrian. An ablation study demonstrates that center-aware query as input can provide denser supervision than a purified feature map in the attention-based detection head. Moreover, we were able to intuitively observe that in complex traffic environment, our proposed model could produce more accurate 3D detection results than other compared methods with fewer false positives, which is helpful for other downstream VICAD tasks.

AB Target approaching is an essential ability in marine applications, such as underwater rescue. The recent advances in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) make them ideal options to deliver the target approaching in anchor-free environments, where no device with a known position (anchor) is pre-deployed. To approach a moving target, the trajectory planning of AUVs is an indispensable technical guarantee. However, due to the lack of anchors and the error accumulation during the navigation, the position errors of AUVs grow without bound and degrade trajectory planning performance. Thus, an AUV localization procedure is required and should be used in combination with the trajectory planning. In this paper, we research the multiple-AUV trajectory planning based on AUV cooperative localization and propose a framework named multiple-AUV cooperative localization based trajectory planning (MCLTP). Under MCLTP, scalable cooperative localization for multiple AUVs (SCLMA) and trajectory planning for multiple AUVs (TPMA) algorithms are derived. The design of SCLMA focuses on improving the localization accuracy by alleviating the accuracy degradation caused by the accumulated errors in the inertial measurements. TPMA formulates the trajectory planning into a convex optimization problem with balanced target detection probability and tracking accuracy. Furthermore, the considerations of the practical constraints, such as the kinematic and communication limitations of AUVs, collision and obstacle avoidance, make TPMA reliable in the complex marine environments. Simulation results reveal the advantages of the proposed methods by comparisons with the state-of-the-art alternative algorithms.

AB Summer surveys of the Chukchi Sea indicate that high densities of age-0 gadid fishes, historically Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) but recently also walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus), dominate the pelagic fish community. Adults are comparatively scarce, suggesting that either overwinter survivorship of age-0 gadids is low, or that they emigrate to other areas of the Pacific Arctic. To examine population movement, we conducted repeat acoustic surveys with saildrone autonomous surface vehicles equipped with echosounders throughout summer 2018. The saildrones' range and endurance enabled two large-scale surveys of the U.S. Chukchi shelf. Acoustic backscatter, a proxy for fish density, was highest in regions with sea surface temperatures of 6-8 degrees C, and lowest in areas influenced by recent ice melt. A subarea of the central Chukchi was surveyed a total of four times; backscatter in this subarea increased by > 85% from late-July to mid-September. As summer progressed, fish developed more extensive diel vertical migrations and backscatter from individuals doubled. Both changes suggest increases in backscatter were driven primarily by increasing body size. Particle tracking simulations indicated age-0 gadids were likely retained over the Chukchi shelf by extended periods of wind-driven southward flow during the survey period before strong northward flow in late fall transported them to the north. These findings suggest that in summer 2018, age-0 gadids were advected northward to the Chukchi shelf from the northern Bering Sea, where they were retained during a period of growth until late fall before being advected farther north toward the Chukchi and Beaufort shelf breaks.

AB The ride comfort of bus passengers is a critical factor that is recognised to attract greater ridership towards a sustainable public transport system. However, it is challenging to estimate bus passenger comfort onboard while travelling due to the complex non-linear interaction among various factors. A practicable method to collect real-time comfort ratings by passengers is also not readily available. This study developed an artificial neural network (ANN) model with three layers to precisely estimate real-time ride comfort of bus passengers. The inputs are vehicle-related parameters (speed, acceleration and jerk), passenger-related features (posture, location, facing, gender, age, weight and height), ride comfort index in ISO 2631-1997 (vibration dose value and maximum transient vibration value), and output is passenger rating (collected from a specialised mobile application). The ANN model provided a satisfactory performance and good correlation between inputs and output with an average MSE = 0.03 andR-value = 0.83, respectively. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to quantify the relative contribution of each variable in the ANN model, revealing similar contributions among all influencing factors in the range of 4-6%. On average, passenger-related factors contribute slightly higher than vehicle-related factors to the ride comfort estimation based on the connection weight approach. The development of ANN model which can precisely estimate bus ride comfort is important as a considerable amount of machine learning and artificial intelligence are utilised to guide autonomous bus (AB). The present findings can help AB designers and engineers in improving AB technology to achieve a higher level of passengers' onboard comfort.

ID PARTITION
AB Purpose: Localization and mapping with LiDAR data is a fundamental building block for autonomous vehicles. Though LiDAR point clouds can often encode the scene depth more accurate and steadier compared with visual information, laser-based Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) remains challenging as the data is usually sparse, density variable and less discriminative. The purpose of this paper is to propose an accurate and reliable laser-based SLAM solution. Design/methodology/approach: The method starts with constructing voxel grids based on the 3D input point cloud. These voxels are then classified into three types to indicate different physical objects according to the spatial distribution of the points contained in each voxel. During the mapping process, a global environment model with Partition of Unity (POU) implicit surface is maintained and the voxels are merged into the model from stage to stage, which is implemented by Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Findings: We propose a laser-based SLAM method. The method uses POU implicit surface representation to build the model and is evaluated on the KITTI odometry benchmark without loop closure. Our method achieves around 30% translational estimation precision improvement with acceptable sacrifice of efficiency compared to LOAM. Overall, our method uses a more complex and accurate surface representation than LOAM to increase the mapping accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Experimental results indicate that the method achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art methods. Originality/value: We propose a novel, low-drift SLAM method that falls into a scan-to-model matching paradigm. The method, which operates on point clouds obtained from Velodyne HDL64, is of value to researchers developing SLAM systems for autonomous vehicles.

ID VEHICLES
AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) play a crucial role in enhancing urban mobility within the context of a smarter and more connected urban environment. Three-dimensional object detection in AVs is an essential task for comprehending the driving environment to contribute to their safe use in urban environments. Existing 3D LiDAR object detection systems lose many critical point features during the down-sampling process and neglect the crucial interactions between local features, providing insufficient semantic information and leading to subpar detection performance. We propose a dynamic feature abstraction with self-attention (DFA-SAT), which utilizes self-attention to learn semantic features with contextual information by incorporating neighboring data and focusing on vital geometric details. DFA-SAT comprises four modules: object-based down-sampling (OBDS), semantic and contextual feature extraction (SCFE), multi-level feature re-weighting (MLFR), and local and global features aggregation (LGFA). The OBDS module preserves the maximum number of semantic foreground points along with their spatial information. SCFE learns rich semantic and contextual information with respect to spatial dependencies, refining the point features. MLFR decodes all the point features using a channel-wise multi-layered transformer approach. LGFA combines local features with decoding weights for global features using matrix product keys and query embeddings to learn spatial information across each channel. Extensive experiments using the KITTI dataset demonstrate significant improvements over the mainstream methods SECOND and PointPillars, improving the mean average precision (AP) by 6.86% and 6.43%, respectively, on the KITTI test dataset. DFA-SAT yields better and more stable performance for medium and long distances with a limited impact on real-time performance and model parameters, ensuring a transformative shift akin to when automobiles replaced conventional transportation in cities.

AB Driving a vehicle in a safe manner is a highly specialized task that depends on the driver's cognitive ability, skills, attention, fast processing, interpretation of traffic situations and rules, and above all, sound decision making. By driver, we imply either a human or an intelligent agent. In parallel to numerous yet fragmented studies that have addressed the individual effect of the above factors, there has been a continuous quest towards a unifying perspective to articulate the driving task within the framework of a cognitive architecture. Adaptive Control of the Thought-Rational (ACT-R) as a theory of human cognition is among the most promising and complete cognitive architectures that has been widely used to model human behavior and decision making. It is sensible to suggest that it can realistically be employed to model human behavior in driving, and by the same token, it can be configured as architecture for an autonomous driving system. In this paper, we present a directed review of drive simulators, and cognitive architectures, notably ACT-R architecture. Resources including but not limited to Google, Google Scholar, Crossref, Science Direct, and Mendeley are examined, compiled, and presented in this document. The results are classified into seven categories: (1) simulation environment; (2) review of ongoing drive simulators; (3) driving simulation data analysis; (4) driving performance analysis; (5) driving simulation validation; (6) driver behavior analysis; and (7) driving simulation experiments. The review could be beneficial to researchers and stakeholders in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Driverless cars.

AB Adding human cognitive skills to planetary exploration through remote teleoperation can lead to more valuable scientific data acquisition. Still, even small amounts of latency can significantly affect real-time operations, often leading to compromised robot safety, goal overshoot, and high levels of cognitive workload. Thus, novel operational strategies are necessary to cope with these effects. This paper proposes three augmented teleoperation interfaces that allow the user to operate a robot subject to 3 seconds of latency: (1) Avatar-Aided Interface (AAI), a semi-autonomous approach based on a virtual element; (2) Predictive Interface (PI), an approach with direct control and predictive elements; and (3) Hybrid Interface (HI), where operators can easily switch between PI and AAI. We conducted a systematic within-subject experiment to evaluate the proposed interfaces in a realistic virtual environment with frequent traction losses. The user study compared AAI and PI to a Control Interface (CI), which did not display any augmented elements. The main results of this comparison showed that: (1) AAI led to a significant reduction in workload and a significant increase in usability and robot safety; (2) the use of the PI caused a significant increase in path length, indicating that operators overshoot their goals more often with this approach; (3) PI and AAI had lower reported effort; and (4) AAI is more flexible and effortless than PI and CI. Finally, during traction loss periods, PI and AAI had shortcomings that led to confusion from the operator, showing the need to integrate uncertainty measures in future interface design.

AB Highly accuracy classification and mapping of seafloor hydrothermal fields provides an important addition to research into the geological background and exploration of seafloor massive sulfides (SMS). Currently, acoustic remote sensing using multibeam sounding systems (MBES) is the primary means of achieving large-scale seafloor classification. However, the characteristics of complex topography, complex seafloor distribution, and deep water depth of the hydrothermal fields make it difficult to obtain accurate high-resolution seafloor classification maps using shipboard MBES surveys. Here, a seafloor classification strategy combining shipboard MBES and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) sidescan sonar data is proposed. First, a downscaling model is established, which downscales the MBES backscatter mosaic (12-kHz and 10-m resolution) to a resolution of 2 m. The second step performs feature extraction of the downscaled MBES backscatter mosaic (12-kHz and 2-m resolution), the AUV sidescan sonar backscatter mosaic (150-kHz and 2-m resolution), and a seafloor digital elevation model (2-m resolution). Finally, a deep neural network model was built for training and classification. To evaluate the classification performance of the model, the method was applied to the survey of the Duanqiao hydrothermal field. Results were verified using field data (deep-tow video). The overall root mean square error and coefficient of determination (R-2) for the classification were 0.032 and 0.840, respectively. The experimental results show that the method can effectively meet the challenges to seafloor classification presented by complex seafloor distribution, and can obtain an accurate high-resolution seafloor classification map.

AB Altitude estimation is one of the fundamental tasks of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) automatic navigation, where it aims to accurately and robustly estimate the relative altitude between the UAV and specific areas. However, most methods rely on auxiliary signal reception or expensive equipment, which are not always available, or applicable owing to signal interference, cost or power-consuming limitations in real application scenarios. In addition, fixed-wing UAVs have more complex kinematic models than vertical take-off and landing UAVs. Therefore, an altitude estimation method which can be robustly applied in a GPS denied environment for fixed-wing UAVs must be considered. In this paper, we present a method for high-precision altitude estimation that combines the vision information from a monocular camera and poses information from the inertial measurement unit (IMU) through a novel end-to-end deep neural network architecture. Our method has numerous advantages over existing approaches. First, we utilize the visual-inertial information and physics-based reasoning to build an ideal altitude model that provides general applicability and data efficiency for neural network learning. A further advantage is that we have designed a novel feature fusion module to simplify the tedious manual calibration and synchronization of the camera and IMU, which are required for the standard visual or visual-inertial methods to obtain the data association for altitude estimation modeling. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated, and validated using real flight data obtained during a fixed-wing UAV landing phase. The results show the average estimation error of our method is less than 3% of the actual altitude, which vastly improves the altitude estimation accuracy compared to other visual and visual-inertial based methods.

AB Radar sensors are gradually becoming a wide-spread equipment for road vehicles, playing a crucial role in autonomous driving and road safety. The broad adoption of radar sensors increases the chance of interference among sensors from different vehicles, generating corrupted range profiles and range-Doppler maps. In order to extract distance and velocity of multiple targets from range-Doppler maps, the interference affecting each range profile needs to be mitigated. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional neural network for automotive radar interference mitigation. In order to train our network in a real-world scenario, we introduce a new data set of realistic automotive radar signals with multiple targets and multiple interferers. To our knowledge, we are the first to apply weight pruning in the automotive radar domain, obtaining superior results compared to the widely-used dropout. While most previous works successfully estimated the magnitude of automotive radar signals, we propose a deep learning model that can accurately estimate the phase. For instance, our novel approach reduces the phase estimation error with respect to the commonly-adopted zeroing technique by half, from 12.55 degrees to 6.58 degrees. Considering the lack of databases for automotive radar interference mitigation, we release as open source our large-scale data set that closely replicates the real-world automotive scenario for multiple interference cases, allowing others to objectively compare their future work in this domain.

AB When the bi-stable stochastic resonance method was applied to enhance weak thruster fault for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), the enhancement performance could not satisfy the detection requirement of weak thruster fault. As for this problem, a fault feature enhancement method based on mono-stable stochastic resonance was proposed. In the method, in order to improve the enhancement performance of weak thruster fault feature, the conventional bi-stable potential function was changed to mono-stable potential function which was more suitable for aperiodic signals. Furthermore, when particle swarm optimization was adopted to adjust the parameters of mono-stable stochastic resonance system, the global convergent time would be long. An improved particle swarm optimization method was developed by changing the linear inertial weighted function as nonlinear function with cosine function, so as to reduce the global convergent time. In addition, when the conventional wavelet reconstruction method was adopted to detect the weak thruster fault, undetected fault or false alarm may occur. In order to successfully detect the weak thruster fault, a weak thruster detection method was proposed based on the integration of stochastic resonance and wavelet reconstruction. In the method, the optimal reconstruction scale was determined by comparing wavelet entropies corresponding to each decomposition scale. Finally, pool-experiments were performed on AUV with thruster fault. The effectiveness of the proposed mono-stable stochastic resonance method in enhancing fault feature and reducing the global convergent time was demonstrated in comparison with particle swarm optimization based bi-stochastic resonance method. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed fault detection method was illustrated in comparison with the conventional wavelet reconstruction.

AB Objective The study aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the factors impacting technology adoption, to predict the acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies. Background Although the acceptance of AI devices is usually defined by behavioural factors in theories of user acceptance, the effects of technical and human factors are often overlooked. However, research shows that user behaviour can vary depending on a system's technical characteristics and differences in users. Method A systematic review was conducted. A total of 85 peer-reviewed journal articles that met the inclusion criteria and provided information on the factors influencing the adoption of AI devices were selected for the analysis. Results Research on the adoption of AI devices shows that users' attitudes, trust and perceptions about the technology can be improved by increasing transparency, compatibility, and reliability, and simplifying tasks. Moreover, technological factors are also important for reducing issues related to human factors (e.g. distrust, scepticism, inexperience) and supporting users with lower intention to use and lower trust in AI-infused systems. Conclusion As prior research has confirmed the interrelationship among factors with and without behaviour theories, this review suggests extending the technology acceptance model that integrates the factors studied in this review to define the acceptance of AI devices across different application areas. However, further research is needed to collect more data and validate the study's findings. Application A comprehensive overview of factors influencing the acceptance of AI devices could help researchers and practitioners evaluate user behaviour when adopting new technologies.

AB Featured Application This study focuses on the design of a 3-DOF spherical motor for the camera module of the humanoid and autonomous systems. The proposed 3-DOF spherical motor has a wide application prospect in joints and eyeballs of the humanoid, unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous cars, walking robots, and other fields. In keeping with consumers' preferences for electromagnetic motors of ever smaller power consumption, it is necessary to improve the power efficiency of the electromagnetic motors used in unmanned aerial vehicles and robots without sacrificing their performance. Three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) spherical motors have been developed for these applications. Accordingly, this study modifies the 3-DOF spherical motor proposed by Hirata's group in a previous study (Heya, A.; Hirata, K.; Niguchi, N., Dynamic modeling and control of three-degree-of-freedom electromagnetic actuator for image stabilization, IEEE Transactions on Magnetics 2018, 54, 8207905.) to accomplish a 3-DOF spherical motor for camera module with higher torque output in the large rotation angle. The main contribution of this study is to improve the static torque in the X- and Y-axes with an improved electromagnetic structure and a particular controlling strategy. In the structural design, eight symmetrical coils with specific coil combination are used instead of conventional four symmetrical coils. In this study, the development of the proposed 3-DOF spherical motor was constructed and verified by using a 3D finite-element method (3D FEM). The simulation results show that the proposed 3-DOF spherical motor has higher torque output in the large rotation angle when compared to the original 3-DOF spherical motor.

AB As supply chains recover from the impact of COVID-19, a sudden acceleration of interest in digitalization and automation is expected, as firms increasingly look towards digital technologies as sources of innovation in the wake of an extreme disruption. The purpose of this study is to utilize the experience of supply chain practitioners, to ascertain the current level of adoption of a number of key Industry 4.0 technologies, understand what preparatory measures are being taken by firms to ensure they are digitally-ready to utilise Industry 4.0 technologies, recognise how and where these technologies are likely impact supply chains, and investigate whether organisational size is a factor in technology adoption. This empirical study utilises primary data from a descriptive survey of supply chain practitioners working across a range of industry sectors and different stages in the supply chain. Whilst the findings from this research indicate that some Industry 4.0 technologies are still in the early stages of adoption, amongst Australian supply chain organisations, they clearly show which technologies are anticipated to have the greatest impact, what sectors that impact will most likely occur in, and which specific improvements they are expected to drive. Larger firms were found to be more digitally-ready than smaller firms, and a number of significant gaps were identified between expected impact and expected investment, meaning little spend is currently projected for certain technologies that are expected to have a significant impact.

AB The Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem, which emerged in the last quarter of the century, has been adapted for territorial, naval and aerial platforms starting from the year of 2000's and some parametric filter approaches such as Kalman Filter based Extended Kalman Filter and Distributed Kalman Filter, the state-estimation methods including nonparametric methods such as Particle Filter, some high level control aspiring, model or graphics-based and particularly image processing techniques has been used along with it. A strong need for performance analysis of the SLAM problem by classification can be mentioned, as it vary considerably in the platform, vehicle, sensor, and media type such as territorial, naval and aerial platforms. The particle flow filter, which put forward in 2009 for the first time, was particularly attractive due to its advantages such as high accuracy and fast convergence. In this research, a Particle Flow Filter based SLAM structure is given including mathematical bases/background of the filter, analysis, an autonomous ground vehicle and a sensor model, for the first time in the literature. According to the simulation results provided with the performance analysis of estimation under uncertainty tools/algorithms, although it has some computational complexity that may cause real time application concerns, the particle flow filter based SLAM performance is superior than other recursive state estimation approaches emerged before in the literature in terms of accuracy. Especially in the measurement environments with less uncertain sensors, it is preferable because it removes the problem of degeneration which arises in the particle filter structure.

ID CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW; PHASE-TRANSITION
AB We consider the car following problem for a set of autonomous vehicles following each other on either an infinite or circular road. The behavior of each car is specified by its "speed regulator", a device that decides to increase or decrease the speed of the car as a function of the head-tail distance to its predecessor and the speed of both cars. A collective behavior emerges that corresponds to previously proposed cellular automata traffic models. We further analyze the traffic patterns of the system in the long term, as governed by the speed regulator and we study under which conditions traffic patterns of maximum flow can or cannot be reach. We show the existence of suboptimal flow conditions that require external coordination mechanisms (that we do not consider in this paper) in order to reach the optimal flow achievable with the given density. In contrast with other approaches, we do not try to reproduce observed or measured traffic patterns. We analyze a deterministic speed regulator in order to decipher the emergent dynamics, and to ponder what maneuvers can be safely performed. Here, we restrict our attention to the car following problem. By comparing our speed regulator with classical models, auch as the Nagel-Schreckenberg and KKW models, we observe that although our regulator is formulated in simple terms, its dynamics share similarities with these models. In particular, the KKW model is designed to reproduce the observed behavior that a trailing car in the synchronization range of the leading car tends to regulate its speed to maintain a constant distance. this same behavior is adopted by our speed regulator, showing that this is a safe way of driving.

ID OSCILLATING FOILS
AB Marine mammals could directly harvest energy from waves and obtain propulsive force through oscillating flapping fins or horizontal tail flukes, which in many cases have been observed and proved to be substantial. The propulsion generated by the flapping fin has been analyzed by many researchers from both the theoretical and experimental prospects; however, the structural and operational optimization of a flapping fin for the optimal propulsion performance has been less studied, such as the investigation of the effects of the phase difference between heave and pitch motion, maximum oscillation angle, fin shape, oscillation centre of the fin and the operating sea state on the generated propulsion. In this paper, the flapping fin is used as a self-propulsor to propel an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for propulsion assistance. For the optimization design of the flapping fin, its propulsion effect is numerically investigated with different structural parameters and under various operation conditions using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches. Verification and validation study have been implemented to quantify the numerical uncertainties and evaluate the accuracy of the proposed CFD method. Then, a series of case studies are thoroughly conducted to investigate the effects of different structural parameters and operational conditions on the generated propulsion of a flapping fin by CFD simulations. The simulation results demonstrate that different structural parameters and operation conditions would significantly impact the magnitude and distribution state of the fluid pressure around the flapping fin surface, thus, affect the propulsion performance of the fin. The findings in this study will provide guidelines for the structural and operational optimization design of a flapping fin for self-propulsion of mobile platforms.

AB Multiple-object tracking has long been a topic of interest since it plays an important role in many computer vision applications. Existing works are mostly designed for outdoor tracking, such as video surveillance and autonomous driving. However, the behaviors of objects in outdoor tracking scenarios do not fully reflect the tracking challenges in indoor tracking environments. In outdoor tracking scenarios, pedestrians and vehicles usually move uniformly from place to place on a simple straight path, and target appearances are usually different. In contrast, in indoor scenarios, such as choreographed performances, the dynamic behaviors of dancers lead to severe occlusions, and similar costumes present a homogeneous appearance problem. These severe occlusion and homogeneous appearance problems in indoor tracking lead to noticeable degradation in the performance of existing works. In this paper, we propose a depth-enhanced tracking-by-detection framework and a semantic matching strategy combined with a scene-aware affinity measurement method to mitigate occlusion and homogeneous appearance problems significantly. In addition, we introduce an indoor tracking dataset and increase the diversity of existing benchmark datasets for indoor tracking evaluation. We conduct experiments on both the proposed indoor tracking dataset and the latest MOT benchmarks, MOT17 and MOT20. The experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms other works on the convincing HOTA metric across the benchmarks and greatly reduces the number of identity switches by 20% compared to that of the second-best tracker, DeepSORT, in our proposed indoor MOT benchmark dataset.

AB This study considers a closed core-suburb city connected by a highway. Two travel modes, namely on-demand and frequency-based autonomous vehicles (AVs), are used for commuting between the suburb and urban core. Each resident attempts to maximize his/her individual utility with consideration to environment quality by choosing a residential location, travel mode, departure time, and non-housing composite consumption good within an expenditure budget. The traffic equilibria are analytically derived for two right-of-way policies, namely (i) the two travel modes sharing the right-of-way and (ii) frequency-based AVs-priority, with consideration of the effect of AVs on travel and urban characteristics. It was found from the analytical results that at any level of AV automation, adopting the frequency-based AVs-priority policy can reduce travel cost for suburban residents while alleviating traffic congestion. Furthermore, an increase in AV automation level results in an increase in expected trip time if the highway capacity is less elastic than the value of travel time for on-demand AVs with respect to the automation level. In addition, if the environment quality depends solely on the residential density, with an increasing level of AV automation, the suburban population and the number of residents using on-demand AVs increase, the land rent in the urban core reduces, the suburb expands, and the utility for all residents increases. These findings help to provide a better understanding of the interactions between AVs, travel and urban characteristics, and serve as a valuable reference to transportation-urban planning in the era of driving automation.

AB This paper proposes a simple and a robust bistable docking system with a deep learning based real-time drogue detection and tracking system for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) for mid-air autonomous aerial docking. Secure aerial docking mechanisms between the leader and follower aerial vehicles with effective drogue detection and tracking strategies are fundamental challenges during the air-to-air docking phase of autonomous aerial docking. To confront those issues, this paper not only presents the design of a bistable-based aerial docking mechanism, but also proposes effective deep learning based real-time drogue detection using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and real-time tracking algorithm using a point cloud algorithm. To ensure novelty and robustness for the aerial docking mechanism, a foldable bistable gripper-type mechanism is designed to increase the grasping performance with simplicity and adaptability. The proposed gripper acts as a drogue by itself to grasp a probe which is attached to the follower aerial vehicle. To employ an effective drogue detection method, the deep learning based real-time object detection algorithm, YOLOv3, is used to implement the drogue detection system. The proposed new probe-and-drogue type bistable docking system has the advantages of being simple and robust. The deep learning based real-time drogue detection method increases the detection rate. Moreover, the real-time tracking algorithm with a depth camera system does not require a GPS/INS system and many other sensors to follow the drogue movement in the air. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have increasingly played a key role in monitoring the marine environment, studying its physical-chemical parameters for the supervision of endangered species. AUVs now include a power source and an intelligent control system that allows them to autonomously carry out programmed tasks. Their navigation system is much more challenging than that of land-based applications, due to the lack of connected networks in the marine environment. On the other hand, due to the latest developments in neural networks, particularly deep learning (DL), the visual recognition systems can achieve impressive performance. Computer vision (CV) has especially improved the field of object detection. Although all the developed DL algorithms can be deployed in the cloud, the present cloud computing system is unable to manage and analyze the massive amount of computing power and data. Edge intelligence is expected to replace DL computation in the cloud, providing various distributed, low-latency and reliable intelligent services. This paper proposes an AUV model system designed to overcome latency challenges in the supervision and tracking process by using edge computing in an IoT gateway. The IoT gateway is used to connect the AUV control system to the internet. The proposed model successfully carried out a long-term monitoring mission in a predefined area of shallow water in the Mar Menor (Spain) to track the underwaterPinna nobilis(fan mussel) species. The obtained results clearly justify the proposed system's design and highlight the cloud and edge architecture performances. They also indicate the need for a hybrid cloud/edge architecture to ensure a real-time control loop for better latency and accuracy to meet the system's requirements.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is an important carrier for studying the ocean. AUV's accurate navigation and positioning capabilities are most important in ocean exploration. Due to the limitation of communication, the limitation of cost, and the limitation of beacon use conditions, the navigation and positioning of AUV still rely on the sensor equipped with its own dead reckoning algorithm. In the deep sea, Extended Kalman Filtering(EKF), Unscented Kalman Filtering(UKF), and Adaptive Kalman Filtering(AKF) all produce error divergence in navigation and positioning. The article adopted the acoustic-based ranging and positioning method to analyze the error under different conditions, accurately compensate the error in the dead reckoning, and finally improve the navigation and positioning accuracy. Considering the controllability and observability of AUV during ranging positioning, the article proved the stability of AUV model. The article also explained the observability and selection of paths in the ranging and positioning methods to ensure the observability of AUV. The simulation results showed that compared with the dead reckoning method using Kalman filter, the method of introducing ranging location is effective and feasible. The article considered the direction and size of the actual current, and verifies the effectiveness of the method under different conditions. The article considered the divergence of the dead reckoning error and explores the optimal path size at different depths to better obtain the actual AUV motion position. The article also discussed the research that can be done in the future. In the practical application of underwater robots, the article proposed a solution to the inaccuracy of navigation and positioning in the case of large diving depth. The results of the article have practical application value.

AB Surveys and monitoring are essential to study the biology and ecology of coral reefs in order to understand the reasons behind reef demise and recovery. However, mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) remain largely unknown compared to their shallow counterparts because it is difficult to observe the seafloor below 30 m depths. Here, we propose a seafloor observation method using a low-cost autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). This method was developed to allow many people to easily perform underwater observations of MCEs, and is also applicable to general seafloor surveys, such as underwater artificial structures, hydrothermal vent fields, etc. The method possesses three important attributes to achieve effective surveys. First, it can be applied in highly rugged terrains and enables the AUV to track omnidirectional surfaces at high speed (Max. similar to 1 m/s). Second, it can produce a reliable three-dimensional (3D) image of the seafloor based on a depth sensor. Third, it can be used to estimate the flow velocity field. The proposed method was tested by using the AUV HATTORI- 2, which is a lightweight, one- man portable AUV equipped with commercial off-the-shelf sensors. Our study area is the Sekisei Lagoon in the South Ryukyus, which represents the largest coral reef complex in Japan. The method enabled us not only to obtain a wide and high-definition 3D image of mesophotic coral reefs that captures detailed characteristics of marine habitats but also to acquire environmental data, such as flow velocity field and seawater temperature, spatially and temporally aligned with the 3D image.

AB The paper is concerned with station keeping control problem via backstepping for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) systems with nonlinear continuous function. This paper is the first time to using backstepping control method for stochastic nonlinear systems. Under nonlinear growth conditions, when the AUV motion affected the driving force, resistance of ocean and the force generated by current the difficulty arising from the underwater robot system output feedback makes the station keeping problems challenging and forward-looking. There exist two problems to research the fast response time and good station keeping, respectively. There a new control method is proposed for the first time to construct a backstepping stabilizing controller. In this paper, a concept of randomness to study the station keeping control problem of output feedback of stochastic nonlinear systems, remove the original harsher growth conditions, make it meet the more general function growth conditions. In order to deal with the station error of system converges to arbitrarily small domains. Under all the states of the system meet boundedness, a coordinate transformation is proposed. A useful technical theorem is proposed in the stability analysis to show that combined with the backstepping method to cleverly construct a set of Lyapunov functions, and obtain the output controller to ensure that the system is asymptotically probabilistic in the global scope. Finally, through the ocean library in the Simulation X simulation software and the Hardware-in-the-loop simulation, the controller design results are imported into the AUV actuator model to verify the effectiveness of the controller design.

AB Dependable, safety-critical real-time (SCRT) systems are becoming increasingly important and complex. Examples of such systems are autonomous or self-driving cars which are poised to revolutionise the transport industry. A critical part of these SCRT systems is the network communication protocol that is used by components in an SCRT system to exchange data. Communication protocols for SCRT systems are required to exhibit predictable, worst-case execution times and thus have to be designed in a more static and less flexible way. To ensure this predictability, current state-of-art communication protocols for SCRT systems are based on the Time-Triggered Architecture (TTA), where static and equal-length time-slots are used for all nodes to access the communication channel, irrespective of the size of their transmission payload. This determinism forms the basis of predictable timing, behaviour and fault tolerance. However, this determinism comes at the cost of poor channel and bandwidth utilisation, which hinders the development of SCRT systems. In this paper, we propose a more flexible approach, INCUS+, that allocates the slot length of a node based on its transmission requirements in a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) round. We achieve this while retaining the level of dependability required for SCRT systems and ensuring fail-silence. We validate this through formal verification of the timing parameters for the transmission windows of all participating nodes as well as independent bus guardians. Our design exhibits a significant improvement in bandwidth and channel utilisation, as we demonstrate in an autonomous vehicle case study.

ID MASSIVE MIMO; SPECTRAL EFFICIENCY
AB Device-to-device (D2D) communications is a cell-free enabler of 5G and rising wireless communications demand between low-orbit satellite constellation, self-driving vehicles and unmanned aerial systems. Distributed computation (where channel state information is not available) schemes facilitate direct exchanges between mobile user equipment (UE) and if necessary a UE can serve as a relay. Thus, it is essential to develop robust D2D communications frameworks agnostic to the channel distribution which can deliver scalable data rates to self-driving vehicles while the spectral efficiency(SE) is non-asymptotic and energy consumption is increasing to yield an energy efficiency (EE) that is a unimodal function. In this paper, we evaluate the optimal EE by using the computation of the SE in distributed multiple input- multiple output (MIMO) wireless communications. A generalized water-filling framework over arbitrary channel distribution is used to evaluate the SE and then the EE to compare with single-input single-output optimized approximate schemes based on Taylor expansion. The computation yields the optimal power allocation at the transmitters which is derived to illustrate the performance gain of the generalized water-filling distributed MIMO over the approximate scheme. Our simulations results show novel achievable EE linear growth as a function of SE and robust trade-offs in performance gains determined by the total power consumption optimal profile when switching MIMO dimensions. Our trade-off prevents power consumption while EE is decreasing. Thus by switching the number of MIMO operating antenna elements at both the receiver and transmitter sides, EE is no more a unimodal function as illustrated in the literature.

AB The spatial and temporal evolution of an introduced dye tracer in a small reservoir was observed using a robotic autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), providing quantifiable data of the convective processes which drive transport and mixing. The tracer served as a surrogate for advanced treated water that has been proposed to be introduced into a reservoir as part of an overall system for efficient water reclamation, a critical management tool for addressing water issues facing the southwest. While emergent autonomous technology has been widely applied in the field of oceanography, applications in the field of limnology remain limited. Here, we introduce survey methods used to map the evolution of the introduced dye, which was influenced by differential cooling of the reservoir. A cooling event during the study modified the diurnal cycle of the reservoir, generating horizontal temperature gradients that caused the dye to migrate quickly out of the shallow side-arm where it was introduced. The dispersion of the dye throughout the reservoir was well captured by the sampling resolution of the AUV providing three-dimensional data sets of complex convective processes that were used to validate a numerical lake/reservoir model. The operational efficiency, adaptive sampling capabilities, and resolution of observations make the AUV an appealing alternative compared to traditional boat-based survey methods for rapidly assessing reservoirs. Survey method limitations, advantages, and future recommendations are discussed. The study demonstrates the utility of an AUV in a small reservoir, providing the framework for increased use of high-resolution mobile instrument platforms in future limnology studies.

AB Light is a major cue for nearly all life on Earth. However, most of our knowledge concerning the importance of light is based on organisms' response to light during daytime, including the dusk and dawn phase. When it is dark, light is most often considered as pollution, with increasing appreciation of its negative ecological effects. Using an Autonomous Surface Vehicle fitted with a hyperspectral irradiance sensor and an acoustic profiler, we detected and quantified the behavior of zooplankton in an unpolluted light environment in the high Arctic polar night and compared the results with that from a light-polluted environment close to our research vessels. First, in environments free of light pollution, the zooplankton community is intimately connected to the ambient light regime and performs synchronized diel vertical migrations in the upper 30m despite the sun never rising above the horizon. Second, the vast majority of the pelagic community exhibits a strong light-escape response in the presence of artificial light, observed down to 100 m. We conclude that artificial light from traditional sampling platforms affects the zooplankton community to a degree where it is impossible to examine its abundance and natural rhythms within the upper 100 m. This study underscores the need to adjust sampling platforms, particularly in dim-light conditions, to capture relevant physical and biological data for ecological studies. It also highlights a previously unchartered susceptibility to light pollution in a region destined to see significant changes in light climate due to a reduced ice cover and an increased anthropogenic activity.

AB Various human problems are tried to resolve with biomimetic design which imitate biological forms. A biomimetic Carangiform robotic fish provides great benefits with flexible maneuverability, high propulsion efficiency and less noisy considering classical rotary underwater vehicles. This paper presents a dynamic simulation model of the Carangiform robotic fish with flexible multi-joint propulsion mechanism considered as an artificial spine system for two swimming cases. In order to swim like a real fish, multi-joint propulsion mechanism assumed a series planar hinge joints which represent vertebras is adjusted by optimizing with a new searching method which provides precise values as direct search methods. The flapping frequency and the speed are proportional with the tail link lengths and angles of the joints. Thus, the optimization parameters are selected as end point coordinates of the joints and lengths of the each link to imitate the real traveling body wave. Two possible route planning scenarios for the robotic fish model inspired from the Carangiform motion are performed. These scenarios are summarized by two cases. Case 1 is the free swimming mode permits to go straight forward until it faces an obstacle. The fish decides to the turning direction by using decision-making process when it encounters an obstacle and finds the way to turn. In the Case 2, the fish proposes to reach the destination area along the shortest path. When faced with obstacles, it overcomes obstacles and tries to reach the target in the shortest way again.

TI Autonomous Visual Mapping and Exploration With a Micro Aerial Vehicle

AB Cameras are a natural fit for micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) due to their low weight, low power consumption, and two-dimensional field of view. However, computationally-intensive algorithms are required to infer the 3D structure of the environment from 2D image data. This requirement is made more difficult with the MAV's limited payload which only allows for one CPU board. Hence, we have to design efficient algorithms for state estimation, mapping, planning, and exploration. We implement a set of algorithms on two different vision-based MAV systems such that these algorithms enable the MAVs tomap and explore unknown environments. By using both self-built and off-the-shelf systems, we show that our algorithms can be used on different platforms. All algorithms necessary for autonomous mapping and exploration run on-board the MAV. Using a front-looking stereo camera as the main sensor, we maintain a tiled octree-based 3D occupancy map. The MAV uses this map for local navigation and frontier-based exploration. In addition, we use a wall-following algorithm as an alternative exploration algorithm in open areas where frontier-based exploration under-performs. During the exploration, data is transmitted to the ground station which runs large-scale visual SLAM. We estimate the MAV's state with inertial data from an IMU together with metric velocity measurements from a custom-built optical flow sensor and pose estimates from visual odometry. We verify our approaches with experimental results, which to the best of our knowledge, demonstrate our MAVs to be the first vision-based MAVs to autonomously explore both indoor and outdoor environments.

AB Recent advances in robotic technologies provide new opportunities to conduct high-resolution sampling of patchily distributed zooplankton and associated environmental variables. We used two robots and molecular probes to assess the temporal and spatial variability of zooplankton in water samples obtained from Monterey Bay, California. The Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Dorado is a mobile platform that carries ten, 1.8-L bottles ("Gulpers") capable of rapidly acquiring discrete seawater samples, and an extensive sensor suite for gathering contextual environmental data during day-long expeditions. Molecular assays were conducted ex situ at a shore-based laboratory. In contrast, the Environmental Sample Processor (ESP) was deployed as a stationary (moored) device capable of repeatedly "sipping" water to conduct in situ molecular assays and record environmental data during month-long deployments. Molecular analyses were conducted with the sandwich hybridization assay (SHA), which employed 185 ribosomal RNA oligonucleotide probes designed to detect calanoid and podoplean copepods, and the larvae of barnacles, mussels, polychaete worms, brachyuran crabs, and invasive green crabs (Carcinus maenas). Both the stationary and mobile sampling protocols revealed the greatest zooplankton diversity and abundance in relatively warm waters, higher in chlorophyll and lower in salinity and nitrate. Diversity and abundance were least in recently upwelled waters with the inverse conditions. High-resolution sampling revealed that while calanoid copepods were generally associated with elevated chlorophyll, they were most abundant in upwelling fronts, in some cases. These narrow features appear to provide favorable conditions for the growth and aggregation of certain zooplankton. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There are concerns about the impact that global warming will have on our environment, which will inevitably result in expanding deserts and rising water levels. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) were considered and chosen as the most suitable tool for conducting surveys concerning these global environmental problems. JAMSTEC has started building a long-range cruising AUV. The plan for its development is in several steps. As the first step, the AUV Urashima was built in 1999, and sea trials have been held since 2000. The Urashima dived to a 3,518-m depth in 2001. At the end of February 2005, the Urashima was able to cruise autonomously and continuously for 317 km, beyond its target range of 300 km; this record is the longest one in the world. The PEFC (Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell) power system with metal hydrogen storage has been developed for expanding its cruising range. As the second step, the AUV Urashima-2, which will cruise more than 3,000 km, started development in 2007. The development plan of the next AUV was selected as one of the official, nationally important technologies in Japan. The deep-ocean areas we know of constitute only a small fraction of the entire deep ocean. The information that can be obtained by man-made satellites is limited to that pertaining to the surface or subsurface portions of the sea. Today, man does not have the means to canvass the entire deep ocean at one time. If a number of AUV like the Urashima autonomously cruise in various deep-ocean areas of the world, man will then, for the first time, be able to get that entire picture.

AB In the field of autonomous driving, object detection under point clouds is indispensable for environmental perception. In order to achieve the goal of reducing blind spots in perception, many autonomous driving schemes have added low-cost blind-filling LiDAR on the side of the vehicle. Unlike point cloud target detection based on high-performance LiDAR, the blind-filling LiDARs have low vertical angular resolution and are mounted on the side of the vehicle, resulting in easily mixed point clouds of pedestrian targets in close proximity to each other. These characteristics are harmful for target detection. Currently, many research works focus on target detection under high-density LiDAR. These methods cannot effectively deal with the high sparsity of the point clouds, and the recall and detection accuracy of crowded pedestrian targets tend to be low. To overcome these problems, we propose a real-time detection model for crowded pedestrian targets, namely RTCP. To improve computational efficiency, we utilize an attention-based point sampling method to reduce the redundancy of the point clouds, then we obtain new feature tensors by the quantization of the point cloud space and neighborhood fusion in polar coordinates. In order to make it easier for the model to focus on the center position of the target, we propose an object alignment attention module (OAA) for position alignment, and we utilize an additional branch of the targets' location occupied heatmap to guide the training of the OAA module. These methods improve the model's robustness against the occlusion of crowded pedestrian targets. Finally, we evaluate the detector on KITTI, JRDB, and our own blind-filling LiDAR dataset, and our algorithm achieved the best trade-off of detection accuracy against runtime efficiency.

AB This article introduces the single winding type selection process for a dual winding (DW) three-phase motor. Unlike the conventional DW three-phase motor design, the proposed single winding type selection process simultaneously considers the mechanical length determined by the single winding type and the motor overheating problem caused by faulty operation for each single winding type. The proposed single winding type selection process consists of four steps. First, all single-winding combinations, the point symmetry dual winding (PSDW), line symmetry dual winding (LSDW), and cross symmetry dual winding (CSDW) for DW three-phase motor are investigated. Second, according to the selected single winding types, the busbar height (BH) required for dual division is designed and compared. Third, the stack length (SL) of motor in the PSDW, the LSDW, and the CSDW obtained through overheat compensation design to avoid the overheating problem in the faulty mode are investigated and compared. In the overheat compensation design, the thermal map utilizing measurement data from the previously developed motor for an integrated electric brake (IEB) system, a radial basis function, an overheat compensation coefficient, and the IEB brake load condition are utilized. Finally, the single winding type of DW three-phase motor is selected as the CSDW by comparing the total motor size. As a result of the DW three-phase motor design, the proposed CSDW can reduce the motor size by 12.0% and 4.2%, respectively, compared with the PSDW and LSDW.

AB In this article, a decentralized optimal tracking control problem has been studied for a large-scale autonomous vehicle system with heterogeneous system dynamics. Due to the ultralarge number of agents, the notorious "curse of dimension" problem as well as the unrealistic assumption of the existence of reliable very large-scale communication links in uncertain environments have challenged the traditional multiagent system (MAS) algorithms for decades. The emerging mean-field game (MFG) theory has recently been widely adopted to generate a decentralized control method that deals with those challenges by encoding the large scale MASs' information into a novel time-varying probability density functions (PDF) which can be obtained locally. However, the traditional MFG methods assume all agents are homogeneous, which is unrealistic in practical industrial applications, e.g., Internet of Things (IoTs), and so on. Therefore, a novel mean-field Stackelberg game (MFSG) is formulated based on the Stackelberg game, where all the agents have been classified as two different categories where one major leader's decision dominates the other minor agents. Moreover, a hierarchical structure that treats all minor agents as a mean-field group is developed to tackle the assumption of homogeneous agents. Then, the actor-actor-critic-critic-mass (A(2)C(2) M) algorithm with five neural networks is designed to learn the optimal policies by solving the MFSG. The Lyapunov theory is utilized to prove the convergence of A(2)C(2) M neural networks and the closed-loop system's stability. Finally, a series of numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method.

AB In this study, high-resolution bathymetric multibeam and optical image data, both obtained within the Belgian manganese (Mn) nodule mining license area by the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Abyss, were combined in order to create a predictive random forests (RF) machine learning model. AUV bathymetry reveals small-scale terrain variations, allowing slope estimations and calculation of bathymetric derivatives such as slope, curvature, and ruggedness. Optical AUV imagery provides quantitative information regarding the distribution (number and median size) of Mn nodules. Within the area considered in this study, Mn nodules show a heterogeneous and spatially clustered pattern, and their number per square meter is negatively correlated with their median size. A prediction of the number of Mn nodules was achieved by combining information derived from the acoustic and optical data using a RF model. This model was tuned by examining the influence of the training set size, the number of growing trees (ntree), and the number of predictor variables to be randomly selected at each node (mtry) on the RF prediction accuracy. The use of larger training data sets with higher ntree and mtry values increases the accuracy. To estimate the Mn-nodule abundance, these predictions were linked to ground-truth data acquired by box coring. Linking optical and hydroacoustic data revealed a nonlinear relationship between the Mn-nodule distribution and topographic characteristics. This highlights the importance of a detailed terrain reconstruction for a predictive modeling of Mn-nodule abundance. In addition, this study underlines the necessity of a sufficient spatial distribution of the optical data to provide reliable modeling input for the RF.

AB The path following of underactuated autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) with line-of-sight (LOS)-based heading and velocity guidance is studied thoroughly in the presence of complex uncertainties and asymmetric input saturation that actuators are likely to suffer from. On the basis of the extended-state-observer-based LOS (ELOS) principle and guided velocity design strategies, a finite-time heading and velocity guidance control (HVG) scheme is presented. Firstly, an improved ELOS (IELOS) is developed such that the unknown sideslip angle can be estimated directly, instead of requiring one more step to calculate it by the output of observers and relying on the equivalent assumption between actual heading angle and guidance angle. Secondly, a new form of velocity guidance is designed by considering magnitude and rate constraints and path's curvature, keeping in line with ASV's manoeuvrability and agility. Then asymmetric saturation is considered and studied by designing projection-based finite-time auxiliary systems to avoid parameter drift. All error signals of the closed-loop system of ASV are forced to converge to an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of the origin within a finite settling time by the HVG scheme. The expected performance of the presented strategy is demonstrated via a series of simulations and comparisons. In addition, to show the strong robustness of the presented scheme, stochastic noises modelled by Markov process, bidirectional step signals and faults both multiplication and addition types are considered in simulations. & COPY; 2023 ISA.

AB A detailed representation of the surrounding road scene is crucial for an autonomous driving system. yellow The camera-based Bird's Eye View map has been a popular solution to present the surrounding information, due to its low cost and rich spatial context information. Most of the existing methods predict the BEV map based on the depth-estimation or the trivial homography method, which may cause the error propagation and the absence of content. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a novel end-to-end framework that employs the front monocular image to predict the road layout and vehicle occupancy. In particular, to capture the long-range feature, we redesign a CNN encoder with a large kernel size to extract the image features. For reducing the big difference between the front image features and the top-down features, we propose a novel Spatial-Channel projection module to convert the front map into the top-down space. Additionally, concerning the correlation between front view and top-down view, we propose the Dual Cross-view Transformer module to refine the top-down view feature maps and strengthen the transformation. Extensive evaluations on the KITTI and Argoverse datasets present that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art results for both datasets. Furthermore, the proposed model runs in 37 FPS on a single GPU, demonstrating the generation of a real-time BEV map. The code will be published at https://github.com/raozhongyu/BEV_LKA.

AB The autonomous vehicles (AVs) in smart city, as intelligent mobile robots, are expected to provide diversified services to facilitate the life of citizens. However, the attributes of the services requested by users are different and the statuses of the AVs managed by different central servers are dynamically changed. To execute the services with the minimum cost based on the requirements of users and the statuses of AVs therefore becomes a challenge. In this article, we establish an intelligent multi-attribute service response framework in smart city based on the request of users and the response of AVs. In the first phase of the framework, each central server decides the minimum service execution cost (SEC) to respond to the user's service by considering the available resources of its AVs, where the minimization problems are formulated for the services with one attribute and the services with multiple attributes, respectively. To address the problems, the optimal AV selection (OAVS) algorithm for the services with one attribute and the OAVS-M algorithm for the services with multiple attributes are designed. In the second phase, based on the SEC of each central server, an auction game is developed to model the competition among the central servers to help the user select the optimal one to execute the service with the lowest service transaction price (STP). By achieving the Nash equilibrium of the game, the optimal strategy of each central server to win the chance for executing the service is obtained. The simulation results show that the designed framework can reduce the STP compared with the conventional schemes.

AB The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) shows great potential in realizing the smart ocean. Underwater acoustic sensor networks (UWASNs) are the main existing form of IoUT but face with reliable data transmission problems. To tackle this issue, this article considers using the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) as a mobile collector to construct a reliable hierarchical information collection system while the Value of Information (VoI) is used as a main metric to measure the Quality of Information (QoI). We first establish a realistic model for characterizing the behaviors of AUV and sensor nodes as well as the challenging environments. Then, to construct a hierarchical architecture, we design a sink node (SN) selection scheme by jointly considering VoI conservation and energy load balancing. After that, we focus on AUV path planning with the objective of maximizing the VoI of the total network. We formulate the problem as a combinatorial optimization problem and provide an integer linear programming (ILP) model for this problem. An optimal algorithm based on the branch-and-bound (BB) method is proposed for seeking for the optimal solution, in which the lower bound and upper bound calculation strategies are specifically designed. Two near-optimal heuristic algorithms based on the concepts of the ant colony algorithm (ACA) and the genetic algorithm (GA) are also provided for further reducing the computation complexity. Finally, simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

AB The X-rudder concept has been applied to more and more autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in recent years, since it shows better maneuverability and robustness against rudder failure compared to the traditional cruciform rudder. Aiming at the fault-tolerant control of the X-rudder AUV (hereinafter abbreviated as xAUV), a fault-tolerant steering prototype system which can realize dynamics control, autonomous rudder fault detection and fault-tolerant control is presented in this paper. The steering prototype system is deployed on a verification platform, an xAUV, in which the monitor software is developed based on the factory method and the onboard software is developed based on the finite state machine (FSM). Dual-loop increment feedback control (DIFC) is first introduced to obtain smooth virtual rudder commands considering actuator's limitations. Then the virtual rudder commands are transformed into X-rudder commands based on the mapping theory. In rudder fault diagnosis, an optimized particle filter is proposed for estimating rudder effect deduction, with proposal distribution derived from unscented Kalman filter (UKF). Then the fault type can be determined by analyzing indicators related to the deduction. Fault-tolerant control is addressed by dealing with nonlinear programming (NLP) problem, where minimization of allocation errors and control efforts are set as the optimization objectives, and rudder failure, saturation and actuators limitations are considered as constraints. The fixed-point iteration method is utilized to solve this optimization problem. Many field tests have been conducted in towing tank. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed steering prototype system is able to detect rudder faults and is robust against rudder failure.

We also introduce a technique for identifying arrow signal lights in multiple urban traffic environments. For detection, we use map data and two different focal length cameras for traffic light detection at various distances. For recognition, we propose a new algorithm that combines object detection and classification to recognize the light state classes of traffic lights. Furthermore, we use a unified network by sharing features to decrease computation time. The results reveal that the proposed approach enables high-performance traffic light detection and recognition.

AB We propose an algorithm using method of evolving junctions to solve the optimal path planning problems with piece-wise constant flow fields. In such flow fields, we prove that the optimal trajectories, with respect to a convex Lagrangian in the objective function, must be formed by piece-wise constant velocity motions. Taking advantage of this property, we transform the infinite dimensional optimal control problem into a finite dimensional optimization and use intermittent diffusion to solve the problems. The algorithm is proven to be complete. At last, we demonstrate the performance of the algorithm with various simulation examples.

AB This article provides a modeling framework for quantifying cost and optimizing motion plans in combat situations with rapid weapon fire, multiple agents, and attacker uncertainty characterized by uncertain parameters. Recent developments in numerical optimal control enable the efficient computation of numerical solutions for optimization problems with multiple agents, nonlinear dynamics, and a broad class of objectives. This facilitates the application of more realistic, equipment-based combat models, which track both more realistic models, which track both agent motion and dynamic equipment capabilities. We present such a framework, along with a described algorithm for finding numerical solutions, and a numerical example.

AB This paper describes an algorithm for constructing a procedural sea bottom model, which can be used for testing and debugging machine vision systems of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The algorithm consists of three main stages: generating a low-frequency heightmap (used by the designer to define the basic form of a water area), constructing a three-dimensional model (based on the heightmap and fractal noise), and visualizing the three-dimensional model (refined by means of hardware or manual tessellation). The sea bottom model has the following features: it is detailed accurate to a screen pixel, each of its sections is absolutely unique, and its size is adequate for any tests.

AB Driving cycles are essential in hybrid locomotive design by conditioning their size and performance. This paper introduces a new systemic approach to hybrid locomotive design, taking real-world driving cycles into account. The proposed approach first exploits clustering analysis with the aim of identifying classes corresponding to particular sets of driving cycles. Then, a synthesis process of a reduced and representative profile from each class of driving cycles is presented. Both approaches are applied to the integrated optimal design of an autonomous hybrid (Diesel-electric) locomotive devoted to shunting and switching operations in nonelectrified areas.

AB Automatic road marking recognition is a key problem within the domain of automotive vision that lends support to both autonomous urban driving and augmented driver assistance such as situationally aware navigation systems. Here we propose an approach to this problem based on the extraction of robust road marking features via a novel pipeline of inverse perspective mapping and multi-level binarisation. A trained classifier combined with additional rule-based post-processing then facilitates the real-time delivery of road marking information as required. The approach is shown to operate successfully over a range of lighting, weather and road surface conditions.

AB Mobile robots must have some effective method for determining their position in the working environment in order to operate appropriately. In this paper, precise outdoor positioning of a vehicle is achieved by continuously fusing odometry with wide-area Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) data through a Kalman filter. The propagation and reduction of spatial uncertainty is computed together with the mobile robot's coordinates and heading. Two distinct sources of differential corrections have been applied to autonomous and teleoperated navigation of the Aurora mobile robot in a road network. Path teaching and path tracking have been successfully tested in several experiments over a relatively flat surface.

DT Article
DE Continuous wavelet transform; Convolution neural network; Tire -pavement
   interaction noise; Classification; Road surfaces
AB This study presents a novel artificial intelligence model (AIM) for the real-time classification of 13 different road types in an autonomous vehicle. The model was developed based on a combination of a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and convolutional neural network (CNN). Previously, three methods have been used for the classification of road types, depending on the type of sensor. First, a camera sensor has been widely used because it can capture the road type directly. Second, a vibration sensor has been used, since the vibration level measured on the suspension or inside the tire depends on the road type. Finally, an acoustic sensor has been used, especially in measuring tire-pavement interaction noise (TPIN). In a previous feasibility study, an AIM was developed to classify road types using TPIN signals, which vary depending on the road type. It can distinguish between two road types: asphalt and snow. Recently, CNN has been widely used as an AIM for classification, but it is limited as the input size of the CNN should be optimized for real-time processing due to its long calculation times, even for a 2D convolution process. Its input is image data, which can be produced through the CWT of the TPIN signal. This study proposes an AIM that can classify 13 different road surfaces in real-time while driving. In this study, a method to determine the optimal filter band and data length used for CWT is proposed. The method was developed based on the classification accuracy of an AIM. The developed AIM was successfully applied to the real-time classification of road types with an accuracy of 95% on a public road.

AB In this paper, a new unsupervised algorithm for the detection of underwater targets in synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) imagery is proposed. The method capitalizes on the high-quality SAS imagery whose high resolution permits many pixels on target. One particularly novel component of the method also detects sand ripples and estimates their orientation. The overall algorithm is made fast by employing a cascaded architecture and by exploiting integral-image representations. As a result, the approach makes near-real-time detection of proud targets in sonar data onboard an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) feasible. No training data are required because the proposed method is adaptively tailored to the environmental characteristics of the sensed data that are collected in situ. To validate and assess the performance of the proposed detection algorithm, a large-scale study of SAS images containing various mine-like targets is undertaken. The data were collected with the MUSCLE AUV during six large sea experiments, conducted between 2008 and 2012, in different geographical locations with diverse environmental conditions. The analysis examines detection performance as a function of target type, aspect, range, image quality, seabed environment, and geographical site. To our knowledge, this study-based on nearly 30 000 SAS images collectively covering approximately 160 km of seabed, and involving over 1100 target detection opportunities-represents the most extensive such systematic, quantitative assessment of target detection performance with SAS data to date. The analysis reveals the variables that have the largest impact on target detection performance, namely, image quality and environmental conditions on the seafloor. Ways to exploit the results for adaptive AUV surveys using through-the-sensor data are also suggested.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have increasingly shown to be useful in civilian applications (such as agriculture, public safety, surveillance) and mission critical military applications. Despite the growth in popularity and applications, UAVs have also been used for malicious purposes. In such instances, their timely detection and identification has garnished rising interest from government, industry and academia. While much work has been done for detecting UAVs, there still exist limitations related to the impact of extreme environmental conditions and big dataset requirements. This paper proposes a novel ensemble deep learning framework that has hybrid synthetic and deep features to detect unauthorized or malicious UAVs by using acoustic, image/video and wireless radio frequency (RF) signals for robust UAV detection and classification. We present the performance evaluation of the proposed approach using numerical results obtained from experiments using acoustic, image/video and wireless RF signals. The proposed approach outperforms the existing related approaches for detecting malicious UAVs.

AB This article presents an estimation scheme for the six degree-of-freedom position and attitude of an aerial vehicle by integrating an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a low-cost real-time kinematic GPS unit, which delivers a precise relative position measurement corrupted by a time-delay. Assuming that the time-delay is known, the extended Kalman filter is generalized to fuse the time-lagged position measurement from GPS with the synchronous attitude and angular velocity measurements from IMU. More specifically, it is formulated as an optimal prediction where the past state is corrected by the position measurement before being propagated up to the current time with the history of the IMU measurements. This provides a compact formulation to merge multiple sensors with varying time-delays in an optimal fashion. The efficacy of the proposed approach is illustrated by a numerical example, experimental data collected over a Navy research vessel, and an outdoor autonomous flight of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle.

TI Real-time UVMS torque distribution algorithm based on weighting matrix

ID PARAMETER-IDENTIFICATION; UNDERWATER ROBOTS; CALIBRATION; MANIPULATOR
AB This study presents a real-time algorithm for even distributing the torque burden on the parallel manipulator with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) through the cooperation of the AUV and manipulator. For the redundant resolution of the underwater vehicle manipulator system (UVMS), we used the weighting matrix of the weighted pseudo inverse for kinematic and dynamic modeling. We made dynamic and kinematic modeling using the force distribution characteristics of parallel manipulators. Using the parallel manipulator's model, the weighting matrix was changed every second to share the manipulator torque with the AUV. The Taguchi method was used to reduce the calculation time for real-time calculation and to perform valve rotation operations with as little torque as possible even in an underwater environment where it is difficult to determine any cause of errors. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm, we experimented with valve rotation in water using the UVMS. Analysis of the experimental results revealed that the manipulator torque load was greatly reduced due to the AUV load distribution.

AB Industrial Internet of unmanned aerial vehicles (IIoUAVs) that enable autonomous inspection and measurement of anything anytime anywhere have become an essential component of the future industrial Internet of things (IIoT) ecosystem. In this paper, we investigate how to apply IIoUAVs for power line inspection in smart grid from an energy-efficiency perspective. First, the energy consumption minimization problem is formulated as a joint optimization problem, which involves both the large-timescale optimization, such as trajectory scheduling, velocity control, and frequency regulation, and the small-timescale optimization, such as relay selection and power allocation. Then, the original NP-hard problem is transformed into a two-stage suboptimal problem by exploring the timescale difference and the energy magnitude difference between the large-timescale and the small-timescale optimizations, and is solved by combining dynamic programming (DP), auction theory, and matching theory. Finally, the proposed algorithm is verified based on real-world map and realistic power grid topology.

AB Current research on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) shows a lot of interest in autonomous UAV navigation. This interest is mainly driven by the necessity to meet the rules and restrictions for small UAV flights that are issued by various international and national legal organizations. In order to lower these restrictions, new levels of automation and flight safety must be reached. In this paper, a new method for ground obstacle avoidance derived by using UAV navigation based on the Dubins paths algorithm is presented. The accuracy of the proposed method has been tested, and research results have been obtained by using Software-in-the-Loop (SITL) simulation and real UAV flights, with the measurements done with a low cost Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) sensor. All tests were carried out in a three-dimensional space, but the height accuracy was not assessed. The GNSS navigation data for the ground obstacle avoidance algorithm is evaluated statistically.

AB In a tractor automatic navigation system, path planning plays a significant role in improving operation efficiency. This study aims to create a suboptimal reference course for headland turning of a robot tractor and design a path-tracking controller to guide the robot tractor along the reference course. A time-minimum suboptimal control method was used to generate the reference turning course based on the mechanical parameters of the test tractor. A path-tracking controller consisting of both feedforward and feedback component elements was also proposed. The feedforward component was directly determined by the desired steering angle of the current navigation point on the reference course, whereas the feedback component was derived from the designed optimal controller. Computer simulation and field tests were performed to validate the path-tracking performance. Field test results indicated that the robot tractor followed the reference courses precisely on flat meadow, with average and standard lateral deviations being 0.031 m and 0.086 m, respectively. However, the tracking error increased while operating on sloping meadow due to the employed vehicle kinematic model.

The proposed approach extracts a runtime monitoring graph from system requirements specified using unified modeling language sequence diagrams with timing annotations. Nonintrusive, in-situ, on-chip hardware dynamically monitors the system execution, matches the specified requirements, and provides detailed information that can be analyzed in the event of a system failure. We present a case study using an autonomous vehicle subsystem demonstrating that the approach can achieve 100% detection rate of common failure types, including timing, dependency, synchronization, and sensor failures. We further analyze the relationship between coverage of system events, detection rates, and hardware requirements.

AB Human route choice is undeniably one of the key contributing factors towards traffic dynamics. However, most existing macroscopic traffic models are typically concerned with driving behavior and do not incorporate human route choice behavior models in their formulation. In this paper, we propose a socio-technical macroscopic traffic model that characterizes the traffic states using human route choice attributes. Essentially, such model provides a framework for capturing the Cyber-Physical-Social coupling in smart transportation systems. To derive this model, we first use Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) to model the human passengers' route choice under bounded rationality. These choices are assumed to be influenced by traffic alerts and other incomplete traffic information. Next, we assume that the vehicles are operating under a non-cooperative cruise control scenario. Accordingly, human route choice segregates the traffic into multiple classes where each class corresponds to a specific route between an origin-destination pair. Thereafter, we derive a Mean Field Game (MFG) limit of this non-cooperative game to obtain a macroscopic model which embeds the human route choice attribute. Finally, we analyze the mathematical characteristics of the proposed model, present simulation studies to illustrate the model behavior and show comparison with existing traffic model.

AB The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm is widely applied in many fields, such as disaster relief and geological exploration. However, it is highly vulnerable when facing an attack from internal malicious UAVs due to the underlying disconnected, intermittent, and limited (DIL) network environment. Recently, building trusted networks has been considered as a strategy to address security issues. Nevertheless, deploying a trusted network in a swarm faces many challenges imposed by the dynamic topology and limited resources of DIL networks. In order to overcome these challenges, we developed a blockchain-based UAV trusted self-organizing networking mechanism (BC-UTSON) to enhance internal security. Three key technologies are proposed for assisting BC-UTSON in achieving trustworthiness. UAV practical Byzantine fault tolerance (U-PBFT) is proposed to guarantee the lightweight consensus and real-time full-node trustworthiness evaluation under the hierarchical self-organizing networking structure of a UAV swarm. A blockchain-based multiweighted subjective logic (BMWSL) scheme has been designed to identify malicious UAV nodes based on the trustworthiness evaluation, which also assists the trusted path quality-aware dynamic routing (TPDR) mechanism to prevent data from routing through malicious nodes. The experimental results show that the proposed BC-UTSON performs much better than nonblockchain-based mechanisms for the UAV swarm.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) hold great potential to support a wide range of applications due to the high maneuverability and flexibility. Compared with single UAV, UAV swarm carries out tasks efficiently in harsh environment, where the network resilience is of vital importance to UAV swarm. The network topology has a fundamental impact on the resilience of UAV network. It is discovered that scale-free network topology, as a topology that exists widely in nature, has the ability to enhance the network resilience. Besides, increasing network throughput can enhance the efficiency of information interaction, improving the network resilience. Facing these facts, this paper studies the throughput of UAV network with scale-free topology. Introducing the hybrid network structure combining both ad hoc transmission mode and cellular transmission mode into UAV network, the throughput of UAV network is improved compared with that of pure ad hoc UAV network. Furthermore, this work also investigates the optimal setting of the hop threshold for the selection of ad hoc or cellular transmission mode. It is discovered that the optimal hop threshold is related with the number of UAVs and the parameters of scale-free topology. This paper may motivate the application of hybrid network structure into UAV network.

AB Path planning is critical to realizing a high-performance unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) crowdsensing system, which can be deployed to carry out large-scale tasks in the physical world, especially in emergency scenarios, such as earthquakes and mudslides. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently proven its superiority in path design. However, it is often applied under the assumption that the entire status of the target region is available, which is hard to achieve in practice. Instead, efforts should be made to ensure the efficient flight of several UAVs in order to collect data with incomplete observations in specified places. In this work, we set out to create a high-performance UAV crowdsensing system by combining DRL with partial observations. We present a novel DRL-based path-planning algorithm called DRL-PP. Specifically, we integrate an attention mechanism into the actor-critic technique to assist UAV swarm collaboration to collect data. We also design an incentive mechanism to ease the problem of sparse reward. Furthermore, we provide a dilemma detection system to prevent the generation of overlapping flight paths. Experimental results from extensive simulations prove that compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed DRL-PP can significantly improve the efficiency of data collection.

AB In recent years, massive outbreaks of the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus, (L.)) have caused colossal harm to coniferous forests. The main solution for this problem is the timely prevention of the bark beetle spread, for which it is necessary to identify damaged trees in their early stages of infestation. Fortunately, high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery together with modern detection models provide a high potential for addressing such issues. In this work, we evaluate and compare three You Only Look Once (YOLO) deep neural network architectures, namely YOLOv2, YOLOv3, and YOLOv4, in the task of detecting infested trees in UAV images. We built a new dataset for training and testing these models and used a pre-processing balance contrast enhancement technique (BCET) that improves the generalization capacity of the models. Our experiments show that YOLOv4 achieves particularly good results when applying the BCET pre-processing. The best test result when comparing YOLO models was obtained for YOLOv4 with the mean average precision up to 95%. As a result of applying artificial data augmentation, the improvement for models YOLOv2, YOLOv3, and YOLOv4 was 65.0%, 7.22%, and 3.19%, respectively.

AB Automated vehicles (AVs) have great potential to revolutionize the transportation sector and landscapes of future cities. The impacts of AVs on urban space, however, are far from clear. Mobility-on-Demand (MOD) services, on the other hand, are readily available in many places. This study seeks to explore (1) how Automated Mobility-onDemand (AMOD) might affect urban residents' levels of accessibility and their residential relocation decisions; and (2) how these impacts might vary across space and socioeconomic groups. We use an agent-based microsimulation platform to assess two future AMOD scenarios in Singapore relative to a baseline. Results suggest that the addition of AMOD could enhance the overall accessibility of the population, but not if private transport modes, including private cars, taxis, and human-driven on-demand services, are prohibited. On the other hand, if private modes are eliminated, AMOD could alleviate inequality in accessibility as it appears to benefit the disadvantaged socioeconomic groups to a larger extent. We also find that AMOD deployment would not induce outward migration, nor would it increase home-work location imbalance. This study demonstrates how largescale microsimulation can be leveraged to assess AMOD scenarios. The findings have some implications for preparing for the inevitable and potentially disruptive emergence of AVs.

AB The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) estimates that 80% of the deaths and injuries resulting from rear-end collisions could be prevented by the use of advanced collision avoidance systems. While autonomous or higher-level vehicles will be equipped with this technology by default, most of the vehicles on our roadways will lack these advances, so rear-end crashes will dominate accident statistics for many years to come. However, a simple and cost-effective in vehicle device that uses predictive tools and real-time driver-behavior and roadway data can significantly reduce the likelihood of these crashes. In this paper, we propose a hybrid physics/data-driven approach that can be used in a kinematic-based forward-collision warning system. In particular, we use a hierarchical regularized regression model to estimate driver reaction time based on individual driver characteristics, driving behavior, and surrounding driving conditions. This personalized reaction time is input into the Brill's one-dimensional car-following model to calculate the critical distance for collision warning. We use the Second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP-2)'s Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) data, the largest and most comprehensive study of its kind, to model driver brake-to-stop response time. The results show that the inclusion of driver characteristics increases model precision in predicting driver reaction times.

AB In this paper, a robust scheme is presented for distributed formation tracking control of marine vessels with heterogeneous hydrodynamics. Provided that multiple ships sail in proximity at sea, the hydrodynamic forces and moments would be changed greatly due to the ship-ship interactions, thereby causing the heterogeneous hydrodynamics; nevertheless, it is usually ignored in formation control of marine vessels. The heterogeneous hydrodynamics is very difficult to model and induces the uncertainty; therefore, it is treated as unknown dynamics in this paper. The neural network (NN), which is well-known for approximation-based control, is employed to handle the unknown dynamics. Note that the NN is employed to approximate the unknown dynamics collectively for reducing the learning parameters. Furthermore, unlike traditional formation control of coordination of positions, the consensus mechanism of velocities is also included into the control design to ensure the performance of formation maintenance. The presented distributed controller for each ship only utilizes the information from itself and its neighbors, aiming to prevent single-point failure in harsh marine environment. All the closed-loop signals are proved to be stable based on Lyapunov theory. Various simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of proposed control design.

AB Objective: An experiment was performed in a driving simulator to investigate the impacts of practice, trust, and interaction on manual control recovery (MCR) when employing fully automated driving (FAD).
   Background: To increase the use of partially or highly automated driving efficiency and to improve safety, some studies have addressed trust in driving automation and training, but few studies have focused on FAD. FAD is an autonomous system that has full control of a vehicle without any need for intervention by the driver.
   Method: A total of 69 drivers with a valid license practiced with FAD. They were distributed evenly across two conditions: simple practice and elaborate practice.
   Results: When examining emergency MCR, a correlation was found between trust and reaction time in the simple practice group (i.e., higher trust meant a longer reaction time), but not in the elaborate practice group. This result indicated that to mitigate the negative impact of overtrust on reaction time, more appropriate practice may be needed.
   Conclusions: Drivers should be trained in how the automated device works so as to improve MCR performance in case of an emergency.
   Application: The practice format used in this study could be used for the first interaction with an FAD car when acquiring such a vehicle.

TI Autonomous docking of a smart wheelchair for the Automated Transport and
   Retrieval System (ATRS)
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
ID LOCALIZATION; TRACKING
AB The Automated Transport and Retrieval System (ATRS) represents a technology-based alternative to van conversions for automobile drivers in wheelchairs. Rather than requiring dramatic, permanent, and expensive modifications to the host vehicle, ATRS employs robotics and automation technologies and can be integrated noninvasively into a standard minivan or sport utility vehicle. At the core of ATRS is a "smart" wheelchair system that autonomously navigates between the driver's position and a powered lift at the rear of the vehicle, eliminating the need for an attendant. From an automation perspective, autonomously docking the wheelchair onto the lift platform presented the most significant technical challenge due to limited clearance between the chair wheels and the lift platform rails. To solve the docking task, we employed a light detection and ranging (LIDAR)-based approach for wheelchair localization coupled with a hybrid motion controller design. Extensive testing from the localization subsystem to the complete ATRS was conducted under representative usage conditions. This included 3 days of public demonstrations indoors at the World Congress on Disabilities, where potential end users were able to evaluate the system. In this environment, ATRS performed more than 300 consecutive cycles without failure. During 2 days of outdoor reliability testing, 97.5% docking reliability was observed. The system is scheduled to enter the commercial market in 2008. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The fusion of spectral-polarimetric information can improve the autonomous reconnaissance capability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in detecting artificial targets. However, the current spectral and polarization imaging systems typically suffer from low image sampling resolution, which can lead to the loss of target information. Most existing segmentation algorithms neglect the similarities and differences between multimodal features, resulting in reduced accuracy and robustness of the algorithms. To address these challenges, a real-time spectral-polarimetric segmentation algorithm for artificial targets based on an efficient attention fusion network, called ESPFNet (efficient spectral-polarimetric fusion network) is proposed. The network employs a coordination attention bimodal fusion (CABF) module and a complex atrous spatial pyramid pooling (CASPP) module to fuse and enhance low-level and high-level features at different scales from the spectral feature images and the polarization encoded images, effectively achieving the segmentation of artificial targets. Additionally, the introduction of the residual dense block (RDB) module refines feature extraction, further enhancing the network's ability to classify pixels. In order to test the algorithm's performance, a spectral-polarimetric image dataset of artificial targets, named SPIAO (spectral-polarimetric image of artificial objects) is constructed, which contains various camouflaged nets and camouflaged plates with different properties. The experimental results on the SPIAO dataset demonstrate that the proposed method accurately detects the artificial targets, achieving a mean intersection-over-union (MIoU) of 80.4%, a mean pixel accuracy (MPA) of 88.1%, and a detection rate of 27.5 frames per second, meeting the real-time requirement. The research has the potential to provide a new multimodal detection technique for enabling autonomous reconnaissance by UAVs in complex scenes.

AB In hazardous situations involving the dispersion of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear pollutants, timely containment of the emission is critical. A contaminant disperses as a dynamically evolving plume into the atmosphere, introducing complex difficulties in predicting the dispersion trajectory and potential evacuation sites. Strategies for predictive modeling of rapid contaminant dispersion demand localization of the emission source, a task performed effectively via unmanned mobile-sensing platforms. With vast possibilities in sensor configurations and source-seeking algorithms, platform deployment in real-world applications involves much uncertainty alongside opportunity. This work aims to develop a plume source detection simulator to offer a reliable comparison of source-seeking approaches and performance testing of ground-based mobile-sensing platform configurations prior to experimental field testing. Utilizing ROS, Gazebo, MATLAB, and Simulink, a virtual environment is developed for an unmanned ground vehicle with a configurable array of sensors capable of measuring plume dispersion model data mapped into the domain. For selected configurations, gradient-based and adaptive exploration algorithms were tested for source localization using Gaussian dispersion models in addition to large eddy simulation models incorporating the effects of atmospheric turbulence. A unique global search algorithm was developed to locate the true source with overall success allowing for further evaluation in field experiments. From the observations obtained in simulation, it is evident that source-seeking performance can improve drastically by designing algorithms for global exploration while incorporating measurements of meteorological parameters beyond solely concentration (e.g. wind velocity and vorticity) made possible by the inclusion of high-resolution large eddy simulation plume data.

AB In this paper, we propose a game theoretical adversarial intervention detection mechanism for reliable smart road signs. A future trend in intelligent transportation systems is "smart road signs" that incorporate smart codes (e.g., visible at infrared) on their surface to provide more detailed information to smart vehicles. Such smart codes make road sign classification problem aligned with communication settings more than conventional classification. This enables us to integrate well-established results in communication theory, e.g., error-correction methods, into road sign classification problem. Recently, vision-based road sign classification algorithms have been shown to be vulnerable against (even) small scale adversarial interventions that are imperceptible for humans. On the other hand, smart codes constructed via error-correction methods can lead to robustness against small scale intelligent or random perturbations on them. In the recognition of smart road signs, however, humans are out of the loop since they cannot see or interpret them. Therefore, there is no equivalent concept of imperceptible perturbations in order to achieve a comparable performance with humans. Robustness against small scale perturbations would not be sufficient since the attacker can attack more aggressively without such a constraint. Under a game theoretical solution concept, we seek to ensure certain measure of guarantees against even the worst case (intelligent) attackers that can perturb the signal even at large scale. We provide a randomized detection strategy based on the distance between the decoder output and the received input, i.e., error rate. Finally, we examine the performance of the proposed scheme over various scenarios.

AB An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) carrying 614 kHz RDI acoustic doppler current profilers (ADCPs) was deployed at four locations over the West Spitsbergen outer shelf in July 2010. The backscatter signal recorded by the ADCPs was extracted and analysed to investigate the vertical distribution and patchiness of pelagic organisms during midnight sun. At the northernmost locations (Norskebanken and Woodfjorden), fresher and colder water prevailed in the surface layer (0-20 m) and scatterers (interpreted as zooplankton and micronekton) were mainly distributed below the pycnocline. In contrast, more saline and warmer Atlantic Water dominated the surface layer at Kongsfjordbanken and Isfjordbanken and scatterers were concentrated in the top 20 m, above the pycnocline. Pelagic scatterers formed patchy aggregations at all locations, but patchiness generally increased with the density of organisms and decreased at depths >80 m. This study contributes to our understanding of the vertical distribution of pelagic organisms in the Arctic, and the spatial coverage of the AUV has extended early acoustic studies limited to Arctic fjords from 1D observations to a broader offshore coverage. Neither synchronized nor unsynchronized vertical migrations were detected, but autonomous vehicles with limited autonomy (<1 day) may not be as effective as long-term mooring deployments or long-range AUVs to study vertical migrations. Short-term AUV-based acoustic surveys of the pelagic communities are nonetheless highly complementary to Eulerian studies, in particular by providing spatial measurements of patchiness. Compared with ship-based or moored acoustic instruments, the 3D trajectory of AUVs also allows using acoustic instruments with higher frequencies and better size resolution, as well as the detection of organisms closer to the surface.

AB Submarine edifices with caldera summits are common along volcanic arcs and much more likely than simple cones to host hydrothermal venting. Compared with cones, however, locating all vent field locations on a caldera's complex bathymetry is a daunting logistical challenge. Here we describe the first use of an autonomous underwater vehicle, ABE, to fully map the distribution of near-bottom hydrothermal tracers over the caldera walls and cone complex of Brothers Volcano, the most active hydrothermal source on the southern Kermadec arc. Sensors on ABE simultaneously measured hydrothermal plume anomalies in temperature, light backscattering (particle concentration), and oxidation-reduction potential (dissolved reduced species) every 2 to 3 m along track. Local maxima in these tracers confirmed known sites on the northwestern wall and the cone summits, and more precisely mapped their extents. We discovered evidence for new sites throughout the entire northwestern half of the caldera wall, at the base of the southeastern wall, and on the flanks of both cones. Systematic variations in the backscattering/temperature ratio identified different types of fluid discharge. Plumes from high-temperature, metal-rich sources dominated the caldera wall, while on top of the caldera wall and on the cones we found only plumes from low-temperature diffuse flow, including occasional S-rich plumes. Source distribution on the walls appears fault controlled, but we detected no sources along the deepest fault defining the rim of the downdropped caldera floor. Advanced deep-sea survey techniques using autonomous vehicles is an indispensible and cost-effective tool for acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between hydrothermal discharge and geology on individual volcanoes.

AB In this paper, we study mixed traffic flow in which some cars are under car-following control and others are under bilateral control. We also provide the necessary (modular string) stability condition for this type of mixed traffic, which can be viewed as an extension of the condition for pure car-following control-based traffic. This necessary stability condition provides some indication of how the introduction of self-driving cars (under bilateral control) will affect today's traffic.

AB The main aim of this briefing is to make visible the invisible and bring light to the role African workers are playing in developing key emergent and everyday digital technologies such as autonomous vehicles, machine learning systems, next-generation search engines and recommendations systems. Once we acknowledge that many contemporary digital technologies rely on a lot of human labour to drive their interfaces, we can begin to piece together what the new global division of labour for digital work looks like and build a greater socio-political response (both at the global and local scale) to make some of these value chains more transparent, ethical and rewarding.

AB We surveyed Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) under sea ice using the autonomous underwater vehicle Autosub-2. Krill were concentrated within a band under ice between 1 and 13 kilometers south of the ice edge. Within this band, krill densities were fivefold greater than that of open water. The under-ice environment has tong been considered an important habitat for krill, but sampling difficulties have previously prevented direct observations under ice over the scale necessary for robust krill density estimation. Autosub-2 enabled us to make continuous high-resolution measurements of krill density under ice reaching 27 kilometers beyond the ice edge.

AB Recent commentary has sounded the alarm about the effects of emerging technologies on strategic stability, yet the topic has received relatively little systematic scholarly attention. Will emerging technologies such as cyber, autonomous weapons, additive manufacturing, hypersonic vehicles, and remote sensing make the world more dangerous? Or is pessimism unwarranted? In this volume, we leverage international relations scholarship, historical data, and a variety of methodological approaches to discern the future implications of new technologies for international security. The findings suggest that new technologies can have multiple, conditional, and even contradictory effects on different aspects of strategic stability, and raise a host of important questions for future research.

AB New technological advances in areas such as digital information, algorithmic forensic data analysis, autonomous surveillance vehicles, advanced robotics, and multispectral sensors (sometimes all working together) can help avert war, introduce more effective peacekeeping and peacemaking initiatives, lessen the impact of conflict on innocent people, and help rebuild war-torn states. When international humanitarian action becomes urgent, by way of knowledge gained through such technologies, then those same peace applications can be used to reduce harmful forms of intervention and to ensure that enforcers are abiding by international law and UN guidance. An ethical failure occurs when such technologies exist to save lives, reduce risks, and secure peace, but are not employed.

Thus sink mobility is introduced to minimize the energy consumption cost of nodes as it directly collects data from the network nodes at minimized communication distance. We also present delay and energy optimized versions of our proposed RE-AEDG to further enhance its performance. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of our proposed RE-AEDG in terms of the selected performance matrics.

AB This paper proposes a sonar-based underwater object classification method for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) by reconstructing an object's three-dimensional (3D) geometry. The point cloud of underwater objects can be generated from sonar images captured while the AUV passes over the object. Then, a neural network can predict the class given the generated point cloud. By reconstructing the 3D shape of the object, the proposed method can classify the object accurately through a straightforward training process. We verified the proposed method by performing simulations and field experiments.

AB To solve the problem of unknown state noises and uncertain measurement noises inherent in underwater cooperative navigation, a new Variational Bayesian (VB)-based Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter (VBAEKF) for master-slave Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) is proposed in this paper. The Inverse Wishart (IW) distribution is used to model the predicted error covariance and measurement noise covariance matrix. The state, together with the predicted error covariance and measurement noise covariance matrix, can be adaptively estimated based on VB approximation. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through a lake trial, which shows the advantage of the proposed algorithm.

AB With a growing demand for the development of smart ocean projects, the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) integrating multiple networks will gradually become the mainstream, particularly for civil, commercial, and military scenarios. During development, however, the security aspect cannot be ignored. Faced with possible future battles on the ocean, this study focuses on underwater source location privacy protection for both static and mobile sources. By combining the Ekman drift model, location privacy protection is converted into multi-round gaming between the source and adversary, in which two ways of gaming on nodes, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), and adversary are adopted to protect the static source location. Because the location of the mobile source, such as underwater intelligent agent, changes regularly, the protection for this type of source is focused on the trajectory, preventing the mobile source from being tracked. This paper aims to protect the location privacy of the static source first and then initial attempts to protect the dynamic source location privacy. By fuzzing the remaining semantic information after the mobile source passes by, the trajectory of the mobile source is protected, thereby protecting its location privacy. Compared with existing algorithms, the simulation results of the proposed scheme indicate the probability that the source has been captured. Furthermore, the results show that the period of safety of the proposed algorithm is longer than that of a multi-hop-based location privacy protection scheme but shorter than that of an autonomous underwater vehicle based scheme. Although the difference in the energy consumption of the nodes among the compared schemes is little increased, the delay varies significantly.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) and edge computing have truly advanced in vehicular networks encouraging assessment of real-time traffic conditions using kinetic information of autonomous vehicles with the help of road side units (RSUs). However, regardless of numerous improvements in sensor fusion technologies the existing vision/LIDAR-based systems have found severe difficulties during perception on roads. In addition, the inter-vehicular communications are hampered due to inefficient RSU placement techniques causing high-latency issues during transmission of messages. Therefore, this article presents an AI-driven vision-based self driver assistance system (VSDAS) comprising a joint RSU deployment mechanism that utilizes enhanced memetic architecture-based optimal RSU placement (MARP) method and an object detection model that implements an improved Haar-cascade object detection algorithm for speedy identification of object. We have designed two varieties of genetic algorithm (GA) to solve optimal placement problem of RSUs: genetic architecture-based with random restart hill climbing (GARRH) and the other is MARP for efficient placement of RSUs. After our experimental results, we see that the MARP algorithm shows best possible RSU locations over different generations achieving significantly better fitness scores than the GAHRC and GA ascribing to its local search process. In addition, Haar-cascade achieves better mean average precision than local binary pattern and histogram of oriented gradients by selecting key frames. The experimental outcomes of our model reveals that the proposed enhanced memetic algorithm reduces the transmission delay to a greater extent. Additionally, the outcomes of our investigations on two public datasets (KITTI and Panasonic) showed that our improved algorithm clearly enhances the object detection performance.

AB To solve the problem of realizing autonomous aerial combat decision-making for unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) rapidly and accurately in an uncertain environment, this paper proposes a decision-making method based on an improved deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm: the multi-step double deep Q-network (MS-DDQN) algorithm. First, a six-degree-of-freedom UCAV model based on an aircraft control system is established on a simulation platform, and the situation assessment functions of the UCAV and its target are established by considering their angles, altitudes, environments, missile attack performances, and UCAV performance. By controlling the flight path angle, roll angle, and flight velocity, 27 common basic actions are designed. On this basis, aiming to overcome the defects of traditional DRL in terms of training speed and convergence speed, the improved MS-DDQN method is introduced to incorporate the final return value into the previous steps. Finally, the pre-training learning model is used as the starting point for the second learning model to simulate the UCAV aerial combat decision-making process based on the basic training method, which helps to shorten the training time and improve the learning efficiency. The improved DRL algorithm significantly accelerates the training speed and estimates the target value more accurately during training, and it can be applied to aerial combat decision-making.

AB Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology is a key component of an autonomous vehicle's sensing system. It also has the potential to be used at the roadside as a major infrastructure-based detection for connected and autonomous traffic infrastructure systems, as well as for the general purpose of traffic data collection and performance evaluation. Lane and movement-based traffic volume data collection is a basic function of roadside traffic sensing systems. The accuracy of volume detection is mainly impacted by occlusion for most of the advanced traffic sensing technologies, such as LiDAR, video, and radar. This paper presents research results to quantify the influence of occlusion on LiDAR systems' traffic volume detection in different traffic demand scenarios. A method for automatic identification and classification of LiDAR specific occlusion was first developed based on the inherent characteristics of LiDAR sensors, which can report occlusion ratios of roadside LiDAR data. Then, the study was extended to accommodate all traffic demand scenarios, traffic levels of service (LOS A to E), and different truck compositions (5% to 30%) by integrating the developed method and traffic simulation. Lastly, a comprehensive case study first verified the accuracy of the simulation results using field data collected from two testbeds, and then at the third testbed, a lane and movement-based traffic volume study was demonstrated. The practical significance of this paper is to help traffic engineers making informed decisions when considering LiDAR as their choice of sensing technology in the field from two aspects: (1) the quantitative relationship between expected occlusion rate and resulted detection accuracy under various traffic conditions; (2) lessons learned from the pilot field implementation on LiDAR, installation strategy, data storage, and communication.

AB With the rapid development of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and the continuous improvement of marine exploration requirements, AUV formation has emerged as a promising technique for performing underwater tasks with greater flexibility, adaptability, and scalability. To achieve AUV formation control, underwater acoustic communication networks (UACNs) are widely used to support information exchange among AUVs. Considering broadcast communications in fully connected mobile UACNs, existing medium access control (MAC) protocols face severe packet collision risk or low reuse efficiency. To improve the timeliness and reliability of the information exchange among AUVs, we develop an efficient scheduling-based adaptive broadcasting MAC (AB-MAC) protocol. The AB-MAC protocol is incompletely centralized, which can be reflected in two aspects. First, to ensure the consistency of the transmission schedule in the network, the AB-MAC protocol selects a control node for each frame to schedule the transmission of all nodes according to the updated network topology. The slot lengths and transmission sequences are changeable in each frame to avoid packet collisions and minimize frame lengths. Second, to further improve the efficiency and robustness of the protocol, all nodes adaptively adjust their transmission time by integrating the information contained in their previously received control packets and ordinary packets. The transmission scheduling problem is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem, which can be solved by our proposed improved Genetic Algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the AB-MAC protocol not only performs well in terms of network throughput and average update interval but also has a high level of robustness even in low-quality underwater acoustic channels.

AB Harnessing hydrokinetic energy from deep water to increase the operation periods of autonomous underwater vehicles and underwater moored platforms has received considerable attention in recent years. Hydrokinetic turbines should have a reliable startup performance for deployment in deep water with a prevailing average current speed of 0.5 m/s. In the present study, a deep-water in-situ power generation system based on a novel chain-driven hydrokinetic turbine is proposed for such low-speed current application. A numerical simulation was performed on the proposed turbine to investigate its hydrodynamic performance at different initial setting positions and tip speed ratios. No static dead band exists in the operation of the turbine, indicating a superior self-starting advantage over traditional drag-type turbines. Multi-objective optimization was performed on the proposed turbine to improve its power coefficient and startup performance. Compared with the initial design (Cp = 0.234, Ct,s = 0.520), the Cp and Ct,s in the Pareto front range from 0.103 to 0.325 and 0.565 to 0.712, respectively. All-process simulation was conducted based on Simulink to estimate the power supply capacity of a deep-water in-situ power generation system using the optimal chain-driven hydrokinetic turbine. The result shows that this system can generate the electricity at 218.45 Wh/day in the deep-water location with an average current speed of 0.334 m/s, providing enough energy to the power units of autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB Subsea pipeline is the safest, most reliable, and most economical way to transport oil and gas from an offshore platform to an onshore terminal. However, the pipelines may rupture under the harsh working environment, causing oil and gas leakage. This calls for a proper device and method to detect the state of subsea pipelines in a timely and precise manner. The autonomous underwater vehicle carrying side-scan sonar offers a desirable way for target detection in the complex environment under the sea. As a result, this article combines the field-programmable gate array, featuring high throughput, low energy consumption and a high degree of parallelism, and the convolutional neural network into a sonar image recognition system. First, a training set was constructed by screening and splitting the sonar images collected by sensors, and labeled one by one. Next, the convolutional neural network model was trained by the set on the workstation platform. The trained model was integrated into the field-programmable gate array system and applied to recognize actual datasets. The recognition results were compared with those of the workstation platform. The comparison shows that the computational precision of the designed field-programmable gate array system based on convolutional neural network is equivalent to that of the workstation platform; however, the recognition time of the designed system can be saved by more than 77%, and its energy consumption can also be saved by more than 96.67%. Therefore, our system basically satisfies our demand for energy-efficient, real-time, and accurate recognition of sonar images.

AB The US Northeast Passive Acoustic Sensing Network is composed of numerous passive acoustic recorders that provide archived and near real time data on acoustically active marine mammals and fish species. It currently stretches from the northern Gulf of Maine into the New York Bight within the northwest Atlantic Ocean. The recorders include moored units that are entirely subsurface and archive audio, units with real-time reporting capabilities via surface buoys, and autonomous vehicles or 'gliders'. Data derived from NEPAN will provide long-term year-round information on the presence and spatial distribution of vocal mysticetes and odontocetes, as well as fish. These data will be used to address critical conservation and management needs as well as to reduce threats from anthropogenic activities. Currently, NEPAN will operate from 2014 until late 2017. This listening network is an example of how collaborative scientific efforts and financial investment across many federal agencies can produce a novel far-reaching solution to current scientific information gaps. In this manuscript, we lay out our vision for the future and provide details on the technologies and applications currently used in NEPAN. Furthermore, we present a road map that includes expanding the range of NEPAN throughout the Western North Atlantic Ocean, detecting more species and addressing an even more diverse range of management and conservation applications. However, the reality remains that the continued operation and/or expansion of this type of 'listening network' will only be possible in the long term with clear and direct support from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

AB In this paper, we demonstrate digital holographic imaging through a 27-m-long fog tube filled with ultrasonically generated fog. Its high sensitivity makes holography a powerful technology for imaging through scattering media. With our large-scale experiments, we investigate the potential of holographic imaging for road traffic applications, where autonomous driving vehicles require reliable environmental perception in all weather conditions. We com- pare single-shot off-axis digital holography to conventional imaging (with coherent illumination) and show that holographic imaging requires 30 times less illumination power for the same imaging range. Our work includes signal-to-noise ratio considerations, a simulation model, and quantitative statements on the influence of various physical parameters on the imaging range.

AB Recent advances in the area of mobile robotics caused growing attention of the armed forces, where the necessity for unmanned vehicles being able to carry out the "dull and dirty" operations, thus avoid endangering the life of the military personnel. UAV offers a great advantage in supplying reconnaissance data to the military personnel on the ground, thus lessening the life risk of the troops. In this paper we analyze various techniques for path planning and obstacle avoidance and cooperation issues for multiple mobile robots. We also present a generic dynamics and control model for steering a UAV along a collision free path from a start to a goal position.

AB We present an autonomous aerial system which can safely navigate inside the rows of an orchard for crop inspection, yield estimation and similar farm management tasks. Our operating environment has two practical constraints: GPS signal can be unreliable close to the ground and the trees can grow large branches that might block the robot's predetermined path. To address these challenges, we developed components for navigation, vision-based obstacle detection and avoidance and path planning for visual coverage. Results from a field demonstration in an apple orchard are presented showcasing the ability of our system to perform successful navigation and complete yield coverage of apple tree rows.

AB Facing the two major challenges of just-in-time (JIT) and energy-saving in part-feeding system for mixed-model assembly lines in automotive industry, this paper focuses on optimizing the part-feeding process by investigating the autonomous guided vehicles (AGV) routing and scheduling problem. A hybrid feeding policy, called dual-distribution, is proposed, which considers the utilization of different types of AGVs in various part-feeding policies. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming model with the objectives of simultaneously minimizing the line-side inventory and AGV energy consumption in the part-feeding system. To solve this problem, a Q-learning-based multi-objective quantum-inspired Archimedes optimization algorithm (QMQAOA) is developed with a customized encoding and decoding approach to solve the problem. Besides, the quantum rotation gate initialization mechanism, the Q-learning-based neighborhood search strategy, and the neighboring distance calculation are integrated into the algorithm to improve both solution quality and convergence rate. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of QMQAOA by comparing it with the Gurobi solver and other benchmark algorithms. The results demonstrate the superiority of QMQAOA, with performance superiority rates of 90/90, 77/90, and 90/90 achieved for degree of Pareto optimality (DPO), evenness of solutions (ES), and inverted generational distance (IGD) indicators, respectively. From managerial insights, the application of different types of AGVs in the part-feeding system is shown to enhance efficiency when compared to using a single type of AGV in several instances. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing the automotive part-feeding system.

AB Uncontrolled spread of eastern red cedar invades the United States Great Plains prairie ecosystems and lowers biodiversity across native grasslands. The eastern red cedar (ERC) infestations cause significant challenges for ranchers and landowners, including the high costs of removing mature red cedars, reduced livestock forage feed, and reduced revenue from hunting leases. Therefore, a fleet of autonomous ground vehicles (AGV) is proposed to address the ERC infestation. However, detecting the target tree or trunk in a rangeland environment is critical in automating an ERC cutting operation. A tree trunk detection method was developed in this study for ERC trees trained in natural rangeland environments using a deep learning-based YOLOv5 model. An action camera acquired RGB images in a natural rangeland environment. A transfer learning method was adopted, and the YOLOv5 was trained to detect the varying size of the ERC tree trunk. A trained model precision, recall, and average precision were 87.8%, 84.3%, and 88.9%. The model accurately predicted the varying tree trunk sizes and differentiated between trunk and branches. This study demonstrated the potential for using pretrained deep learning models for tree trunk detection with RGB images. The developed machine vision system could be effectively integrated with a fleet of AGVs for ERC cutting. The proposed ERC tree trunk detection models would serve as a fundamental element for the AGV fleet, which would assist in effective rangeland management to maintain the ecological balance of grassland systems.

   learning; domain adaptation; adversarial learning
AB In recent years, deep learning technologies for object detection have made great progress and have powered the emergence of state-of-the-art models to address object detection problems. Since the domain shift can make detectors unstable or even crash, the detection of cross-domain becomes very important for the design of object detectors. However, traditional deep learning technologies for object detection always rely on a large amount of reliable ground-truth labelling that is laborious, costly, and time-consuming. Although an advanced approach CycleGAN has been proposed for cross-domain object detection tasks, the ability of CycleGAN to reduce the divergence across domains at the feature level is limited. In this paper, a stepwise domain adaptation (SDA) detection method is proposed to further improve the performance of CycleGAN by minimizing the divergence in cross-domain object detection tasks. Specifically, the domain shift is addressed in two steps. In the first step, to bridge the domain gap, an unpaired image-to-image translator is trained to construct a fake target domain by translating the source images to the similar ones in the target domain. In the second step, to further minimize divergence across domains, an adaptive CenterNet is designed to align distributions at the feature level in an adversarial learning manner. Our proposed method is evaluated in domain shift scenarios based on the driving datasets including Cityscapes, Foggy Cityscapes, SIM10k, and BDD100K. The results show that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods and is effective for object detection in domain shift scenarios.

AB This article presents a real-time outlier detection deep-learning (OD-DL)-based method using a hybridized artificial neural network (ANN) approach. We propose an unsupervised ANN scheme that runs in parallel, a denoising autoencoder (DAE) and a recurrent neural network (RNN). The DAE aims to reconstruct relevant/normal input data, whereas it seeks to ignore outliers; the RNN, with a recursive structure, is used to predict time-series data. As measurements arrive, two tasks are performed: 1) the outlier decision, which is based on a reconstruction error and an energy score criteria from the output difference between the DAE and the RNN; and 2) the training procedure for both DAE and RNN. The proposed OD-DL scheme is specifically targeted to address the outlier problem of the data generated by a Doppler velocity log (DVL) sensor installed on board of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to enhance the AUV navigation system performance. In particular, the DVL data enter into the OD-DL scheme whose output is fed into an AUV navigation system that runs an error-state Kalman filter that integrates the corrected DVL data with the measurements of an inertial measurement unit and a depth meter. The experimental results show that the AUV navigation system with the OD-DL method outperforms in terms of a more accurate estimated position when compared with the case that there is no outlier detection and with the case of a navigation system using a conventional outlier detection method, or other simpler deep-learning methods.

TI Review of Learning-Based Longitudinal Motion Planning for Autonomous

ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; STABILITY; DESIGN
AB Self-driving technology companies and the research community are accelerating the pace of use of machine learning longitudinal motion planning (mMP) for autonomous vehicles (AVs). This paper reviews the current state of the art in mMP, with an exclusive focus on its impact on traffic congestion. The paper identifies the availability of congestion scenarios in current datasets, and summarizes the required features for training mMP. For learning methods, the major methods in both imitation learning and non-imitation learning are surveyed. The emerging technologies adopted by some leading AV companies, such as Tesla, Waymo, and Comma.ai, are also highlighted. It is found that: (i) the AV industry has been mostly focusing on the long tail problem related to safety and has overlooked the impact on traffic congestion, (ii) the current public self-driving datasets have not included enough congestion scenarios, and mostly lack the necessary input features/output labels to train mMP, and (iii) although the reinforcement learning approach can integrate congestion mitigation into the learning goal, the major mMP method adopted by industry is still behavior cloning, whose capability to learn a congestion-mitigating mMP remains to be seen. Based on the review, the study identifies the research gaps in current mMP development. Some suggestions for congestion mitigation for future mMP studies are proposed: (i) enrich data collection to facilitate the congestion learning, (ii) incorporate non-imitation learning methods to combine traffic efficiency into a safety-oriented technical route, and (iii) integrate domain knowledge from the traditional car-following theory to improve the string stability of mMP.

AB The first-ever observed horizontal profiles of summertime ice-ocean boundary layer fluxes were obtained using vertical water velocity, temperature, and salinity collected by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle during the Surface Heat Balance of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) experiment of 1998. Scalars and their vertical fluxes, as well as vertical stability, varied in the horizontal direction with correspondence to changes in the overlying surface. In early summer, fresh meltwater was trapped at the upper ice surface and only entered the ocean through leads. A highly stable fresh layer was formed in the SHEBA lead, which eventually grew to depths greater than the mean draft of the local first-year ice. Near the end of July, a storm removed this layer via shear-generated turbulence, supercritical hydraulic flow speeds, and ice divergence. The mixed layer freshened and deepened at this time. Particularly strong fluxes were observed under and downstream of rough, ridged ice, and properties changed rapidly with distance downstream of leads. The location and signs of the fluxes are suggestive of a mechanism of instability in which fresh surface water is forced under salty water downstream of leads and/or ridges. Simulations from a two-dimensional unsteady model suggest that both mechanical forcing from ice topography and a dynamic instability near downstream lead edges may enhance vertical mixing, particularly when ice velocity is large. The horizontal variability in interfacial fluxes observed at SHEBA may explain the difference between the observed melt rates and those calculated using a bulk relationship because this relationship may not adequately parameterize the large lateral heat fluxes at lead edges and basal heat fluxes under ridge keels.

AB Non-holonomic systems are of immense practical value and increasingly subject to automation. However, controlling them accurately, e.g., when parking vehicles, is challenging for automatic control methods, including model predictive control (MPC). Combining results from MPC theory and sub -Riemannian geometry in the form of homogeneous nilpotent system approximations, this paper proposes the first comprehensive, ready-to-apply design procedure for MPC controllers to steer controllable, driftless non-holonomic systems into given setpoints. It can be ascertained that the resulting controllers nominally asymptotically stabilize the setpoint for a large-enough prediction horizon. The design procedure is exemplarily applied to four systems, including the kinematic car and a differentially driven mobile robot with up to two trailers. The controllers use a non-quadratic cost function tailored to the non-holonomic kinematics. Novelly, it is proven that a quadratic cost employed in an otherwise similar controller is insufficient to reliably asymptotically stabilize the closed loop for all considered vehicles. Since quadratic costs are the conventional choice in control, this highlights the relevance of the findings. To the knowledge of the authors, it is the first time that MPC controllers of the proposed structure are formulated and applied to non-holonomic systems beyond very simple ones, in particular (partly) on hardware.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with large-scale antenna array constitutes a promising relaying candidate for reliable and secure satellite-terrestrial communication. Due to the limitation of energy consumption, a novel UAV architecture with one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and one-bit digital-to-analog converters (DACs) is proposed firstly. Leveraging the additive quantization noise model, the exact closed-form expressions of both ergodic capacity and ergodic achievable secrecy rate are derived for UAV-assisted satellite-terrestrial communication systems using large-scale antenna array with one-bit ADCs/DACs. To enhance the transmission capacity and combat the eavesdropper simultaneously, maximum-ratio combining (MRC) is used by UAV to receive signals from satellite and location-based beamforming (LBB) is adopted by UAV to forward signals to destination, where the beamformer is optimized based on the derived expression of the ergodic achievable secrecy rate. Simulation results validate the accuracy of our analytical ergodic achievable secrecy rate, and demonstrate that our proposed MRC/LBB scheme has better secrecy rate than its conventional location-based counterpart.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are gaining tremendous attention due to their flying nature. To complete the task efficiently, multi-UAV systems are a good choice as compared to a single UAV system. However, multi-UAV systems introduce issues, such as high dynamics, limited battery, and frequent changes in topology. Software control is required to solve these issues. Thus, software-defined networking (SDN) is an excellent candidate to separate control logic from forwarding elements and provide high-level programming abstractions. However, due to architectural constraints, applying SDN introduces some new challenges, including uneven load on multiple links between source and destination. This irregular load also affects UAVs' battery consumption, necessitating an adequate solution to meet these challenges fully. This article proposes an SDN-based framework for UAV elements that monitors frequent changes in the network topology. Based on this monitoring, an algorithm is designed, which distributes traffic load evenly on different links of multi-UAV systems. UAV networks have limited resources; therefore, battery limitations are also considered, and traffic is shifted to a path where elements have more battery. Moreover, a flight control mechanism is proposed to avoid collisions due to the high dynamics of UAVs. Extensive simulation results show that the traffic load is distributed evenly on multiple links connecting different systems with less battery consumption.

AB Recent technology developments and the numerous availabilities of mobile users, devices and Internet technologies together with the growing focus on reducing traffic congestion and emissions in urban areas have led to the emergence of new paradigms for ridesharing and crowdsourcing for smart cities. Compared to carpooling approaches where the driver and participant passengers or riders are usually prearranged and the journey details known beforehand, the paradigm for ridesharing requires the participants to be selected at short notice and the rider trips are often dynamically formed. Crowdsourcing techniques and approaches are well suited to match drivers and riders for these dynamic scenarios, although there are many challenges to be addressed. This paper aims to survey this new paradigm of ridesharing and crowdsourcing for smart city transportation environments from several technological and social perspectives including: 1) ridesharing and architecture in transportation; 2) techniques for ridesharing; 3) artificial intelligence for ridesharing; 4) autonomous vehicles and systems ridesharing; and 5) security, policy and pricing strategies. The paper concludes with some use cases and lessons learned for the practical deployment of ridesharing and crowdsourcing platforms for smart cities.

AB This study investigates the integration of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) into an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform to utilize the advantages of these leading technologies for sixth-generation communications, e.g., improved spectral and energy efficiency, extended network coverage, and flexible deployment. In particular, we investigate a downlink IRS-UAV system, wherein single-antenna ground users (UEs) are served by a multi-antenna base station (BS). To assist the communication between UEs and the BS, an IRS mounted on a UAV is deployed, in which the direct links are obstructed owing to the complex urban channel characteristics. The beamforming at the BS, phase shift at the IRS, and the 3D placement of the UAV are jointly optimized to maximize the sum rate. Because the optimization variables, particularly the beamforming and IRS phase shift, are highly coupled with each other, the optimization problem is naturally non-convex. To effectively solve the formulated problem, we propose an iterative algorithm that employs block coordinate descent and inner approximation methods. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach for a UAV-mounted IRS system on the sum rate performance over the state-of-the-art technology using the terrestrial counterpart.

AB The sudden demand rises in security made researchers come up with solutions that provide instantaneous safety better than the state of the art solutions. The quest for securing data began in the Spartan era. People are now looking to expand this field of research by attacking the existing paradigms and inventing new algorithms that prove to be better than their vulnerable counterparts. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are very much prevailing due to their sleek design and flexible mobility in many sectors such as agriculture, army, healthcare, monitoring and surveillance, and many more. We discuss the growth and demand of drone technology along with its importance in this article. The paper also throws some light on the ongoing security issues in real-time scenarios and the role of quantum cryptography in securing the information over the traditional solutions. Motivated by this, we present a survey on quantum cryptography's importance, role, and benefits in securing UAV communications underlying beyond 5G networks. A novel quantum cryptography-based layered architectural solution is also proposed to achieve high data security and efficient transmission. This paper also present a case study on the battlefield application on the Internet of military things. The performance of the proposed case study system is evaluated by considering the latency, security, and reliability.

ID KALMAN FILTER
AB GPS sensors are widely used to know a vehicle's location and to track its route. Although GPS sensor technology is advancing, they present systematic failures depending on the environmental conditions to which they are subjected. To tackle this problem, we propose an intelligent system based on fuzzy logic, which takes the information from the sensors and correct the vehicle's absolute position according to its latitude and longitude. This correction is performed by two fuzzy systems, one to correct the latitude and the other to correct the longitude, which are trained using the MATLAB ANFIS tool. The positioning correction system is trained and tested with two different datasets. One of them collected with a Pmod GPS sensor and the other a public dataset, which was taken from routes in Brazil. To compare our proposal, an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) was implemented. The main finding is that the proposed fuzzy systems achieve a performance of 69.2% higher than the UKF. Furthermore, fuzzy systems are suitable to implement in an embedded system such as the Raspberry Pi 4. Another finding is that the logical operations facilitate the creation of non-linear functions because of the 'if else' structure. Finally, the existence justification of each fuzzy system section is easy to understand.

TI Calibration procedure for Slocum glider deployed optical instruments
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
LA English
DT Article
ID SOUTHERN-CALIFORNIA; PHENYLALANINE; ASPARTAME; ATLANTIC; SURFACE
AB Recent developments in the field of the autonomous underwater vehicles allow the wide usage of these platforms as part of scientific experiments, monitoring campaigns and more. The vehicles are often equipped with sensors measuring temperature, conductivity, chlorophyll a fluorescence (Chl a), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence, phycoerithrin (PE) fluorescence and spectral volume scattering function at 117 degrees, providing users with high resolution, real time data. However, calibration of these instruments can be problematic. Most in situ calibrations are performed by deploying complementary instrument packages or water samplers in the proximity of the glider. Laboratory calibrations of the mounted sensors are difficult due to the placement of the instruments within the body of the vehicle. For the laboratory calibrations of the Slocum glider instruments we developed a small calibration chamber where we can perform precise calibrations of the optical instruments aboard our glider, as well as sensors from other deployment platforms. These procedures enable us to obtain pre- and post-deployment calibrations for optical fluorescence instruments, which may differ due to the biofouling and other physical damage that can occur during long-term glider deployments. We found that biofouling caused significant changes in the calibration scaling factors of fluorescent sensors, suggesting the need for consistent and repetitive calibrations for gliders as proposed in this paper.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper was to present the process of building hardware and software for a collision avoidance system of a quadrotor capable of an indoor autonomous flight.
   Design/methodology/approach - The system development was carried out in two steps. First, the quadrotor system was designed to mount mission equipments for an indoor flight. The prediction error minimization (PEM) method was used for system identification of the quadrotor, and the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control method was used for the attitude control. Second, a collision detection system was realized by using a Kinect sensor, an embedded board and a ground control system (GCS). A Kinect sensor with embedded board can send the 3D depth information to GCS and then the GCS displays the 3D depth information with a warning message.
   Findings - As the controller design requires a linear model, the PEM method was used in system identification. The LQR was used in controller design. It was found that the use of the PEM method for system identification was effective for developing a linear model required for a practical control system using LQR. As 3D depth information from a Kinect sensor is quite accurate in an indoor environment, a collision detection system with Kinect was successfully developed.
   Practical implications - The step-by-step approach presented in this paper can be used to develop an autonomous aerial vehicle capable of navigating in an indoor environment with obstacles.
   Originality/value - The primary contribution of the paper is the presentation of a practical method for developing a low-cost collision avoidance system for a quadrotor vehicle.

AB When a group of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) sail from a wide waterway to a narrow waterway, one difficulty is to keep relative formation with collision avoidance. Scaling the formation sizes with formation shapes invariant is a promising way. This article investigates such a formation scaling control problem of ASVs with uncertainties and input saturation. A novel bearing-based adaptive neural formation scaling control scheme for ASVs is developed. The main idea of this formation scheme is as follows. Choose a small number of leader ASVs based on bearing rigidity theory and program their trajectories according to the kinematics of formation scaling maneuver. Steer remaining ASVs to follow leader ASVs via adaptive neural techniques and the formation sizes can be scaled only by leaders without redesigning control inputs of followers. To deal with the uncertainties of ASVs, weights updating of neural networks is simplified into one-parameter estimation in each control channel. Auxiliary systems are introduced for each ASV to reduce the effect of limited actuator capability. It is shown that desired formation scaling maneuver of ASVs can be achieved with the proposed formation scheme if the augmented formation is infinitesimally bearing rigid. Formation errors are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded. The main advantage of our scheme over existing results is that directional, computational, and actuator constraints are satisfied simultaneously in the formation scaling control of ASVs. Simulations and comparisons are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of theoretical results.

AB Robust and globally-referenced positioning is indispensable for autonomous driving vehicles. Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is still an irreplaceable sensor. Satisfactory accuracy (about 1 m) can be obtained in sparse areas. However, the GNSS positioning error can be up to 100 m in dense urban areas due to the multipath effects and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) receptions caused by reflection and blockage from buildings. NLOS is currently the dominant factor degrading the performance of GNSS positioning. Recently, the camera has been employed to detect the NLOS and then to exclude the NLOS measurements from GNSS calculation. The exclusion of NLOS measurements can cause severe distortion of satellite distribution, due to the excessive NLOS receptions in deep urban canyons. Correcting the NLOS receptions with the aid of 3D light detection and ranging after detection of NLOS receptions using a fish-eye camera was proposed in this study. Finally, the GNSS positioning was improved by using the healthy and corrected NLOS pseudo-range measurements. The proposed method is evaluated through real road tests in typical highly urbanised canyons of Hong Kong. The evaluation results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the positioning performance.

TI SOFT-SLAM: Computationally efficient stereo visual simultaneous
   localization and mapping for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
ID ODOMETRY; VISION
AB Autonomous navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in GPS-denied environments is a challenging problem, especially for small-scale UAVs characterized by a small payload and limited battery autonomy. A possible solution to the aforementioned problem is vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), since cameras, due to their dimensions, low weight, availability, and large information bandwidth, circumvent all the constraints of UAVs. In this paper, we propose a stereo vision SLAM yielding very accurate localization and a dense map of the environment developed with the aim to compete in the European Robotics Challenges (EuRoC) targeting airborne inspection of industrial facilities with small-scale UAVs. The proposed approach consists of a novel stereo odometry algorithm relying on feature tracking (SOFT), which currently ranks first among all stereo methods on the KITTI dataset. Relying on SOFT for pose estimation, we build a feature-based pose graph SLAM solution, which we dub SOFT-SLAM. SOFT-SLAM has a completely separate odometry and mapping threads supporting large loop-closing and global consistency. It also achieves a constant-time execution rate of 20Hz with deterministic results using only two threads of an onboard computer used in the challenge. The UAV running our SLAM algorithm obtained the highest localization score in the EuRoC Challenge 3, Stage IIa-Benchmarking, Task 2. Furthermore, we also present an exhaustive evaluation of SOFT-SLAM on two popular public datasets, and we compare it to other state-of-the-art approaches, namely ORB-SLAM2 and LSD-SLAM. The results show that SOFT-SLAM obtains better localization accuracy on the majority of datasets sequences, while also having a lower runtime.

AB There are many applications that require mobile robots to autonomously cover an entire area with a sensor or end effector. The vast majority of the literature on this subject is focused on addressing path planning for area coverage under the assumption that the robot's pose is known or that error is bounded. In this work, we remove this assumption and develop a completely probabilistic representation of coverage. We show that coverage is guaranteed as long as the robot pose estimates are consistent, a much milder assumption than zero or bounded error. After formally connecting robot sensor uncertainty with area coverage, we propose an adaptive sliding window filter pose estimator that provides a close approximation to the full maximum a posteriori estimate with a computation cost that is bounded over time. Subsequently, an adaptive planning strategy is presented that automatically exploits conditions of low vehicle uncertainty to more efficiently cover an area. We further extend this approach to the multi-robot case where robots can communicate through a (possibly faulty and low-bandwidth) channel and make relative measurements of one another. In this case, area coverage is achieved more quickly since the uncertainty over the robots' trajectories is reduced. We apply the framework to the scenario of mapping an area of seabed with an autonomous underwater vehicle. Experimental results support the claim that our method achieves guaranteed complete coverage notwithstanding poor navigational sensors and that resulting path lengths required to cover the entire area are shortest using the proposed cooperative and adaptive approach.

TI 3D traversability awareness for rough terrain mobile robots
SO SENSOR REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE Mobile robots; Local descriptor; Point feature representation;
   Unevenness point descriptor
ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Purpose - This research aims to address the issue of safe navigation for autonomous vehicles in highly challenging outdoor environments. Indeed, robust navigation of autonomous mobile robots over long distances requires advanced perception means for terrain traversability assessment.
   Design/methodology/approach - The use of visual systems may represent an efficient solution. This paper discusses recent findings in terrain traversability analysis from RGB-D images. In this context, the concept of point as described only by its Cartesian coordinates is reinterpreted in terms of local description. As a result, a novel descriptor for inferring the traversability of a terrain through its 3D representation, referred to as the unevenness point descriptor (UPD), is conceived. This descriptor features robustness and simplicity.
   Findings - The UPD-based algorithm shows robust terrain perception capabilities in both indoor and outdoor environment. The algorithm is able to detect obstacles and terrain irregularities. The system performance is validated in field experiments in both indoor and outdoor environments.
   Research limitations/implications - The UPD enhances the interpretation of 3D scene to improve the ambient awareness of unmanned vehicles. The larger implications of this method reside in its applicability for path planning purposes.
   Originality/value - This paper describes a visual algorithm for traversability assessment based on normal vectors analysis. The algorithm is simple and efficient providing fast real-time implementation, since the UPD does not require any data processing or previously generated digital elevation map to classify the scene. Moreover, it defines a local descriptor, which can be of general value for segmentation purposes of 3D point clouds and allows the underlining geometric pattern associated with each single 3D point to be fully captured and difficult scenarios to be correctly handled.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB We automatically mapped the distribution of temperate continental shelf rocky reef habitats with a high degree of confidence using colour, texture, rugosity and patchiness features extracted from images in conjunction with machine-learning algorithms. This demonstrated the potential of novel automation routines to expedite the complex and time-consuming process of seabed mapping. The random forests ensemble classifier outperformed other tree-based algorithms and also offered some valuable built-in model performance assessment tools. Habitat prediction using random forests performed most accurately when all 26 image-derived predictors were included in the model. This produced an overall habitat prediction accuracy of 84% (with a kappa statistic of 0.793) when compared to nine distinct habitat classes assigned by a human annotator. Predictions for three habitat classes were all within the 95% confidence intervals, indicating close agreement between observed and predicted habitat classes. Misclassified images were mostly unevenly, partially or insufficiently illuminated and came mostly from rugged terrains and during the autonomous underwater vehicle's obstacle avoidance manoeuvres. The remaining misclassified images were wrongly or inconsistently labelled by the human annotator. This study demonstrates the suitability of autonomous underwater vehicles to effectively sample benthic habitats and the ability of automated data handling techniques to extract and reliably process large volumes of seabed image data. Our methods for image feature extraction and classification are repeatable, cost-effective and well suited to studies that require non-extractive and/or co-located sampling, e.g. in marine reserves and for monitoring the recovery from physical impacts, e.g. from bottom fishing activities. The methods are transferable to other continental shelf areas and to other disciplines such as seabed geology. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB [1] Evolution of the coastal current structure on the shallow continental shelf east of Cape Cod was studied using autonomous underwater vehicle ( AUV) surveys and moored observations during the winters of 2005 and 2006. A coastally bounded plume of relatively fresh water, characteristic of a coastal current, persisted throughout both winters despite strong mixing. Nondimensional parameter analysis classified the plume as a bottom- trapped gravity current over a moderately steep slope, placing it in the context of other buoyant coastal currents. The range of water properties within the coastal current, its spatial extent and temporal variability were characterized on the basis of the data from repeat hydrographic sections. Along- shore freshwater transport was dominated by highly variable barotropic flow driven by local wind and basin- wide pressure gradients. It eventually contributed substantially to the average southward along- shore freshwater transport, estimated at 1.1 +/- 0.3 x 10(3) m(3) s(-1) in February and 1.8 +/- 0.4 x 10(3) m(3) s(-1) in the first half of March 2006. The contribution of baroclinic buoyancy- driven freshwater transport was typically an order of magnitude lower during both winters. Despite the relative weakness of the baroclinic freshwater transport, the coastal current potentially had a major impact on water mass modification during the winter. Continual presence of the low- salinity plume prevented the formation of cold dense water near the coast and its export offshore. The coastal current effectively isolated the inner- shelf zone, reducing its potential role in ventilation of the intermediate layers of the Wilkinson Basin of the Gulf of Maine.

AB Benefiting from the deployment flexibility and the line-of-sight (LoS) channel conditions, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has gained tremendous attention in data collection for wireless sensor networks. However, the high-quality air-ground channels also pose significant threats to the security of UAV-aided wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a short-packet secure UAV-aided data collection and transmission scheme to guarantee the freshness and security of the transmission from the sensors to the remote ground base station (BS). First, during the data collection phase, the trajectory, the flight duration, and the user scheduling are jointly optimized with the objective of maximizing the energy efficiency (EE). To solve the non-convex EE maximization problem, we adopt the first-order Taylor expansion to convert it into two convex subproblems, which are then solved via successive convex approximation. Furthermore, we consider the maximum rate of transmission in the UAV data transmission phase to achieve a maximum secrecy rate. The transmit power and the blocklength of UAV-to-BS transmission are jointly optimized subject to the constraints of eavesdropping rate and outage probability. Simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB As an important sensor of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV), an electro-optical device is usually used to detect ships and obstacles in USV autonomous navigation and collision avoidance. However, the installation perpendicularity error of the electro-optical device greatly impacts the line-of-sight (LOS) stability control. This error is difficult to eliminate through mechanical calibration because the platform inertial navigation axis cannot be led out. This study aims to establish the model for the perpendicularity error of electro-optical devices during circumferential scanning and analyze its impact on the stability of LOS. In addition, we present a measurement technique for perpendicularity errors utilizing sea-sky line images. Through this method, we find an error function of LOS elevation angle, which is a convex function that can quickly search out high-precision perpendicularity errors step by step. Finally, we measured and compensated the perpendicularity error according to experimental data collected by the electro-optical device. The findings of this research demonstrate that the suggested approach can efficiently mitigate low-frequency disruptions and minor amplitude high-frequency vibrations of LOS in the elevation direction. As a result, it considerably enhances the precision of stability and image observation effect of electro-optical devices.

AB Siamese network-based object tracking has remarkably promoted the automatic capability for highly-maneuvered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the leading-edge tracking framework often depends on template matching, making it trapped when facing multiple views of object in consecutive frames. Moreover, the general image-level pretrained backbone can overfit to holistic representations, causing the misalignment to learn object-level properties in UAV tracking. To tackle these issues, this work presents TRTrack, a comprehensive framework to fully exploit the stereoscopic representation for UAV tracking. Specifically, a novel pre-training paradigm method is proposed. Through trajectory-aware reconstruction training (TRT), the capability of the backbone to extract stereoscopic structure feature is strengthened without any parameter increment. Accordingly, an innovative hierarchical self-attention Transformer is proposed to capture the local detail information and global structure knowledge. For optimizing the correlation map, we proposed a novel spatial correlation refinement (SCR) module, which promotes the capability of modeling the long-range spatial dependencies. Comprehensive experiments on three UAV challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed TRTrack achieves superior UAV tracking performance in both precision and efficiency. Quantitative tests in real-world settings fully prove the effectiveness of our work.

AB The dynamics of an AUV, which can perform manoeuvres with pitch angles in the range of 90?? is investigated in this paper. The purpose of the AUV is to perform a station-keeping manoeuvre at about 90?? pitch angle by varying propeller revolution. The AUV is launched in horizontal orientation. Quaternion mathematics, 4 quadrant propeller open water characteristics, and PID controller for propeller revolution are incorporated in manoeuvring mathematical model for this purpose. A procedure for optimizing the gain coefficients for the PID controller is developed using the 7 DoF manoeuvring mathematical model. Two design configurations of the AUV are investigated, positively buoyant and negatively buoyant. The design objective is, the AUV shall travel as far away as possible from the parent vehicle using minimum energy and time. It is shown that both the optimal gain coefficients for the PID controller for propeller revolution and the dynamic response of the AUV is different for each design configuration. The methodology developed in the paper can be used in the design and propeller revolution control system for certain categories of AUVs. The study shows that prime mover torque/ shaft revolution and 7 DoF manoeuvring mathematical model are important in predicting the attitude and trajectory in space and station-keeping manoeuvring capability of an AUV launched from a parent vehicle.

AB Many recent approaches for automated driving (AD) functions currently include components relying on deep neural networks (DNNs). One approach in order to test AD functions is the scenario-based approach. This work formalizes and evaluates the parameter discretization process required in order to yield concrete scenarios for which an AD function can be tested. Using a common perception algorithm for camera images, a simulation case study is conducted for a simple static scenario containing one other vehicle. The results are analyzed with methods akin to those applied in the domain of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The performance of the perception algorithm shows strong fluctuations even for small input changes and displays unpredictable outliers even at very small discretization steps. The convergence criteria as known from CFD fail, meaning that no parametrization is found which is sufficient for the validation of the perception component. Indeed, the results do not indicate consistent improvement with a finer discretization. These results agree well with theoretical attributes known for existing neural networks. However, the impact appears to be large even for the most basic scenario without malicious input. This indicates the necessity of directing more attention towards the parameter discretization process of the scenario-based testing approach to enable the safety argumentation of AD functions.

AB Connectivity refers to the ability of civil engineering system components to transmit/receive data for making strategic, tactical and operational decisions towards enhanced efficiency, effectiveness, and lower costs to the system stakeholders. Automation is the capability of a system or its component to carry out control functions or decisions that are traditionally done by humans. As the benefits of these two technologies become increasingly apparent in various civil engineering disciplines, it seems useful to measure such impacts to generate information for evaluating the feasibility of past or prospective future applications related to connectivity and automation (C/A) or for comparing alternative C/A applications. This paper discusses some constructs for measuring the benefits or effectiveness (MOEs) of C/A applications. An MOE expressed in terms of an appropriate system performance indicator (SPI) can help ascertain the extent to which a C/A application has accomplished or is expected to accomplish its specified goals or to compare the efficacy of alternative C/A applications. This paper identifies a number of SPIs, and establishes a number of MOEs for measuring the effectiveness of C/A applications in terms of the relevant SPIs. The paper provides illustrations to the concepts discussed in the context of highway transport.

AB Self-driving cars are expected to be integrated into the traffic system in the near future. It is crucial to understand how the public accepts self-driving cars and how adoption rates are influenced. The main purpose of this study was to investigate how trait anxiety and the Big Five personality traits affect acceptance and to provide a personality profile of early adopters of self-driving cars. A total of 527 drivers participated in the research, completing Chinese versions of the Self-driving Car Acceptance Scale, the Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Big Five Inventory and some demographic questions. The results showed that trait anxiety had a positive effect on perceived automation reliability. Openness and extraversion had positive effects on self-driving car acceptance, while neuroticism had a negative effect. People with high agreeableness had a more positive perspective on the benefits of self-driving cars, but they were also more worried about ease of use and automation reliability. These results help to provide a personality profile of early adopters of self-driving cars. People with certain personality traits are more likely to be starting points for the diffusion of self-driving cars.

ID COLOR IMAGE SEGMENTATION
AB By using an onboard camera, it is possible to detect the free road surface ahead of the ego-vehicle. Road detection is of high relevance for autonomous driving, road departure warning, and supporting driver-assistance systems such as vehicle and pedestrian detection. The key for vision-based road detection is the ability to classify image pixels as belonging or not to the road surface. Identifying road pixels is a major challenge due to the intraclass variability caused by lighting conditions. A particularly difficult scenario appears when the road surface has both shadowed and nonshadowed areas. Accordingly, we propose a novel approach to vision-based road detection that is robust to shadows. The novelty of our approach relies on using a shadow-invariant feature space combined with a model-based classifier. The model is built online to improve the adaptability of the algorithm to the current lighting and the presence of other vehicles in the scene. The proposed algorithm works in still images and does not depend on either road shape or temporal restrictions. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on real-world road sequences with heavy traffic and shadows show that the method is robust to shadows and lighting variations. Moreover, the proposed method provides the highest performance when compared with hue-saturation-intensity (HSI)-based algorithms.

Material movement conforms to the "puzzle architecture" found in popular board games such as the 15-puzzle and Rush Hour. Control of the system is decentralized, meaning that each module contains identical operating logic that directs its behavior based on local conditions and message passing.

AB The 1962-1992 period spanning the research vessel Eltanin/Islas Orcadas expeditions to Ice Station Weddell, and the following World Ocean Circulation Experiment, may be viewed as the closing phase of an era of broad-based, circumpolar surveys of the Southern Ocean. Today's investigations of the spatial and temporal dimensions of this complex ocean and its coupling to the climate system integrate observations from ships, aircraft, satellites, tethered instrumentation, and autonomous vehicles with numerical models. However, the adventure of obtaining Southern Ocean observations remains the same, requiring not just the right people and technology, but also special ships capable of working within the harsh Antarctic environment, where unknowns await discovery.

DT Article
AB Two contrasting approaches for tracking multiple targets in multi-beam forward-looking sonar images are considered. The first approach is based on assigning a Kalman filter to each target and managing the measurements with gating and a measurement-to-track data association technique. The second approach uses the recently developed particle implementation of the multiple-target probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter and a target state estimate-to-track data association technique. The two approaches are implemented and compared on both simulated sonar and real forward-looking sonar data obtained from an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) and demonstrate that the PHD filter with data association compares well with traditional approaches for multiple target tracking.

AB Underwater target detection technology plays a crucial role in the autonomous exploration of underwater vehicles. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of target detection through the application of artificial intelligence technology. Effectively applying AI techniques to underwater target detection is a highly promising area of research. However, the difficulty and high cost of underwater acoustic data collection have led to a severe lack of data, greatly restricting the development of deep-learning-based target detection methods. The present study is the first to utilize diffusion models for generating underwater acoustic data, thereby effectively addressing the issue of poor detection performance arising from the scarcity of underwater acoustic data. Firstly, we place iron cylinders and cones underwater (simulating small preset targets such as mines). Subsequently, we employ an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with side-scan sonar (SSS) to obtain underwater target data. The collected target data are augmented using the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Finally, the augmented data are used to train an improved YOLOv7 model, and its detection performance is evaluated on a test set. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating similar data and overcoming the challenge of limited training sample data. Compared to models trained solely on the original data, the model trained with augmented data shows a mean average precision (mAP) improvement of approximately 30% across various mainstream detection networks. Additionally, compared to the original model, the improved YOLOv7 model proposed in this study exhibits a 2% increase in mAP on the underwater dataset.

AB Fixed and rotary-wing unmanned aircraft systems (UASs), originally developed for military purposes, have widely spread in scientific, civilian, commercial, and recreational applications. Among the most interesting and challenging aspects of small UAS technology are endurance enhancement and autonomous flight; i.e., mission management and control. This paper proposes a practical method for estimation of true and calibrated airspeed, Angle of Attack (AOA), and Angle of Sideslip (AOS) for small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, up to 20 kg mass, 1200 ft altitude above ground level, and airspeed of up to 100 knots) or light aircraft, for which weight, size, cost, and power-consumption requirements do not allow solutions used in large airplanes (typically, arrays of multi-hole Pitot probes). The sensors used in this research were a static and dynamic pressure sensor ( "micro-Pitot tube " MPX2010DP differential pressure sensor) and a 10 degrees of freedom (DoF) inertial measurement unit (IMU) for attitude determination. Kalman and complementary filtering were applied for measurement noise removal and data fusion, respectively, achieving global exponential stability of the estimation error. The methodology was tested using experimental data from a prototype of the devised sensor suite, in various indoor-acquisition campaigns and laboratory tests under controlled conditions. AOA and AOS estimates were validated via correlation between the AOA measured by the micro-Pitot and vertical accelerometer measurements, since lift force can be modeled as a linear function of AOA in normal flight. The results confirmed the validity of the proposed approach, which could have interesting applications in energy-harvesting techniques.

ID LIFETIME MAXIMIZATION; MAC PROTOCOL; DESIGN
AB Underwater sensor networks (UWSNs) have recently attracted much attention due to their ability to discover and monitor the aquatic environment. However, acoustic communication has posed some significant challenges, such as high propagation delay, low available bandwidth, and high bit error rate. Therefore, proposing a cross-layer protocol is of high importance to the field to integrate different communication functionalities (i.e, an interaction between data link layer and network layer) to interact in a more reliable and flexible manner to overcome the consequences of applying acoustic signals. In this paper, a novel Cross-Layer Mobile Data gathering (CLMD) scheme for Underwater Sensor Networks (UWSNs) is presented to improve the performance by providing the interaction between the MAC and routing layers. In CLMD, an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is used to periodically visit a group of clusters which are responsible for data collection from members. The communications are managed by using a distributed cross-layer solution to enhance network performance in terms of packet delivery and energy saving. The cluster heads are replaced with other candidate members at the end of each operational phase to prolong the network lifetime. The effectiveness of CLMD is verified through an extensive simulation study which reveals the performance improvement in the energy-saving, network lifetime, and packet delivery ratio with varying number of nodes. The effects of MAC protocols are also studied by studying the network performance under various MAC protocols in terms of packet delivery ratio, goodput, and energy consumption with varying density of nodes.

AB This research aimed to examine how personal car users are informed about Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) in Australia, and the extent to which information received at point of sale influenced the level of understanding and adaptation of ADAS. Further, this study applied the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to assess drivers' intentions to use ADAS within the next month. Participants were required to have purchased a new or second-hand vehicle within the past five years and which had at least one of the following five ADAS: autonomous emergency braking, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitoring, and rear cross traffic alert. Participants (N = 217, Mage = 47.87 years, 149 male) completed a 20-minute online questionnaire. The findings revealed that 122 (56%) participants reported not seeking out any information about ADAS prior to purchasing their vehicle. Further, the most reported approaches used by participants to learn about their vehicle's ADAS were through the owner's manual (n = 121, 55%) and via trial and error (n = 117, 54%). It was also found that total time spent with the salesperson in explaining ADAS features did not influence drivers' level of understanding of ADAS or number of days to adapt to the ADAS in their vehicle. However, and consistent with the TAM, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were significant positive predictors of intentions to use ADAS within the next month. It was also found that participants who learnt about these technologies either via reading the owner's manual, trial and error, or a verbal explanation at point of sale appeared to be more frequently classified as reporting higher acceptance of ADAS than those participants who did not use those learning methods. Given that technology in vehicles will continue to advance, it is vital that more work is conducted to educate drivers about the functionality of ADAS. Further, it is also important to communicate where buyers of personal cars can go and find accurate and reliable information about ADAS.

This work is centred around testing the capability of a road centreline modelling and matching algorithm to localise accurately. Alongside, dynamic feature modelling and minimalistic description to optimise data association are proposed.

AB This paper describes an efficient algorithm to find a smooth trajectory joining two points A and B with minimum length constrained to avoid fixed subsets. The basic assumption is that the locations of the obstacles are measured several times through a mechanism that corrects the sensors at each reading using the previous observation. The proposed algorithm is based on the penalized nonparametric method previously introduced that uses confidence ellipses as a fattening of the avoidance set. In this paper we obtain consistent estimates of the best trajectory using Monte Carlo construction of the confidence ellipse.

AB A primary important aspect of wireless network domain is known to be secured communication as the signals are emphatically available and broadcasted through the air. Quantum wireless networks are a hot topic of research in recent years that made researchers to avail new techniques in this field. Big data is one of the major aspects that support large-scale quantum network applications. As sensor nodes have resource constraints, it is more complex when using the traditional techniques of key establishment that only used for stable communication networks. Group-related applications are also one of the important aspects in wireless network for sending and receiving messages from multiple users. Unfortunately, maintenance of security for the group-oriented protocols is major issue due to the frequent changes in membership. In this paper, a hybrid GKM with re-keying procedure is proposed to obtain a secure communication for the remote system of unmanned autonomous vehicle (UAV) with mobile backbone network (MBN). Here, the group controller is selected based on the simplified hybrid energy efficient distributed (HEED) protocol and honey key encryption algorithm is used by the key management center (KMC) for generating and distribution of key for the group's controller. The secure communication is explored using the key exchange mechanism between the nodes. The joining and leaving of a node from the group are initiated by the re-keying process. The simulation results explain the improved performance of the proposed hybrid method when compared with other existing techniques in terms of privacy level, energy, memory, and time consumption.

AB The control issue of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) is very challenging since the precise mathematical model of AUV is hard to establish due to its strong coupling and time-varying features. Meanwhile, AUV movement is easily interfered with by ocean currents and waves, causing anti-interference performance of traditional Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control to be unsatisfactory. Aiming to solve those problems, an algorithm of fuzzy optimized model-free adaptive control (MFAC) based on auto-disturbance rejection control (ADRC) was proposed and used in AUV heading control. The MFAC is used to overcome the difficulty with establishing a precise mathematical model, and the ADRC is introduced to handle the interference of currents and waves. In this paper, MFAC and ADRC are combined. First, the MFAC is performed based only on the I/O data of the controlled object, which is simple to implement with low calculation complexity and strong robustness. Then, a tracking differentiator (TD) is employed to track the input signal to overcome the antinomy of rapidity and hypertonicity in MFAC. After that, an extended-state observer (ESO) is added to control the variables of MFAC to estimate all the disturbances, which can greatly improve the anti-interference ability of the system. Due to the complexity and diversity of the marine environment, a fuzzy optimized MFAC based on ADRC is proposed to improve the adaptability of AUV to the marine environment. Simulations and experiments were carried out to verify the control effect of this algorithm in complex sea conditions.

AB Existing 3D Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs) are either fixed having nodes anchored with the seabed or a combination of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and a fixed UASN where AUVs are controlled to move along paths for data collection. Existing data delivery protocols for such AUV equipped networks are designed in a way where AUVs act as message ferries. These UASNs are deployed for a specific service such as asset (e.g., oil pipes, shipwreck) monitoring and event detection. For a coordinated data collection, to deploy a network for any service like information discovery in an ad hoc manner, it requires a 3D UASN consisting of only AUVs and the movement of an AUV needs to be controlled by another AUV through commands. To our knowledge, no such data delivery protocol required for a 3D UASN comprising only AUVs exists in the current literature that can efficiently handle data collection and delivery. To address this research gap, in this paper, an AUV-based technique for ad hoc underwater network, namely AUV-based Data Delivery Protocol (ADDP), is introduced which ensures data delivery within a given time-constraint by controlling node (i.e., AUV) movement at each hop through commands of a node. The performance of the proposed protocol has also been evaluated and compared with existing relevant protocols in terms of packet delivery ratio, routing overhead and energy consumption considering various network scenarios and sizes. Results exhibit outstanding performance improvement achieved by the proposed protocol for all metrics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Owing to its relatively low absorption loss and high data transmission rate, wireless blue light communication is becoming an increasingly attractive technology for underwater applications. Here, we demonstrate an underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) system that communicates using blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with a dominant wavelength of 455 nm. Under the on-off keying modulation scheme, the waterproof UOWC system achieves a bidirectional communication rate of 4 Mbps based on the transmission control protocol (TCP) and exhibits real-time full-duplex video communication with a transmission distance of 12 m in a swimming pool, offering great potential for practical use in real-world scenarios, such as carried around or attached to an autonomous vehicle.

AB This paper proposes a fuzzy controller for trajectory tracking with unicycle-like mobile robots. Such controller uses two Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy blocks to generate its gains. The controller is able to limit the velocity and control signals of the robot, and to reduce the errors arising from its dynamics as well. The stability of the developed controller is proven, using the theory of Lyapunov. Experimental results show that the use of the proposed controller is attractive in comparison with the use of a controller with fixed saturation function. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By applying a pseudo-random code modulation to sequential acquisition of projected patterns the impact of environmental factors such as ambient light and mutual interference is significantly reduced. The proposed concept has been proven with an experimental range sensor based on the laser triangulation principle. The proposed design can potentially enhance the use of this principle to a variety of outdoor applications, such as autonomous vehicles, pedestrians' safety, collision avoidance, and many other tasks, where robust real-time distance detection in real world environment is crucial.

AB In this paper, wide-field integration methods, which are inspired by the spatial decompositions of wide-field patterns of optic flow in the insect visuomotor system, are explored as an efficient means to extract visual cues for guidance and navigation. A control-theoretic framework is developed and used to quantitatively link weighting functions to behaviorally-relevant interpretations such as relative orientation, position, and speed in a corridor environment. It is shown through analysis and demonstration on a ground vehicle that the proposed sensorimotor architecture gives rise to navigational heuristics, namely, centering and speed regulation, which are observed in natural systems.

AB Autonomous vehicle technology is rapidly advancing (see "Summary "). A key enabling factor is the advancing capabilities and declining cost of computing and sensing systems that enable sensor fusion for awareness of the vehicle's state and surroundings (see "Nontechnical Article Summary "). For control purposes, the vehicle's state must be estimated accurately, reliably, at a sufficiently high sample rate, and with a sufficiently high bandwidth. For systems with a high bandwidth, these requirements are often achieved by an aided inertial navigation system (INS) (see "Aided Inertial Navigation System History ") [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. An INS integrates data from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) through a kinematic model at the high sampling rate of the IMU to compute the state estimate. An aided INS corrects this state estimate using data from aiding sensors [for example, vision, lidar, radar, and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS)]. State estimation by sensor fusion may be accomplished using a variety of methods: Kalman filter (KF) [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], extended KF (EKF) [12], [13], [14], [15], unscented KF (UKF) [16], [17], [18], particle filter (PF) [19], [20], [21], and maximum a posteriori (MAP) optimization [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27].

AB Due to the fast, dynamic, and continuous arrival of data streams in the green Internet of Things (IoT) environment, the probability distribution of data streams changes over time. In real IoT scenarios such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) detection and smart light switch control, data distribution changes have reduced the trained model's accuracy for data streams problems classification, making it challenging to detect UAV intruders and predict whether energy-saving lamps in smart buildings are on or off. In this paper, an incremental ensemble classification method is proposed to improve prediction accuracy for green IoT. Specifically, a fuzzy rule-based classifier is combined with a dynamic weighting algorithm for improving classification accuracy. Moreover, the model is updated by incrementally learning the characteristics of data streams, which can effectively handle concept drift caused by data distribution changes in data streams. Experimental evaluations of UAV intrusion detection, smart buildings, and other datasets show that the proposed approach yields 2% higher area under the curve (AUC) and geometric mean (G-mean) than existing methods on UAV Detection and Occupancy datasets and 5% higher AUC and G-mean on five benchmarking datasets. For all datasets, the proposed approach yields 50% faster average training time than other methods.

AB The essential broadcasting feature of radio propagation channels provides an opportunity for multiple nodes to exchange information and work cooperatively, where each node, for example, mobile sensor or robot, plays both the role of transmitter and receiver. Especially in such machine-to-machine communication scenarios, the network performance and redundancy of information from different providers highly affect the work efficiency of each individual node and the whole system. To address these problems, a relay assisted centralised network model with physical layer network coding implemented in the relay is proposed in this study. This structure has the advantage of flexible data exchange and the capability to reduce redundancy in information. Its theoretical performance is analysed by the diversity multiplexing tradeoff, which proves the proposed model is versatile in reliable and high spectral-efficiency information exchange. Experiments of multiple nodes in a machine-to-machine scenario - unmanned aerial vehicles, further reveal its potential in improving efficiency of communication and cooperation.

SO JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS

AB The problem of autonomous tracking of aground moving target in an urban terrain is studied. In the investigated scenario, the target is tracked from multiple unmanned aerial vehicles using gimballed or body-fixed sensors under the constraints of terrain occlusions and airspace limitations. Information regarding the occlusions may be available a priori from a database or may be provided to the system by the operator based on his understanding of the environment. To ensure flyable trajectories, the unmanned aerial vehicles' dynamic constrains must be taken into account. A methodology is proposed for solving in real time a general class of such problems by casting the tracking task as a cooperative motion planning problem. Because of the computational complexity of the problem, a stochastic search method (genetic algorithm) is proposed for finding in real time monotonically improving solutions. An important attribute of the proposed solution approach is its scalability and, consequently, applicability to large-sized problems. For testing the algorithm, it was implemented in a high-fidelity simulation test bed using a visual database of an actual city., The viability of using the algorithm is shown using a Monte Carlo study. It is envisioned that automating this part of a ground moving target tracking problem will considerably reduce operators' workload and dramatically improve mission performance in such real-life problems.

AB During the last years, there is an increasing demand for cheap and easy to operate platforms for surveillance and reconnaissance purposes. Therefore, the development of micro aerial vehicles is receiving an increasing attention. However, VTOL-MAVs often show an inherent instability that makes at least an automatic stabilization necessary, because otherwise the operator would not be able to keep these vehicles airborne. This requires the availability of navigation information, especially the vehicle's attitude has to be known.
   This paper addresses the development of an integrated navigation system based on MEMS inertial sensors and GPS for a VTOL-MAV. Special attention is paid to the handling of GPS outages. While usually periods without GPS aiding can be bridged using the unaided strapdown solution, the poor quality of the MEMS inertial sensors prohibits this approach here. Therefore, during GPS outages the accelerometer data is interpreted as approximate measurements of the local gravity vector. Additionally, the usage of a magnetometer providing measurements of the Earth's magnetic field is motivated and discussed. Finally, flight test results illustrate the performance of the resulting system, proving that the achieved attitude accuracy is sufficient for the automatic control of the MAV. This holds in situations with permanent GPS loss and dynamic maneuvering, too. (C) 2006 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB The three-dimensional characterization and mapping of remote environments is an important task that generates a good deal of attention both by end users and by researchers across several fields of interests In the mobile robotics community, a great deal of work has been done in equipping vehicles with sensors that can acquire three-dimensional and even multimodal information about the location and nature of features and objects in remote environments. However, the interpretation of such data using fully autonomous methods, such as computer vision, is usually a highly complex problem that, we believe, is much better suited to a human-oriented solution.
   In this paper, we describe our work in the development of augmented reality (AR) techniques for the telerobotic inspection and characterization of remote environments. We describe how we are using stereoscopic camera feedback from a remote vehicle and equipping the human operator with three-dimensional virtual cursors that can be used to interactively measure and model real features and objects in the remote environment We include a description of the calibration techniques used to correctly align the real and virtual images both statically and under vehicle and camera motion. We also describe how we are using our system to demonstrate the potential of AR for improving the inspection of underground sewer pipes.

A mutation operator with a threshold is introduced to solve the problem of particles falling into the local extreme, and a nonlinear adaptive parameter strategy is introduced to accelerate the convergence speed. The proposed algorithm considers "path length", "path safety", "path smoothness" and "physical constraints" synthetically. For the specific navigation environment of AUVs, the path planning simulation is conducted based on MATLAB/Simulink, and the navigation guidance and control closed-loop simulation system is established. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

These guidance laws enable an unmanned aircraft system, equipped with a monocular camera, to continuously observe a set of moving objects within the field of view of its sensor. During the multi-object tracking process, we detect and categorize feature point estimators for controlling the occurrence of occlusions in a comprehensive fashion. Furthermore, we extend our open-source simulation environment and perform a series of simulations to show the efficacy of our proposed approach.

AB In this article, we investigate a two-tier delivery network with robots operating on the second tier. We determine the optimal number of local robot hubs as well as the optimal number of robots to service all customers and compare the resulting operational cost to conventional truck-based deliveries. Based on the well-known p-median problem, we present mixed-integer programs that consider the limited range of robots due to battery size. Compared with conventional truck-based deliveries, robot-based deliveries can save about 70% of operational cost and even more, up to 90%, for instances with customer time windows.

AB This paper addresses the design problem of the distributed optimization algorithms for tracking targets over Wireless Sensor Networks through coordinative communication. To balance the tradeoff between tracking error and control power consumption, a performance index is established in advance. Then, the optimization algorithm is designed consisting of an error integrator term and a feedforward term which can eliminate the steady-state tracking error and compensate the disturbance effect respectively. Finally, the numerical simulation is performed. By applying the designed control in an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle leader-follower formation control system, the algorithms are validated effective, feasible, and easy to be implemented.

AB This paper presents a hybrid feedback controller for path control of autonomous mobile robots. The controller combines reactive obstacle avoidance with global path replanning, enabling collision-free navigation along a preplanned path. Avoidance of local obstacles is accomplished by reactively adjusting the vehicle's lateral deviation from the path trajectory. Global path replanning is performed to circumvent obstacles which cannot be avoided locally. In contrast to common approaches, this is done by searching the shortest feasible path returning to the initial trajectory beyond the obstacle. Following the description of the hybrid feedback controller, experimental results with speeds of up to 4 m/s will demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.

AB This analytic and experimental study proposes a control algorithm for coordinated position and force control for autonomous multi-limbed mobile robotic systems. The technique is called Coordinated Jacobian Transpose Control (CJTC). Such position/force control algorithms will be required if future robotic systems are to operate effectively in unstructured environments. Generalized Control Variables (GCVs), express in a consistent and co-ordinated manner the desired behavior of the forces exerted by the multi-limbed robot on the environment and a system's motions. The effectiveness of this algorithm is demonstrated in simulation and laboratory experiments on a climbing system.

AB Low-latency communication is becoming more popular as applications that demand real-time interaction, such as autonomous mobile vehicles and tactile Internet, have recently gained prominence. In this paper, we propose a fast autotuning algorithm to support low-latency communication in the Quick UDP Internet Connection (QUIC) protocol. The transmission rate is adjusted by the fast autotuning based on the quantity of unused buffers. If the buffer has large free space, the receive window is quickly enlarged to increase the transmission rate and reduce the transmission delay. The fast autotuning is evaluated in this paper through extensive simulations, and the results show that the fast autotuning effectively reduces the transmission latency and increases throughput.

The occurrence of soft errors in such systems can lead to wrong decisions, which might ultimately incur in life losses. This brief focuses on the soft error susceptibility assessment of a real automotive application running on top of unmodified Linux kernels, and considering two commercially available processors, and three cross-compilers. Results collected from more than 29 thousand simulation hours show that the occurrence of faults in critical functions may cause 2.16x more failures on the system.

AB . Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming more broadly used for improving agricultural spraying applications. However, compared with the nearly 100 years of data accumulated on manned aerial applications, UAV sprayers are relatively new, and associated technologies are in the early stages of development. The objective of this paper is to give a comprehensive review of the current UAV spraying platforms with a comparison to manned aerial sprayers and a discussion of their application, performance, and efficiency. A total of 213 peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed articles, extension papers, government websites, and company websites were reviewed and cited in this study. We also discuss factors that could influence the effectiveness of aerial spraying applications, such as release height, wind speed, vortex strength, and droplet size. Finally, we review the latest UAV sprayers available worldwide and present technology gaps in those platforms. We highlight areas that require improvement, particularly in autonomous navigational controllers and spraying systems.

DE Agriculture; Feature aggregation; Obstacle detection; Video deblurring
AB Autonomous agricultural vehicles are increasingly common on farms, where they can replace humans in tasks such as irrigation, harvesting, and weeding, reducing labor costs. Real-time obstacle avoidance is a prerequisite for their work. At present, vehicles equipped with vision sensors cannot perform end-to-end video object detection, and their accuracy is also affected by motion blur. We propose a novel agricultural obstacle detection method based on RNN and flow-guided feature aggregation, combining video deblurring and object detection tasks for joint optimization. In addition, to make full use of the region proposals, a region shared strategy is proposed to improve the efficiency of video deblurring. The proposed method can solve the common motion blur problem in agricultural video and is expected to be suitable for all kinds of obstacle detection tasks in agricultural scenes. We experimented with this method on the FieldSAFE and GOPRO datasets. Our method provides better detection performance and is computationally less costly than other methods according to experimental results.

AB High-performance light detection and ranging (LiDAR) modules are highly demanded for advanced driving assistance system and autonomous driving. With CMOS-fabricated single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) and pulsed-operated semiconductor lasers, photon-counting based vehicle LiDARs are one of the most promising candidates for low-cost solution. The high data rate and the long integration time of SPAD LiDARs are two of main obstacles for realizing commercially affordable 3-D imagers. In this work, we develop an evaluation method for the minimum ranging time and investigate the time-bin width effect on the ranging precision. A simple formula for predicting the shortest integration time is proposed and compared with the experimental data. We also demonstrate that a proper time-bin width can reduce the data rate and required memory size without degrading the distance resolution. Our work paves the way for making low-cost vehicle LiDARs through system optimizing and engineering.

AB Flying ad hoc networks (FANETs), which are composed of autonomous flying vehicles, constitute an important supplement to satellite networks and terrestrial networks, and they are indispensable for many scenarios including emergency communication. Unfortunately, the routing therein is largely affected by rapid topology changes, frequent disconnection of links, and a high vehicle mobility. In this paper, an intelligent routing strategy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed, which is decentralized and takes into account the status of symmetrical nodes in two hops. In order to perceive the local dynamics of the network as comprehensively as possible, the location, moving speed, load degree, and link quality of the nodes are considered into the setting process of state elements in the method. The nodes can select the neighboring node adaptively according to the Q values calculated by the model obtained through the training of Deep Q-Networks. The simulation and analysis show that the proposed method possesses good convergence characteristics and has obviously better performance compared with several common methods.

AB Every day, new applications arise relying on the use of high-resolution road maps in both academic and industrial environments. Autonomous vehicles rely on digital maps to navigate when optical sensors cannot be trusted, such as heavy rainfalls, snowy conditions, fog, and other situations. These situations increase the risks of accidents and disable the potentials of real-time mapping sensors. To tackle those problems, we present a methodology to automatically map anomalies on the road, namely speed bumps in this study, using an off-the-shelf camera (GoPro) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. We acquired data over a series of differently shaped speed bumps and applied three classification techniques: Naive Bayes, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Random Forest (RF). With over 96% of classification accuracy, then RF was able to identify speed bumps on a GoPro dataset automatically. The results show a potential of the proposed methodology to be developed in surveying vehicles to produce highly-detailed maps of vertical road anomalies with a fast and accurate update rate.

AB In the last decade, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been a research focus for many purposes. Many of these studies require a path planning to perform autonomous flights, as well as the maintenance of a fixed flight level with respect to the ground to capture videos or overlying images. This article presents an approach to plan a mission for UAVs keeping a fixed flight level constraint. The 3D environment where the planning is carried out is an open field with non-uniform terrain. The approach proposed is based on the Fast Marching Square (FM2) method, which generates a path free from obstacles. Our approach includes two adjustment parameters. Depending on the values of these parameters, the restriction of flight level can be modified, as well as the smoothness and safety of the generated paths. Simulated experiments carried out in this work demonstrate that the proposed approach generates trajectories respecting a fixed flight level over the ground with successful results.

AB Autonomous navigation of legged robots in complex environments poses a great deal of challenges compared with ground vehicles because of their different terrain traverse capabilities. An obstacle for vehicles may be traversable for legged robots. This paper proposes a real-time obstacle detection algorithm for legged robots using the Microsoft Kinect sensor. First, the elevation map of a reference grid is calculated. Then an obstacle definition for legged robots is proposed, which makes it possible for a legged robot to discriminate traversable areas from non-traversable areas. To reduce computational cost, sometimes, efficient judging rules are developed to identify obstacles. A spiral search strategy is proposed to find the most ground-like point as the starting point for graph-based traversal. Breadth-First-Traversal of the graph is used to label all traversable areas connecting to the starting point. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is reliable and efficient. The proposed algorithm can be employed in real-time obstacle detection for legged robots in complex environments.

AB This paper addresses the problem of building a shared environment representation by a human-robot team. Rich environment models are required in real applications for both autonomous operation of robots and to support human decision-making. Two probabilistic models are used to describe outdoor environment features such as trees: geometric (position in the world) and visual. The visual representation is used to improve data association and to classify features. Both models are able to incorporate observations from robotic platforms and human operators. Physically, humans and robots form a heterogeneous sensor network. In our experiments, the human-robot team consists of an unmanned air vehicle, a ground vehicle, and two human operators. They are deployed for an information gathering task and perform information fusion cooperatively. All aspects of the system including the fusion algorithms are fully decentralized. Experimental results are presented in form of the acquired multi-attribute feature map, information exchange patterns demonstrating human-robot information fusion, and quantitative model evaluation. Learned lessons from deploying the system in the field are also presented. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Determination of the existence of intervisibility between pairs of points above realistically undulating terrain is a fundamental operation within land-based military simulations. However, transitions between regions where an intelligently piloted vehicle is respectively exposed and concealed are of particular importance, yet are often very difficult to identify a priori. Tn this paper we show how a meaningful gradient of intervisibility can be directly calculated, and we argue that this provides a valuable indication of the direction to the nearest point of opposite visibility. Moreover, direct methods for evaluating such gradients are also relevant to some classes of behavioural models for vehicles moving over such terrain. Numerical simulation results are presented in support of the theoretical analyses.
   We will also outline how. simple randomized, yet differentiable topography, exhibiting realistic undulations, can be conveniently generated as a thermalized elastic manifold. The availability of such an ensemble of different topographies provides a powerful test of the adaptability of any terrain-dependent algorithm, and forms an integral part of the validation of our analysis.

AB Myojin Knoll caldera, one of the submarine silicic calderas lying on the volcanic front of the northern Izu-Ogasawara arc, has attracted increasing attention since the discovery of a large hydrothermal field called the Sunrise deposit. Although numerous submersible surveys have been conducted in Myojin Knoll caldera, they have not sufficiently explored areas to produce a complete picture of the caldera and understand the origin of the Sunrise deposit. We conducted comprehensive deep-sea surveys using an autonomous underwater vehicle and obtained high-resolution bathymetric and magnetic data and sonar images from similar to 70% of the caldera. The detailed bathymetric map revealed that faulting and magma eruptions, possibly associated with an inflation-deflation cycle of the magma reservoir during postcaldera volcanism, had generally occurred in the caldera wall. The main dome of the central cone was covered with lava flows and exhibits exogenous growth, which is unusual for rhyolitic domes. The magnetization distribution in the central cone indicates preferential magma intrusion along a NW-SE direction. It is presumed that magma migrated along this direction and formed a rhyolite dome at the foot of the southeastern caldera wall, where the Sunrise deposit occurs. The Sunrise deposit is composed mainly of three ridges extending in slope directions and covers similar to 400 x similar to 400 m. Magnetization reduction in the deposit area is small, indicating that the alteration zone beneath the Sunrise deposit is slanting rather than vertical. It is presumed that several slanting and near-vertical volcanic vents serve as pathways of hydrothermal fluid in Myojin Knoll caldera.

AB This paper addresses the problem of environment representation for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SIAM) algorithms. One of the main problems of SLAM is how to interpret and synthesize the external sensory information into a representation of the environment that can be used by the mobile robot to operate autonomously. Traditionally, SLAM algorithms have relied on sparse environment representations. However, for autonomous navigation, a more detailed representation of the environment is necessary, and the classic feature-based representation fails to provide a robot with sufficient information. While a dense representation is desirable, it has not been possible for SLAM paradigms.
   This paper presents DenseSLAM, an algorithm to obtain and maintain detailed environment representations. The algorithm represents different sensory information in dense multi-layered maps. Each layer can represent different properties of the environment, such as occupancy, traversability, elevation or each layer can describe the same environment property using different representations. Implementations of the algorithm with two different representations for the dense maps are shown.
   A rich representation has several potential advantages to assist the navigation process, for example to facilitate data association using multi-dimensional maps. This paper presents two particular applications to improve the localization process; the extraction of complex landmarks from the dense maps and the detection of areas with dynamic objects. The paper also presents an analysis of consistency of the maps obtained with DenseSLAM. The position error in the dense maps is analyzed and a method to select the landmarks in order to minimize these errors is explained.
   The algorithm was tested with outdoor experimental data taken with a ground vehicle. The experimental results show that the algorithm can obtain dense environment representations and that the detailed representation can be used to improve the vehicle localization process.

AB Physical-biological couplings impacting phytoplankton ecology are examined with synoptic, high-resolution observations of Monterey Bay, California, Influences of submarine canyon and shelf break topography on the physical-biological couplings are supported by 2 case studies. In the first case study, benthic-pelagic coupling was observed in southern shelf waters where a turbid plume extended from the bottom at similar to 60 m deep to the base of a phytoplankton layer centered at similar to 10 m deep. The alongshelf scale of the plume ranged from similar to 5 km near the bottom to similar to 1 km at its intersection with the phytoplankton layer. In situ and remote sensing data support the influence of Monterey Canyon on circulation forcing the benthic-pelagic coupling. In the second case study, a frontal zone and adjacent waters were rapidly surveyed over similar to 20 km(2) of the northern shelf. The front was associated with an isopycnal ridge/trough structure, surface slick, and frontal eddy < 1 km in diameter. The magnitude and vertical location of a chlorophyll maximum layer were closely coupled with the physical environment through the frontal zone. The layer was dispersed by the isopycnal ridge and frontal eddy, and concentrated in the isopycnal trough and along the periphery of the eddy. Influence of an internal wave generated by interaction of tidal currents with the shelf break is supported by the observed surface slick, measured water velocities, and the proximity and orientation of the shelf break. Significant and persistent influences of topography on phytoplankton ecology in Monterey Bay are indicated.

ID DESIGN
AB Solar power is a popular option for powering Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) due to its ability to provide power for long-endurance flight. However, solar-powered UAVs face challenges, including operational reliability problems. To address their operational reliability issues, this paper proposes an automatic solar tracker system and tests two implementation strategies for controlling a tandem-winged and solar-powered UAV, developed by the Faculty of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Institut Teknologi Bandung. Due to its unconventional configuration, a mathematical model for the UAV is developed to evaluate the vehicle's dynamic characteristics. Based on these, three feedback control systems are designed, i.e., roll attitude control, a heading tracker, and a solar tracker. Two implementation strategies are proposed to combine the control systems, i.e., the mode-switching and the simultaneous tracking strategies. A series of simulations are then conducted to check the vehicle's overall flight performance, as well as the gathering of solar energy. The mode-switching strategy was able to gather up to 13% more solar energy than the simultaneous strategy, which could only reach slightly above 2%. Mode-switching, however, resulted in a shorter range compared to the latter, due to the time spent in the charging mode, flying in a circular pattern.

AB The focus of this article is maximizing the sum-rate of wireless unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks with intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) in the presence of system practical limitations. More specifically, we consider that the phase compensation at the IRS is imperfect due to various factors such as device imperfections and channel estimation errors. Moreover, we consider that the IRS elements have limited switching frequency, which limits the possibility of being allocated to different UAVs over consecutive time slots when time-division multiple access is considered. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem, where the objective is to maximize the network sum-rate subject to total energy and quality-of-service constraints by optimizing the number of IRS elements and power allocated to each UAV. To solve the optimization problem, a low-complexity heuristic algorithm is proposed based on the quality of the estimated phase for each IRS element. The proposed approach is compared to benchmark techniques such as the uniform allocation process and genetic algorithm. The obtained results show that a significant sum-rate improvement of up to 45% can be gained using the proposed algorithm.

AB In this paper, the joint design of power allocation (PA), beamforming (BF) and positioning is studied for unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) aided millimeter-Wave (UAV-mmWave) systems, with the objective of maximizing the energy efficiency (EE), under the constraints of maximum transmitting power, minimum data rate from the ground users and positioning range of the UAV. To address the above problem, we first obtain the positioning of the UAV, with the help of approximate beam pattern. Then, near-optimal BF and closed-form PA are derived given the obtained position, with the help of block coordinate descent method. To reduce the complexity, two suboptimal BF schemes with one-loop iteration and closed-form solutions are respectively derived. Furthermore, we propose the simplified algorithms for two special cases, i.e., only line-of-sight (LoS) path and Non-LoS (NLoS) path exist between the users and the UAV. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the developed joint schemes and show the superior EE performance. Moreover, they can obtain almost the same performance as the existing benchmark schemes but with lower complexity.

AB This study designs a method to improve the robustness of the micro air vehicle (MAV) yaw angle estimation for low-cost inertial navigation system/global positioning system (INS/GPS) integration by using a tri-axial magnetometer. Observability properties of the integration navigation system are first analysed, indicating that all attitude angles have great observability with the aid of the heading measurement by a magnetometer, while the observability of yaw angle is low in traditional INS/GPS. To improve the robustness of yaw angle estimation, the authors calibrate the tri-axial magnetometer according to the rotating ellipsoid model and establish a fault detection and isolation mechanism to adjust the weight of magnetic-measurement adaptively and dynamically in integration navigation. The simulation and experiment results show that the proposed method can calibrate the tri-axial magnetometer properly and screen out the abnormal magnetic measurement for the robustness of yaw angle estimation, suggesting that this technique is a viable candidate for MAV navigation and control applications in complex magnetic fields.

AB The last decade has witnessed a wide spread of small drones in many civil and military applications. With the massive advancement in the manufacture of small and lightweight Inertial Navigation System (INS), navigation in challenging environments became feasible. Navigation of these small drones mainly depends on the integration of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and INS. However, the navigation performance of these small drones deteriorates quickly when the GNSS signals are lost, due to accumulated errors of the low-cost INS that is typically used in these drones. During GNSS signal outages, another aiding sensor is required to bound the drift exhibited by the INS. Before adding any additional sensor on-board the drones, there are some limitations that must be taken into considerations. These limitations include limited availability of power, space, weight, and size. This paper presents a novel unconventional method, to enhance the navigation of autonomous drones in GNSS denied environment, through a new utilization of hall effect sensor to act as flying odometer Air-Odo and vehicle dynamic model (VDM) for heading estimation. The proposed approach enhances the navigational solution by estimating the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) velocity, and heading and fusing these measurements in the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) of the integrated system.

AB This paper proposes an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flight control method where a graph-based path is generated after the collected UAV flight data by a pilot are analyzed. UAV flights are planned by using hierarchical A* search algorithms based on graph-based generated flight paths to take images at multiple surveillance points. Generating a graph-based path makes it possible for UAVs to fly autonomously along paths shorter than that of the pilot collecting UAV flight data given that the shorter paths can be derived by connecting partially flied paths. A* search algorithms can be applied hierarchically to a graph-based path that contains circulation paths. The proposed method was experimentally verified through an analysis of the collected UAV flight data to generate graph-based and planned paths. The pilot flew the UAV six times and obtained 8115 UAV flight data points. The generated graph-based path included 17 monitoring points for taking surveillance images and 90 intermediate flight points. The length of the flight paths collected by six time flights was 1364.32 m, and the length of the flight paths by the proposed method was 764.27 m. Given that 8115 flight points were collected and 109 flight points were selected by the proposed method, the complexity of the generated graph-based path consisted of flight points was reduced to 1.34% by hierarchical A* search algorithms.

AB There is accumulating evidence that driver distraction is a leading cause of vehicle crashes and incidents. In particular, increased use of so-called in-vehicle information systems (IVIS) and partially autonomous driving assistance systems (PADAS) have raised important and growing safety concerns. Thus, detecting the driver's state is of paramount importance, to adapt IVIS and PADAS accordingly, therefore avoiding or mitigating their possible negative effects. The purpose of this paper is to show a method for the nonintrusive and real-time detection of visual distraction, using vehicle dynamics data and without using the eye-tracker data as inputs to classifiers. Specifically, we present and compare different models that are based on well-known machine learning (ML) methods. Data for training the models were collected using a static driving simulator, with real human subjects performing a specific secondary task [i.e., a surrogate visual research task (SURT)] while driving. Different training methods, model characteristics, and feature selection criteria have been compared. Based on our results, using a support vector machine (SVM) has outperformed all the other ML methods, providing the highest classification rate for most of the subjects. Potential applications of this paper include the design of an adaptive IVIS and of a "smarter" PADAS.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm cooperative decision-making has attracted increasing attentions because of its low-cost, reusable, and distributed characteristics. However, existing non-learning-based methods rely on small-scale, known scenarios, and cannot solve complex multi-agent cooperation problem in large-scale, uncertain scenarios. This paper proposes a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (HMARL) method to solve the heterogeneous UAV swarm cooperative decision-making problem for the typical suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) mission, which is decoupled into two sub-problems, i.e., the higher-level target allocation (TA) sub-problem and the lower-level cooperative attacking (CA) sub-problem. A HMARL agent model, consisting of a multi-agent deep Q network (MADQN) based TA agent and multiple independent asynchronous proximal policy optimization (IAPPO) based CA agents, is established. MADQN-TA agent can dynamically adjust the TA schemes according to the relative position. To encourage exploration and promote learning efficiency, the Metropolis criterion and inter-agent information exchange techniques are introduced. IAPPO-CA agent adopts independent learning paradigm, which can easily scale with the number of agents. Comparative simulation results validate the effectiveness, robustness, and scalability of the proposed method.

AB The rapid development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) holds vast potential for transportation systems through improved safety, efficiency, and access to mobility. However, the progression of these impacts, as AVs are adopted, is not well understood. Numerous technical challenges arise from the goal of analyzing the partial adoption of autonomy: partial control and observation, multivehicle interactions, and the sheer variety of scenarios represented by real-world networks. To shed light into near-term AV impacts, this article studies the suitability of deep reinforcement learning (RL) for overcoming these challenges in a low AV-adoption regime. A modular learning framework is presented, which leverages deep RL to address complex traffic dynamics. Modules are composed to capture common traffic phenomena (stop-and-go traffic jams, lane changing, intersections). Learned control laws are found to improve upon human driving performance, in terms of system-level velocity, by up to 57% with only 4-7% adoption of AVs. Furthermore, in single-lane traffic, a small neural network control law with only local observation is found to eliminate stop-and-go traffic-surpassing all known model-based controllers to achieve near-optimal performance-and generalize to out-of-distribution traffic densities.

AB Future ocean exploration will be dominated by a large-scale deployment of marine robots such as unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). Without the involvement of human operators, USVs exploit oceans, especially the complex marine environments, in an unprecedented way with an increased mission efficiency. However, current autonomy level of USVs is still limited, and the majority of vessels are being remotely controlled. To address such an issue, artificial intelligence (AI) such as reinforcement learning can effectively equip USVs with high-level intelligence and consequently achieve full autonomous operation. Also, by adopting the concept of multiagent intelligence, future trend of USV operations is to use them as a formation fleet. Current researches in USV formation control are largely based upon classical control theories such as PID, backstepping and model predictive control methods with the impact by using advanced AI technologies unclear. This paper, therefore, paves the way in this area by proposing a distributed deep reinforcement learning algorithm for USV formations. More importantly, using the proposed algorithm USV formations can learn two critical abilities, i.e. adaptability and extendibility that enable formations to arbitrarily increase the number of USVs or change formation shapes. The effectiveness of algorithms has been verified and validated through a number of computer-based simulations.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have recently been used in a wide variety of applications due to their versatility, reduced cost, rapid deployment, among other advantages. Search and Rescue (SAR) is one of the most prominent areas for the employment of UAVs in place of a manned mission, especially because of its limitations on the costs, human resources, and mental and perception of the human operators. In this work, a real-time path-planning solution using multiple cooperative UAVs for SAR missions is proposed. The technique of Particle Swarm Optimization is used to solve a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem that aims to perform search in a given area of interest, following the directive of international standards of SAR. A coordinated turn kinematic model for level flight in the presence of wind is included in the MPC. The solution is fully implemented to be embedded in the UAV on-board computer with DUNE, an on-board navigation software. The performance is evaluated using Ardupilot's Software-In-The-Loop with JSBSim flight dynamics model simulations. Results show that, when employing three UAVs, the group reaches 50% Probability of Success 2.35 times faster than when a single UAV is employed.

AB In this paper, an intelligent scheme for detecting incipient defects in spur gears is presented. In fact, the study has been undertaken to determine these defects in a single propeller system of a small-sized unmanned helicopter. It is important to remark that although the study focused on this particular system, the obtained results could be extended to other systems known as AUVs (Autonomous Unmanned Vehicles), where the usage of polymer gears in the vehicle transmission is frequent. Few studies have been carried out on these kinds of gears. In this paper, an experimental platform has been adapted for the study and several samples have been prepared. Moreover, several vibration signals have been measured and their time-frequency characteristics have been taken as inputs to the diagnostic system. In fact, a diagnostic system based on an artificial intelligence strategy has been devised. Furthermore, techniques based on several paradigms of the Artificial Intelligence (Neural Networks, Fuzzy systems and Genetic Algorithms) have been applied altogether in order to design an efficient fault diagnostic system. A hybrid Genetic Neuro-Fuzzy system has been developed, where it is possible, at the final stage of the learning process, to express the fault diagnostic system as a set of fuzzy rules. Several trials have been carried out and satisfactory results have been achieved.

AB Deep learning techniques lead to fundamentally non-interpretable decisions made by the machine. Although such choices do not have an explanation, they impact the users in significant ways. If the ultimate innovator is a machine, what is the meaning of responsible conduct? I argue in a recent book that the capacity to extract an AI system from human judgment, by reducing transparency in favor of opacity, is an essential value in machine ethics. This can be achieved through the use of randomness, as illustrated with the example of the trolley dilemma. Methodologically, a comparison of common motives between technological setups and mythological narratives is used to achieve ethical insights.

AB We present the first evidence for widespread seabed methane venting along the southeastern United States Atlantic margin beyond the well-known Blake Ridge diapir seep. Recent ship- and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-collected data resolve multiple water-column anomalies (>1000 m height) and extensive new chemosynthetic seep communities at the Blake Ridge and Cape Fear diapirs. These results indicate that multiple, highly localized fluid conduits punctuate the areally extensive Blake Ridge gas hydrate province, and enable the delivery of significant amounts of methane to the water column. Thus, there appears to be an abundance of seabed fluid flux not previously ascribed to the Atlantic margin of the United States.

AB Doppler shift tracking and compensation based on block and adaptive estimation methods are presented. These methods enable robust high data-rate acoustic communication between moving platforms such as autonomous underwater vehicles. The proposed schemes are incorporated within a wideband beamforming array with decision feedback equalisation. The block-based Doppler compensator is used as a pre-processor to the beamforming structure, whereas the adaptive compensator and the beamforming structure are jointly updated. The two methods employ multirate sampling and linear interpolation to compensate for the Doppler shift. Simulation and experimental sea-trial results are reported for both block and adaptive methods, which demonstrate successful communication at 16 kbit/s with a transmitting platform moving at up to +/- 2.6 m/s.

In the first step, these images are colour segmented with a pixel classifier. Colour combinations which are characteristic for traffic signs generate hypotheses. These hypotheses are verified using a pictogram classifier.
   Our system has been successfully tested on thousands of traffic scenes. The processing of a 512 by 512 frame takes approximately 1 second on a Sparc-10.

AB A launch vehicle needs to adapt to a complex flight environment during flight, and traditional guidance and control algorithms can hardly deal with multi-factor uncertainties due to the high dependency on control models. To solve this problem, this paper designs a new intelligent flight control method for a rocket based on the deep reinforcement learning algorithm driven by knowledge and data. In this process, the Markov decision process of the rocket landing section is established by designing a reinforcement function with consideration of the combination effect on the return of the terminal constraint of the launch vehicle and the cumulative return of the flight process of the rocket. Meanwhile, to improve the training speed of the landing process of the launch vehicle and to enhance the generalization ability of the model, the strategic neural network model is obtained and trained via the form of a long short-term memory (LSTM) network combined with a full connection layer as a landing guidance strategy network. The proximal policy optimization (PPO) is the training algorithm of reinforcement learning network parameters combined with behavioral cloning (BC) as the reinforcement learning pre-training imitation learning algorithm. Notably, the rocket-borne environment is transplanted to the Nvidia Jetson TX2 embedded platform for the comparative testing and verification of this intelligent model, which is then used to generate real-time control commands for guiding the actual flying and landing process of the rocket. Further, comparisons of the results obtained from convex landing optimization and the proposed method in this work are performed to prove the effectiveness of this proposed method. The simulation results show that the intelligent control method in this work can meet the landing accuracy requirements of the launch vehicle with a fast convergence speed of 84 steps, and the decision time is only 2.5 ms. Additionally, it has the ability of online autonomous decision making as deployed on the embedded platform.

AB Nowadays, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has emerged as a powerful platform for diversified application development. In traffic areas specifically for the much-anticipated Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), UAVs can coordinate with the ground internet of things infrastructure, such as the Road Side Unit (RSU), to perform 3D data collection and processing, improving traffic safety and transportation efficiency. In ITS, decision-making is crucial and relies heavily on proper and timely processing and transmission of the massive amounts of data generated by ubiquitous sensors, especially in emergency disposal scenarios. In this paper, the latency incurred from RSU-aided data offloading and UAV-aided data relay plays a decisive role, characterized by both the average and risk performance metric, Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), for quantifying the risk incurred from the latency violation over a certain threshold in probability. Specifically, the peak Age of Information (AoI) with its distribution is adopted to underlying the CVaR analysis in relay latency. Besides, the matching algorithm to coordinate the mutual transmission between UAVs and RSUs is proposed, achieving low computation complexity and minimum risk for both sides. The system performance is validated through analysis, simulation, and field experiments.

AB As a significant research direction in remote sensing fields, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) tracking has achieved rapid development in recent years. However, due to limited power and computation resources on aerial platforms, the trackingmethods deployed on UAVs usually require high computational efficiency and performance. In addition, various challenges (i.e., similar object, background clutter, and occlusion) have inevitably occurred during the UAV tracking phase. Therefore, considering the above issues comprehensively, this article proposes a dynamic aberrance-repressed temporal regularized correlation filter (CF) to achieve stable tracking inUAVremote sensing videos. First, we have introduced the aberrance-repressed temporal regularizations into the discriminative CF framework. Second, a novel objective loss function is constructed to adjust the strength of each regularization for training the filter. Then, a new judgment mechanism based on the response variation is exploited to reflect the response fluctuation and applied to tune parameters of both regularizations. Finally, comprehensive experiments are done on three different UAV benchmarks, i.e., UAV123@10fps, UAVDT, and VisDrone2018, to verify the performance of our tracker and have demonstrated that our tracker achieves superior performance against other total 25 state-of-the-art trackers while reaching 35 FPS on a single CPU.

AB This paper addresses the event-triggered tracking control problem of the SbW system subject to unavailable steering angular velocity of front-wheels, time-varying external disturbance, and uncertain dynamics, including friction torque and self-aligning torque. First, an adaptive state observer is proposed to estimate the unavailable steering angular velocity of front-wheels. The uncertain nonlinearity and time-varying disturbance can be estimated by the adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2 FLS) and the disturbance observer, respectively. An event-triggered control is proposed for SbW systems to guarantee the pre specified control performance and save communication resources in the controller-to actuator channel. Much importantly, the nested robust terms are incorporated in the control scheme to counteract the observation error and overcome the negative influence of the event-triggering error. Theoretical analysis shows that the prespecified arbitrary tracking accuracy can be guaranteed within finite time, and the Zeno-behavior can be strictly avoided while saving communication resources in the controller-to-actuator channel. Finally, simulation and vehicle experiment results and some comparisons are given to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Social internet of things (SIoT) is an emerging concept that enables the autonomous interactions between social networks and internet of things (IoT). Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks are one of the instances of the SIoT. To mitigate privacy and security issues exist in the V2G networks, it is crucial to employ proper security solutions. One of the most important and popular security solutions is the key exchange protocol. During the last decade, several key exchange schemes have been proposed considering the specific requirements of V2G networks. However, the existing schemes have not reached a proper balance between security and efficiency. Therefore, in this paper, after the security assessment of a recent work, we propose a key exchange protocol, which can provide the desired performance and security properties. Rigorous formal security analyses besides the security features, communication overhead, and computational complexity comparisons indicate that the proposed scheme is a robust one to be employed in the V2G networks. To be more specific, in comparison to one of the most secure schemes, the proposed protocol has 84% improvement in execution time and 54% improvement in communication overhead. Furthermore, experiments on realistic platform indicate that the proposed protocol only takes 3 s to be executed by the computationally constrained onboard unit of electric vehicle.

AB The development of the Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) with urban applications are now possible due to the recent solutions (DARPA Grand Challenge) developed to solve the Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) problem: perception, path planning and control. For the last decade, the introduction of GPS systems and vision have been allowed the transposition of SLAM methods dedicated to indoor environments to outdoor ones. When the GPS data are unavailable, the Current position of the mobile robot can be estimated by the fusion of data from odometer and/or Inertial Navigation System (INS).
   We detail in this article what call be done with all Uncalibrated stereo-rig, when it is embedded in a vehicle which is going through urban roads. The methodology is based on features extracted on planes: we mainly assume the road at the foreground as the plane common to all the urban scenes but other planes like vertical frontages of buildings can be used if the features extracted oil the road are not enough relevant. The relative motions of the coplanar features tracked with both cameras allow us to estimate the vehicle ego-motion with a high precision. Furthermore, the features which don't check the relative motion of the considered plane call be assumed as obstacles. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We study the problem of using single or multiple cooperative autonomous vehicles, called trackers, to localize and pursue an unknown underwater moving target using measurement of the ranges between the tracker(s) and the target. At the motion planning level, each tracker is assigned a spatial-temporal (S-T) curve to track that is generated by the composition of two types of motion: along the target's trajectory and on a path encircling the target. At the control level, we derive control laws for robust trajectory tracking and show that under mild assumptions on the convergence of the target's state estimate provided by a suitably designed filter, the tracker converges to and remains in a desired vicinity of the target. For the case of multiple trackers, we propose an efficient distributed estimation and control (DEC) strategy for the trackers that consider explicitly the constraints on the intertracker communication network. To this end, a distributed extended Kalman filter (DEKF) and a distributed control law for cooperative S-T curve tracking are developed to cooperatively pursue and localize the target. Using this setup, all trackers converge to a specified vicinity of the target while keeping an optimal tracker-target relative geometry that maximizes the range information acquired to estimate the target's state. The stability of the complete closed-loop DEC system is analyzed rigorously and the efficacy of the proposed strategy is illustrated with extensive computer simulations for the 2-D and 3-D cases.

DE Planning under uncertainty; Decentralized POMDP; Information gathering;

AB Decentralized policies for information gathering are required when multiple autonomous agents are deployed to collect data about a phenomenon of interest when constant communication cannot be assumed. This is common in tasks involving information gathering with multiple independently operating sensor devices that may operate over large physical distances, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, or in communication limited environments such as in the case of autonomous underwater vehicles. In this paper, we frame the information gathering task as a general decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). The Dec-POMDP is a principled model for co-operative decentralized multi-agent decision-making. An optimal solution of a Dec-POMDP is a set of local policies, one for each agent, which maximizes the expected sum of rewards over time. In contrast to most prior work on Dec-POMDPs, we set the reward as a non-linear function of the agents' state information, for example the negative Shannon entropy. We argue that such reward functions are well-suited for decentralized information gathering problems. We prove that if the reward function is convex, then the finite-horizon value function of the Dec-POMDP is also convex. We propose the first heuristic anytime algorithm for information gathering Dec-POMDPs, and empirically prove its effectiveness by solving discrete problems an order of magnitude larger than previous state-of-the-art. We also propose an extension to continuous-state problems with finite action and observation spaces by employing particle filtering. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is verified in domains such as decentralized target tracking, scientific survey planning, and signal source localization.

TI Learning traversability models for autonomous mobile vehicles

AB Autonomous mobile robots need to adapt their behavior to the terrain over which they drive, and to predict the traversability of the terrain so that they can effectively plan their paths. Such robots usually make use of a set of sensors to investigate the terrain around them and build up an internal representation that enables them to navigate. This paper addresses the question of how to use sensor data to learn properties of the environment and use this knowledge to predict which regions of the environment are traversable. The approach makes use of sensed information from range sensors (stereo or ladar), color cameras, and the vehicle's navigation sensors. Models of terrain regions are learned from subsets of pixels that are selected by projection into a local occupancy grid. The models include color and texture as well as traversability information obtained from an analysis of the range data associated with the pixels. The models are learned without supervision, deriving their properties from the geometry and the appearance of the scene.
   The models are used to classify color images and assign traversability costs to regions. The classification does not use the range or position information, but only color images. Traversability determined during the model-building phase is stored in the models. This enables classification of regions beyond the range of stereo or ladar using the information in the color images. The paper describes how the models are constructed and maintained, how they are used to classify image regions, and how the system adapts to changing environments. Examples are shown from the implementation of this algorithm in the DARPA Learning Applied to Ground Robots (LAGR) program, and an evaluation of the algorithm against human-provided ground truth is presented.

AB Model predictive control (MPC) is a promising approach to the lateral and longitudinal control of autonomous vehicles. However, the parameterization of the MPC with respect to high-level requirements such as passenger comfort, as well as lateral and longitudinal tracking, is challenging. Numerous tuning parameters and conflicting requirements need to be considered. In this paper, we formulate the MPC tuning task as a multi-objective optimization problem. Its solution is demanding for two reasons: First, MPC-parameterizations are evaluated in a computationally expensive simulation environment. As a result, the optimization algorithm needs to be as sample-efficient as possible. Second, for some poor parameterizations, the simulation cannot be completed; therefore, useful objective function values are not available (for instance, learning with crash constraints). In this work, we compare the sample efficiency of multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), a genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), and multiple versions of Bayesian optimization (BO). We extend BO by introducing an adaptive batch size to limit the computational overhead. In addition, we devise a method to deal with crash constraints. The results show that BO works best for a small budget, NSGA-II is best for medium budgets, and none of the evaluated optimizers are superior to random search for large budgets. Both proposed BO extensions are, therefore, shown to be beneficial.

AB Decentralized control allows each unmanned surface vehicle (USV) in a flock to be autonomous to some extent. In this paper, the flocking algorithm put forth by Olfati-Saber was improved and applied in the multi-leader scenario based on its original flocking movement. Repulsion was also taken into account in the formation. Subsequently, the concept of neighborhood in finite-range communications was borrowed to control the communication distance of each USV. In this way, USVs could satisfy the restriction of a given communication distance, and avoid collision in motion. USVs might have collaborative tracking of a virtual leader and obtain the distributed cooperative control strategy. Based on the simulation results, the improved flocking control algorithm allowed every USV to accurately track the speed of the virtual leader they followed, respectively. The test results also demonstrated the effectiveness of the algorithm in safe flock navigation, and proved that the proposed control algorithm must be an effective way to ensure the safe flocking of multiple USVs.

AB Brothers volcano is the most hydrothermally active volcano along the Kermadec arc, with distinct hydrothermal fields located on the caldera walls and on the postcollapse volcanic cones. These sites display very different styles of hydrothermal activity in terms of temperature, gas content, fluid chemistry, and associated mineralization. Here we show the results of a systematic heat flow survey integrated with near-seafloor magnetic data acquired using remotely operated vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles. Large-scale circulation is structurally controlled, with a deep (similar to 1- to 2-km depth) central recharge through the caldera floor and lateral discharge along the caldera walls and at the summits of the postcollapse cones. Shallow (similar to 0.1-0.2 km depth) circulation is characterized by small-scale recharge zones located at a distance of similar to 0.1-0.2 km from the active vent sites.

   range; spectroradiometer; droplet size distribution
AB Autonomous driving is based on innovative technologies that have to ensure that vehicles are driven safely. LiDARs are one of the reference sensors for obstacle detection. However, this technology is affected by adverse weather conditions, especially fog. Different wavelengths are investigated to meet this challenge (905 nm vs. 1550 nm). The influence of wavelength on light transmission in fog is then examined and results reported. A theoretical approach by calculating the extinction coefficient for different wavelengths is presented in comparison to measurements with a spectroradiometer in the range of 350 nm-2450 nm. The experiment took place in the French Cerema PAVIN BPplatform for intelligent vehicles, which makes it possible to reproduce controlled fogs of different density for two types of droplet size distribution. Direct spectroradiometer extinction measurements vary in the same way as the models. Finally, the wavelengths for LiDARs should not be chosen on the basis of fog conditions: there is a small difference (<10%) between the extinction coefficients at 905 nm and 1550 nm for the same emitted power in fog.

ID DESIGN
AB The need of a more persistent human presence on sea is driving the development of increasingly more efficient Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. A particularly promising solution to power these vehicles is the retrieval of energy from the ocean temperature gradient. This paper investigates the use of thermoelectric generators (TEGs) for that purpose, by presenting a complete model of thermoelectric generators embedded in the hull of an underwater glider. The model includes not only the thermoelectric generators but also the heat transfer process and the behaviour of different heat storage materials. Several simulations are performed, for each storage material, to determine the adequate design parameters leading to sufficient energy generation for a thermal glider. It is shown that the use of Phase Change Materials (PCM) as an energy storage material is highly advantageous over the use of sea water or stainless steel. Furthermore, it is shown that this approach, although leading to a high number of TEGs and mass of PCM, is compatible with current existing glider dimensions.

AB The performance of an inverse dynamics guidance and control strategy is experimentally evaluated for the planar maneuver of a "chaser" spacecraft docking with a rotating "target." The experiments were conducted on an airbearing proximity maneuver testbed. The chaser spacecraft simulator consists of a three-degree-of-freedom autonomous vehicle floating via air pads on a granite table and actuated by thrusters. The target consists of a docking interface mounted on a rotational stage with the rotation axis perpendicular to the plane of motion. Given a preassigned trajectory, the guidance and control strategy computes the required maneuver control forces and torque via an inverse dynamics operation. The recorded data of 150 experimental test runs were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance and post hoc Tukey tests. The metrics were maneuver success, vehicle mass change, maneuver duration, thruster duty cycle, and maneuver work. The results showed that the guidance and control algorithm provided robust performance over a range of target rotation rates from 1 to 4 deg /s. The effects of the rate estimation errors are measurable but not dominant.

AB The deployment of Intelligent Vehicles in urban environments requires reliable estimation of positioning for urban navigation. The inherent complexity of this kind of environments fosters the development of novel systems which should provide reliable and precise solutions to the vehicle. This article details an advanced GNSS/IMU fusion system based on a context-aided Unscented Kalman filter for navigation in urban conditions. The constrained non-linear filter is here conditioned by a contextual knowledge module which reasons about sensor quality and driving context in order to adapt it to the situation, while at the same time it carries out a continuous estimation and correction of INS drift errors. An exhaustive analysis has been carried out with available data in order to characterize the behavior of available sensors and take it into account in the developed solution. The performance is then analyzed with an extensive dataset containing representative situations. The proposed solution suits the use of fusion algorithms for deploying Intelligent Transport Systems in urban environments.

ID POTENTIAL FUNCTIONS
AB Hybrid-driven underwater glider (HUG) is a new type of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). An HUG fleet can extend the ability of individual vehicles and increase mission efficiency. This paper presents motion planning and obstacle avoidance of multi-HUG formation using the artificial potential field (APF) method and Kane's method. The artificial potential fields used for formation motion control are constructed for particular mission requirement, ocean environment, and formation geometry. Multi-HUG formation with the artificial potential fields is regarded as a multibody system, in which HUGs are constrained by the virtual forces derived from the artificial potential fields. Kane's method for dynamic analysis of multibody systems is used to study the dynamic characteristics of motion of the multi-HUG formation. Combination of the APF method and Kane's method offers the advantage that coordinated control and motion planning of the formation can be implemented simultaneously. A case of a three-HUG formation is provided to demonstrate the methodology for clarity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mobile units, such as vehicles in a traffic flow or robots in a factory, may use sensors to interact with their environment and a radio to communicate with other autonomous units in the local area. Collaborative decision making can be carried out through information sharing amongst these units and result in cooperative problem solving. Examples of solutions include coordinated vehicle control for collision avoidance and executing complementary path plans for robots on a factory floor. We propose an application-level protocol that enables units to contribute their local knowledge and actions to a shared global view of the problem space. The protocol uses a time-driven token ring architecture to permit any unit to reliably broadcast a message to the entire group. The protocol ensures that all units commit the same set of received messages in the same order by a deadline, and it upholds these guarantees in the presence of channel failures, hidden units, and a changing set of collaborators. Units in the network are made aware of when others fail to maintain the global view. Failing units may be required to operate autonomously, pending information recovery.

ID LIDAR
AB Lidar sensors are widely used for environmental perception on autonomous robot vehicles (ARV). The field of view (FOV) of Lidar sensors can be reshaped by positioning plane mirrors in their vicinity. Mirror setups can especially improve the FOV for ground detection of ARVs with 2D-Lidar sensors. This paper presents an overview of several geometric designs and their strengths for certain vehicle types. Additionally, a new and easy-to-implement calibration procedure for setups of 2D-Lidar sensors with mirrors is presented to determine precise mirror orientations and positions, using a single flat calibration object with a pre-aligned simple fiducial marker. Measurement data from a prototype vehicle with a 2D-Lidar with a 2 m range using this new calibration procedure are presented. We show that the calibrated mirror orientations are accurate to less than 0.6 degrees in this short range, which is a significant improvement over the orientation angles taken directly from the CAD. The accuracy of the point cloud data improved, and no significant decrease in distance noise was introduced. We deduced general guidelines for successful calibration setups using our method. In conclusion, a 2D-Lidar sensor and two plane mirrors calibrated with this method are a cost-effective and accurate way for robot engineers to improve the environmental perception of ARVs.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) due to their rapid deployment and high mobility, which are considered as a promising solution to expand the scope of communication, especially in inaccessible areas. However, there is a lack of a universal and extensible multi-hop collaboration model in the existing research on UAV-involved ITS. In this paper, we innovatively introduce a novel UAV-enabled multi-hop collaborative fog computing (FC) system model, in which several moving UAVs with unpredictable locations provide effective and efficient communication and computation services for ground user equipments (UEs). With this model, we mathematically formulate a joint user association, UAV association, task offloading, transmission power, computation resource allocation, and UAV location optimization problem, which is a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and challenging to deal with. To solve the non-convex problem, we propose a novel multi-hop collaborative algorithm to derive the optimal task offloading and resource allocation decisions for each UAV. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the UAV-enabled multi-hop collaborative FC system and validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB This work is focused on reactive Static Obstacle Avoidance (SOA) methods used to increase the autonomy of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). Currently, there are multiple approaches to avoid obstacles, which can be applied to different types of USV. In order to assist in the choice of the SOA method for a particular vessel and to accelerate the pretuning process necessary for its implementation, this paper proposes a new AutoTuning Environment for Static Obstacle Avoidance (ATESOA) methods applied to USVs. In this environment, a new simplified modelling of a LIDAR (Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging) sensor is proposed based on numerical simulations. This sensor model provides a realistic environment for the tuning of SOA methods that, due to its low load computation, is used by evolutionary algorithms for the autotuning. In order to analyze the proposed ATESOA, three SOA methods were adapted and implemented to consider the measurements given by the LIDAR model. Furthermore, a mathematical model is proposed and evaluated for using as USV in the simulation enviroment. The results obtained in numerical simulations show how the new ATESOA is able to adjust the SOA methods in scenarios with different obstacle distributions.

AB Consensus problems for both leaderless and leader-follower disturbed higher-order multi-agent systems are investigated in this study. Based on the combination of integral sliding-mode control and disturbance observer techniques, composite sliding-mode consensus protocols are proposed for leaderless and leader-follower disturbed multi-agent systems, respectively. First, for the leaderless case, composite sliding-mode consensus protocols are designed to make the agents achieve asymptotic consensus. Second, for the leader-follower case, finite-time composite sliding-mode consensus protocols are presented to make the followers achieve consensus with the leader in finite time. Then based on the consensus algorithms proposed in this study, a consensus control strategy is given to realise the velocity and altitude finite-time consensus for a class of leader-follower multi-hypersonic vehicle systems. Finally, the numerical simulations are conducted to validate the efficiency of the proposed consensus algorithms.

ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE; UAV
AB The ability to avoid collisions with each other is one of the fundamental requirements for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to be safely integrated into the civilian airspace, and for the viability of multi-UAV operations. This paper introduces a new approach for online cooperative collision avoidance between quadcopters, involving reciprocal maneuvers, i.e., coherent maneuvers without requiring any real-time consensus. Two maneuver strategies are presented, where UAVs respectively change their speed or heading to avoid a collision. A learning-based framework that trains these reciprocal actions for collision evasion (called TRACE) is developed. The primary elements of this framework include: 1) designing simulated experiments that cover a variety of UAV-UAV approach scenarios; 2) performing optimization to identify speed/heading change actions that satisfy safety constraints while minimizing the energy cost of the maneuver; and 3) using the offline optimization outcomes to train classifier (via ensemble bagged tree) and function approximation (via neural networks and Kriging) models for respectively selecting and encoding the avoidance actions. Trajectory generation and dynamics/controls are incorporated in the simulation environment used for training and testing. Over 90% accuracy in action prediction and over 95% success in avoiding collisions is observed when the trained models are applied to simulated unseen test scenarios. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The rapid development of intelligent navigation systems has speed development for its uses in military and civilian applications. On-board integrated navigation and multiple sensors are essential for real-time data update. Using multiple sensors may sever from the disconnection of the readings due to sensor(s) transient faults. So, the need for sensor(s) transient fault correction becomes an important action to improve performance. In this study, a novel proposed optimal pseudo sensor enhancement method (OPSEM) is introduced, investigated and implemented. The proposed OPSEM has multiple missions: (i) optimal arrangement for the sensors architecture, (ii) detecting, isolating, and compensating for the sensor(s) transient fault. The simulation results of the traditional and the proposed OPSEMs for multiple sensor architecture have been obtained, analysed and compared. Also, the proposed OPSEM has been applied to the proportional navigation guidance law to check for the improved performance. Finally, the integrated OPSEM navigation system has been realised and implemented. The proposed OPSEM practical system has been examined using unmanned aerial vehicle and fixed wing aircrafts to illustrate the improved operation of the proposed OPSEM system.

AB The rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has made great progress for its widespread uses in military and civilian applications in recent years. On-board integrated navigation sensors are essential for UAV flight control systems in that they must operate with robustness and reliability. To achieve this, timely and effectively anomaly detection capabilities for the estimated UAV status from the integrated navigation sensors are required to ensure the UAV flight safety. Extraction of the anomaly information from the real-time navigation sensors and designing a robust and reliable anomaly detection algorithm are major issues for the UAV navigation sensor anomaly detection. This study introduces a novel integrated algorithm for detecting UAV on-board navigation sensor anomaly, by combining particle filter (PF) estimated state residuals with fuzzy inference system (FIS) decision system. The residual information is obtained based on the difference between the collected Global Positioning System measurements and high accuracy PF estimates. The indicators derived from the PF residuals are further made as inputs for the FIS system to output the different anomaly levels. The simulation and filed test results have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed anomaly detection method in terms of timeliness, recall and precision.

AB The development of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is of high interest to many governmental and military organizations around the world. An essential aspect of UAV autonomy is the ability for automatic path planning. In this paper, we use the genetic algorithm (GA) and the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) to cope with the complexity of the problem and compute feasible and quasi-optimal trajectories for fixed wing UAVs in a complex 3D environment, while considering the dynamic properties of the vehicle. The characteristics of the optimal path are represented in the form of a multiobjective cost function that we developed. The paths produced are composed of line segments, circular arcs and vertical helices. We reduce the execution time of our solutions by using the "single-program, multiple-data" parallel programming paradigm and we achieve real-time performance on standard commercial off-the-shelf multicore CPUs. After achieving a quasi-linear speedup of 7.3 on 8 cores and an execution time of 10 s for both algorithms, we conclude that by using a parallel implementation on standard multicore CPUs, real-time path planning for UAVs is possible. Moreover, our rigorous comparison of the two algorithms shows, with statistical significance, that the GA produces superior trajectories to the PSO.

AB In many fields and even in our daily life, besides the usual feedback controls, it is also very useful for us to control our business by regulating the connections among the subsystems directly. In this paper, the problem of a kind of synergic control among a collection of vehicles performing a shared task using intervehicle communication and internal output feedback are considered, in which the weights of the corresponding edges are considered as the control variables and called connection coefficient gain in this paper. Firstly, when the weights of the corresponding edges are fixed, necessary and sufficient conditions for stability and stabilizability under a special decentralized control strategy are given for the corresponding closed loop network system. Corresponding controllers design methods are proposed via the parameter-dependent Lyapunov function. Especially, two types of networks, star-shaped networks and globally coupled networks, are studied in detail. Secondly, the Nyquist criterion is presented, which uses the eigenvalues of the weights matrix to determine the effects of the connection coefficients regulation on system stability. Thirdly, a general description of this kind of synergic control is proposed via the block diagram of the information flow. Finally, the synergic control among a collection of vehicles with different linear dynamical model is investigated simply.

SO JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS

DT Article
AB To enable autonomous operation of future reusable launch vehicles, reconfiguration technologies will be needed to facilitate mission recovery following a major anomalous event. The Air Force's Integrated Adaptive Guidance and Control program developed such a system for Boeing's X-40A, and the total in-flight simulator research aircraft was employed to flight test the algorithms during approach and landing. The inner loop employs a modelfollowing/dynamic-inversion approach with optimal control allocation to account for control-surface failures. Further, the reference-model bandwidth is reduced if the control authority in any one axis is depleted as a result of control effector saturation. A backstepping approach is utilized for the guidance law, with proportional feedback gains that adapt to changes in the reference model bandwidth. The trajectory-reshaping algorithm is known as the optimum-path-to-go methodology. Here, a trajectory database is precomputed off line to cover all variations under consideration. An efficient representation of this database is then interrogated in flight to rapidly find the "best" reshaped trajectory, based on the current state of the vehicle's control capabilities. The main goal of the flight-test program was to demonstrate the benefits of integrating trajectory reshaping with the essential elements of control reconfiguration and guidance adaptation. The results indicate that for more severe, multiple control failures, control reconfiguration, guidance adaptation, and trajectory reshaping are all needed to recover the mission.

AB A novel approach of joint gravity and gravity gradient inversion is presented for passive subsurface object detection in this letter. Gravity and gravity gradient anomalies induced by an object can be measured and inversed to estimate the mass, orientation, and distance of the object. The new equations of gravity inversion are explored, and the weighted least squares estimation is constructed. Therefore, the two kinds of data are complementary to each other in the joint inversion via the self-adaptive weights. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is more efficient and robust than the previous gravity gradient tensor inversion.

The presented verification methodology is equally applicable for avionics applications (such as TCAS), train applications (such as ETCS), or automotive applications (such as platooning). We present a verification rule explicating the essence of employed design patters, guaranteeing global safety properties of the kind "a collision will never occur", and whose premises can either be established by off-line analysis of the worst-case behavior of the involved traffic agents, or by purely local proofs, involving only a single traffic agent. In a companion paper we will show, how such local proof obligations can be discharged automatically.

Based on the concept of geometric path-tracking, a controller is designed that is a memoryless function of the lateral, heading, and velocity path-tracking offsets.

AB State estimation is critical for achieving autonomous navigation of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). We present a fast and robust monocular visual-inertial odometry (VIO) algorithm, which achieves real-time pose estimation for UAV. A semidirect method for tracking is used in the front end to address the problem of the slow running speed of traditional VIO on onboard computing platforms, which preserves the fast performance of direct methods and the robustness of feature-based methods. Edgelet features are added to the Shi-Tomasi feature extraction to enhance the robustness of VIO in low-texture environments. Furthermore, a quadtree-based feature extraction algorithm is employed to filter features, which effectively addresses the issue of feature accumulation. In the back end of the VIO system, a sliding-window-based nonlinear optimization method is used to fuse image and inertial information. We evaluate our approach on the public European robotics challenges micro aerial vehicle (EuRoC MAV) dataset and compare it with the state-of-the-art VIO algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed VIO system is capable of operating in challenging scenarios with fast motion, image blur, and weak texture features. Moreover, our proposed VIO system achieves comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art VIO algorithms while improving tracking speed by 54.28% compared to VINS-Mono.

AB This article addresses the cooperative multiunmanned aerial vehicles task assignment problem (CMTAP) with temporally coupled constraints and aims to find a feasible assignment to minimize the equivalent distances of all tasks. We first present a mixed-integer linear programming model of CMTAP. To solve the undesirable deadlocks of CMTAP, a Petri net amender is constructed based on a candidate solution, and a deadlock-free solution is equivalent to a feasible transition sequence that can be fired sequentially in the corresponding amender. With this amender, we present a Petri net-based deadlock amending method (PDAM) with polynomial time complexity to convert a deadlocked solution into a deadlock-free solution. Also, a deadlock-free hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm (DHEDA) is developed for CMTAP by embedding PDAM into the original EDA. To further improve the solution quality, we establish a local exploitation method, and an adaptive operational probability is used to balance the computational burden and local exploitation ability. Then, a match-up-based reassignment method is proposed to cope with time-sensitive targets. Finally, extensive computational experiments demonstrate that PDAM is more effective at solving deadlocks than graph-based methods, particularly for large-scale CMTAP, and DHEDA outperforms existing algorithms when solving CMTAP.

AB The underwater glider is one of the most promising autonomous underwater vehicles for long-term ocean observations, whose battery capacity and energy consumption are directly affected by compressibility and buoyancy factor of its pressure hull. Thus, to further increase compressibility and decrease buoyancy factor of underwater vehicles, this study proposes a cylindrical hull with non-uniform arch ribs by analyzing design and test results of the existing hulls used in the Petrel-L glider, China. Considering complexity of the proposed cylindrical hull, the approximate model of mass and other output responses of hull is established based on a parametric model by response surface method, which is used to optimize design variables and thus obtain an optimal cylindrical hull. Additionally, the performance of the optimal hull is verified by finite element method and pressure tests. Compared with a conventional cylindrical hull, the deformation of optimal hull is increased by 38.79%, which can indirectly reduce the energy consumption of the buoyancy drive unit and improve endurance of the Petrel-L glider. Meanwhile, the mass of the optimal hull is decreased by 21.57%, which allows more battery or sensor load under the same pressure. Furthermore, the proposed hull can apply to other underwater vehicles.

DE road transport; efficiency; CO2 emissions
ID ENERGY; CONSUMPTION
AB 'Business as usual' scenarios in long-term energy forecasts are crucial for scenario-based policy analyses. This article focuses on fuel economy of passenger cars and light trucks, a long-disputed issue with serious implications for worldwide energy use and CO2 emissions. The current status in Europe is explained and future developments are analysed with the aid of historical data of the last three decades from the United States and Europe. As a result of this analysis, fuel economy values are proposed for use as assumptions in baseline energy/transport scenarios in the 15 'old' European Union Member States. Proposed values are given for new gasoline and diesel cars and for the years 2010, 2020 and 2030. The increasing discrepancy between vehicle fuel consumption measured under test conditions and that in the real world is also considered. One main conclusion is that the European Commission's voluntary agreement with the automobile industry should not be assumed to fully achieve its target under baseline conditions, nor should it be regarded as a major stimulus for autonomous vehicle efficiency improvements after 2010. A second conclusion is that three very recent studies enjoying authority across the EU tend to be overly optimistic as regards the technical progress for conventional and alternative vehicle propulsion technologies under 'business as usual' conditions.

ID COORDINATION
AB Electric vehicles (EVs) are the backbone of the future intelligent transportation system (ITS). They are environmentally friendly and can also be integrated as distributed energy resources (DERs) into the smart grid using vehicle-to-grid (V2G) scheme. Specifically, utility companies can push back EV batteries into the electric grid to reduce the peak load. However, integrating EVs into the power grid efficiently requires accurate artificial intelligence (AI) mechanisms to forecast, coordinate, and dispatch the EVs into the grid. This paper proposes a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) mechanism that schedules the day-ahead discharging process of EV batteries to optimize the peak shaving performance of the electric grid. The proposed MARL overcomes the inaccuracy of energy prediction by allowing the agents, i.e. EVs, to make autonomous decisions. These agents are trained in a centralized fashion but make decisions locally to maintain autonomy and privacy. In particular, the model does not require that the EVs communicate with a centralized entity during the execution stage, which assures the model's integrity and protects the EVs' private information. To evaluate the model, a comprehensive series of experiments were carried out to prove the effectiveness of the MARL coordination and scheduling mechanism and to show that the model can indeed flatten the peak load.

ID NETWORK
AB Trajectory prediction plays a key role in the decision-making system of autonomous vehicles. The existing trajectory prediction models have the problem of accuracy deterioration when driving behavior change. To solve this problem, a novel BRAM-ED trajectory prediction framework is proposed, which mainly consists of driving behavior recognition model, behavior attention mechanism (BAM) trajectory encoder, and behavior adaptive future trajectory decoder. First, a Bi-GLSTM network is designed to recognize real-time driving behavior. The graph structure is used to describe the complex dependencies among vehicles and recurrent cell is to capture temporal correlation. Subsequently, in contrast to traditional models, directly concatenate historical trajectories and interactive information as the input of prediction model, BAM is proposed to integrated trajectory and interaction features in this article. The BAM is designed to generate attention weights according to the change of driving behavior, and guide trajectory decoder to predict the future trajectories. Then, the proposed model is trained and validated on various public datasets, including HighD and NGSIM. Compared with existing optimal models, our prediction error has been reduced 44.66% at most. Furthermore, a typical cut-in scenario is designed based on hardware-in-loop platform. The experiment results show that the proposed model could recognize the change of driving behavior timely, and predict accurate trajectory.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) extend the traditional ground-based Internet of Things (IoT) into the air. UAV mobile edge computing (MEC) architectures have been proposed by integrating UAVs into MEC networks during the current novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) era. UAV mobile edge computing (MEC) shares personal data with external parties (such as edge servers) during intelligent medical analytics. However, this technique raises privacy concerns about patients' health data. More recently, the concept of federal learning (FL) has been set up to protect mobile user data privacy. Compared to traditional machine learning, federated learning requires a decentralized distribution system to enhance trust for UAVs. Blockchain technology provides a secure and reliable solution for FL settings between multiple untrusted parties with anonymous, immutable, and distributed features. Therefore, blockchain-enabled FL provides both theories and techniques to improve the performance of intelligent UAV edge computing networks from various perspectives. This survey begins by discussing the current state of research on blockchain and FL. Then, compare the leading technologies and limitations. Second, we will discuss how to integrate blockchain and FL into UAV edge computing networks and the associated challenges and solutions. Finally, we discuss the fundamental research challenges and future directions.

AB This paper presents a novel adaptive neural event-triggered formation control strategy for underactuated surface vehicles (USVs) in the presence of marine practical constraints, i.e. the waypoints-based planned path and actuator failures. The proposed strategy is composed of the guidance model and the control one. For the guidance part, the logic virtual ship (LVS) guidance principle is developed to implement the reference path programming for the formation pattern. For merit of the adaptive virtual ship, the smooth reference can be produced for followers without using the velocity information of leader. Furthermore, the proposed adaptive neural fault-tolerant control algorithm is to guarantee that the followers can maintain their pattern and converge to the corresponding reference path. In the algorithm, the neural networks (NNs)-based observer is designed to estimate the unmeasurable velocities of followers online. With the input event-triggered mechanism, two adaptive parameters are derived to compensate for the gain uncertainty and actuator failure. And that could effectively reduce the communication burden for the channel from controller to actuator. The derived closed-loop system has been proved to be with the semi-global uniform ultimate bounded (SGUUB) stability. Finally, the superiority of the proposed strategy can be verified by the simulation experiments.

AB For automated vehicles (AVs) to navigate safely, they must be able to anticipate and predict the behavior of pedestrians. This is particularly critical in urban driving environments where risks of collisions are high. However, a major challenge is that pedestrian behavior is inherently multimodal in nature, i.e., pedestrians can plausibly take multiple paths. This is because, in large part, pedestrian behaviors are driven by unique intentions and decisions made by each pedestrian walking along a particular sidewalk or crosswalk. As described in this paper, we developed a hybrid automaton model of multimodal pedestrian behavior called Multimodal Hybrid Pedestrian (MHP). We account for multimodal pedestrian behavior by identifying pedestrian decision-making points and developing decision-making models to predict pedestrian behaviors in a probabilistic hybrid automaton framework. The resulting MHP model is more likely to predict the ground truth trajectory compared to two baseline models-a baseline hybrid automaton model and a constant velocity model. The MHP model is applicable to a wide variety of urban scenarios-midblocks, intersections, one-way, and two-way streets, etc., and the probabilistic predictions from the model can be utilized for AV motion planning.

Selected gaze metrics are used as objective metrics to minimize prejudice, which is commonly caused by subjective measures. Experiments are carried out using crane simulator to measure glance behavior of novice operators and the 3D perspective projection method is used for autonomous mapping of gaze fixations to dynamic Area-of-Interests (AOIs). Subjective responses, such as operators' emotion and usability of IVVS, are evaluated using the Likert scale of the Semantic Differential method. Correlation between gaze metrics and subjective responses is established using multiple linear regression. Glance behavior exhibits a statistically significant difference when information on IVVS is perceived as useful to ease operation and reduce tension. Despite this, there are no significant signs of distraction. Glance behavior is found to be a reliable sub-conscious indicator of subjective response and distraction. More importantly, the proposed gaze metrics are found to be a good representation of glance behavior, such as randomness and distribution of attention. The methods and findings are useful to evaluate impact of IVVS, which is becoming more common in many other applications.

AB The aim of this study is to present a tool that can calculate critical performance measures of different Shuttle-Based Storage and Retrieval System (SBS/RS) designs. Specifically, our aim is to develop an analytical model-based tool that can estimate the mean and variance of travel time of lifts and shuttles, as well as the mean amount of energy consumption and energy regeneration per transaction for a pre-defined SBS/RS design. The methodology illustrated in this paper can also be utilized for any system having a straight discrete travel pattern with equal distance stop points. We are motivated in this study by a relatively new automated storage and retrieval technology, SBS/RS. By the provided tool, one can evaluate these systems' performance promptly by changing the input design parameters (e.g., discrete travel lengths, velocity of vehicles, acceleration/deceleration of vehicles, number of tiers, number of bays, etc.) of these systems. The analytical models used in the tool are verified via simulation for several SBS/RS design scenarios. As a result, it is found that the proposed tool produces highly accurate results, specifically less than 1% Absolute Percentage Error from the simulation results. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB This article presents a robust stabilizing control for nonholonomic underwater systems that are affected by uncertainties. The methodology is based on adaptive integral sliding mode control. Firstly, the original underwater system is transformed in a way that the new system has uncertainties in matched form. A change of coordinates is carried out for this purpose, and the nonholonomic system is transformed into chained form system with matched uncertainties. Secondly, the chained form system with uncertainties is transformed into a special structure containing nominal part and some unknown terms through input transformation. The unknown terms are computed adaptively. Afterward, the transformed system is stabilized using integral sliding mode control. The stabilizing controller for the transformed system is constructed which consists of the nominal control plus some compensator control. The compensator controller and the adaptive laws are derived in a way that the derivative of a suitable Lyapunov function becomes strictly negative. Two different cases of perturbation are considered including the bounded uncertainty present in any single control input and the uncertainties present in the overall system model of the underwater vehicle. Finally, simulation results show the validity and correctness of the proposed controllers for both cases of nonholonomic underwater system affected by uncertainties.

AB In this paper, a novel barrier function-based super-twisting integral terminal sliding mode control algorithm is proposed for a quad-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The approach of employing an integral terminal sliding mode control strategy is adopted to achieve an equivalent control, while the switching control law is designed using the super-twisting algorithm. The barrier function is introduced as the gain of switching control law. The integral terminal sliding mode approach guarantees that the system's initial state lies on the sliding mode surface, while also enhancing the convergence rate of the system state through exponential acceleration. Super-twisting algorithm is introduced to reduce the sliding mode chattering. The barrier function can guarantee the convergence of output variables and induce a decrease in gain proportionate to the output variables. Finally, the numerical simulation results demonstrate the efficacy and exceptional performance of the proposed schemes.

AB In the context of the potential future use of unmanned ground vehicles for forest inventories, we present the first experiences with SPOT, a legged robot equipped with a LiDAR instrument and several cameras that have been used with a teleoperation approach for single-tree detection and measurements. This first test was carried out using the default LiDAR system (the so-called enhanced autonomy payload-EAP, installed on the board of SPOT to guide autonomous movements) to understand advantages and limitations of this platform to support forest inventory activities. The test was carried out in the Vallombrosa forest (Italy) by assessing different data acquisition methods. The first results showed that EAP LiDAR generated noisy point clouds where only large trees (DBH >= 20 cm) could be identified. The results showed that the accuracy in tree identification and DBH measurements were strongly influenced by the path used for data acquisition, with average errors in tree positioning no less than 1.9 m. Despite this, the best methods allowed the correct identification of 97% of large trees.

AB Functional control is key for any autonomous robot, linking high-level artificial intelligence with the robot actuators. Due to environmental disturbances, model uncertainties and nonlinear dynamic systems, reliable functional control is essential and improvements in the controller design can significantly benefit the overall vehicle performance. Even though there are many published studies considering the design of various advanced controllers, most of them are not evaluated in physical experiments. In this research, four different control strategies have been investigated: Proportional-Integral-Derivative Control (PID), Sliding Mode Control (SMC), Backstepping Control (BC) and Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC). The performances of these four controllers were simulated initially and evaluated by practical experiments in different conditions, including various environmental disturbances and hydrodynamic coefficients. The main contributions are as follows: Firstly, this paper reports a comparison study between different types of controllers based on simulations and physical experiments in various conditions; Secondly, this paper provides an improved SMC algorithm combining the merits from linear control and nonlinear control, and a customized second-order FLC method.

AB Although topographic mapping missions and geological surveys carried out by Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are becoming increasingly prevalent, the lack of precise navigation in these scenarios still limits their application. This paper deals with the problems of long-term underwater navigation for AUVs and provides new mapping techniques by developing a Bathymetric Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping (BSLAM) method based on graph SLAM technology. To considerably reduce the calculation cost, the trajectory of the AUV is divided into various submaps based on Differences of Normals (DoN). Loop closures between submaps are obtained by terrain matching; meanwhile, maximum likelihood terrain estimation is also introduced to build weak data association within the submap. Assisted by one weight voting method for loop closures, the global and local trajectory corrections work together to provide an accurate navigation solution for AUVs with weak data association and inaccurate loop closures. The viability, accuracy and real-time performance of the proposed algorithm are verified with data collected onboard, including an 8 km planned track recorded at a speed of 4 knots in Qingdao, China.

AB QUICKWAY is an integral concept of mobility for people and minor goods in large cities. This concept is based on creating additional traffic area which is used by various driverless vehicles that are controlled by a central electronic controlling system. The controller uses information about the current position as well as the desired destination of all QUICKWAY users at the same time and calculates the fastest routes with minimized stops, thus increasing the traffic capacity by more than thousand percent. This paper treats the general concept of the traffic system QUICKWAY on the one hand and focuses on the construction details of the necessary elevated roadways (QUICKWAYs) on the other hand. The structure is made of Ultra High Performance Concrete and follows the principles of the segmental method of construction with dry joints. The progress of construction is intended to be 500 m per week and construction site. Finally, the on-going activities aiming at the preparation of prospective realization are briefly presented.

AB An approach of rapidly computing the projective width of lanes is presented to predict the projective positions and widths of lanes. The Lane Marking Extraction Finite State Machine is designed to extract points with features of lane markings in the image, and a cubic B-spline is adopted to conduct curve fitting to reconstruct road geometry. A statistical search algorithm is also proposed to correctly and adaptively determine thresholds under various kinds of illumination conditions. Furthermore, the parameters of the camera in a moving car may change with (be vibration, so a dynamic calibration algorithm is applied to calibrate camera parameters and lane widths with the information of lane projection. Moreover, a fuzzy logic is applied to determine the situation of occlusion. Finally, a region-of-interest determination strategy is developed to reduce the search region and to make the detection more robust with respect to the occlusion on the lane markings or complicated changes of curves and road boundaries.

AB The mobility sensors on a typical mobile robot vehicle have limited range. Therefore a navigation system has no knowledge about the world beyond this sensing horizon. As a result, path planners that rely only on this knowledge to compute paths are unable to anticipate obstacles sufficiently early and have no choice but to resort to an inefficient local obstacle avoidance behavior.
   To alleviate this problem, we present an opportunistic navigation and view planning strategy that incorporates look-ahead sensing of possible obstacle configurations. This planning strategy is based on a "what-if" analysis of hypothetical future configurations of the environment. Candidate sensing positions are evaluated based on their ability to observe anticipated obstacles. These sensing positions identified by this forward-simulation framework are used by the planner as intermediate waypoints. The validity of the strategy is supported by results from simulations as well as field experiments with a real robotic platform. These results show that significant reduction in path length can be achieved by using this framework.

AB In the past mobile robot research was often focused to various kinds of point-to-point transportation tasks. Service tasks, such as floor cleaning, require specific approaches for path planning and vehicle guidance in real indoor environments. This article discusses automatic planning of a feasible cleaning path considering a 2D-map as well as kinematic and geometric robot models. Path construction makes use of two typical motion patterns. Each pattern is defined by a sequence of subgoals indicating robot position and orientation. Results of automatic path planning are illustrated by realistic examples of typical robots and cleaning environments. Vehicle guidance includes initialization of robot location, path execution, accurate path tracking and detection of unexpected environmental changes. Path tracking is achieved by subgoal modification during cleaning motion using data from the dead-reckoning and landmark localization systems. If obstacles permanently block the preplanned path, an automatic map update and path replanning is performed. Experimental results with the mobile robot MACROBE confirm the feasibility of the developed planning and guidance system.

AB The presence of automation and information technology in agricultural environments seems no longer questionable; smart spraying, variable rate fertilizing, or automatic guidance are becoming usual management tools in modern farms. Yet, such techniques are still in their nascence and offer a lively hotbed for innovation. In particular, significant research efforts are being directed toward vehicle navigation and awareness in off-road environments. However, the majority of solutions being developed are based on occupancy grids referenced with odometry and dead-reckoning, or alternatively based on GPS waypoint following, but never based on both. Yet, navigation in off-road environments highly benefits from both approaches: perception data effectively condensed in regular grids, and global references for every cell of the grid. This research proposes a framework to build globally referenced navigation grids by combining three-dimensional stereo vision with satellite-based global positioning. The construction process entails the in-field recording of perceptual information plus the geodetic coordinates of the vehicle at every image acquisition position, in addition to other basic data as velocity, heading, or GPS quality indices. The creation of local grids occurs in real time right after the stereo images have been captured by the vehicle in the field, but the final assembly of universal grids takes place after finishing the acquisition phase. Vehicle-fixed individual grids are then superposed onto the global grid, transferring original perception data to universal cells expressed in Local Tangent Plane coordinates. Global referencing allows the discontinuous appendage of data to succeed in the completion and updating of navigation grids along the time over multiple mapping sessions. This methodology was validated in a commercial vineyard, where several universal grids of the crops were generated. Vine rows were correctly reconstructed, although some difficulties appeared around the headland turns as a consequence of unreliable heading estimations. Navigation information conveyed through globally referenced regular grids turned out to be a powerful tool for upcoming practical implementations within agricultural robotics. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper investigates the finite-time adaptive dynamic positioning (DP) control problem of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) with prescribed performance subject to time-varying disturbances, unknown model parameters and input saturation. First, the error transformation is performed to provide a framework for the design of model-free prescribed performance DP controller, which eliminates the need for accurate prior information of the model and external disturbances. Then, a saturated-command-deviation based compensated law is proposed by incorporating the fuzzy supervisory approach to account for the excess control efforts resulted by input saturation. Subsequently, the fuzzy logic systems (FLS) integrated with minimum learning parameters technique are employed to approximate the model-based and high-order terms, such that the explosion of computational complexity is removed and requirements for accurate modeling are eliminated. Meanwhile, to suppress the negative effects induced by time-varying disturbances and unknown approximation errors, the adaptive technique is adopted to estimate the upper boundary of compounded disturbances online. Finally, by incorporating the softening sign signal and piecewise function into recursive backstepping procedure, a DP controller is developed to avoid potential singularity and achieve finite time convergence. Theoretical analysis and simulation results successfully illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB Truck platooning has gained increasing attention due to the benefits in energy and operation efficiency in freight transportation. One significant challenge for deploying truck platoons is the safe and efficient interaction with surrounding traffic, especially at freeway discontinuities where mandatory lane changes usually lead to the decoupling of truck platoons. This study proposes a cooperative truck platoon lane-changing model (CTPLC) to prevent the decoupling of truck platoons in a mixed traffic environment. Specifically, a two-step control strategy is presented, where vehicles in the target lane firstly cooperatively adjust speeds to create an appropriate gap for a truck platoon, and then trucks within the truck platoon conduct lane change sequentially. The cooperative speed profiles are generated by solving an optimization problem considering the lane-changing influence and energy consumption. Based on that, a two-dimensional nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is employed to generate vehicular acceleration and steering angle for each truck. A series of numerical simulation experiments were conducted to validate the proposed strategy. As shown by the results, our proposed method truck platoon could conduct a lane change in a traffic-efficient and safe manner, and meanwhile, our method was more energy-efficient than a benchmark strategy.

AB To integrate automated vehicles (AVs) into our transportation network, we should consider how human road users will interact with them. Human aggression toward AVs could be a new risk in mixed traffic and reduce AV adoption. Is it OK to drive aggressively toward AVs? We examined how identical aggressive behavior toward an AV or human driver is appraised differently by observers. In our 2 (scenario type: human driver vs. AV) x 2 (victim identity salience: low vs. high) between-subjects survey, we randomly allocated participants (N = 956) to one of four conditions where they viewed a video clip from an AV or a human driver showing a car suddenly braking continuously ahead of the AV or human driver's car. The salience of victim identity influenced the observers' appraisals of aggressive behavior. When asked to judge the front car's behavior toward this AV or human driver (the victim identity is salient), they reported more acceptability and less risk perception, negative affect, and immoral judgment while judging this behavior toward the AV. When asked to judge the front car's behavior (the victim identity not highlighted), they reported non-different appraisals. This finding implies that AVs might need to hide their identity to blend in visually and behaviorally as regular cars.

AB Advanced energy management strategies (EMS) are used to control the power flow through a vehicle's powertrain. However, the cost of high-power computational hardware and lack of a priori knowledge of future road conditions poses difficult challenges for engineers attempting to implement globally optimal frameworks. One solution is to use advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and connectivity to obtain a prediction of future road conditions. This paper presents a look-ahead predictive EMS which combines approximate dynamic programming (ADP) methods and an adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (A-ECMS) to obtain a near-optimal solution for a future prediction horizon. ECMS is highly sensitive to the equivalence factor (EF), making it necessary to adapt during a trip to account for disturbances. A novel adaptation method is presented in this work which uses an artificial neural network to learn the nonlinear relationship between a speed and the state of charge (SOC) trajectory prediction obtained from ADP to estimate the corresponding EF. A traffic uncertainty analysis demonstrates an approximately 10% fuel economy (FE) improvement over traditional A-ECMS. Using a data-driven adaptation method for A-ECMS informed by a dynamic programming (DP) based prediction results in an EMS capable of online implementation.

AB An underwater vehicle is useful in the monitoring of the unstructured and dangerous underwater conditions. One of the unmanned underwater vehicle is AUV. AUV is a robotic device that is driven through the water by a propulsion system, controlled and piloted by an onboard computer, and maneuverable in three dimensions. This research explains about position estimation of AUV based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) and the Fuzzy Kalman Filter (FKF). EnKF is used as the estimation method of AUV's position that maneuvering in 6 DOF (Degrees of Freedom) with the specified trajectory. The estimation results are simulated with Matlab. The simulations show the AUV position estimation based on the EnKF with some of the different ensembles and the comparison results of the position estimation between the EnKF and the FKF. The final result of these study shows that Ensemble Kalman Filter is better to estimate the trajectory of the dynamical equation of AUV motion with the error estimation of EnKF is 92% smaller in the x-position dan y-position, 6.5% smaller in the z-position, 93% smaller in the angle dan the computation of time is 50% faster than the estimation results of FKF.

AB Surface waves play an important role in the ocean-atmosphere coupled climate system by mediating the exchange of momentum, heat, and gas between the atmosphere and the ocean. Pseudo-Lagrangian autonomous platforms (e.g., Boeing Liquid Robotics Wave Gliders) have been used to investigate the underlying physical dynamics involved in these processes to better parameterize the air-sea exchange occurring at the scale of the surface waves. This requires accurate measurements of directional surface waves down to short scales [O(1) m], as these shorter waves support most of the stress between the atmosphere and the ocean. A challenge to overcome for pseudo-Lagrangian autonomous vehicles is that the platform's velocity causes the observed frequency of the waves to be Doppler shifted. This leads to a modulation of the wave spectrum, particularly at high frequencies, that depends on the platform's speed, the wave frequency, and the relative angle between the direction of wave and platform propagation. In this work, we propose a method to account for Doppler effects that considers the full directionality of the wave field. The method is validated using a unique dataset collected from a fleet of two Wave Gliders off the coast of Southern California in September 2019 operating on the perimeter of a tight square (500-m edge length) track over a 3-day deployment. This technique can be used to estimate wave spectra derived from other slow-moving surface vehicles such as Saildrones that use platform motion to characterize the surface wave field. MATLAB routines to implement this method are publicly available.

AB Self-driving technology may lead to a paradigm shift for the transport industry with shared cars available to every-one. However, this vision has increasingly been challenged as too optimistic and unsubstantiated. In this study we explore societal impacts of using this technology for both cars and public transport and investigate differences depending on geography and trip purpose. Four scenarios were designed through workshops with 130 transport experts, modelled using a conventional four-step model for Stockholm, Sweden and evaluated in terms of changes to mode choice, number of trips and person kilometres.We find larger increases for non-commuting trips, i.e. service and leisure trips, than for commuting trips, questioning the view of the 'productive work trip' as self-driving technology's main impact on society. As these trips are primarily made outside of rush hours, this may lead to a changed transport system. Geographic differences are substantial and heavily dependent on the cost model for car alternatives, even indicating a reduction in car travel in rural areas if private ownership would be replaced by shared cars. Furthermore, walking and cycling levels decreased in all scenarios while enhancing public transport using self-driving technology had a limited impact on ridership.These results show that the impacts of self-driving technology may have varied societal impacts even within a region and may lead to increased car travel, especially off-peak. These conclusions stress the need for policies that are sensitive to both geography and time.

AB Autonomous vehicles in intelligent transportation systems must be able to perform reliable and safe navigation. This necessitates accurate object detection, which is commonly achieved by high-precision depth perception. Existing stereo vision-based depth estimation systems generally involve computation of pixel correspondences and estimation of disparities between rectified image pairs. The estimated disparity values will be converted into depth values in downstream applications. As most applications often work in the depth domain, the accuracy of depth estimation is often more compelling than disparity estimation. However, at large distances (>50m), the accuracy of disparity estimation does not directly translate to the accuracy of depth estimation. In the context of learning-based stereo systems, this is mainly due to biases imposed by the choices of the disparity-based loss function and the training data. Consequently, the learning algorithms often produce unreliable depth estimates of under-represented foreground objects, particularly at large distances. To resolve this issue, we first analyze the effect of those biases and then propose a pair of depth-based loss functions for foreground objects and background separately. These loss functions can be tuned and can balance the inherent bias of the stereo learning algorithms. The efficacy of our solution is demonstrated by an extensive set of experiments, which are benchmarked against state of the art. We show on the KITTI 2015 benchmark that our proposed solution yields substantial improvements in disparity and depth estimation, particularly for objects located at distances beyond 50 meters, outperforming the previous state of the art by 10%.

TI Learning from animals: How to Navigate Complex Terrains
SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY

DT Article
AB We develop a method to learn a bio-inspired motion control policy using data collected from hawkmoths navigating in a virtual forest. A Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework is introduced to model the dynamics of moths and sparse logistic regression is used to learn control policy parameters from the data. The results show that moths do not favor detailed obstacle location information in navigation, but rely heavily on optical flow. Using the policy learned from the moth data as a starting point, we propose an actor-critic learning algorithm to refine policy parameters and obtain a policy that can be used by an autonomous aerial vehicle operating in a cluttered environment. Compared with the moths' policy, the policy we obtain integrates both obstacle location and optical flow. We compare the performance of these two policies in terms of their ability to navigate in artificial forest areas. While the optimized policy can adjust its parameters to outperform the moth's policy in each different terrain, the moth's policy exhibits a high level of robustness across terrains.
   Author summary Many animals exhibit a remarkable ability to navigate in complex forest terrains. Can we learn their navigation strategy from observed flying trajectories? Further, can we refine these strategies to design UAV/drone navigation policies in dense cluttered terrains? To that end, we propose a method to analyze data from hawkmoth flight trajectories in a closed-loop virtual forest and extract the navigation control policy. We find that moths rely heavily on optical flow rather than detailed information on the location of obstacles around them. We also develop a method to refine the hawkmoth control policy to be used by autonomous aerial vehicles in a cluttered environment. We find that integrating both obstacle location information and optical flow improves navigation performance.

AB Predicting the multimodal future motions of neighboring agents is essential for an autonomous vehicle to navigate complex scenarios. It is challenging as the motion of an agent is affected by the complex interaction among itself, other agents, and the local roads. Unlike most existing works, which predict a fixed number of possible future motions of an agent, we propose a map-adaptive predictor that can predict a variable number of future trajectories of an agent according to the number of lanes with candidate centerlines (CCLs). The predictor predicts not only future motions guided by single CCLs but also a scene-reasoning prediction and a motion-maintaining prediction. These three kinds of predictions are produced integrally via a single graph operation. We represent the driving scene with a heterogeneous hierarchical graph containing nodes of two types. An agent node contains its dynamics feature encoded from its historical states, and a CCL node contains the CCL's sequential feature. We propose a hierarchical graph operator (HGO) with an edge-masking technology to regulate the information flow in graph operations and obtain the encoded scene feature for the trajectory decoder. Experiments on two large-scale real-world driving datasets show that our method realizes map-adaptive prediction and outperforms strong baselines.

AB This work analyzes gendered processes by a methodology based on clustering factors with influence in the decision-making process of women as users or employees of the transport system. Considering gender as a social construction which changes over time and space, this study is based on the concept of a woman as a person who adopts this role in society. This paper performs a deep analysis of those factors women consider as needs and barriers to use or work in the transport system in four scenarios: railway public transport infrastructures, automated vehicles, bicycle sharing, and jobholders. A literature review and focus group discussions were performed under the consideration that the definition of woman includes the addition of several personal characteristics (age, sexual orientation, family responsibilities, and culture). The data analysis allowed the identification of fairness characteristics (FCs) that affect the interaction of women with the transport system for each scenario. A methodology for clustering the fairness characteristics identified the main areas of action to improve the inclusion of women within each use case. Further studies will be focused on the quantification and prioritization of the FCs through mathematical methods and the suggestion of inclusive measures by an interdisciplinary panel.

AB The lack of attention during the driving task is considered as a major risk factor for fatal road accidents around the world. Despite the ever-growing trend for autonomous driving which promises to bring greater road-safety benefits, the fact is today's vehicles still only feature partial and conditional automation, demanding frequent driver action. Moreover, the monotony of such a scenario may induce fatigue or distraction, reducing driver awareness and impairing the regain of the vehicle's control. To address this challenge, we introduce a non-intrusive system to monitor the driver in terms of fatigue, distraction, and activity. The proposed system explores state-of-the-art sensors, as well as machine learning algorithms for data extraction and modeling. In the domain of fatigue supervision, we propose a feature set that considers the vehicle's automation level. In terms of distraction assessment, the contributions concern (i) a holistic system that covers the full range of driver distraction types and (ii) a monitoring unit that predicts the driver activity causing the faulty behavior. By comparing the performance of Support Vector Machines against Decision Trees, conducted experiments indicated that our system can predict the driver's state with an accuracy ranging from 89% to 93%.

AB Advanced control methodologies have helped the development of modern vehicles that are capable of path planning and path following. For instance, Model Predictive Control (MPC) employs a predictive model to predict the behavior of the physical system for a specific time horizon in the future. An optimization problem is solved to compute optimal control actions while handling model uncertainties and nonlinearities. However, these prediction routines are computationally intensive and the computational overhead grows with the complexity of the model. Switching MPC addresses this issue by combining multiple predictive models, each with a different precision granularity. In this artcle, we proposed a novel switching predictive control method based on a model reduction scheme to achieve various model granularities for path following in autonomous vehicles. A state-based model with tunable parameters is proposed to operate as a reconfigurable predictive model of the vehicle. A runtime switching algorithm is presented that selects the best model using machine learning. We employed a metric that formulates the tradeoff between the error and computational savings due to model reduction. Our simulation results show that the use of the predictive model in the switching scheme as opposed to single granularity scheme, yields a 45% decrease in execution time in tradeoff for a small 12% loss in accuracy in prediction of future outputs and no loss of accuracy in tracking the reference trajectory.

AB The Cucker-Smale flocking model is designed to analyze the velocity and position-control mechanisms in a group of living individuals, such as a flock of birds. In this model, each agent (a bird or fish) adjusts its velocity according to its own velocity and the weighted mean of the relative velocities of the other members of the flock. We herein focus on the simple, distributed, and autonomous nature of the flocking model and apply its operating principles to fair resource allocation for vehicle-mounted mobile relays (VMRs) by considering their need for distributed fair resource allocation in various network topologies. By adaptively adjusting the VMR transmission power, the proposed method effectively alleviates the interference between users in vehicles and users directly connected to the base station. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method in the context of the IEEE 802.16j based system. The achievable bandwidth performance of the proposed method is evaluated relative to that of both the fixed power allocation (FPA) method and the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR)-based transmit power control method. The result shows that the proposed method adjusts to various network topologies and provides better achievable bandwidth than both the SINR-based method and the FPA method.

AB Clapping-wing micro air vehicles (CWMAVs) face many control problems due to their lightweight design and susceptibility to disturbances. This study proposes a radial basis function (RBF) model-based adaptive model predictive control (AMPC) for trajectory tracking to solve the control problem in the presence of internal uncertainties and external disturbances. First, a method for calculating the desired attitude is given. Second, a control optimization model is used by adjusting future control inputs to minimize the difference between the future and desired outputs. Third, a nonlinear predictive linearization is used to transform the nonlinear optimization model into a quadratic programming problem. Two observers are introduced to estimate the internal uncertainties and the external disturbances. Finally, the control assignment method is combined with the trajectory tracking method to obtain the design variables of actuators (flapping frequency, pitch angle, and yaw angle). Validation studies were performed to verify the effectiveness and accuracy in the presence of constant and time-dependent disturbances. The comparison of RAMPC with classical methods shows that RAMPC has better control performance with smaller errors. The proposed RAMPC framework can be well used for CWMAV control and provides an excellent basis for accurate navigation and autonomous obstacle avoidance.

AB This paper presents a hybrid unmanned aerial vehicle configuration, the quad tilt rotor (QTR), which combines both the tandem wing configuration and the quadrotor configuration using a tilt mechanism. The paper focuses on the vehicle configuration, transition control scheme and modified proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control. The effectiveness of a tilt rotor configuration depends on its smooth transition from rotary wing to tandem wing flight during take-off and vice-versa during landing. An autonomous transition control scheme for the QTR using a modified PID controller is proposed to maintain desirable attitudes during transition. The derivative control of error term in a conventional PID controller is replaced by the rate of change of the control parameter in the modified PID controller. The modified PID controller provides the desired response with significantly reduced oscillations and actuator control effort than the conventional PID controller. The QTR configuration is simulated in a software-in-the-loop (SIL) simulation using MATLAB Simulink and the X-Plane simulator to analyze the controller performance and flight characteristics during transitions from rotary wing to tandem wing flight during take-off and vice-versa during landing. The simulation is performed with and without atmospheric disturbance and the simulation results showed acceptable deviation in attitude during the transition even under atmospheric disturbances.

AB In this article, we aim to study an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) communication system where a rotary-wing UAV travels from the initial to the final location to communicate with multiple IoT ground devices. The limited onboard energy of the UAV poses a constraint to the overall system's performance. UAV's energy consumption is majorly based on its kinematics, i.e., UAV's velocity and acceleration. Therefore, in this work, we maximize the sum user throughput by jointly optimizing the 3-D UAV trajectory, and velocity-time profile in the presence of onboard energy, velocity, acceleration, and completion time constraints. Noting the nonconvexity of the optimization problem, the original problem is decoupled into two subproblems. First, the trajectory is optimized considering the velocity constraint, while in the second subproblem, the velocity and time optimization in each time slot is carried out. Simulation results show insights on the UAV trajectory and velocity-time profile with the variation in the onboard energy availability. In addition, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach in comparison to the benchmark schemes.

AB Several market sectors are attracted by the potential of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), such as delivery, agriculture, and cinema, among others. UAVs are becoming part of Internet of Things (IoT) networks in the development of autonomous and scalable solutions. However, these vehicles are gradually becoming attractive targets for cyberattacks. This study proposes the development of an efficient platform based on the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol for UAV control and Denial-of-Service (DoS) detection embedded in the UAV system. For the efficiency test, latency, network and memory consumption on the platform were measured, in addition to the correlation between payload and delay time. The results of efficiency tests were collected for the three levels of quality of service (QoS). A strong correlation greater than 90% was found between delay and data size for all QoS levels, showing almost a linear proportion. In DoS detection, the best results were a true positive rate (TPR) of 0.97 with 16 features from the AWID2 dataset using LightGBM with Bayesian optimization and data balancing. Unlike other studies, the built platform shows efficiency for UAV control and guarantees security in the communication with the broker and in the Wi-Fi UAV network.

AB In this paper, we present a deep learning model for high-accuracy, high-speed detection of vehicle taillights in traffic. The model consists of three major modules: the lane detector, the car detector, and the taillight detector. Unlike most previously proposed algorithms where hand-coded schemes are used, we have adopted a data-driven approach. This data-driven scheme was implemented in both the car and taillight detection modules. First, we used an intricately designed lane detection module, then we adopted the Recurrent Rolling Convolution (RRC) architecture and tracking mechanism for detecting car boundaries. Subsequently, we used the same RRC architecture to extract the taillight regions of the detected cars. The lane detection and car detection modules improve both the speed and detection rate of the final taillight detection. The robustness of our model was verified using datasets from Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) as well as the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute (KITTI). Our model works well even in hostile conditions. It achieves detection rates as high as 99% in testing with the SKKU dataset. When using the KITTI 2D Object dataset, the model achieves a taillight detection rate of 86%. The model achieves 100% taillight detection rate on a certain, small subset of the KITTI Tracking dataset.

AB Diagnosing faults in electric vehicles (EVs) is a great challenge. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the detection of faults in an electromechanical conversion chain for conventional or autonomous EVs. The information and data coming from different sensors make it possible for EVs to recover a series of information including currents, voltages, speeds, and so on. This information is processed to detect any faults in the electromechanical conversion chain. The novelty of this study is to develop an architecture for a fault diagnosis model by means of the feature extraction technique. In this regard, the long short-term memory (LSTM) approach for the fault diagnosis is proposed. This approach has been tested for an EV prototype in practice, is superior in accuracy over other fault diagnosis techniques, and is based on machine learning. An EV in an urban context is modeled, and then the fault diagnosis approach is applied based on deep learning architectures. The EV and the fault diagnosis model is simulated in Matlab software. It is also revealed how deep learning contributes to the fault diagnosis of EVs. The simulation and practical results confirm that higher accuracy in the fault diagnosis is obtained by applying the LSTM.

AB In this paper, a novel plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) modeling approach is proposed for residential charging stations. This methodology can be used in the design of autonomous energy management systems (EMS) with the purpose of providing the charging schedules using minimum input measured data. The proposed method is composed of two main steps. In the first step, unlike other similar works, online PEV recognition is performed by means of an artificial neural network as a supervised classification method. The required feature space for classification is provided using the power spectral density estimation and the statistical analysis of individual PEVs charging current. The second step deals with the statistical modeling of the charging habits to facilitate the scheduling by predicting the charging demand using the current measurements on the grid side. In this respect, each PEV charging habit is modeled based on the correlation among the plug-in time, departure time, required energy, and weekdays using kernel density estimation. The performance of the suggested method is validated using real data collected from a charging station. The final results confirm the applicability of the proposed methodology with a satisfactory precision. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated using a comparative analysis in terms of the recognition performance.

AB The advent of autonomous navigation, positioning, and general robotics technologies has enabled the improvement of small to miniature-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones') and their wide uses in engineering practice. Recent research endeavors further envision a systematic integration of aerial drones and traditional contact-based or ground-based sensors, leading to an aerial-ground wireless sensor network (AG-WSN), in which the UAV serves as both a gateway besides and a remote sensing platform. This paper serves two goals. First, we will review the recent development in architecture, design, and algorithms related to UAVs as a gateway and particularly illustrate its nature in realizing an opportunistic sensing network. Second, recognizing the opportunistic sensing need, we further aim to focus on achieving energy efficiency through developing an active radio frequency (RF)-based wake-up mechanism for aerial-ground data transmission. To prove the effectiveness of energy efficiency, several sensor wake-up solutions are physically implemented and evaluated. The results show that the RF-based wake-up mechanism can potentially save more than 98.4% of the energy that the traditional duty-cycle method would otherwise consume, and 96.8% if an infrared-receiver method is used.

AB This article presents a monocular-based navigation approach for unmanned aerial vehicle safe and continuous inspection along one side of transmission lines. To this end, a navigation model based on the transmission tower and the transmission-line vanishing point was proposed, and the following three key issues were addressed. First, a deep-learning-based object detection and a fast and smooth tracking algorithm based on the kernelized correlation filter were combined to locate transmission tower timely and reliably. Second, the vanishing point of transmission lines was computed and optimized to provide unmanned aerial vehicle with a robust and precise flight direction. Third, to keep a stable safe distance from transmission lines, the transmission lines were first rectified by optimizing a homography matrix to eliminate the parallel distortion, and then their interval variation was estimated for reflecting the spatial distance variation. Finally, the real distance from transmission tower was measured by the triangulation across multiple views. The proposed navigation approach and the designed UAV platform were tested in a field environment, which achieved an encouraging result. To the best of authors' knowledge, this article marks the first time that a safe and continuous navigation approach along one side of transmission lines is put forward and implemented.

AB Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) should be allowed to respond to dynamic ocean environments and self-adjust their paths safely and efficiently. In this paper, considering the challenges posed by time-varying, partially unknown complex environments, a novel hierarchical motion planning framework is elaborately designed for a USV, which includes a global trajectory optimization and a local reactive collision avoidance strategy. By encapsulating the intricate nature of ocean environment, a global optimization path planning problem is developed to systematically strengthen the model's adaptability to the complex engineering problem. Incorpo-rating adaptive elite selection and fuzzy probability set, an adaptive-elite GA with fuzzy inference (AEGAfi) is devised to fully exploit the underlying optimization problem, providing high-quality global paths. By applying virtual sensory vector onto the USV's sensing module, the COLREG-compliant local-reaction is achieved by governing feasible actions of USVs under dynamically unforeseen environments. Seamlessly bridged by the transition Clothoid path, the linkage between global optimization and dynamic-avoidance is strengthened by softening the replanning time restriction and maintaining path continuity. Eventually, the motion planning framework merits autonomous global-planning and local-reaction in an organically modular manner. Compre-hensive simulations and comparisons in various ocean scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework.

AB A proportional integral differential (PID) trajectory tracking control strategy based on fuzzy logic and RBF neural network is proposed for the trajectory stability tracking control of the quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control system. Firstly, the trajectory tracking problem of UAV is transformed into the command tracking control problem of PID position control loop and PID attitude control loop by transformation. Then, the fuzzy control theory is used to adjust the PID parameter gain adaptively in real time, so as to overcome the shortcomings of the traditional PID parameters relying on experience and unable to adjust in real time according to the change of the system. At the same time, the online compensator of PID parameter gain is designed by using the attention mechanism of radial basis function (RBF) neural network, and the disturbance caused by the environmental impact of the system is suppressed by online learning and adjustment. Finally, the designed controller (RFPID) is compared with the PID controller and the fuzzy-PID (FPID) controller in three numerical simulation. The experimental results show that the proposed controller can significantly improve the robustness and accuracy of the trajectory tracking control of the quadrotor UAV.

AB Self-organizing protocols and algorithms in wireless sensor networks rely on knowledge of the topology of the network they manage. In most practical cases, establishing the topology prior to actual deployment is not possible, as the exact placement of nodes and the existence of a reliable link between any two individual nodes cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, this task has to be carried out post deployment. If the network is stand-alone and certain aspects are fixed (such as the identity and placement of the base station), then the task is achievable. If, however, the network has to interact with other systems - such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or mobile robots - whose operation is affected by environmental factors, self-organization becomes challenging. In this paper, we propose a dynamic topology construction algorithm, assuming that the network is a part of a joint deployment and does not have a fixed base station. A node carried by a UAV initiates the topology construction process and the ground nodes direct the network traffic towards the initiator. Our approach is collision-tolerant and enables in-network processing, thus reducing the computation burden of the initiator. We demonstrate the scope and usefulness of our approach using both lab and field deployments.

AB This paper presents a novel Fast Monocular Visual Place Recognition (FMPR) with a shallow path-oriented offline learning stage and an online place recognition and tracking stage. FMPR uses a tube of frames with a humanlike key frame recognition to solve place recognition for situations with varying speeds and changing lighting conditions, which are two most commonly encountered situations in real life. We propose an offline learning to analyze the correlation of all video frames in a reference path and to extract effective feature patches of key frames with an offline feature-shifts approach to achieve real-time place recognition. Our recognition results are on the basis of both the instant feature matching of frames and the historical recognition results which impose temporal logic constraints on the movement of a vehicle. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve comparable or even better performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods on different challenging datasets, especially for the case which requires a trade-off between the performance and the processing time. We believe that our FMPR offers a useful alternative to computationally expensive deep learning-based methods especially for applications with battery-powered or resource-limited devices.

AB Cyclists may have incorrect expectations of the behaviour of automated vehicles in interactions with them, which could bring extra risks in traffic. This study investigated whether expectations and behavioural intentions of cyclists when interacting with automated cars differed from those with manually driven cars. A photo experiment was conducted with 35 participants who judged bicycle-car interactions from the perspective of the cyclist. Thirty photos were presented. An experimental design was used with between-subjects factor instruction (two levels: positive, neutral), and two within-subjects factors: car type (three levels: roof name plate, sticker - these two external features indicated automated cars; and traditional car), and series (two levels: first, second). Participants were asked how sure they were to be noticed by the car shown in the photos, whether the car would stop, and how they would behave themselves. A subset of nine participants was equipped with an eye-tracker. Findings generally point to cautious dispositions towards automated cars: participants were not more confident to be noticed when interacting with both types of automated cars than with manually driven cars. Participants were more confident that automated cars would stop for them during the second series and looked significantly longer at automated cars during the first.

AB Single-modal image registration methods are generally not feasible for visible and infrared images. Besides, multimodal image registration methods still suffer from uneven distribution of extracted features, low repeatability, and ambiguous features. To address these issues, a coarse-to-fine infrared and visible image registration approach for a dual-sensor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imaging system is proposed, which is resilient to the difference in focal lengths and field of view. First, in the coarse registration step, the infrared image is transformed to the same scale as the visible image by using the similarity transformation. This operation makes the proposed method robust to the variation of the field of view. Then, the feature point pairs are initialized using feature detectors in the infrared image's blocked phase congruency feature map. Next, the feature point pairs are optimized by estimating the offset based on the relationship between the constructed feature descriptors. Finally, using elastic deformation, the pixel-level registered infrared image is obtained. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed coarse-to-fine image registration methodology in real infrared-visible image pairs. The code and dataset are available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mpUWwHUbKTrBdOrNMNRRnuJclDUAC7nU?usp=sharing.

AB Demand is expected to accelerate for autonomous air vehicles that transport people and goods, making wind sensors on these vehicles and in the air space where they operate critical to ensure safe control of many simultaneous take-offs and landings. Conventional anemometers such as pitot tubes as well as rotating, heated-element, acoustic, and drag technologies have drawbacks for small and micro-aerial vehicles including high power consumption, high aerodynamic drag, complex signal processing, and high cost. This paper presents an airfoil-shaped anemometer that provides low drag while integrating sensors for measuring wind speed and direction on tethered kites, balloons, and drones. Wind speed is measured by an integrated dual-layer capacitive pressure sensor with a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) diaphragm while wind direction is measured by a 3D digital magnetometer that senses the orientation of the airfoil relative to the earth's magnetic field. A model is presented for a dual-layer capacitive sensor and validated through quasistatic pressure chamber testing. The capacitive sensor as well as a commercial digital magnetometer are integrated into a NACA 2412 profile airfoil and tested in a laboratory-scale wind tunnel. The capacitive sensor provides a sensitivity of 1.84 fF m(2)s(-2) and the airfoil exhibits a unique stable angle-of-attack to within +/- 2 degrees as measured by the magnetometer.

AB This paper presents stabilisation of a relative equilibrium of an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with three independent control inputs on Lie group SE(3), since SE(3) can describe the evolution of a rigid body without singularities or ambiguities. First, by using the interconnection and damping assignment (IDA) method through kinetic energy shaping, a controller is proposed to stabilise the relative equilibrium in the sense of Lyapunov stability in cotangent bundle T*SE(3) modulo an isotropy subgroup when a marine vehicle immerses in an ideal fluid. Then, for an AUV submersed in a viscous fluid, an asymptotical static control law consisting of three terms is designed to stabilise the relative equilibrium via the IDA method, which these three control terms are derived from kinetic energy shaping, potential energy shaping and damping reassignment, respectively. The control term derived from kinetic energy shaping preserves stability of this motion modulo translations along the shortest semi-axis in any direction and rotations about the same axis. Moreover, the static controller is developed to a dynamic one via adaptive neural network approach, which is robust for uncertainties in the system's damping and mass. Simulation results complete our work.

AB Long-term vehicular motion prediction is a crucial function for both autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistant systems. However, due to the uncertainties of vehicle dynamics and complexities of surroundings, long-term motion prediction is never trivial work. As they combine effects of humans, vehicles and environments, kinematic trajectory data reflect several aspects of vehicles' spatial behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel method that leverages spatial database and kinematic trajectory data to achieve long-term vehicular motion prediction in a lightweight way. In our system, a spatial database system is initially embedded in an extended Kalman filter (EKF) framework. The spatial kinematic trajectory data are managed through the database and directly used in motion prediction; namely, weighted means are derived from the spatially retrieved kinematic data and used to update EKF predictions. The proposed method is validated in the real world. The experiments indicate that different weighting methods make a slight accuracy difference. Our method is not data-and-computation-consumed; its performance is acceptable in the limited data conditions and its prediction accuracy is improved as the size of used data sets increases; our method can predict in real time. The efficiency of an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is compared with that of the EKF. The results show that the UKF can hardly meet real-time requirements.

AB In this study, the use of a thermoelectric aftertreatment heater (TATH) to reduce NOx emissions in low demanding regimes of diesel-powered Heavy-Duty vehicles (HDV) has been analysed. This system is composed by an Exhaust Gas Heater (EGH) that heats up the exhaust gases in low engine regimes, in order to shorten the time that urea is injected. Besides, the TATH is fed by an Automotive Thermoelectric Generator (ATEG) that converts the waste heat from exhaust gases into electricity, so the system can work energetically autonomous.
   Experimental results show that under low-speed regimes, a Euro VI certified HDV emits NOx 5 times above the Euro VI limit value. Results demonstrate that the use of a TATH reduces NOx emissions by up to 97.2% in a long-haul diesel-powered MAN Euro VI TGX 18.480 Efficient Line 2 and may help to fulfil the prospective EURO VII regulation. Apart from that, it is also demonstrated that an ATEG can produce the energy required by the EGH in a long-haul mission profile. However, the added weight and the back pressure caused by the TATH is expected to increase the fuel consumption of the vehicle in 0.35%.

AB In the autonomous driving era, automotive architecture has been rapidly progressing toward electronic control unit (ECU) integration and centralization. Advanced vehicle control is becoming increasingly important for safe driving. It requires microcontroller unit (MCU) integration, the highest automotive safety integrity level (ASIL), and network performance improvement. A 28-nm 600-MHz automotive flash MCU has been developed for next-generation automotive architecture. The MCU for vehicle control integrates three key features: a virtualization-assisted processor (VAP) for functional safety, a built-in self-test in the field (field-BIST) at a sleep resume (SR) BIST for functional safety, and a serial gigabit media independent interface (SGMII) for the in-vehicle network. The VAP helps the hypervisor to realize real-time virtualization to execute several different virtual machines without interference. The SR-BIST realizes random hardware failures per hour of 10(-8) in various automotive applications. In the SGMII circuit, we used 5-V transistors for high reliability despite their narrow bandwidth. The automotive MCU satisfies the ISO26262 ASIL D system requirements with a low power consumption of 0.52 W. The VAP can realize the severe automotive control hard real time capability.

AB The smart regenerative braking system (SRS) is an autonomous version of one-pedal driving in electric vehicles. To implement SRS, a deceleration planning algorithm is necessary to generate the deceleration used in automatic regenerative control. To reduce the discomfort from the automatic regeneration, the deceleration should be similar to human driving. In this paper, a deceleration planning algorithm based on multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is proposed. The MLP models can mimic the human driving behavior by learning the driving data. In addition, the proposed deceleration planning algorithm has a classified structure to improve the planning performance in each deceleration condition. Therefore, the individual MLP models were designed according to three different deceleration conditions: car-following, speed bump, and intersection. The proposed algorithm was validated through driving simulations. Then, time to collision and similarity to human driving were analyzed. The results show that the minimum time to collision was 1.443 s and the velocity root-mean-square error (RMSE) with human driving was 0.302 m/s. Through the driving simulation, it was validated that the vehicle moves safely with desirable velocity when SRS is in operation, based on the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the classified structure has more advantages than the integrated structure in terms of planning performance.

ID SICKNESS; SIMULATOR; SWAY
AB Background: Motion platforms and driving simulators have been shown to contribute to motion sickness and a short-term increase in standing postural sway. However, no studies to date have investigated how the motion of a passenger vehicle and the performance of a task during a drive on a closed test track affects post-drive standing balance.
   Research Questions: What are the effects of (1) a continuous, scripted drive on a closed test track, and (2) the performance of a handheld tablet-based task during the scripted drive, on post-drive standing balance?
   Methods: Fifty adults (23 males, 27 females; 40.0 +/- 20.6 yr) rode in the front passenger seat of a midsized sedan on a scripted drive. Participants were assigned to one of the acceleration levels (Low, Moderate) and completed both Task and No-Task test conditions, involving a visual-based task on a handheld tablet device. Before and after each scripted drive, participants completed two standing balance exercises: 1) feet tandem, eyes open, on firm support, and 2) feet together, eyes closed, on foam support. An inertial measurement unit (IMU) captured estimates of postural trunk sway. Root-mean-square (RMS) of angular position and velocity in the anteroposterior (A/P) and mediolateral (M/L) directions, and elliptical fit and path length of sway trajectory were computed. A nonparametric analysis was performed on the balance metrics.
   Results: Exposure to a scripted drive in a vehicle affected participants' postural sway, especially after using a handheld device during the drive. M/L RMS sway velocity and path length increased for both exercises following the scripted drive with task. Additionally, M/L RMS sway increased for the more challenging balance exercise, during which participants stood with feet together on foam support with eyes closed.
   Significance: This study is the first to explore balance following a scripted drive on a closed test track. Changes in post-drive balance introduces potential risks to vehicle passengers; concurrent performance of a task on a handheld device further increases the likelihood that post-drive balance will be negatively affected.

TI A geographical hierarchy greedy routing strategy for vehicular big data

AB As the autonomous and intelligent driving technologies rapidly develop, vehicles are equipped with more sensors and produce more data. To cope with the challenge of big data, millimeter wave (mmWave) can achieve data rates of up to multiple gigabits per second. Though mmWave communications can provide wide bandwidths, mmWave is susceptible to blockage due to its poor diffraction capability and its high penetration loss. To overcome the limited communication range for vehicular applications in wide areas, a routing strategy is required to relay data in a multi-hop way. In this work, we propose a geographical hierarchy greedy routing algorithm for inter-vehicle mmWave communications. Also, we evaluate the channel characteristics and the throughput performance of mmWave working at 60 GHz. The proposed routing strategy makes use of geographical information for relay determination while maintaining the high throughput and ensuring the channel stability of mmWave. Based on the simulation results, it is found that mmWave is promising for the future big data vehicular applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Smoothed A* algorithm for practical unmanned surface vehicle path
   planning
SO APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH

DT Article

AB An effective path planning or route planning algorithm is essential for guiding unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) between way points or along a trajectory. The A* algorithm is one of the most efficient algorithms for calculating a safe route with the shortest distance cost. However, the route generated by the conventional A* algorithm is constrained by the resolution of the map and it may not be compatible with the non-holonomic constraint of the USV. In this paper an improved A* algorithm has been proposed and applied to the Springer USV. A new path smoothing process with three path smoothers has been developed to improve the performance of the generated route, reducing unnecessary 'jags', having no redundant waypoints and offering a more continuous route. Both simulation and experimental results show that the smoothed A* algorithm outperforms the conventional algorithm in both sparse and cluttered environments that have been uniformly rasterised. It has been demonstrated that the proposed improved A* route planning algorithm can be applied to the Springer USV providing promising results when tracking trajectories.

AB The paper considers the problem of automatic path tracking by autonomous farming vehicles subject to wheel slips, which are characteristic for agricultural applications. Two guidance laws are proposed to solve this problem, and both explicitly take into account the constraints on the steering angle and ensure tracking an arbitrarily curved path. The first law is implemented by the pure sliding-mode controller, whereas the second one combines the sliding mode approach with a smooth nonlinear control law and requests control chattering at the reduced amplitude as compared with the first law. Mathematically rigorous proofs of global convergence and robust stability of the proposed guidance laws are presented. In doing so, the slipping effects are treated as bounded uncertainties. Simulation results and real world experiments confirm the applicability and performance of the proposed guidance approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Regulating the curbside usage of delivery vehicles and ride-hailing services as well as micromobility has been a challenge in the last years, a challenge which might worsen with the increase of autonomous vehicles. The contribution of the research outlined in this paper is an evaluation method of the land use of on-demand meal delivery services such as Deliveroo and UberEats. It evaluates the effect parking policies, operating strategy changes, and scheduling options have on the land consumption of bicycle couriers and sidewalk automated delivery robots (SADRs). Various operating strategies (i.e., shared fleets and fleets operated by restaurants), parking policies (i.e., parking at the restaurant, parking at the customer or no parking) and scheduling options (i.e., one meal per vehicle, multiple meals per vehicle) are simulated and applied to New York City (NYC). Additionally, the time-area requirements of on-demand meal delivery services are calculated based on GPS traces of Deliveroo and UberEats riders in two UK cities. The simulation in the paper shows that SADRs can reduce the time-area requirements by half compared with bicycle couriers. The effect of operating strategy changes and forbidding vehicles to park at the customer's home is small. Delivering multiple meals in one tour halves the time-area requirements. The time-area requirements based on GPS traces is around 300 m(2)& BULL;min per order. The study allows policymakers to learn more about the land use of on-demand meal delivery services and how these can be influenced. Hence, they can adjust their policy strategies to ensure that on-demand meal delivery services are provided in a way that they use land effectively, reduce external costs, improve sustainability and benefit everyone.</p>

AB Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology has the advantages of high detection accuracy, a wide range of perception, and not being affected by light. The 3D LiDAR is placed at the commanding height of the traffic scene, the overall situation can be grasped from the perspective of top view, and the trajectory of each object in the traffic scene can be accurately perceived in real time, and then the object information can be distributed to the surrounding vehicles or other roadside LiDAR through advanced wireless communication equipment, which can significantly improve the local perception ability of an autonomous vehicle. This paper first describes the characteristics of roadside LiDAR and the challenges of object detection and then reviews in detail the current methods of object detection based on a single roadside LiDAR and multi-LiDAR cooperatives. Then, some studies for roadside LiDAR perception in adverse weather and datasets released in recent years are introduced. Finally, some current open challenges and future works for roadside LiDAR perception are discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically study roadside LiDAR perception methods and datasets. It has an important guiding role in further promoting the research of roadside LiDAR perception for practical applications.

AB Air-ground interference mitigation is a challenging issue for integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into cellular networks, since UAVs can cause/suffer severe interference to/from a large number of co-channel base stations (BSs) in their uplink/downlink communications due to line-of-sight (LoS) UAV-ground channels. In this letter, we propose a new and efficient interference mitigation scheme to tackle this challenge by exploiting the intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) deployed near the BSs. Specifically, in the downlink, the IRS near each co-channel BS tunes its passive beamforming to suppress the BS's interference to the UAV. While in the uplink, its passive beamforming is tuned to suppress/enhance the interference from the UAV for facilitating the linear/nonlinear interference cancellation (IC) at each co-channel BS. To achieve the optimal UAV-ground performance trade-off, we further propose a hybrid IC scheme to maximize the weighted sum rate of the UAV and ground users in the uplink, by jointly optimizing the set of BSs applying the linear/nonlinear IC and the UAV's transmit power. Simulation results demonstrate the performance gain of the proposed schemes over benchmark schemes and draw important design insights for IRS-aided UAV communication in cellular networks.

AB Thanks to the agility and mobility features, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been applied for a wide range of civil and military missions. To remotely control and monitor UAVs, mission-related data such as location and trajectory information are transmitted over wireless channels. However, UAV networks are vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks due to: 1) the broadcasting nature of wireless channels; 2) the broad coverage in aerial environments. In this paper, we investigate the potential security threats in UAV networks with passive attackers who aim to eavesdrop and decode encrypted locations by using machine learning techniques. We show that a neural network of two hidden layers is able to decode the encrypted locations if using the existing location protection methods. To defend against such machine learning based attacks, we suggest a location protection approach based on the random linear network coding with encryption keys being randomly permuted. We prove that our proposed approach allows for a low attacker's success probability and provides untraceability property. Our simulation results indicate that our approach significantly outperforms the existing location protection methods in terms of attacker's bit error rate, even with a small number of UAVs.

AB In this paper, the problem of energy efficiency maximization of an unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV)-assisted full-duplex non-orthogonal-multiple-access (FD-NOMA) system is investigated. In order to reduce the interference among users in the considered system, we first propose a novel and less complex adaptive-geometric distribution (AGD) which adaptively maintain equal cluster size and allocate resource optimally among the users. Later, we formulate an optimization problem of energy efficiency maximization subject to the transmit power budget at the UAV for downlink (DL) users and for each uplink (UL) user and UAV placement. To transform the non-convex problem into convex one, we decouple the original optimization problem into different sub-problems in which the problems of power allocation and UAV placement are alternatively solved using Dinkelbach's algorithm with successive convex approximation (SCA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), respectively. Later, the unified solution for optimal power allocation and UAV placement is proposed based on block-coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm. Extensive simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed AGD clustering based proposed algorithm for UAV-assisted FD-NOMA system over the conventional clustering and other orthogonal schemes.

AB Unmanned Aerial vehicles (UAV) have been utilized in many application domains. UAVs (or Airships, e.g., Drones) have been adopted to explore resources (e.g., minerals). One of the main limitations of using such airships is that flying at a fixed altitude is based on GPS altitude information. In many applications, it is important to support the 'terrain-following flying' function for airships when deployed and utilized in areas where the terrain is not flat but bumpy and steep (for example, in mountains areas in South Korea). This paper proposed a novel architecture of an airship autopilot system with three main contributions: First, the proposed architecture is designed to support a terrain-following function using a laser range finder (which continuously identifies the distance between an airship and terrain). Second, the proposed system provides two new algorithms for path and terrain-following functions for the proposed architecture. Third, this work designed and implemented a prototype airship and autopilot system to validate the proposed method. As a result, the proposed airship design and algorithm can guarantee a high-quality data collection (e.g., magnetic data) and demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach with the experimental results based on real-flight operation in a test area.

AB We consider the problem of finding an optimal manoeuvre that moves a car-like vehicle between two configurations in minimum time. We propose a two phase algorithm in which a path that joins the two points is first found by solving a geometric optimisation problem, and then the optimal manoeuvre is identified considering the system dynamics and its constraints. We make the assumption that the path is composed of a sequence of clothoids. This choice is justified by theoretical arguments, practical examples and by the existence of very efficient geometric algorithms for the computation of a path of this kind. The focus of the paper is on the computation of the optimal manoeuvre, for which we show a semi-analytical solution that can be produced in a few milliseconds on an embedded platform for a path made of one hundred segments. Our method is considerably faster than approaches based on pure numerical solutions, it is capable to detect when the optimal solution exists and, in this case, compute the optimal control. Finally, the method explicitly considers nonlinear dynamics, aerodynamic drag effect and bounds on the longitudinal and on the lateral acceleration. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Perfect hardware conditions are often difficult to meet in practical networks due to the inevitable hardware impairments (HIs). The secure multiuser communication of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system with HIs at the transceiver and the IRS is studied in this article. Aiming for maximizing the average sum secrecy rate (ASSR) of the UAV system, we jointly optimize the transmit precoding (TPC) matrices, IRS phase shift matrices, and UAV trajectory. To deal with the nonconvexity, we break down this problem into three subproblems and solve them using an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Specifically, the semidefinite programming method is used to solve the TPC and phase shift matrices, while the successive convex approximation method is used to obtain the UAV trajectory. In addition, a low complexity mathod on the basis of the Riemannian Manifold Gradient is proposed to solve the IRS phase shift matrix. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the algorithm. Our robust algorithm can improve ASSR by 22% compared to that without IRS. Furthermore, the nonrobust design without considering HIs will cause a loss of secrecy performance.

AB This paper develops an event-triggered-based finite-time cooperative path following (CPF) control scheme for underactuated marine surface vehicles (MSVs) with model parameter uncertainties and unknown ocean disturbances. First, a finite-time extended state observer (FTESO) is proposed, in which the FTESO can estimate the velocities and compound disturbances in finite time. Then, the finite-time LOS guidance law based on velocity estimation values is designed to obtain the desired surge velocity and the desired yaw rate. In order to realize the cooperative control of multiple paths in finite time, the cooperative control law for the path variable is designed. In addition, the relative threshold event-triggered control (ETC) mechanism is incorporated into the formation control algorithm, and an event-triggered-based finite-time CPF controller is designed, which not only effectively reduces the update frequency of controller and the mechanical loss of actuator but also improves the control performance of system. Furthermore, by using homogeneous method, Lyapunov theory, and finite-time stability theory, it is proved that under the proposed finite-time CPF control scheme, the formation errors can converge to a small neighborhood around origin in finite time. Finally, numerical simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB The global positioning system (GPS), which provides ubiquitous location-awareness with a constellation of satellites, has become an instrumental function of multiple mass-market applications. Satellite signals, however, may not be capable of penetrating obstacles in harsh environments (e.g., urban canyons, tree canopies, and flyovers). Hence, GPS may not provide adequate localization accuracy for applications like autonomous vehicles. Resorting to data fusion of heterogeneous signals emanating from multiple anchors, we advocate a self-localization method that provides accurate estimates of the vehicle position. To be more specific, several heterogenous emitters whose positions are known are used as anchors to determine the vehicle's position based on the weighted direct position determination (DPD) method that eliminates nonhomogeneity among different emitters. However, the weighted DPD method requires an exhaustive search of the parameter search space and is thus time-consuming. To reduce the computational burden, we propose a weighted cascade compensation estimator (WCCE) that is tailored for real-time tracking and self-localization. The proposed WCCE outperforms traditional DPD methods in terms of computational complexity while achieving nearly comparable localization accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is corroborated by extensive simulated examples.

AB Recently, interest in mission autonomy related to Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles(UCAVs) for performing highly dangerous Air-to-Surface Missions(ASMs) has been increasing. Regarding autonomous mission planners, studies currently being conducted in this field have been mainly focused on creating a path from a macroscopic 2D environment to a dense target area or proposing a route for intercepting a target. For further improvement, this paper treats a mission planning algorithm on an ASM which can plan the path to the target dense area in consideration of threats spread in a 3D terrain environment while planning the shortest path to intercept multiple targets. To do so, ASMs are considered three sequential mission elements: ingress, intercept, and egress. The ingress and egress elements require a terrain flight path to penetrate deep into the enemy territory. Thus, the proposed terrain flight path planner generates a nap-of-the-earth path to avoid detection by enemy radar while avoiding enemy air defense threats. In the intercept element, the shortest intercept path planner based on the Dubins path concept combined with nonlinear programming is developed to minimize exposure time for survivability. Finally, the integrated ASM planner is applied to several mission scenarios and validated by simulations using a rotorcraft model.

AB The choice of fuels has frequently been at the center of debates about how a future low-carbon mobility system can be achieved. This paper introduces two visions of biogas fuels and electricity using material from interviews and documents in Swedish transport. These visions are analyzed as interrelated sociotechnical imaginaries. To better understand the way visions of biogas and electric vehicles (EVs) dynamically shape and condition each other, four dimensions of sociotechnical imaginaries are further developed: spatial boundedness, temporality, coherence and contestation, and the socio-material relations they are associated with. Imaginaries of biogas and EVs differ with respect to these characteristics. The biogas imaginary is made up of locally bounded visions of the desirable future, showing how imaginaries can be fragmented and contested, often because of their embeddedness in local socio-material systems of resource use. This local boundedness is exemplified by contrasting cases of contested biogas imaginaries in the Swedish municipalities of Linkoping and Malmo. The imaginary of EVs, in contrast, is more uniform nationally and even influenced by international expectations that in the future vehicles will be shared, electric, and autonomous. The qualities of these imaginaries shape the way they interrelate and coevolve as sociotechnical changes of the transport system unfold.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) road maps have garnered significant attention recently because of applications such as autonomous driving. For 3D road maps to remain accurate and up-to-date, an appropriate updating method is crucial. However, there are currently no updating methods with both satisfactorily high frequency and accuracy. An effective strategy would be to frequently acquire point clouds from regular vehicles, and then take detailed measurements only where necessary. However, there are three challenges when using data from regular vehicles. First, the accuracy and density of the points are comparatively low. Second, the measurement ranges vary for different measurements. Third, tentative changes such as pedestrians must be discriminated from real changes. The method proposed in this paper consists of registration and change detection methods. We first prepare the synthetic data obtained from regular vehicles using mobile mapping system data as a base reference. We then apply our proposed change detection method, in which the occupancy grid method is integrated with Dempster-Shafer theory to deal with occlusions and tentative changes. The results show that the proposed method can detect road environment changes, and it is easy to find changed parts through visualization. The work contributes towards sustainable updates and applications of 3D road maps.

AB An autonomous approach and landing (A&L) guidance law is presented in this paper for landing an unpowered reusable launch vehicle (RLV) at the designated runway touchdown. Considering the full nonlinear point-mass dynamics, a guidance scheme is developed in three-dimensional space. In order to guarantee a successful A&L movement, the multiple sliding surfaces guidance (MSSG) technique is applied to derive the closed-loop guidance law, which stems from higher order sliding mode control theory and has advantage in the finite time reaching property. The global stability of the proposed guidance approach is proved by the Lyapunov-based method. The designed guidance law can generate new trajectories on-line without any specific requirement on off-line analysis except for the information on the boundary conditions of the A&L phase and instantaneous states of the RLV. Therefore, the designed guidance law is flexible enough to target different touchdown points on the runway and is capable of dealing with large initial condition errors resulted from the previous flight phase. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed guidance law in different scenarios. (C) 2017 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

AB Developments of technologies that facilitate vehicle connectivity represent a market demand. In particular, mobile device ( MD) technology provides advanced user interface, customization, and upgradability characteristics that can facilitate connectivity and possibly aid in the goal of autonomous driving. This work explores the use of a MD in the control system of a conceptual electric vehicle (EV). While the use of MD for real-time control and monitoring has been reported, proper consideration has not been given to delays in data flow and their effects on system performance. The motor of a novel propulsion system for an EV was conditioned to be controlled in a wireless local area network by an ecosystem that includes a MD and an electronic board. An intended accelerator signal is predefined and sent to the motor and rotational speed values produced in the motor are sent back to the MD. Sample periods in which the communication really occurs are registered. Delays in the sample periods and produced errors in the accelerator and rotational speed signals are presented and analyzed. Maximum delays found in communications were of 0.2 s, while the maximum error produced in the accelerator signal was of 3.54%. Delays are also simulated, with a response that is similar to the behavior observed in the experiments.

AB Many vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications and use cases require their feasibility to be simulated, tested, and validated in realistic traffic scenarios and under various network conditions before real-time testbed implementation. As cellular-V2X (C-V2X) becomes a superior technology for future connected and autonomous vehicles, the need for a simulation framework, which integrates traffic and network simulators with a realistic channel model, becomes more evident. The challenge is to overcome existing simulation platforms' weak-nesses and improve simulation results' accuracy while preserving flexibility with manageable implementation complexity. This paper proposed a top-down approach for building reference scenarios with macroscopic and microscopic layers, which interweaves traffic, network, and channel simulators. The basis for the proposed simulation framework is realistic scenario data, which provides the input to the road traffic simulator and the radio channel simulator. The core of the whole simulator is the network simulator interacting with the two other simulators via dedicated interfaces. The road traffic simulator generates the vehicles' positions and is forwarded to the network simulator, which requests the radio channel simulator for the path loss values on the transmitter-receiver (TX-RX) link. As a proof of concept, the simulation results focused on the load and interference analysis in the absence and presence of V2X traffic.

AB In this note, one focuses on the application of the event-triggered mechanism into the formation control system of the underactuated surface vehicles (USVs). To avoid the possible singularity problem, a novel fleet control model of the leader-follower structure is established in the Cartesian coordinate frame. The innovation of this design is that the information status between the leader and the follower could be acquired continuously and intuitively. Furthermore, a practical event-triggered robust neural control is developed by utilizing the robust neural damping technique and the input event-triggered rule. When the event-triggered threshold is satisfied, the state variables and the control input could be reset or updated aperiodically. That can effectively reduce the occupancy of the communication network from the controller to the actuator and facilitate its application in the practical engineering. In this algorithm, only four adaptive updated parameters are required in the adaptive model. Such design could compensate the gain uncertainties and the environmental disturbances. Based on the Lyapunov theory, considerable efforts have been made to illustrate that all signals in the closed-loop system are the semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded(SGUUB). Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the validity of the proposed scheme.

DT Article
AB Autonomous vehicles operating in urban environments need to deal with an abundance of other dynamic objects, such as pedestrians and vehicles. This requires the development of predictive models that capture the complexity and long-term patterns of motion in the environment. We approach this problem by modeling movement directions of a typical object in the environment over time. We propose a method to build a continuous map to capture spatiotemporal movements. At a given coordinate in space and time, our method provides a multi-modal probability density function over the possible directions an object can move in. We achieve this by projecting data into a high-dimensional feature space using sparse approximate kernels, and passing the high-dimensional features through a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. A mixture density network (MDN) with von Mises distributions is then trained on the hidden representations of the LSTM. Once trained, the outputs of the MDN can be used to construct the probability distribution over movement directions. The model is continuous in both spatial and temporal domains, as we can query the change of directional uncertainty at arbitrary resolution in space and time. We conduct experiments on three simulated and three real-world benchmark datasets with pedestrians and vehicles, and demonstrate that both the continuous nature and the addition of temporal patterns improves performance.

AB Oceanographic science is frequently hindered by a lack of spatial and temporal resolution for most parameters oceanographic science desires to measure. This paper discusses our effort to advance the current state of bathymetric mapping as part of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) charter. MBARI scientists and engineers, in consultation with the external community, have produced a new multibeam mapping autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) system. The system is intended to reduce some of the impediments encountered by science trying to resolve specific portions of the oceans bottom. Starting with the established and in-house developed Dorado AUV technology, MBARI engineering refined the AUV into a full ocean depth capable and now operational multibeam mapping system (MBAUV). The MBAUV system conducts regular multibeam bathymetry, subbottom, and sidescan surveys for oceanographic science. MBAUV is a torpedo-shaped, 6000 rn rated vehicle operating the aforementioned sonars simultaneously. The endurance of the MBAUV is approximately 8 h at 3 kn and is designed to support 16 h operations at 3 kn by adding an additional battery section. This paper describes the basics of the MBAUV and our design trades and modifications to the Dorado AUV in support of multibeam mapping missions. The paper also reviews a sampling of the results from a series of missions that demonstrate the performance of various subsystems and the science quality data available from the MBAUV.

AB The tailless flapping-wing micro air vehicle (FW-MAV) is one of the most challenging problems in flapping-wing design due to its lack of tail for inherent flight stability. It must be designed in such a way that it can produce proper augmented control moments modulated by a closed-loop attitude controller for active stabilization. We propose a tailless FW-MAV with a wing stroke plane modulation mechanism, namely NUS-Roboticbird, which maneuvers by only using its flapping wings for both propulsion and attitude control. The flying vehicle has four wings comprised by two pairs, and each pair of wings and its stroke plane are driven by a motor and a servo, respectively. Attitude control moments of roll, pitch and yaw are generated by vectoring a pair of thrusts, which result from changing the flapping frequency (or motor speed) and wing stroke plane of the two pairs of wings. Free-flight tests show that the vehicle can climb and descend vertically (throttle control), fly sideways left and right (roll control), fly forwards and backwards (pitch control), rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise (yaw control), hover in mid-air (active self-stabilization), and maneuver in the figureof-8 and fast forward/backward flight. These abilities are especially important for surveillance and autonomous flight in terms of obstacle avoidance in an indoor environment. Flight test data show that an effective mechanical control mechanism and control gains for attitude-controlled flights for roll, pitch and yaw are achieved, in particular, yaw control. Currently, the vehicle weighing 31 g and having a wingspan of 22 cm can perform fast forward flight at a speed of about 5 ms(-1)(18 km h(-1)) and endure 3.5 min in flight with a useful payload of a 4.5 g onboard camera for surveillance.

AB By relaying messages between users, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are frequently utilized in the communication industry, can be used as airborne communication relays to resolve connectivity problems. In order to effectively connect a large number of heterogeneous users dispersed on the ground, we deploy a large number of UAVs for reliable relay coverage and message transmission between users. We initially put forth a relay coverage algorithm that continuously optimizes the position of UAVs and the cell division of ground users in order to provide users with full coverage. Second, we study several relay message forwarding methods between UAVs while taking into account the features of heterogeneous users. A relay selection method, which takes the relay link throughput as the optimization goal, is proposed to ensure full connectivity between UAVs. Finally, we contrast and analyze how various relay forwarding methods affect the effectiveness of the relay network. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed relay coverage algorithm can balance the UAV relay load better and reduce transmission delay, while the suggested relay selection strategy can minimize the number of isolated UAVs and maximize the throughput of UAV relay links.

AB Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) are a type of UAV that are both small and fully autonomous, making them ideal for both civilian and military applications. Modern MAVs can hover and navigate while carrying several sensors, operate over long distances, and send data to a portable base station. Despite their many benefits, MAVs often encounter obstacles due to limitations in the embedded system (such as memory, processing power, energy, etc.). Due to these obstacles and the use of open wireless communication channels, MAVs are vulnerable to a variety of cyber-physical attacks. Consequently, MAVs cannot execute complex cryptographic algorithms due to their limited computing power. In light of these considerations, this article proposes a conditional privacy-preserving generalized ring signcryption scheme for MAVs using an identity-based cryptosystem. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), with a key size of 160 bits, is used in the proposed scheme. The proposed scheme's security robustness has been analyzed using the Random Oracle Model (ROM), a formal security evaluation method. The proposed scheme is also compared in terms of computation cost, communication cost and memory overhead against relevant existing schemes. The total computation cost of the proposed scheme is 7.76 ms, which is 8.14%, 5.20%, and 11.40% schemes. The results show that the proposed scheme is both efficient and secure, proving its viability.

TI Improved Data Association Using Buffered Pose Adjustment for Map-Aided
   Localization
SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS

DT Article
DE Localization; intelligent transportation systems
ID GNSS
AB Maps provide an important source of information for autonomous vehicles. They can be used along with cameras and lidars to localize the vehicle. This requires the ability to correctly associate observations to features referenced in the map. The problem is all the more difficult that all observations are not necessarily referenced, and all map features might not be detectable with the embedded sensors. This letter presents an adjustment technique that enables to increase the number of associations that can be made while limiting the chance of obtaining wrong associations. This is achieved by matching observations in batches in a buffer and matching them regularly. Periodically, the observation buffer is used to adjust the trajectory used to match observations. This is done without making any assumption on the association between observations and map features through a likelihood maximization process. The adjusted trajectory then provides the best associations that are used for real-time localization. The method was tested with data recorded on public roads using an experimental vehicle. The results show that the number of associations that can be made is increased, thanks to the trajectory adjustment step and the use of an observation buffer. This also results in greater localization accuracy and consistency with an average error of 0.7 meters at 50 Hz using road markings and traffic signs.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) play an important role in subaqueous construction and oceanographic survey, in which AUV self-localization is a crucial component. Current localization methods mainly depend on expensive acoustic positioning systems, which limit the wide application of AUVs. In this paper, referring to the low-cost visual localization method and focusing on challenges caused by underwater environment, we propose an underwater self-localization method based on Pseudo-3D vision-inertia for AUVs. The proposed method merges depth information into 2D visual image to achieve continuous and robust localization under dramatically changing underwater environment. In order to decrease errors, we propose an online fusion method based on tightly-coupled nonlinear optimization to fuse the measurements of the pre-integrated inertial measurement unit and the observations from the down-looking camera. We also optimize four degrees-of-freedom pose graph to enhance the global consistency and design an online loop detection module to realize the underwater relocalization. In addition, we develop a low-cost, portable, and small volume sensor suite for underwater vehicle localization and test the proposed self-localization method. We test the proposed method in the underwater environment using the custom-made sensor suite, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method under dramatically changing underwater environment.

It is therefore important to understand how to extract performance from these processors, something that is not trivial. This survey discusses various optimization techniques found in 450 articles published in the last 14 years. We analyze the optimizations from different perspectives which shows that the various optimizations are highly interrelated, explaining the need for techniques such as auto-tuning.

Here, we demonstrate an underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) system that communicates using blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with a dominant wavelength of 455 nm. Under the on-off keying modulation scheme, the waterproof UOWC system achieves a bidirectional communication rate of 4 Mbps based on the transmission control protocol (TCP) and exhibits real-time full-duplex video communication with a transmission distance of 12 m in a swimming pool, offering great potential for practical use in real-world scenarios, such as carried around or attached to an autonomous vehicle.

The importance of this work is that sensor information regarding other agents can be leveraged to perform behavior recognition, which is activity recognition of robots performing specific programmed behaviors, and task-assignment. This work illustrates the use of Behavior Histograms, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to perform behavior recognition. We present challenges associated with using each behavior recognition technique along with results on individually selected test trajectories, from simulated and real sonar data, and real-time recognition through a simulated mission.

Thus, developing a fast and robust object detection algorithm has been the primary goal of many automotive industries and institutes. In recent years, multi-purpose vision-based driver assistance systems have gained popularity with the emergence of a deep neural network. A monocular camera has been developed to locate an object in the image plane and estimate the distance of the said object in the real world or the vehicle plane. In this work, we present a monocular 3D object detection method that utilizes the discrete depth and orientation representation. Our proposed method strives to predict object locations on 3D space utilizing keypoint detection on the object's center point. To improve the point detection, we employ center regression on the objects segmentation mask, reducing the detection offset significantly. The simplicity of our proposed network architecture and its one-stage approach allows our algorithm to achieve competitive speed compared with prior methods. Our proposed method is able to achieve 26.93% detection score on the Cityscapes 3D object detection dataset, outperforming the preceding monocular method by a margin of 2.8 points.

   FRAMEWORK
AB Recently, the civilian applications of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are gaining more interest in several domains. Due to operational costs, safety concerns, and legal regulations, Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) is commonly used to design models and conduct tests. This has resulted in numerous research works addressing ABS in civilian UAV applications. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the ABS contribution in civilian UAV applications by conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the relevant research in the previous ten years. Following the SLR methodology, this objective is broken down into several research questions aiming to (i) understand the evolution of ABS use in civilian UAV applications and identify the related hot research topics, (ii) identify the underlying artificial intelligence systems used in the literature, (iii) understand how and when ABS is integrated in broader and more complex internet of things & ubiquitous computing environments, and (iv) identity the communication technologies, tools, and evaluation techniques used to design, implement, and test the proposed ABS models. From the SLR results, key research directions are highlighted including problems related to autonomy, explainability, security, flight duration, integration within smart cities, regulations, and validation & verification of the UAV behavior.

AB Artificial intelligence is the ability of a computer to perform the functions and reasoning typical of the human mind. In its purely informatic aspect, it includes the theory and techniques for the development of algorithms that allow machines to show an intelligent ability and/or perform an intelligent activity, at least in specific areas. In particular, there are automatic learning algorithms based on the same mechanisms that are thought to be the basis of all the cognitive processes developed by the human brain. Such a powerful tool has already started to produce a new class of self-driving vehicles. With the projections of population growth that will increase until the year 2100 up to 11.2 billion, research on innovating agricultural techniques must be continued. In order to improve the efficiency regarding precision agriculture, the use of autonomous agricultural machines must become an important issue. For this reason, it was decided to test the use of the "Neural Network Toolbox" tool already present in MATLAB to design an artificial neural network with supervised learning suitable for classification and pattern recognition by using data collected by an ultrasonic sensor. The idea is to use such a protocol to retrofit kits for agricultural machines already present on the market.

AB In vehicular ad hoc networks, establishing a secure channel between any two vehicles is fundamental. Authenticated key agreement is a useful mechanism, which can be used to negotiate a shared key for secure data transmission between authentic vehicles in vehicular ad hoc networks. Among the existing identity-based two-party authenticated key agreement protocols without pairings, there are only a few protocols that provide provable security in strong security models such as the extended Canetti-Krawczyk model. This article presents an efficient pairing-free identity-based one-round two-party authenticated key agreement protocol with provable security, which is more suitable for real-time application environments with highly dynamic topology such as vehicular ad hoc networks than the existing identity-based two-party authenticated key agreement protocols. The proposed protocol is proven secure under the passive and active adversaries in the extended Canetti-Krawczyk model based on the Gap Diffie-Hellman assumption. The proposed protocol can capture all essential security attributes including known-session key security, perfect forward secrecy, basic impersonation resistance, key compromise impersonation resistance, unknown key share resistance, no key control, and ephemeral secrets reveal resistance. Compared with the existing identity-based two-party authenticated key agreement protocols, the proposed protocol is superior in terms of computational cost and running time while providing higher security.

AB Detection and tracking of objects in the side-near-field has attracted much attention for the development of advanced driver assistance systems. This paper presents a cost-effective approach to track moving objects around vehicles using linearly arrayed ultrasonic sensors. To understand the detection characteristics of a single sensor, an empirical detection model was developed considering the shapes and surface materials of various detected objects. Eight sensors were arrayed linearly to expand the detection range for further application in traffic environment recognition. Two types of tracking algorithms, including an Extended Kalman filter (EKF) and an Unscented Kalman filter (UKF), for the sensor array were designed for dynamic object tracking. The ultrasonic sensor array was designed to have two types of fire sequences: mutual firing or serial firing. The effectiveness of the designed algorithms were verified in two typical driving scenarios: passing intersections with traffic sign poles or street lights, and overtaking another vehicle. Experimental results showed that both EKF and UKF had more precise tracking position and smaller RMSE (root mean square error) than a traditional triangular positioning method. The effectiveness also encourages the application of cost-effective ultrasonic sensors in the near-field environment perception in autonomous driving systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

DE Hypersonic glide vehicle; Analytical entry guidance; Analytical glide

AB An autonomous entry guidance is developed for a hypersonic glide vehicle with high Lift-to-Drag ratio (L/D) based on 3-D analytical glide formulas. To compensate the effects of the Earth's rotation, the pseudo-aerodynamic forces are introduced as the fusions of the aerodynamic forces and inertial forces due to the Earth's rotation. To avoid drastic changes in Angle of Attack (AOA) and bank angle, we carefully forecast the change trends of the inertial forces and then design the pseudo aerodynamic profiles as inversely proportional functions. Here a complex but useful identity is found and proved theoretically, which helps to simplify the pseudo-aerodynamic profiles without losing accuracy significantly. Subsequently, new 3-D analytical glide formulas are derived for these inversely-proportional profiles and then used to determine the profile parameters and bank reversals. Due to the careful design, the guidance is capable of steering the high-L/D vehicle to any place on the Earth accurately while achieving almost constant commands during the steady glide phase, a major phase of flight. The superior performance of the guidance is verified by the Monte Carlo simulations with challenging disturbances including initial state dispersions, aerodynamic uncertainties, and atmospheric perturbations.

AB This paper presents a fuzzy logic control for the navigation of a mobile robotic system in gas pipelines. The robotic system is designed for a local gas distribution pipeline network with 150-300 mm diameter pipes; common pipe fittings in use are straight and bend sections, reducers and slope pipe sections. The navigation problem forms a part of the current development of a new modular and semi-autonomous vehicle system. The vehicle control and navigation technique Is implemented using a two-mode controller consisting of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and fuzzy logic control. The PID controller is responsible for direct control of the actuators, while the fuzzy logic controller is used to evaluate as well as to define the sensor outputs such as speed, climbing angle and rate of climbing angle in order to perceive the different types of pipe environment and vehicle actions. Since the navigation problem involves a multivariable input-output (MIMO) system, a cascaded hierarchical fuzzy model configuration is used to reduce the dimensionality of the fuzzy model. The fuzzy navigation controller is thus an interlink fuzzy subsystem of the pipe environment recognition and action adjustment subsystems. Results of simulations and laboratory experiments are presented to demonstrate the ability of the control strategy. A brief description of the mobile robotic system used is presented as background.

AB Currently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs) are used in many fields, among which UAV locali-zation is the key to UAV autonomous flight capability, and how to locate UAVs in the absence of GNSS signals is a difficult task. In recent years, deep learning has developed rapidly, among which convolutional neural networks are widely used in visual images. In this paper, we apply the convolutional neural network DenseNet to the task of matching between UAV images and satellite remote sensing images for visual localization of UAVs. We make some improvements to address the problems in practice. We propose a quality-aware template matching method based on adaptive adjustment of convolutional feature weights to enhance the feature extraction capability of the model, and introduce a fusion mechanism of multi-scale feature layers. The feature maps of UAV images and satellite images are quality scored so as to locate the position of UAV in satellite images. Qualitative and quantitative experiments are conducted, and the results show the effectiveness and superiority of the method.

AB Collision-free path planning is a major challenge in managing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) fleets, especially in uncertain environments. In this paper, we consider the design of UAV routing policies using multi-agent reinforcement learning, and propose a Multi-resolution, Multi-agent, Mean-field reinforcement learning algorithm, named 3M-RL, for flight planning, where multiple vehicles need to avoid collisions with each other while moving towards their destinations. In the system we consider, each UAV makes decisions based on local observations, and does not communicate with other UAVs. The algorithm trains a routing policy using an Actor-Critic neural network with multi-resolution observations, including detailed local information and aggregated global information based on mean-field. The algorithm tackles the curse-of-dimensionality problem in multi-agent reinforcement learning and provides a scalable solution. We test our algorithm in different complex scenarios in both 2D and 3D space and our simulation results show that 3M-RL result in good routing policies.

AB Over recent decades, we have witnessed a widescale deterioration in seagrass habitats in the Mediterranean Sea. Although the causes underlying this regression are not yet clear, there is a broad consensus that new methods are required to generate high-quality data on seagrass meadows. Specifically, there is a lack of available data in order to assess changes over time in the spatial distribution of seagrass. This article introduces a new methodology to ease data-gathering operations in Posidonia oceanica meadows for benthic mapping, by using the latest developments in lightweight autonomous vehicles and image processing. The proposed methodology has been designed to build a series of online maps, by employing an input data feed based on an encoder?decoder convolutional neural network (CNN) that automatically segments the images recorded by the vehicle. In turn, it uses a sparse Gaussian Process (GP) to map uncertainty linked to the spatial distribution of seagrass. This article presents the most suitable CNN and GP, as well as performance validation results for the method, based on data acquired in three field tests.

AB In recent years, aided navigation systems through combining inertial navigation system (INS) with global navigation satellite system (GNSS) have been widely applied to enhance the position, velocity, and attitude information of autonomous vehicles. In order to gain the accuracy of the aided INS/GNSS in GNSS gap intervals, a heuristic neural network structure based on the recurrent fuzzy wavelet neural network (RFWNN) is applicable for INS velocity and position error compensation purpose. During frequent access to GNSS data, the RFWNN should be trained as a highly precise prediction model equipped with the Kalman filter algorithm. Therefore, the INS velocity and position error data are obtainable along with the lost intervals of GNSS signals. For performance assessment of the proposed RFWNN-aided INS/GNSS, real flight test data of a small commercial unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were conducted. A comparison of test results shows that the proposed NN algorithm could efficiently provide high-accuracy corrections on the INS velocity and position information during GNSS outages.

AB Online approximation of the optimal station-keeping strategy for a marine craft subject to an irrotational current is considered. An approximate policy that minimizes a user-defined cost function over an infinite time horizon is obtained using an actor-critic-identifier-based adaptive dynamic programming technique. The hydrodynamic drift dynamics are assumed to be unknown; therefore, a concurrent learning-based system identifier is developed to identify the unknown model parameters. The identified model is used to implement an adaptive model-based reinforcement learning technique to estimate the unknown value function. The developed policy guarantees uniformly ultimately bounded convergence of the vehicle to the desired station and uniformly ultimately bounded convergence of the approximated policies to the optimal polices without the requirement of persistence of excitation. The developed strategy is validated using an autonomous underwater vehicle, where the three degrees-of-freedom in the horizontal plane are regulated. The experiments are conducted in a second-magnitude spring located in central Florida.

AB This brief presents the results relative to the design and flight testing of formation control laws using a set of YF-22 research unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) designed, built, and instrumented at West Virginia University, Morgantown. In the formation flight configuration, a radio control pilot maintains ground control of the "leader" aircraft while the autonomous "follower" aircraft maintains a predefined position and orientation with respect to the "leader" aircraft. The formation controller was designed to have an inner and outerloop structure, where the outerloop guidance control laws minimized the forward, lateral, and vertical distance error by controlling the engine propulsion and generating the desired pitch and roll angles to be tracked by the innerloop controller. The horizontal components of the outerloop controller were designed using a nonlinear dynamic inversion (NLDI) approach, while the vertical channel of the outerloop controller and the innerloop control laws were instead linear. Flight testing results from two-aircraft formation flights confirmed the performance of the designed formation controller.

ID SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION
AB The objective of the autonomous navigation and sensing experiment research (ANSER) project is to demonstrate decentralized fusion (DDF) and simultaneous localization and map building data (SLAM) across multiple uninhabited air vehicles (UAVs). To achieve this objective, the project specifies the development of four UAVs, where each UAV houses up to two terrain sensors and an INS/GPS navigation system. The terrain sensors include a scanning radar, laser/vision and standard vision system. The DDF concept has to be shown to be effective both on a single UAV and on multiple UAVs. The proof of the concept will lie in the ability of the DDF structure to conduct multi-target tracking problems as well as SLAM. To obtain this goal, a number of subgoals are required, most of which have never been attempted before on a research level. The objective of this paper is to present these goals as an overview of the ANSER project along with some simulated and real-time results.

AB We consider multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serving a density of ground terminals (GTs) as base stations. The objective is to minimize the outage probability of GT-to-UAV transmissions. Optimal placement of UAVs under different UAV altitude constraints and GT densities is studied. A practical variant of the Rician fading model, which has been developed by Azari et al. (2018) specifically for UAV systems, is used to model the communication channels. First, the structure of optimal deployments is determined when the common altitude constraint is large. For a wide class of GT densities, it is shown that all UAVs should be placed to the same location in an optimal deployment. A design implication is that one can use a single multi-antenna UAV as opposed to multiple single-antenna UAVs without loss of optimality. Next, using a random deployment argument, a general upper bound on the optimal outage probability is found for any density of GTs and any number of UAVs. Further, for any arbitrary user density, centralized and distributed numerical algorithms are designed using particle swarm optimization and modified gradient descent algorithms, respectively. Simulations show that our distributed algorithm provides almost optimal results even with considerably reduced communication and sensing ranges at the UAVs.

AB Autonomous Vehicle Platooning (AVP) presents a promising approach to reducing energy expenses, improving traffic safety, and enhancing capacity. In multi-platoon vehicular networks, platoons can collaborate to ensure better data transfer reliability. However, the existing secure information-sharing methods between platoons face efficiency and security challenges. These challenges arise from (1) a lack of an efficient method to simultaneously ensure confidentiality, authenticity, and non-repudiation of the transmitted information; (2) difficulty in cross-domain dynamically sharing ciphertexts to multiple recipients is challenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Flexible Cross-domain Data Access Control (FC-DAC) system in this paper. Our FC-DAC system ensures confidentiality, authenticity, and non-repudiation of transmitted information while enabling high-efficiency ciphertext sharing between various platoons. Additionally, the FC-DAC solution allows vehicles with valid authorizations to access signcrypted information quickly and efficiently, even if they belong to different platoons. Our theoretical and experimental analysis demonstrates that the FC-DAC scheme is resistant to various common attacks and is applicable to multi-platoon vehicular networks.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are now becoming increasingly accessible to amateur and commercial users alike. Several types of airspace structures have been proposed in recent research, which include several structured free flight concepts. In this paper, for simplicity, distributed coordination of the motions of cooperative multicopters in structured airspace concepts is focused on. This is formulated as a free flight problem, including convergence to destination lines/planes and inter-agent collision avoidance. The destination line of each multicopter is known a priori. Further, Lyapunov-like functions are designed elaborately, while formal analysis and proofs of the proposed distributed control are given to show that the free flight control problem can be solved. What is more, by the proposed controller, a multicopter can keep away from another as soon as possible once it enters the safety area of another one. Simulations and experiments are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB The development of non-destructive, non-contact and autonomous unmanned techniques is extremely important for the preservation of heritage integrity. This paper presents a digital integrated methodology combining Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS), Aerial Digital Photogrammetry (ADP) and Infrared Thermography (IRT), which accelerate data collection and facilitate the creation of point clouds, the deterioration mapping and the state of conservation monitoring of historic structures. Both Digital Photogrammetry and Infrared Thermography were coupled with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The proposed methodology was applied to the Moorish Castle in Sintra, Portugal. Manual Infrared Thermography, complemented with other traditional non-destructive techniques, were also applied in a pilot area for comparison purposes. Results: demonstrate the high potential of the integration of TLS, ADP and IRT techniques for heritage modelling digitalization, inspection and deterioration mapping with a positive impact on conservation and restoration projects.

AB This paper studies the time-varying formation reconfiguration control for multiple underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with an Euler-Lagrange-like model. The goal is to control a fleet of AUVs to achieve any desired formation shape using a distance-based graph rigidity and affine transformation (GR-AT) algorithm. Firstly, the distance-based graph rigidity with backstepping technology is utilized to solve the formation controlproblem, and we acquire the initial nominal formation. In the sequel, we transform the nominal formation into any desired formation shape using the properties of the affine transformation (including translation, scaling, rotation, shearing, or a combination of them). Even the geometric shapes formed can be constantly changed. The Lyapunov stability theory can ensure the uniform ultimate boundedness of whole distance errors. Finally, several simulation examples with formation reconfiguration are given to validate the efficacy of the designed control methods. Moreover, some experimental results are presented to confirm the validity and applicability of the scheme with four real bionic robot fish.

AB This letter presents the risk-aware fast trajectory planner (RAFTER) for autonomous vehicles in dynamic uncertain environments, which is based on the probabilistic surrogate reliability of other traffic participants and risk contours. In contrast to the conventional risk metric, RAFTER not only provides the upper bound of the probability of constraint violation but deduces an infimum on the risk which the controlled plant can stand by the probabilistic reliable surrogate model. Such a risk-aware algorithm is capable of perceiving uncertainty and handling robustness. A series of covering disks are constructed utilizing a concise geometric configuration for a lower conservatism representation of the vehicle profile, which attains a desirable tradeoff between the quantity and area of occupation. Safe travel corridors are built on the dilated map via covering disks, significantly reducing the computational burden of a reliability-based optimization procedure for optimal trajectory planning. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by two numerical simulations derived from real scenarios.

AB This paper develops a novel self-discipline predictive control (SPC) scheme to compensate the missing control inputs of networked control systems (NCS) under arbitrary bounded packet dropouts. Since no feedback measurements are available when there are packet dropouts, the key idea of SPC scheme is that one can adjust its controller gains only based on the latest received state measurement rather than waiting the next available measurement. Then, the future controller gains are predicted by using input delay approach while input to state stability (ISS) is arrived under Lypunov-Krasovskii method and switched system framework. In what follows, the SPC scheme based on the predicted controller gains are used to update the control inputs during packet dropout intervals. A main advantage of this work lies in that the proposed SPC scheme realises a self-stabilisation with only limited feedback measurements under large-scale packet dropouts. At last, simulations on path following control of autonomous vehicles are carried out to show the validity of the proposed SPC scheme.

AB Scene categorization is an indispensable technique in intelligent systems, such as scene parsing, video surveillance or autonomous driving. Considering traffic analysis under big data, in this paper, we propose scene categorization towards urban tunnel traffic based on image quality assessment. Specifically, the dataset is obtained through analyzing urban tunnel traffic incidents from 2016 to 2018. And we classify the traffic accidents in the big data environment. Then, the vehicles in the surveillance videos are extracted using conventional detector. The spatial information of vehicles in the image reflects the traffic situation. In order to encode such important information, we leverage the information clustering algorithm based on information entropy for image classification. Afterward, we establish a quality evaluation model based on each clustered images. The trained image quality assessment model will guide tunnel traffic classification and event analysis. The experimental results show the correct rate is more than 90%, and the overall detection effect is better than the k-modes algorithm and the Ng'k-modes algorithm. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB Autonomous off-road navigation and obstacle avoidance are central to applications of unmanned ground vehicles (UGV). This requires the sensors to have the ability to sense obstacles outdoors or in unstructured environments. Radar sensors, which have the ability to operate in all weather, all lighting, and foliage-covered conditions, have been widely used. We focus on the perception ability of forward-imaging interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), which can provide three-dimensional scene information of unstructured environments for UGV. An InSAR signal processing flow, similar to the techniques of stereo pair airborne InSAR, is tailored to acquiring the height information of the scene. The InSAR can output three different kinds of images: the scattering image, the coherence image, and the elevation image. Simulation and real data experiments have been carried out on a terrain scene where there are positive and negative obstacles to validate the proposed method and the perception performance of the InSAR, and the special feature differences of obstacles are prominent in the InSAR images.

AB On the path to high-level vehicle automation, the degree of surveillance both inside and outside the car increases significantly. Consequently, ethical considerations are becoming central to questions around surveillance regimes and data privacy implicit in level 3 and 4 vehicle automation. In this paper, we focus on outputs from the EU Horizon 2020 project Vision Inspired Driver Assistance Systems (VI-DAS). In particular, we assess the VI-DAS 720-degree observation technology, critical to ensuring a safe Human Machine Interaction (HMI), from multiple theoretical perspectives to contribute to a better understanding of the phenomena of privacy. As a synonym for surveillance, we started our evaluation with Bentham's ideation of the panopticon. From there, it is a relatively short step to radical Foucauldian critiques that offered more dystopian technologies of power. However, both theorems demonstrate a limited understanding of the issue of data privacy in the context of safe transportation along the evolution of highly automated vehicles. Thus, to allow the debate to move beyond more binary discussions on privacy versus control/power and to a certain degree escape the shadow of the panopticon, we applied the Nissenbaum four theses framework of Contextual Integrity (CI). Her decision heuristic allowed us to introduce structure and a degree of precision in our thinking on the matter of privacy that represents a step forward to phenomena of privacy in a specific context. Our approach concludes that the VI-DAS 720-degree observation technology can respect the user's privacy through an appropriate flow of personal information. However, the flows of personal data must be strongly regulated to ensure that data is seen as a value in terms of a commodity to protect human life and not seen as an asset that needs to be turned into value in terms of capital or the facilitation of asymmetric power-relations.

AB The connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies have made great progresses. It has been commonly accepted that CV or AV technologies would reduce human errors in driving and benefit traffic safety. However, the answer of how many crashes can be prevented because of CV or AV technologies has not reached a consistent conclusion. In order to quantitatively answer this question, this study used meta-analysis to evaluate the safety effectiveness of nine common and important CV or AV technologies, and tested the safety effectiveness of these technologies for six countries. First, 73 studies about the safety impact of CV or AV technologies were filtered out from 826 CAV-related papers or reports. Second, the safety impacts of these technologies with regard to assistant types and triggering times have been compared. It shows AV technologies can play a more significant role than CV technologies, and the technologies with closer triggering time to collision time have greater safety effectiveness. Third, in the meta-analysis, the random effect model was used to evaluate the safety effectiveness, and the funnel plots and trim-and-fill method were used to evaluate and adjust publication bias, so as to objectively evaluate the safety effectiveness of each technology. Then, according to the crash data of six countries, the comprehensive safety effectiveness and compilation of safety effectiveness of the above technologies were calculated. The results show that if all of technologies were implemented in the six countries, the average number of crashes could be reduced by 3.40 million, among which the India would reduce the most (54.24%). Additionally, different countries should develop different development strategies, e.g., USA should prioritize the development of the lane change warning and intersection warning, the UK should prioritize applications related to intersection warning and rear-end warning. Overall, this study provides comprehensive and quantitative understating of the safety effectiveness of CA or AV technologies and would contribute to government, vehicle companies, and agencies in deciding the development priority of CA or AV technologies.

AB Ensuring the freshness of high Value of Information (VoI) data has a significant practice meaning for marine observations and emergencies. The traditional forward method with an auv-aid is used to ensure the freshness of high VoI data. However, the methods suffer from two issues: an insufficient high VoI data throughput and random forwarding for cluster heads (CHs). The AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) with limited energy cannot meet the demand for the random generation of high VoI data. Low VoI data packets compete with high VoI data packets for channels, resulting in an insufficient high VoI data throughput and a low freshness. To address the above issues, we propose the Data Access Channel Scheme based on High Value of Information (DACS-HVOI), which is suitable for prioritizing the transmission packets with a high VoI. First, according to the level of VoI, the packets are divided into K classes, and the packets that are collected and forwarded by the AUV are defined as the highest K+1 class. Second, based on prior knowledge in the network, a Markov chain algorithm-based method is employed to predict which nodes should preferentially use the channel, to avoid conflict between a low and high VoI. Third, based on the stochastic fluid theory, a multilevel queueing system for CHs are constructed to avoid random forwarding. Last, compared with state-of-art protocols, experimental simulation shows that the proposed scheme has a low latency and high network throughput, while improving the throughput of high-VoI packets and ensuring the priority transmission of high-VoI packets.

AB The exploitation/utilization of marine resources and the rapid development of urbanization along coastal cities result in serious marine pollution, especially underwater diffusion pollution. It is a non-trivial task to detect the source of diffusion pollution, such that the disadvantageous effect of the pollution can be reduced. With the vision of 6G framework, we employ Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) flock and introduce the concept of AUV-based network. In particular, we utilize the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technique to update the controllability of the AUV-based network, leading to the paradigm of SDN-enabled multi-AUVs network Intelligent Transportation Systems (SDNA-ITS). For SDNA-ITS, we utilize artificial potential field theories to model the control model. To optimize the system output, we introduce the graph-based Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, i.e., a category of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) mechanism where each AUV can be regarded as a node in a graph. In particular, we improve the optimization model based on Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) architecture with the assistance of the SDN controller, by which each AUV can efficiently adjust its speed towards the diffusion source. Further, to achieve exact path planning for detecting the diffusion source, a dynamic detection scheme is proposed to output the united control policy to schedule the SDNA-ITS dynamically. Simulation results demonstrate that our approaches are available to detect the underwater diffusion source when the actual scenario is taken into account and perform better than some recent research products.

AB Seamless positioning systems for complex environments have been a popular focus of research on positioning safety for autonomous vehicles (AVs). In particular, the seamless high-precision positioning of AVs indoors and outdoors still poses considerable challenges and requires continuous, reliable, and high-precision positioning information to guarantee the safety of driving. To obtain effective positioning information, multiconstellation global navigation satellite system (multi-GNSS) real-time kinematics (RTK) and an inertial navigation system (INS) have been widely integrated into AVs. However, integrated multi-GNSS and INS applications cannot provide effective and seamless positioning results for AVs in indoor and outdoor environments due to limited satellite availability, multipath effects, frequent signal blockages, and the lack of GNSS signals indoors. In this contribution, multi-GNSS-tightly coupled (TC) RTK/INS technology is developed to solve the positioning problem for a challenging urban outdoor environment. In addition, ultrawideband (UWB)/INS technology is developed to provide accurate and continuous positioning results in indoor environments, and INS and map information are used to identify and eliminate UWB non-line-of-sight (NLOS) errors. Finally, an improved adaptive robust extended Kalman filter (AREKF) algorithm based on a TC integrated single-frequency multi-GNSS-TC RTK/UWB/INS/map system is studied to provide continuous, reliable, high-precision positioning information to AVs in indoor and outdoor environments. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is capable of seamlessly guaranteeing the positioning accuracy of AVs in complex indoor and outdoor environments involving many measurement outliers and environmental interference effects.

AB Real-world traffic sign recognition is an important step toward building autonomous vehicles, most of which highly dependent on deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are surprisingly susceptible to adversarial examples. Many attack methods have been proposed to understand and generate adversarial examples, such as gradient-based attack, score-based attack, decision-based attack, and transfer-based attacks. However, most of these algorithms are ineffective in real-world road sign attack, because 1) iteratively learning perturbations for each frame is not realistic for a fast moving car and 2) most optimization algorithms traverse all pixels equally without considering their diverse contribution. To alleviate these problems, this article proposes the targeted attention attack (TAA) method for real-world road sign attack. Specifically, we have made the following contributions: 1) we leverage the soft attention map to highlight those important pixels and skip those zero-contributed areas-this also helps to generate natural perturbations; 2) we design an efficient universal attack that optimizes a single perturbation/noise based on a set of training images under the guidance of the pretrained attention map; 3) we design a simple objective function that can be easily optimized; and 4) we evaluate the effectiveness of TAA on real-world data sets. Experimental results validate that the TAA method improves the attack successful rate (nearly 10%) and reduces the perturbation loss (about a quarter) compared with the popular RP2 method. Additionally, our TAA also provides good properties, e.g., transferability and generalization capability. We provide code and data to ensure the reproducibility: https://github.com/AdvAttack/RoadSignAttack.

AB This paper reviews various sensor technologies with application in automobiles and robots. Several automotive sensors have been developed using the micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology. The technologies related to combustion pressure sensors, yaw rate sensors, acceleration sensors, and optical scanners are described here. The combustion pressure sensors are used for engine control, while the yaw rate sensors of quartz and silicon crystals and the acceleration sensors are applied for vehicle motion control. Optical scanners are developed for autonomous driving. Several automotive sensors have been significantly reduced in size and cost, and their performance has been improved dramatically by MEMS technology. The inertial force-sensing system with yaw rate and acceleration sensors enabled the assistant and partner robots to stand on two legs, walk, or invert and move on two wheels. Because the robots are required to have a variety of sensors, a nerve-net sensing system was developed. This sensing system has three layers: the host, relay, and sensor nodes. The sensor node is a special large-scale integration called a 'nerve-net chip.' A triaxial force tactile sensor integrated with the nerve-net chip was developed as a 2.8-mm square surface-mountable chip. A force and thermal tactile sensor was also developed, which detected heat flows and discriminated the materials of contacted objects. The heat flow sensor was thinned with thin-film technology. The sensor technologies will be used for eco cars and autonomous vehicles. Next-generation robots are also supported by several automotive sensor technologies.

AB Autonomous vehicle-based storage and retrieval systems are commonly used in many fulfillment centers (e.g., e-commerce warehouses), because they allow a high- and flexible-throughput capacity. In these systems, roaming robots transport loads between a storage location and a workstation. Two main variants exist: horizontal, where the robots only move horizontally and use lifts for vertical transport, and a new variant vertical, where the robots can also travel vertically in the rack. This paper builds a framework to analyze the performance of the vertical system and compare its throughput capacity with the horizontal system. We build closed queueing network models for this that, in turn, are used to optimize the design. The results show that the optimal height-to-width ratio of a vertical system is around one. Because a large number of system robots may lead to blocking and delays, we compare the effects of different robot blocking protocols on the system throughput: robot Recirculation and Wait-on-Spot. The Wait-on-Spot policy produces a higher system throughput when the number of robots in the system is small. However, for a large number of robots in the system, the Recirculation policy dominates the Wait-on-Spot policy. Finally, we compare the operational costs of the vertical and horizontal transport systems. For systems with one load/unload (L/U) point, the vertical system always produces a similar or higher system throughput with a lower operating cost compared with the horizontal system with a discrete lift. It also outperforms the horizontal system with a continuous lift in systems with two L/U points.

AB In this study, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) was used to test this technology as a viable tool for directly observing the behaviour of marine animals and to investigate the behaviour, habitat use and feeding ecology of white sharks Carcharodon carcharias near Guadalupe Island off the coast of Mexico. During the period 31 October to 7 November 2013, six AUV missions were conducted to track one male and three female C. carcharias, ranging in estimated total length (L-T) from 39 to 57 m, off the north-east coast of Guadalupe Island. In doing so, the AUV generated over 13 h of behavioural data for C. carcharias at depths down to 90 m. The sharks remained in the area for the duration of each mission and moved through broad depth and temperature ranges from the surface to 1638 m depth (mean +/- s.d. = 1125 +/- 403 m) and 79-271 degrees C (mean +/- s.d. = 127 +/- 29 degrees C), respectively. Video footage and AUV sensor data revealed that two of the C. carcharias being tracked and eight other C. carcharias in the area approached (n = 17), bumped (n = 4) and bit (n = 9) the AUV during these tracks. This study demonstrated that an AUV can be used to effectively track and observe the behaviour of a large pelagic animal, C. carcharias. In doing so, the first observations of subsurface predatory behaviour were generated for this species. At its current state of development, this technology clearly offers a new and innovative tool for tracking the fine-scale behaviour of marine animals.

AB Dedicated Lanes (DLs) have been proposed as a potential scenario for the deployment of Automated and/or Connected Vehicles (C/AVs) on the road network. However, evidence-based knowledge regarding the impacts of different design configurations, utilization policies, and the design of their access/egress on traffic safety and efficiency is limited. In order to develop an adequate design for DLs, first, a conceptual framework describing the relations and interrelations between these factors and traffic safety and efficiency is needed. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework accounting for the factors that could affect the safety and efficiency of DLs. This conceptual framework is underpinned based on relevant literature on how the deployment of C/AVs, driver behaviour, and DL design and operation affect traffic safety and efficiency. Based on the conceptual framework, the knowledge gaps on DL design for C/AVs were identified and a research agenda, including prioritization of the research needs, is proposed. Following the developed conceptual framework, the necessary building blocks for investigating the impacts of different design configurations, utilization policies, and the design of their access/egress on traffic safety and efficiency are: (1) to specify the types of vehicles with certain capabilities allowed to drive on DLs; (2) to incorporate existing algorithms of C/AVs, which reflect more realistically their behaviour, in both driving simulator experiments and microscopic simulation; (3) to translate the empirical data regarding human behavioural adaptation collected from field tests and driving simulator studies to mathematical models and implement them in traffic flow simulation platform. It is also recommended to develop automated lane change algorithms, taking into account connectivity between C/AVs which can be also implemented in driving simulators and traffic flow simulation platforms.
   Finally, it is recommended that future research investigate the combined effects of traffic safety and efficiency in designing DLs while considering driver behaviour adaptation and control transitions between manual and automated operation.

DE Mobile Sensor Network; Unmanned Air Vehicles
AB In the last decade we have witnessed an unprecedented development of Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) for missions with high societal impact. Future generations of UAV systems will reflect the major current trends: increased levels of autonomy, lower cost, longer endurance, and networking capabilities. Networking is one of the major trends for unmanned vehicle systems; it is also one of the enabling technologies for distributed cooperation (and computation). In mobile network systems, vehicles, sensors and operators interact through (inter-operated) communication networks. Dynamic networks of UAVs can be used in a broad range of missions like border patrol, tracking of pollution at sea, and oceanographic and environmental research. The Portuguese Air Force Academy and the School of Engineering at Porto University have been collaborating, since 2006, on the design, implementation and testing of different types of UAVs to demonstrate these technologies in a wide spectrum of military/civil missions. This is a multi-disciplinary cooperation encompassing several technological fields: advanced vision systems for identification and tracking of fixed and mobile features, cooperative control of teams of UAVs in mixed-initiative environments, sensor fusion and navigation systems. These technologies are being developed and integrated into UAV platforms for demonstration in military missions like reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition, and also in several civil missions like aerial gravimetry, aerial photography, surveillance and control of maritime traffic, fishing surveillance, and detection and control of coastal hazards. This paper reports on these developments and on the demonstrations that took place in the last two years. We report on video surveillance and environmental monitoring operations with six different types of fixed-wing UAVs (wingspans ranging from I to 6 meters), with autonomous take-off and landing capabilities. The smaller platforms can be easily deployed (hand-launched) while the others are more suitable for endurance and larger payloads.

AB In this paper, an observer-based adaptive control method is investigated for the horizontal trajectory tracking of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) with input saturation and system disturbances. Firstly, the desired surge speed and trajectory angle are established, which could decouple the tracking error subsystem and avoid the complex form. Secondly, the input saturation is approximated by a smooth function, and a nonlinear extended states observer (NESO) is designed for estimating system disturbances. Based on the command filtered backstepping technique, which can avoid the explosion caused by the derivative of the virtual control, an observer-based adaptive output feedback control method is developed, and an auxiliary system is applied to compensate for filtered tracking errors, input saturation bias, and observer errors. Finally, simulation results show the proposed method has good robustness in the face of system uncertainties, and the error is nearly 33.3% smaller than that of other control methods when meeting sudden trajectory changes. A good control performance is guaranteed.

AB This letter presents the design and experimental study of an adaptive nonlinear controller for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the presence of unknown time-varying disturbances, and model parametric uncertainty. We employ an adaptive Neural Network (NN), used to approximate the partially unknown system, in tandem with a simple controller designed for trajectory tracking, not of the center of mass, but of a point located along the UAV's vertical body axis. This strategy allows: (i) to avoid the two-subsystems control paradigm generally adopted by conventional UAV controllers; (ii) all control inputs to be defined at once; and (iii) to lump all unknown dynamics from both translational and rotational levels into a single vector term. The weights of the NN are determined online by an adaptive law based on the Lyapunov synthesis method. The tracking and adaptation errors are shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation and experimental results, including comparison data, are provided to validate and assess the proposed control solution.

AB Automotive companies have studied the development of lane support systems in order to secure the Euro New Car Assessment Program (NCAP)'s high score. A front camera module is applied with safety assistance systems in an intelligent vehicle. However, the front camera module has limitations in terms of backlight conditions, entering or exiting tunnels, and night driving because of lower image quality. In this paper, we propose an integrated camera with dual light sensor for improving lane detection performance under the worst conditions. We include a new algorithm to enhance image data quality and improve edge detection and lane tracking using illumination information. We evaluate the tests under various conditions on a real road. These tests are performed on 728 km of road (under various external situations and lane types) for false alarm rates. The experimental results show that the system is promising in terms of reliability, enhancement, and improvements.

AB Finding the boundaries of the drivable space is a key to the development of any advanced driver assistance systems with automated driving functions. A common approach found in the literature is to combine the information of digital maps with multiple on-board sensors for building a robust and accurate model of the environment from which to extract the navigable space. In this sense, the digital map is the crucial component for relating the location of the vehicle and identifying the different road features. This paper presents an automatic procedure for generating driving corridors from OpenStreetMap. The proposed method expands the original map representation, replacing polylines by polynomial-based roads, whose sections are defined using cubic Bezier curves. All curves are automatically adjusted from the original road description, thus generating an efficient and accurate road representation without human intervention. Finally, the driving corridors are generated as a concatenation of the modified road sections along a planned route. The proposed approach has been validated in a peri-urban environment, for which corridors where successfully generated in all cases.

ID ASSIGNMENT
AB The use of multiple aerial vehicles for autonomous missions is turning into commonplace. In many of these applications, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have to cooperate and navigate in a shared airspace, becoming 3D collision avoidance a relevant issue. Outdoor scenarios impose additional challenges: (i) accurate positioning systems are costly; (ii) communication can be unreliable or delayed; and (iii) external conditions like wind gusts affect UAVs' maneuverability. In this paper, we present 3D-SWAP, a decentralized algorithm for 3D collision avoidance with multiple UAVs. 3D-SWAP operates reactively without high computational requirements and allows UAVs to integrate measurements from their local sensors with positions of other teammates within communication range. We tested 3D-SWAP with our team of custom-designed UAVs. First, we used a Software-In-The-Loop simulator for system integration and evaluation. Second, we run field experiments with up to three UAVs in an outdoor scenario with uncontrolled conditions (i.e., noisy positioning systems, wind gusts, etc). We report our results and our procedures for this field experimentation.

AB In recent years, using a network of autonomous and cooperative unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) without command and communication from the ground station has become more imperative, particularly in search-and-rescue operations, disaster management, and other applications where human intervention is limited. In such scenarios, UAVs can make more efficient decisions if they acquire more information about the mobility, sensing and actuation capabilities of their neighbor nodes. In this study, we develop an unsupervised online learning algorithm for joint mobility prediction and object profiling of UAVs, to facilitate control and communication protocols. The proposed method not only predicts the future locations of the surrounding flying objects, but also classifies them into different groups with similar levels of maneuverability (e.g., rotatory and fixed-wing UAVs) without prior knowledge regarding these classes. This method is flexible in admitting new object types with unknown mobility profiles, and is thereby applicable to emerging flying ad-hoc networks (FANETs) with heterogeneous nodes.

AB Fish's outstanding motion and coordination performance make it an excellent source of inspiration for scientists and engineers aiming to design and control next-generation autonomous underwater vehicles within the framework of bionics. This paper offers a general review of the current status of bionic robotic fish, with particular emphasis on the hydrodynamic modeling and testing, kinematic modeling and control, learning and optimization, as well as motion coordination control. Among these aspects, representative studies based on ideas and concepts inspired from fish motion and coordination are discussed. At last, the major challenges and the future research directions are addressed in the context of integration of various research streams from ichthyologic, hydrodynamic, mechanical, electronic, control, and artificial intelligence. Further development of bionic robotic fish can be utilized to execute some specific missions in complex underwater environments, where operations are unsafe or impractical for divers or conventional underwater vehicles.

AB Nature has been a source of inspiration for developing advanced autonomous aerial and underwater vehicles. The bodies with flapping appendages produce Center of Mass (COM) oscillations as the flapping fins generate forces oscillatory in nature. The vehicles with larger COM oscillations pose the problems of control and maneuverability and this paper discusses the effect of flexibility and other operating parameters such as heaving, pitching amplitudes and operating frequency on COM oscillations. A detailed theoretical investigation has been carried out to predict the optimal operating parameters along with the fin stiffness to reduce the COM oscillations for a given Self-Propelled Speed (SPS). Experiments have been performed to validate the theoretical results. It has been observed that the flexible fins operating at larger frequencies produce lower COM oscillations compared to stiffer fins operating at lower frequencies for a given mean thrust/SPS, and that the trailing edge amplitude along with the deformation pattern play a role in the generation of COM oscillations.

AB Attitude control of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a difficult control problem in part due to uncertain nonlinear dynamics, actuator constraints, and coupled longitudinal and lateral motions. Current state-of-the-art autopilots are based on linear control and are thus limited in their effectiveness and performance. drl is a machine learning method to automatically discover optimal control laws through interaction with the controlled system that can handle complex nonlinear dynamics. We show in this article that deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can successfully learn to perform attitude control of a fixed-wing UAV operating directly on the original nonlinear dynamics, requiring as little as 3 min of flight data. We initially train our model in a simulation environment and then deploy the learned controller on the UAV in flight tests, demonstrating comparable performance to the state-of-the-art ArduPlane proportional-integral-derivative (PID) attitude controller with no further online learning required. Learning with significant actuation delay and diversified simulated dynamics were found to be crucial for successful transfer to control of the real UAV. In addition to a qualitative comparison with the ArduPlane autopilot, we present a quantitative assessment based on linear analysis to better understand the learning controller's behavior.

AB This article focuses on the event-based finite-time neural attitude consensus control problem for the six-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems with unknown disturbances. It is assumed that the six-rotor UAV systems are controlled by a human operator sending command signals to the leader. A disturbance observer and radial basis function neural networks (RBF NNs) are applied to address the problems regarding external disturbances and uncertain nonlinear dynamics, respectively. In addition, the proposed finite-time command filtered (FTCF) backstepping method effectively manages the issue of ``explosion of complexity,'' where filtering errors are eliminated by the error compensation mechanism. In addition, an event-triggered mechanism is considered to alleviate the communication burden between the controller and the actuator in practice. It is shown that all signals of the six-rotor UAV systems are bounded and the consensus errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin in finite time. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB One of the key challenges in the adoption of wireless charging for Electric Vehicles (EVs) is the misalignment between the power pads. This manuscript presents an intelligent alignment of the receiving coil to reduce the magnetic leakage between the coupling power pads. The proposed solution implicates sensors to detect the flux strength at the corners and the middle of the receiver coil. A two-dimensional control technique is used for positioning of the receiver coil controlled through the stepper motor driver and a controller circuit. An array of the Hall effect sensor is installed on the receiver to sense the flux, where sensor receiving the smallest flux will generate the least voltage. Further, the controller sends the command to shift the receiver coil to the direction of the sensor receiving highest flux. This manuscript evaluates and verifies the magnetic flux pattern at the maximum alignment position between the transmitter and the receiver using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) on Ansys Maxwell (R). The proposed solution mitigates the flux leakage and improves the efficiency of the wireless power transfer. Theoretical analysis is performed and all the elements of the systems are briefly discussed and explained to develop the proposed system. The modeling and simulation results verify the advantage of proposed intelligent alignment. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As the delta-v-based injury models used to evaluate intelligent driving systems are always fitted with European or American crash database, they cannot achieve wide application in those countries where limited in-depth analysed crash data are recorded. An injury model which is based on easily accessible information, is urgently needed. In this study, a deformation depth based injury risk model is proposed to overcome the limitation of delta-v. First, a correlation between the vehicle deformation depth and occupant injury risk is verified from the aspects of retrospective safety assessment and stiffness cluster analysis using German in-depth accident study and national automotive sampling system-crashworthiness data system. Furthermore, injury risk-deformation functions are regressed for different stiffness clusters using the crash data. The fitting accuracy reaches 97%, higher than the existing literature. A novel safety benefit assessment simulation platform is built with the regressed injury risk model. Based on this platform, an autonomous emergency braking system is evaluated. Only 1% error of the safety benefit exists between the proposed model and the delta-v based one.

AB Unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) have rapidly developed as mobile sensor networks recently in the investigation, survey, and exploration of the underwater environment. The goal of this paper is to develop a practical and efficient formation control method to improve work efficiency of multi-UUV sensor networks. Distributed leader-follower formation controllers are designed based on a state feedback and consensus algorithm. Considering that each vehicle is subject to model uncertainties and current disturbances, a second-order integral UUV model with a nonlinear function is established using the state feedback linearized method under current disturbances. For unstable communication among UUVs, communication failure and acoustic link noise interference are considered. Two-layer random switching communication topologies are proposed to solve the problem of communication failure. For acoustic link noise interference, accurate representation of valid communication information and noise stripping when designing controllers is necessary. Effective communication topology weights are designed to represent the validity of communication information interfered by noise. Utilizing state feedback and noise stripping, sufficient conditions for design formation controllers are proposed to ensure UUV formation achieves consensus under model uncertainties, current disturbances, and unstable communication. The stability of formation controllers is proven by the Lyapunov-Razumikhin theorem, and the validity is verified by simulation results.

AB The success of drone missions is incumbent on an accurate determination of the drone pose and velocity, which are collectively estimated by fusing iner-tial measurement unit and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) mea-surements. However, during a GNSS outage, the long-term accuracy of these estimations are far from allowing practical use. In contrast, vehicle dynamic model (VDM)-based navigation has demonstrated significant improvement in autonomous positioning during GNSS outages. This improvement is achieved by incorporating mathematical models of aerodynamic forces/moments in the sensor fusion architecture. Such an approach, however, relies on a knowledge of aerodynamic model parameters, specific to the operating vehicle. We present a novel calibration algorithm to identify these parameters from the flight data of two geometrically different drones. The identified parameters, when used in the VDM framework, show a significant reduction in navigation drift during GNSS outages. Moreover, the obtained results show that the proposed algorithm is independent of the choice of fixed-wing platform and prior knowledge of aerodynamics.

AB Recent research on robotic fish mainly focused on the bionic structure design and realizing the movement with smart materials. Although many robotic fish have been proposed, most of these works were oriented toward shallow water environments and are mostly built with purely rigid structures, limiting the mobility and practical usability of robotic fish. Inspired by the stability of the real manta ray, a manta ray robot design is proposed with soft material made flapping wing based on an open-source ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle). The flapping wing structure with three different materials mimics the wide pectoral fins of real manta rays, which have bones, muscles, and skin. Furthermore, its modular design makes it easy to install and disassemble. The kinematic and hydrodynamic analysis of the manta ray robot are simulated in this paper. The actual manta ray robot is fabricated and several sets of test are performed in the pool. The robot can swim forward continually and stably with a simple rolling and pitching pattern.

AB This paper presents a study of distributed cooperative formation control of a generic multiple agent robots which is applicable for underwater system application such as multiple-autonomous surface vehicles (ASV). The control objective of the group of ASV agent is to maintain a certain formation in a predefined geometric pattern, notably a symmetric formation shape. In addition, the centroid of this to-be-sustained formation is to follow a designated leader agent whose dynamics resembles that of its followers. The contribution made in this paper is the introduction of an adaptive law capable of adjusting the strength of the state consensus control. Despite of partial information available to subset of agents, the formation control objective can still be achieved. The control scheme features a robustification term owed by a signum function which forces the state consensus error to zero. The control scheme is verified through numerical simulation which shows convergence of state consensus error to zero.

AB Large, pelagic rays (family Myliobatidae) that swim by flapping movements of wing-like pectoral fins use the mobuliform mode of swimming. These rays have pectoral fins with a triangular planform and streamlined cross-sectional geometry that would minimize drag. Thrust is produced by vertical oscillations of the fins with spanwise and chordwise flexibility. The thrust is derived from lift generated by the fins. Speed is modulated by changes in oscillatory frequency, whereas the amplitude of heave remains relatively constant with speed. Mobuliform swimming is considered to be a highly efficient means of propulsion. The Strouhal number for different species of myliobatoid rays is within the optimal range for efficient propulsion, except at low swimming speeds. The design of the body, posture of the pectoral fins, and mode of swimming provide a stable platform to resist external and internal perturbations, while permitting maneuverability. The advantages of mobuliform swimming can be exploited through the biomimetic approach to develop a bioinspired autonomous underwater vehicle.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel user-centric channel allocation scheme for high-speed terrestrial users of the Fifth Generation (5G) network in the millimetre-Wave (mm-Wave) band small-cells named Vehicular Frequency Reuse (VFR) scheme. To adapt the VFR scheme with the 5G network, we develop a new mobility management function that improves the 5G's performance for high-speed road users such as Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) in small-cells by reducing the number of handovers (HOs) in the Vehicle-to-Network (V2N) service. The VFR scheme significantly reduces the users' HO rate, control plane signalling in air interface, and improves link reliability and channel reuse ratio. A metric called Distance-Threshold (DT) is defined to determine the frequency reuse ratio for the 5G network with the VFR scheme. We also propose a new cell reselection procedure for high-speed users in RRC_Connected (Radio Resource Control) state that are using the VFR scheme and managed by our mobility management function. The proposed cell reselection procedure is defined for inter-gNB-DU (gNodeB-Distributed Unit) and intra-gNB-DU mobility. This procedure reduces traffic load on the UE's (User Equipment) air interface, lowers processing and signalling load for network nodes, and assists for seamless mobility management for high-speed users. These all help and facilitate the path towards the targeted zero millisecond mobility interruption time (MIT) for 5G-NR (New Radio) users. Moreover, the proposed scheme, function, and procedure are compatible with the existing 5G structure and user equipment and can be easily added to the network by only software patches. The proposed mobility management function separates low-speed and high-speed users to serve them accordingly with different sets of channels. To separate high-speed and low-speed users, we propose a simple scalar metric defined as a Velocity-Threshold (VT). The VT value is adaptively calculated by a K-Means approach which is a well known unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithm, according to the road condition inferred from reported velocities. Finally, we evaluate the proposed VFR scheme and compare it with the traditional cell-centric channel allocation scheme. Computer simulations show that the proposed VFR scheme can reduce the number of HOs (HO rate) for users by over 99% compared with the traditional scheme.

AB Adaptive routing and efficient packet delivery in Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) are significant challenges due to underlying environment constraints, such as dynamic nature, mobility, and limited connectivity. With the increasing number of machine learning (ML) applications in wireless networks, FANETs can benefit from these data-driven predictions. This letter proposes a Packet Arrival Prediction (PAP) routing protocol to improve transmission link reliability. Primarily, we apply a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict the packet arrival of each UAV, seeking to avoid the high-traffic UAVs, which cause packet loss significantly. Then, we formulate the routing decision issue as an optimization problem, which attempts to find an appropriate path by a proposed constrained sorting approach, in order to make joint yet fast routing decisions. The simulation results demonstrate that the PAP routing protocol outperforms the existing manifold protocols in the aspects of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and delay.

AB Due to the high altitude and deployment flexibility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used as relays to avoid obstacles and extend the coverage of wireless networks. On the other hand, ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) is often required to deliver the information reliably and timely for many emerging applications. In this correspondence, we combine the advantages of both UAV and URLLC to investigate the resource allocation for a URLLC-enabled two-way UAV relaying system. Our goal is to maximize the transmission rate of the backward link with the constraint of URLLC requirement for the forward link. The optimization is non-convex and difficult to solve. Therefore, the optimization variables are divided to several blocks, and three sub-problems are formulated and solved. Finally, an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve these sub-problems alternately. Simulation results show that the proposed joint optimization scheme can achieve excellent performance for the URLLC-enabled two-way UAV relaying system.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has been employed in oceanography applications based on a reliable navigation. The complex underwater environment leads to more velocity measurement errors of AUV, so it is difficult to determine the accurate navigation and positioning information. To solve the problem, a novel variational Bayesian-based filter for inaccurate input (VBFII) is proposed to determine the state information under the complex marine condition of inaccurate input. Firstly, the velocities are assumed to follow the Gaussian distribution, which can better describe the model of input information. Secondly, the augmentation method is used to augment the state vector and error covariance matrix to simplify calculation. The augmented state vector, the augmented predicted error covariance and measurement error noise matrices are derived more accurately based on the variational Bayesian (VB) approach. The experiment results show that the proposed VBFII has better estimation accuracy and robustness than other comparison algorithms.

AB The global positioning and orientation determination of marine vehicles is a challenging issue, especially in the distant sea scenarios where global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and/or magnetic compass failure. In this paper, a self-contained interactive iteration positioning and orientation coupled navigation method based on skylight polarization is proposed. To be more specific, by fusing the e-vectors and the gravity vectors, the orientation determination step is presented. Accordingly, the pitch, yaw, and roll angles can be calculated, and introduced into the global positioning step. In combination with the two steps, a coupled iteration mechanism of global positioning solution and orientation determination based on skylight polarization is constructed. According to the coupled iteration mechanism, the polarization-based geolocation and orientation can be thereby calculated under the complex scenarios where the GNSS or magnetic compass are disturbed. Finally, a set of simulations and field tests are carried out to validate the performance of the method.

SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING

AB A navigation grade Strapdown Inertial Navigation System (SINS) combined with a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) is widely used for autonomous navigation of underwater vehicles. Whether the DVL is able to provide continuous velocity measurements is of crucial importance to the integrated navigation precision. Considering that the DVL may fail during the missions, a novel neural network-based SINS/DVL integrated navigation approach is proposed. The nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) neural network, which is able to provide reliable predictions, is employed. While the DVL is available, the neural network is trained by the body frame velocity and its increment from the SINS and the DVL measurements. Once the DVL fails, the well trained network is able to forecast the velocity which can be used for the subsequent navigation. From the experimental results, it is clearly shown that the neural network is able to provide reliable velocity predictions for about 200 s-300 s during DVL malfunction and hence maintain the short-term accuracy of the integrated navigation.

AB For the first time, the densities and diversity of microorganisms developed on ocean gliders were investigated using flow cytometry and Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA genes. Ocean gliders are autonomous buoyancy-driven underwater vehicles, equipped with sensors continuously recording physical, chemical, and biological parameters. Microbial biofilms were investigated on unprotected parts of the glider and surfaces coated with base, biocidal and chitosan paints. Biofilms on the glider were exposed to periodical oscillations of salinity, oxygen, temperature, pressure, depth and light, due to periodic ascending and descending of the vehicle. Among the unprotected surfaces, the highest microbial abundance was observed on the bottom of the glider's body, while the lowest density was recorded on the glider's nose. Antifouling paints had the lowest densities of microorganisms. Multidimensional analysis showed that the microbial communities formed on unprotected parts of the glider were significantly different from those on biocidal paint and in seawater.

AB This study introduces a novel visual servo controller that is designed to control the pose of the camera to keep multiple objects in the field of view (FOV) of a mobile camera. In contrast with other visual servo methods, the control objective is not formulated in terms of a goal pose or a goal image. Rather, a set of underdetermined task functions are developed to regulate the mean and variance of a set of image features. Regulating these task functions inhibits feature points from leaving the camera FOV. An additional task function is used to maintain a high level of motion perceptibility, which ensures that desired feature point velocities can be achieved. These task functions are mapped to camera velocity, which serves as the system input. A proof of stability is presented for tracking three or fewer targets. Experiments of tracking eight or more targets have verified the performance of the proposed method.

AB We present a system that estimates the motion of a stereo head, or a single moving camera, based on video input. The system operates in real time with low delay, and the motion estimates are used for navigational purposes. The front end of the system is a feature tracker. Point features are matched between pairs of frames and linked into image trajectories at video rate. Robust estimates of the camera motion are then produced from the feature tracks using a geometric hypothesize-and-test architecture. This generates motion estimates from visual input alone. No prior knowledge of the scene or the motion is necessary. The visual estimates can also be used in conjunction with information from other sources, such as a global positioning system, inertia sensors, wheel encoders, etc. The pose estimation method has been applied successfully to video from aerial, automotive, and handheld platforms. We focus on results obtained with a stereo head mounted on an autonomous ground vehicle. We give examples of camera trajectories estimated in real time purely from images over previously unseen distances (600 m) and periods of time. (C) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is an off-policy method that combines two mainstream reinforcement learning methods based on value iteration and policy iteration. Using the DDPG algorithm, agents can explore and summarize the environment to achieve autonomous decisions in the continuous state space and action space. In this paper, a cooperative defense with DDPG via swarms of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is developed and validated, which has shown promising practical value in the effect of defending. We solve the sparse rewards problem of reinforcement learning pair in a long-term task by building the reward function of UAV swarms and optimizing the learning process of artificial neural network based on the DDPG algorithm to reduce the vibration in the learning process. The experimental results show that the DDPG algorithm can guide the UAVs swarm to perform the defense task efficiently, meeting the requirements of a UAV swarm for non-centralization, autonomy, and promoting the intelligent development of UAVs swarm as well as the decision-making process.

AB The micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) technology has led to improvements in the manufacturability and scalability of the semiconductor-based sensors and actuators. This study proposes a framework for topology optimization to improve the dynamic stability of a resonant MEMS scanner for a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system installed on an autonomous vehicle. The microscanner must have excellent dynamic stiffness and rigidity for in-plane disturbances because the vehicle system is subjected to several types of disturbances owing to road harshness and power train vibration. This paper is the first one to apply the topology optimization method to the design of torsional spring of the microscanner to maximize the lateral yawing mode frequency, which might degrade stable operation. The optimization was constrained to the mode frequencies for the torsional and the two bending modes, similar to the reference model. The proposed framework can facilitate the systematical design of a torsional resonant microscanner that satisfies frequency requirements with improved dynamic stability for in-plane disturbance.

AB This letter proposes a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided full-duplex unmanned aerial vehicle (FD-UAV) communication system. The FD-UAV performs its mission to communicate with an uplink (UL) user and a downlink (DL) user simultaneously over the same time-frequency dimension. The RIS is deployed to enhance the signal strength to the UL and DL users while suppressing the co-channel interference (CCI) from the user side. We aim to maximize the weighted sum rate of UL and DL transmissions by jointly optimizing the transmit power of the UL user, RIS's phase-shift, and UAV trajectory. Although the formulated problem is difficult to solve due to its joint non-convexity, we propose an efficient algorithm based on the successive convex approximation and fractional programming techniques to solve the problem suboptimally. Simulation results show that the proposed RIS-aided communication system can achieve a significant sum rate gain over various bechmark schemes.

AB The localization accuracy is critical for the development of future autonomous systems and location-based services. The accuracy level for localization is difficult to achieve in the case of urban and GPS denied environments due to high scattering. Fingerprint-based localization techniques promise to address these challenges. However, this technique demands to build a radio map before localization, which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. This article designs a crowd-sourced based localization system to address the radio map building problem in fingerprinting localization system. In this method, the first initial radio map is constructed from the path-loss RSS model, followed by the update of the fingerprints with crowd-sourcing. Finally, the vehicle location is estimated from the RSS sample by matching it with an updated radio map with a deep learning algorithm. The main advantage of the proposed approach is the calibration-free crowd-sourced fingerprint generation and its applicability in various location-based services in urban infrastructure.

AB This study presents the design of a state feedback controller for an Unmanned Underwater Mobile Vehicle (UUMV) considering the implementation of an Averaged Sub-Gradient (ASG) version of the Integral Sliding Modes (ISM) method. The control problem is formulated here as an extreme seeking problem for the UUMV dynamics, which must track attainable reference trajectories in three-dimensional space. The dynamic nature of the UUMV induces the application of the extended version of ISM, where the integral term represents an ASG of the tracking error norm. The realized trajectory tracking is compared with the trajectories enforced by a traditional state feedback controller with gravity effect compensation. The proposed controller exhibits better tracking and similar control magnitude than the considered classical state feedback realization. These two results confirm the benefits of introducing the mixed extended strategy, including ISM and ASG as an extreme seeking controller for the considered UUMV. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, we present a real-time high-precision visual localization system for an autonomous vehicle which employs only low-cost stereo cameras to localize the vehicle with a priori map built using a more expensive 3D LiDAR sensor. To this end, we construct two different visual maps: a sparse feature visual map for visual odometry (VO) based motion tracking, and a semidense visual map for registration with the prior LiDAR map. To register two point clouds sourced from different modalities (i.e., cameras and LiDAR), we leverage probabilistic weighted normal distributions transformation (ProW-NDT), by particularly taking into account the uncertainty of source point clouds. The registration results are then fused via pose graph optimization to correct the VO drift. Moreover, surfels extracted from the prior LiDAR map are used to refine the sparse 3D visual features that will further improve VO-based motion estimation. The proposed system has been tested extensively in both simulated and real-world experiments, showing that robust, high-precision, real-time localization can be achieved.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are very popular and increasingly used in different applications. Today, the use of multiple UAVs and UAV swarms are attracting more interest from the research community, leading to the exploration of topics such as UAV cooperation, multi-drone autonomous navigation, etc. In this work, we propose two approaches for UAV pursuit-evasion. The first approach uses deep reinforcement learning to predict the actions to apply to the follower UAV to keep track of the target UAV. The second approach uses a deep object detector and a search area proposal (SAP) to predict the position of the target UAV in the next frame for tracking purposes. The two approaches are promising and lead to a higher tracking accuracy with an intersection over union (IoU) above the selected threshold. We also show that the deep SAP-based approach improves the detection of distant objects that cover small areas in the image. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated in outdoor tracking scenarios using real UAVs.

AB This paper proposes a feedback-linearization-based control algorithm for multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The feedback linearization scheme is highly efficient for considering nonlinearity between the rotational and translational motion of multirotor UAVs. We also propose a dynamic equation that reflects the aerodynamic effects of the vehicles; the equation's parameters can be determined through curve fitting using actual flight data. We derive the feedback linearization controller from the proposed dynamic equation, and propose a Luenberger observer to attenuate measurement noises. The proposed algorithm is implemented using our in-house flight control computer, and we describe its implementation in detail. To investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we carry out two flight scenarios: the first scenario, an autonomous landing on a moving platform, is a test of maneuverability; the second, picking up and replacing an object, test the algorithm's accuracy. In these scenarios, the proposed algorithm precisely controls multirotor UAVs, and we confirm that it can be successfully applied to real flight environments.

AB A system, particularly a decision-making concept, that facilitates highly automated driving on freeways in real traffic is presented. The system is capable of conducting fully automated lane change (LC) maneuvers with no need for driver approval. Due to the application in real traffic, a robust functionality and the general safety of all traffic participants are among the main requirements. Regarding these requirements, the consideration of measurement uncertainties demonstrates a major challenge. For this reason, a fully integrated probabilistic concept is developed. By means of this approach, uncertainties are regarded in the entire process of determining driving maneuvers. While this also includes perception tasks, this contribution puts a focus on the driving strategy and the decision-making process for the execution of driving maneuvers. With this approach, the BMW Group Research and Technology managed to drive 100% automated in real traffic on the freeway A9 from Munich to Ingolstadt, showing a robust, comfortable, and safe driving behavior, even during multiple automated LC maneuvers.

AB In the literature survey, most of the signal analysis techniques for underwater acoustic information rely on complex mathematical models, which are impractical for a small real time application such as an underwater echo sounder. The purpose of this work is to introduce a modified signal process algorithm which can be easily implemented into a microprocessor and to determine the distance an obstacle from a moving underwater vehicle. This simplified acoustic signal analyzer uses a series of 'mask shading', '3-time majority' and 'echo-duration threshold' signal process steps to increase the accuracy of distance measurement for the self-developed underwater echo sounder. Experiment result shows that the proposed algorithm can ignore the erroneous signal cased by environment noise at sea and transient noise from the circuit board. This work has been proven valuable when used with an auxiliary solar-powered boat to measure the slurry accumulation at a local An-Ping Harbor in southern Taiwan. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The potential of indoor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) localization is paramount for diversified applications within large industrial sites, such as hangars, malls, warehouses, production lines, etc. In such real-time applications, autonomous UAV location is required constantly. This paper comprehensively reviews radio signal-based wireless technologies, machine learning (ML) algorithms and ranging techniques that are used for UAV indoor positioning systems. UAV indoor localization typically relies on vision-based techniques coupled with inertial sensing in indoor Global Positioning System (GPS)-denied situations, such as visual odometry or simultaneous localization and mapping employing 2D/3D cameras or laser rangefinders. This work critically reviews the research and systems related to mini-UAV localization in indoor environments. It also provides a guide and technical comparison perspective of different technologies, presenting their main advantages and disadvantages. Finally, it discusses various open issues and highlights future directions for UAV indoor localization.

AB Remote, harsh conditions of the Southern Ocean challenge our ability to observe the region's influence on the climate system. Southern Ocean air-sea CO2 flux estimates have significant uncertainty due to the reliance on limited ship-dependent observations in combination with satellite-based and interpolated data products. We utilize a new approach, making direct measurements of air-sea CO2, wind speed, and surface ocean properties on an Uncrewed Surface Vehicle (USV). In 2019, the USV completed the first autonomous circumnavigation of Antarctica providing hourly CO2 flux estimates. Using this unique data set to constrain potential error in different measurements and propagate those through the CO2 flux calculation, we find that different wind speed products and sampling frequencies have the largest impact on CO2 flux estimates with biases that range from -4% to +20%. These biases and poorly constrained interannual variability could account for discrepancies between different approaches to estimating Southern Ocean CO2 uptake.

ID TRAJECTORY TRACKING; DESIGN
AB A control solution for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle encapsulating a nonlinear inner-loop based on the application of feedback linearization to the attitude and altitude dynamics is proposed in this paper. Linear quadratic controllers with integrative action are implemented not only to the resulting inner-loop chain of integrators, but also to the outer-loop, that controls the horizontal movement and, consequently, stabilizes the zero-dynamics. The required full state-feedback relies on measurements from motion sensors and on-flight estimates provided by Kalman filters and a nonlinear attitude filter. In simulation, the capacity of trajectory tracking and withstanding significant deviations of the mass and inertia values of the proposed control structure are evaluated while considering saturation and noisy measurements. The simulations results were experimentally validated using a commercially available drone. The modeling and control system architecture are validated by the experimental results. Additionally, a comparison with the results achieved with a linear control solution developed in a previous work is drawn.

AB An adaptive turning algorithm for a four-wheel robot tractor in the headland is presented in this paper. The navigation sensors consisted of an inertial measurement unit and a real-time kinematic global positioning system (GPS). An objective function based on weights was used to create the navigation path, connecting by continuous primitives. The asymmetric steering mechanism was then taken into consideration with a vehicle model. To follow the path accurately, the slide movement of the robot and the steering rate were taken into account by estimating the turning radius in real time. In addition, the vehicle model was tuned based on the results of each turn. Therefore, the turning control algorithm was optimized on the basis of the specific conditions in the field. Field experiments showed that the robot tractor approached the next path with an average lateral deviation of 3.9 cm at a speed of 1.2 m/s during a turn. Compared to a conventional turning scheme, the time consumption and turning trajectory were decreased by 17% and 21%, respectively.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; PERFORMANCE; TIME
AB This paper presents a computational framework for learning autonomous guidance behavior in unknown or partially known environments. The learning framework uses a receding horizon trajectory optimization associated with a spatial value function. The function describes optimal (for example, minimum time) guidance behavior represented as cost and velocity at any point in geographical space to reach a specified goal state. For guidance in unknown environments, a local spatial value function based on the current vehicle state is updated online using environment data from onboard exteroceptive sensors. The proposed learning framework has the advantage, in that it learns information directly relevant to the optimal guidance and control behavior, enabling optimal trajectory planning in unknown or partially known environments. The learning framework is evaluated by measuring performance over successive runs in three-dimensional indoor flight simulations. The test vehicle in the simulations is a Blade-Cx2 coaxial miniature helicopter. The environment is a priori unknown to the learning system. The paper investigates changes in performance, dynamic behavior, spatial value function, and control behavior in the body frame as a result of learning over successive runs.

AB This paper describes the image processing techniques designed to localize the tracks of snowcats for the automation of transportation of goods and people during the Italian scientific missions in Antarctica. The final goal is to enable a snowcat to automatically follow the preceding one in a train-like fashion. A camera is used to acquire images of the scene; the image sequence is analyzed by a computer vision system which identifies the tracks and produces a high level description of the scene. This result is then forwarded to a further software module in charge of the control of the snowcat movement. A further optional representation, in which markers highlighting the tracks are superimposed onto the acquired image, is transmitted to a human supervisor located off board. This system has been tested in the Italian test site and was under testing in the South Pole during the early 2002 Italian scientific mission. The paper also briefly describes an alternative solution based on an evolutionary approach.

Although previous studies have mostly focused on internal schema of beliefs in latent variables, this paper aims to examine the impact of internal and external factors by integrating variables of Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) along with environmental concern and perceived risk. Moreover, the effect of latent variables is also compared for different trip purposes (mandatory and optional) that received less attention in previous studies. Using stated preference survey, 641 valid responses from Tehran citizens have been collected. Estimation results of Structural Equation Modelling show a significant difference between the determinants of AVs acceptance across mandatory and optional trips. Estimated coefficients indicate that social influence and performance expectancy are the strongest explanatory factors in intention to use AVs on optional and mandatory trips, respectively. However, no significant difference is observed for the impact of environmental concern on intention to use AVs across both trip types.

AB In this study, an NMPC-based planning approach is proposed for Hybrid Terrestrial and Aerial Quadrotors (HyTAQs) to achieve safe and efficient hybrid locomotion in unknown environments. The approach ensures bimodal dynamic feasibility and fully exploits the high efficiency and accessibility of HyTAQs. Equipped with the complementarity constraints for hybrid dynamics, the unified NMPC enables simultaneous optimization of the full-state trajectory and the inherent locomotion mode without the computational burden of mixed-integer programming. Also, the uncertainty bounds are evaluated along the nominal trajectory in a receding horizon manner and incorporated within the geometry constraints for the safety and robustness. Further, the bimodal energy efficiency is fully considered by the topology-guided path searching, achieving more efficient mode selection. Then, a compact unified terrestrial-aerial planner is implemented on the HyTAQ and validated through various comparisons and navigation tests. Experimental results verify the high efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach.

AB Wildfire is one of the most critical natural disasters that threaten wildlands and forest resources. Tra-ditional firefighting systems, which are based on ground crew inspection, have several limits and can expose firefighters' lives to danger. Thus, remote sensing technologies have become one of the most de-manded strategies to fight against wildfires, especially UAV-based remote sensing technologies. They have been adopted to detect forest fires at their early stages, before becoming uncontrollable. Autonomous wildfire early detection from UAV-based visual data using different deep learning algorithms has attracted significant interest in the last few years. To this end, in this paper, we focused on wildfires detection at their early stages in forest and wildland areas, using deep learning-based computer vision algorithms to prevent and then reduce disastrous losses in terms of human lives and forest resources (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB Validating the behavior of a complex system is a fundamental step in the development process to avoid costly damages and dangerous circumstances. Such a phase requires a realistic simulation of the system and the reproduction of the full operative scenario, including the environment with all the possible events and situations in which the system could get into. Although several tools exist to design, simulate and validate specific functions, checking the overall system behavior in an operative scenario usually requires the development of custom simulation frameworks. These are often tailored to the specific system under study, with the consequence that they are either incomplete or not fully reusable for other projects. This paper presents a modular hardware-in-the-loop development simulation framework that allows realistic simulation, supporting multi-vehicle scenario and comprehending tools for reproducing realistic testing environments with advanced sensors. A case of study is presented to show the employment of the proposed framework for testing the behavior of unmanned vehicles, focusing on the timing properties of the system. Category (2).

The purpose of the UUV team is to intercept the underwater evader based on the arrival time measurements. We present both the motion control for the UUV team and the algorithm to estimate the evader position in real time. In this manuscript, the UUVs chase the evader while preserving a 3D spherical formation. Moreover, the formation size is controlled adaptively to assure the convergence of the evader estimation. Our tracking approach doesnt require global localization of every UUV. The proposed approach only requires that the central UUV measures the relative position of any other UUV using proximity sensors. Simulations are utilized to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This paper presents a novel localization method for electric vehicles (EVs) charging through wireless power transmission (WPT). With the proposed technique, the wireless charging system can self-determine the most efficient coil to transmit power at the EV's position based on the sensors activated by its wheels. To ensure optimal charging, our approach involves measurement of the transfer efficiency of individual transmission coil to determine the most efficient one to be used. This not only improves the charging performance but also minimizes energy losses by autonomously activating only the coils with the highest transfer efficiencies. The results show that with the proposed system, it is possible to detect the coil with maximum transmitting efficiency without the use of actual power transmission and comparison of the measured efficiency. This paper also proves that with the proposed charger set-up, the position of the receiver coil can be detected almost instantly, which indeed saves energy and boosts the charging time.

AB This paper tackles the problem of sensing coverage for multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with an approach that takes into account the reciprocal between neighboring UAVs to reduce the oscillation of their trajectories. The proposed reciprocal decision approach, which is performed in three steps, is self-organized, distributed and autonomous. First, in contrast to the traditional method modeled and optimized in configuration space, the sensing coverage problem is directly presented as an optimal reciprocal coverage velocity (ORCV) in velocity space that is concise and effective. Second, the ORCV is determined by adjusting the action velocity out of weak coverage velocity relative to neighboring UAVs to demonstrate that the ORCV supports a collision-avoiding assembly. Third, a corresponding random probability method is proposed for determining the optimal velocity in the ORCV. The results from the simulation indicate that the proposed method has a high coverage rate, rapid convergence rate and low deadweight loss. In addition, for up to 10(3)-size UAVs, the proposed method has excellent scalability and collision-avoiding ability.

AB This paper presents a novel approach for the coordination of a team of autonomous sensor platforms searching for lost targets under uncertainty. A real-time receding horizon controller in continuous action space is developed based on a decentralized gradient-based optimization algorithm and by using the expected observation as an estimate of future rewards. The expected observation is a cost-to-go heuristic that estimates the goodness of the states that the platforms could reach. It permits the decision making algorithm to take into account the information on the whole environment, reducing the time needed to detect the target. The heuristic, modeled as a sensor, allows us to develop a new team utility function with low computational cost and high performance. It can be applied to challenging scenarios such as multi-target search with complex and non-uniform target probability distributions. Through simulation and statistical analysis, we show the advantages of using the expected observation heuristic in multi-vehicle coordination for search applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB A Holonic Manufacturing System (HMS) is a manufacturing system where key elements, such as machines, cells, factories, parts, products, operators and teams are modeled as 'holons' having autonomous and cooperative properties. In this paper, we develop an on-line scheduling method for Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) and machines in HMS based on Petri Nets (PNs). We define holons for a given problem context and appropriate system architecture. Relevant holons are identified and their relationships are delineated through a novel modeling of the interactions among parts, machines, and AGVs based on the contract net protocol. A novel Petri Net model is developed for modeling the specifications of holons and coordination between them. We apply a distributed heuristic algorithm that combines dispatching rules of AGVs and machines and a modified version of Limited Expansion A Algorithm for online scheduling of AGVs and machines.
   Significance: We developed a holonic control architecture by using Petri Net modules and distributed dynamic scheduling method based on Petri Net heuristic search algorithm and dispatching rules for AGVs and machines.

AB In the framework of our research on biologically inspired microrobotics, we have developed two novel Automatic Flight Control Systems (AFCs): OCTAVE (Optical flow Control sysTem for Aerospace VEhicles) and OSCAR (Optical Scanning sensor for the Control of Autonomous Robots), both based on insects' visuomotor control systems. OCTAVE confers upon a tethered aerial robot (the OCTAVE robot) the ability to perform terrain following. OSCAR gives a tethered aerial robot (the OSCAR robot) the ability to fixate and track a contrasting target with a high level of accuracy. Both OCTAVE and OSCAR robots are based on optical velocity sensors, the principle of which is based on the results of previous electrophysiological studies on the fly's Elementary Motion Detectors (EMDs) performed at our laboratory. Both processing systems described are light enough to be mounted on-board Micro-Air Vehicles (MAVs) with an avionic payload small enough to be expressed in grams rather than kilograms.

AB Flapping Wing Air Vehicles (FWAVs) have proven to be attractive alternatives to fixed wing and rotary air vehicles at low speeds because of their bio-inspired ability to hover and maneuver. However, in the past, they have not been able to reach their full potential due to limitations in wing control and payload capacity, which also has limited endurance. Many previous FWAVs used a single actuator that couples and synchronizes motions of the wings to flap both wings, resulting in only variable rate flapping control at a constant amplitude. Independent wing control is achieved using two servo actuators that enable wing motions for FWAVs by programming positions and velocities to achieve desired wing shapes and associated aerodynamic forces. However, having two actuators integrated into the flying platform significantly increases its weight and makes it more challenging to achieve flight than a single actuator. This article presents a retrospective overview of five different designs from the "Robo Raven" family based on our previously published work. The first FWAVs utilize two servo motors to achieve independent wing control. The basic platform is capable of successfully performing dives, flips, and button hook turns, which demonstrates the potential maneuverability afforded by the independently actuated and controlled wings. Subsequent designs in the Robo Raven family were able to use multifunctional wings to harvest solar energy to overcome limitations on endurance, use on-board decision-making capabilities to perform maneuvers autonomously, and use mixed-mode propulsion to increase payload capacity by exploiting the benefits of fixed and flapping wing flight. This article elucidates how each successive version of the Robo Raven platform built upon the findings from previous generations. The Robo Raven family collectively addresses requirements related to control autonomy, energy autonomy, and maneuverability. We conclude this article by identifying new opportunities for research in avian-scale flapping wing aerial vehicles.

DE automated guided vehicles; dynamic task assignment; internal logistics;
   heuristic optimization; disruption management
AB An efficient management of production plants has to consider several external and internal factors, such as potential interruptions of the ongoing processes. Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are becoming a widespread technology that offers many advantages. These AGVs can perform complex tasks in an autonomous way. However, an inefficient schedule of the tasks assigned to an AGV can suffer from unwanted interruptions and idle times, which in turn will affect the total time required by the AGV to complete its assigned tasks. In order to avoid these issues, this paper proposes a heuristic-based approach that: (i) makes use of a delay matrix to estimate circuit delays for different daily times; (ii) employs these estimates to define an initial itinerary of tasks for an AGV; and (iii) dynamically adjusts the initial agenda as new information on actual delays is obtained by the system. The objective is to minimize the total time required for the AGV to complete all the assigned tasks, taking into account situations that generate unexpected disruptions along the circuits that the AGV follows. In order to test and validate the proposed approach, a series of computational experiments utilizing real-life data are carried out. These experiments allow us to measure the improvement gap with respect to the former policy used by the system managers.

AB Traffic conflicts are heavily correlated with traffic collisions and may provide insightful information on the failure mechanism and factors that contribute more towards a collision. Although proactive traffic management systems have been supported heavily in the research community, and autonomous vehicles (AVs) are soon to become a reality, analyses are concentrated on very specific environments using aggregated data. This study aims at investigating -for the first timerear-end conflict frequency in an urban network level using vehicle-to-vehicle interactions and at correlating frequency with the corresponding network traffic state. The Time-To-Collision (TTC) and Deceleration Rate to Avoid Crash (DRAC) metrics are utilized to estimate conflict frequency on the current network situation, as well as on scenarios including AV characteristics. Three critical conflict points are defined, according to TTC and DRAC thresholds. After extracting conflicts, data are fitted into Zero-inflated and also traditional Negative Binomial models, as well as quasi-Poisson models, while controlling for endogeneity, in order to investigate contributory factors of conflict frequency. Results demonstrate that conflict counts are significantly higher in congested traffic and that high variations in speed increase conflicts. Nevertheless, a comparison with simulated AV traffic and the use of more surrogate safety indicators could provide more insight into the relationship between traffic state and traffic conflicts in the near future.

AB FastGraph is a novel positioning approach recently proposed to address the challenges of positioning in large spaces. Wi-Fi-based indoor positioning solutions often require complex and time-consuming deployments. Fingerprinting, as one of most used approaches, relies on a radio map, usually created by manual site survey, a process unpractical even for small spaces. Moreover, the site survey has to be repeated frequently due to the changes in the radio environment. Wi-Fi-based solutions are also frequently discarded for applications such as indoor vehicle navigation due to limited accuracy. This article introduces FastGraph Enhanced, a new version of FastGraph, able to provide high accuracy positioning, opening new fields of application, such as navigation for autonomous vehicles. In FastGraph Enhanced, the 3D Force-Directed Graph-Based method, used to model the radio environment, is extended with new algorithms, allowing to improve, among other aspects, the positioning performance. The core advantages of FastGraph are maintained, not requiring previous calibration or knowledge about the space. The proposed solution was evaluated in real world, with very significative improvements in positioning accuracy when compared with the basic version of FastGraph (from around 5m to 0.5m), and with state-of-the-art solutions.

TI ArmillEye: Flexible platform for underwater stereo vision
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper describes ArmillEye, a 3-degree of freedom (DOF) flexible hybrid platform designed for agile underwater stereoptic vision. Effective telecontrol systems of remote operated vehicles require active and dexterous camera support in order to allow the operator to easily and promptly change the point of view, also improving the, virtual reconstruction of the environment in difficult operative conditions (dirtiness, turbulence, and partial occlusion). The same concepts hold for visual servoing of autonomous underwater vehicles. ArmillEye was designed for this specific application; it is based on the concept of using a parallel-hybrid mechanism architecture that, in principle, allows us to minimize the ad hoc waterproof boxes (generally only for cameras) while the actuators, fixed to the base of the mechanism, can be placed into the main hotly of the underwater vehicle. This concept was revealed effective and was previously proposed for underwater arms. The synthesis of ArmillEye followed the specific aims of visual telecontrol and servoing, specifying vision workspace, dexterity, and dynamics parameters. Two versions of ArmillEye are proposed: the first one with two cameras to obtain a steroptic vision by using two viewpoints (two rotational freedoms with a fixed tilt or pan axis and vergence); the second one with one camera operated to obtain a stereoptic vision by using one viewpoint (two rotational freedoms with a fixed tilt or pan axis and extrusion).

AB 6G network enables the rapid connection of autonomous vehicles, the generated internet of vehicles establishes a large-scale point cloud, which requires automatic point cloud analysis to build an intelligent transportation system in terms of the 3D object detection and segmentation. Recently, a great variety of deep convolution networks have been proposed for 3D data analysis, making significant progress in the application of deep learning in 3D computer vision. Inspired by the application of transformer network in 2D computer visual tasks, and in order to increase the expression ability of local fine-grained features, we propose an effective local feature transformer network to learn local feature information and correlations between point clouds. Our network is adaptive to the arrangement of set elements through transformer module, so it is suitable for the feature extraction of local point clouds. In addition, experimental results demonstrate that our LFT-network outperforms the state-of-the-art in 3D model classification tasks on ModelNet40 dataset and segmentation tasks on S3DIS dataset.

AB Nowadays, more and more complex methods of signal modulating and processing are actively used for organizing underwater acoustic communication with and between submerged mobile vehicles due to harsh underwater conditions. In this research, the method that is based on multi-frequency signals forming (OFDM) with the constant envelope is applied to the problem. It is based on multi-frequency FM-OFDM signals forming with Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulated subcarriers and FM spectrum spreading coefficients of 1, 2, 4, and 10. The proposed solution was modeled in a software simulator, which implements a noisy underwater acoustic multipath channel, changing the bit error rate (BER) from 0.15 to 10(-3). In addition, it was tested during the full-scale data transmission experiments at 25 km distance using a low frequency (400 Hz) underwater acoustic apparatus under conditions of strong impulse noises and quasi-non-stationary channel. The results of in-situ experiments were similar to the ones that were obtained during the simulation.

ID MODELS
AB The focus of this paper is to present a game theoretical modeling framework for the integration of unmanned aircraft systems into the National Airspace System. The problem of predicting the outcome of complex scenarios, where manned and unmanned air vehicles coexist, is the research problem of this work. The fundamental gap in the literature is that the models of interaction between manned and unmanned vehicles are insufficient: 1) They assume that pilot behavior is known a priori, and 2) They disregard pilot reaction and the decision-making process. The contribution of this paper is to propose a realistic modeling framework that will fill this gap. The foundations of the proposed method are formed by game theory, which investigates strategic decision making between intelligent agents; bounded rationality concept, which is based on the fact that humans cannot always make perfect decisions; and reinforcement learning, which is shown to be effective in human learning in psychology literature. An analysis of integration is conducted using an example scenario in the presence of manned aircraft and fully autonomous unmanned aircraft systems equipped with sense-and-avoid algorithms.

DT Article
AB To meet the power demand requirements of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), the power supply is generally composed of a large number of high-energy lithium battery groups. The lithium battery heat dissipation properties not only affect the underwater vehicle performance but also bring some security risks. Based on the widespread application of lithium batteries, lithium batteries in an AUV are taken as an example to investigate the heat dissipation characteristics of the lithium battery spatial layout in an AUV. With the aim of increasing the safety of lithium batteries, a model is developed for the heat transfer process based on the energy conservation equation, and the battery heat dissipation characteristics of the spatial layout are analyzed. The results indicate that the most suitable distance between the cells and the cross arrangement is better than the sequence arrangement in terms of cooling characteristics. The temperature gradient and the temperature change inside the cabin with time are primarily affected by the navigation speed, but they have little relationship with the environmental temperature.

AB The duration of missions that can be accomplished by a system of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is limited by the battery or fuel capacity of its constituent UAVs. However, a system of UAVs that is supported by automated refueling stations may support long term or even indefinite duration missions. We develop a mixed integer linear program (MILP) model to formalize the problem of scheduling a system of UAVs and multiple shared bases in disparate geographic locations. There are mission trajectories that must be followed by at least one UAV. A UAV may hand off the mission to another in order to return to base for fuel. To address the computational complexity of the MILP formulation, we develop a genetic algorithm to find feasible solutions when a state-of-the-art solver such as CPLEX cannot. In practice, the approach allows for a long-term mission to receive uninterrupted UAV service by successively handing off the task to replacement UAVs served by geographically distributed shared bases.

AB Object detection studies aim to solve safety problems at industrial sites; however, improving object detection performance and ensuring real-time capabilities simultaneously remains challenging in multi-complex industrial environments. This paper proposes an unconditionally protected detector to address this problem. The detector's backbone network uses a residual block with a bottleneck structure to reduce computation and enhance real-time performance. Additionally, a selective attention network enhances object detection by extracting important features based on the morphological characteristics of the feature map in the neck structure. The method includes a whole-body estimation to locate individuals obstructed by obstacles, thereby preventing collisions with vehicles and avoiding hazardous situations in restricted areas. The proposed method enables real-time object detection and risk assessment for nearby objects, enhancing safety for industrial vehicle drivers and workers. Moreover, it can lead to further improvements in object detection performance in research fields such as autonomous driving and AI CCTV utilizing cameras.

ID INFORMATION
AB This paper studiesan unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless network, where a UAV is dispatched to gather information from ground sensor nodes (SN) and transfer the collected data to a depot. The information freshness is captured by the age of information (AoI) metric, whilst the energy consumption of the UAV is seen as another performance criterion. Most importantly, the AoI and energy efficiency are inherently competing metrics, since decreasing the AoI requires the UAV returning to the depot more frequently, leading to a higher energy consumption. To this end, we design UAV paths that optimize these two competing metrics jointly and reveal the Pareto frontier. To formulate this problem, a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is proposed with a flow-based constraint set and we apply Bender's decomposition on the proposed formulation. Numerical results show that the proposed method allows deriving non-dominated solutions among two competing metrics when designing the UAV path.

AB The design of the pressure hull, one of the most important components, has great significance for improving the performance of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In this paper, a novel ring-stiffened arched cylindrical (RAC) hull is presented based on the traditional ring-stiffened cylindrical hull, which has the advantages of smooth outline, large compressibility, and small buoyancy factor. Then, a data-driven approach for efficiently designing the pressure hull with an irregular structure is proposed based on the finite element simulation, and its framework is introduced in detail. With the data-driven approach, the optimization design of the RAC structure for AUV is performed, which considers the effect of temperature variation on the deformation. The optimization results indicate that the mass of the pressure hull can be reduced by 10.3% by replacing the traditional ring stiffened cylindrical hull with the RAC hull proposed in this paper. Finally, some pressure tests are carried out to verify the proposed approach, which is also appropriate for designing irregular structures in other engineering fields.

AB The letter proposes a passive wall following strategy for a multirotor robot based on the aerodynamic interaction between the propeller wake and the vertical surface. To reinforce the proximity effects, a vehicle with tilted and ducted propellers is introduced. Momentum theory is employed to elucidate the changes in horizontal and vertical components of the propelling thrust in the vicinity of a wall. The modeling and force measurements, when combined with the analysis of the flight dynamics, reveal the existence of a stable distance between the robot and a wall when only the attitude and altitude of the robot are controlled. Flight experiments were conducted to validate that the stable distance between the robot and the wall can be manipulated through the attitude setpoint or control gain, eliminating the need for position feedback. The outcomes enable a human operator to effortlessly fly the robot safely along a corridor without a collision in the absence of vision or other sensing instruments.

AB The paper characterizes the shortest bounded-curvature paths from an initial configuration (a location and a heading orientation), via the boundary of an intermediate circle, to a target configuration. Such paths are fundamentally required in motion planning of a Dubins vehicle that has to avoid entering certain forbidden regions and when addressing the Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem with Neighborhoods. By using Pontryagin's maximum principle and analyzing the necessary conditions for state inequality constraints, the geometric properties of the shortest bounded-curvature paths are established. These geometric properties not only allow restricting the shortest bounded-curvature path within a sufficient family of 26 candidates but also enable us to devise a completely analytic solution for finding the candidate path. As a consequence, the shortest bounded-curvature path can be computed in a constant time by checking the path lengths of these 26 candidates. Finally, numerical examples validate the developments in the paper and highlight its importance in addressing some Dubins Traveling Salesman Problems with Neighborhoods. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The ever-changing battlefield environment requires the use of robust and adaptive technologies integrated into a reliable platform. Unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) aim to integrate such advanced technologies while increasing the tactical capabilities of combat aircraft. As a research object, common UCAV uses the neural network fitting strategy to obtain values of attack areas. However, this simple strategy cannot cope with complex environmental changes and autonomously optimize decision-making problems. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a new deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) strategy based on deep reinforcement learning for the attack area fitting of UCAVs in the future battlefield. Simulation results show that the autonomy and environmental adaptability of UCAVs in the future battlefield will be improved based on the new DDPG algorithm and the training process converges quickly. We can obtain the optimal values of attack areas in real time during the whole flight with the well-trained deep network.

AB Unlike many current navigation approaches for micro air vehicles, the relative navigation (RN) framework presented in this paper ensures that the filter state remains observable in GPS-denied environments by working with respect to a local reference frame. By subtly restructuring the problem, RN ensures that the filter uncertainty remains bounded, consistent, and normally-distributed, and insulates flight-critical estimation and control processes from large global updates. This paper thoroughly outlines the RN framework and demonstrates its practicality with several long flight tests in unknown GPS-denied and GPS-degraded environments. The relative front end is shown to produce low-drift estimates and smooth, stable control while leveraging off-the-shelf algorithms. The system runs in real time with onboard processing, fuses a variety of vision sensors, and works indoors and outdoors without requiring special tuning for particular sensors or environments. RN is shown to produce globally-consistent, metric, and localized maps by incorporating loop closures and intermittent GPS measurements.

TI Toward Automated Vehicle Control Beyond the Stability Limits: Drifting
   Along a General Path
SO JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
LA English
DT Article
AB Professional drivers in drifting competitions demonstrate accurate control over a car's position and sideslip while operating in an open-loop unstable region of state-space. Could similar approaches help autonomous cars contend with excursions past the stable handling limits, thereby improving overall safety outcomes? As a first step toward answering that question, this paper presents a novel controller framework for automated drifting along a path. The controller is derived for the general case, without reference to a nearby equilibrium point. This leads to the physically insightful result that one can use the rotation rate of the vehicle's velocity vector to track the path, while simultaneously using the yaw acceleration to stabilize sideslip. Nonlinear model inversion, in concert with low-level wheelspeed control, is then used to achieve these required state derivatives over a broad range of conditions. Experiments on MARTY, a modified 1981 DMC DeLorean, demonstrate excellent tracking of a path with varying curvature, speed, and sideslip. Comparisons to a test run without wheelspeed control highlight the importance of accounting for the rear saturated-tire wheelspeed dynamics.

AB Vegetation detection is a common procedure in remote sensing, but recently it has also been applied in robotics as an aid in navigation of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we present a method for roadside vegetation detection intended for traffic infrastructure maintenance. While many published methods use Near Infrared images for vegetation detection, our method uses images from the visible spectrum which allows the use of a common color camera on-board a vehicle. Deep neural networks have proven to be a very promising machine learning technique and have shown excellent results in different computer vision problems. In this paper, we show that Fully Convolutional Neural Networks can be effectively used in a real-world application for detecting roadside vegetation. For training and testing purposes, we have created our own image database which contains roadside vegetation in various conditions. We present promising experimental results and a discussion of encountered problems in a real-world application as well as a comparison with several alternative approaches. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ID LONGITUDINAL CONTROL; COMMUNICATION; VEHICLES; SYSTEMS
AB The problem of autonomous platoon control via wireless communication network is studied in this study. Firstly, a novel hybrid model is established for the platoon's longitudinal movement, where disturbances of lead vehicle acceleration and wind gust, parameter uncertainties and intermediate uncertainties induced by communication network (e.g. time delay, quantisation and packet dropout) are given full considerations and involved in the model for the first time. Then, the authors establish a hierarchical platoon controller design framework comprising a feedback linearisation controller at the first layer and a guaranteed cost H-infinity controller at the second layer. By reducing the non-linear system to a linear model using the top layer feedback linearisation controller, a robust H-infinity controller, the kernel controller, is designed utilising novel techniques in robust control of time-delay systems. For the general objective of disturbance attenuation, string stability and robust platoon control to be achieved simultaneously, the robust H-infinity controller is complemented by additional conditions established for guaranteeing string stability and zero steady-state spacing errors. Simulations are given to show the efficiency of the proposed results.

AB This note scrutinizes the distributed finite-time tracking problem of heterogeneous multi-agent systems with uncertain dynamics and environmental disturbances. To estimate the exogenous disturbances, an adaptive neural network-based disturbance observer is developed in which the approximation error of the neural network is compensated using adaptation laws. Based on finite-time stability theory, a distributed finite-time observer is proposed for each follower in order to estimate the leader's position. Moreover, an adaptive dynamic sliding mode-based controller is also developed for each follower, which ensures finite-time convergence of the tracking error between the leader and the follower. Incorporating adaptive control into the developed composite control structure leads to reducing the chattering, as well as enhancing the robustness and accuracy. Stability analysis and finite-time convergence of the tracking error are performed using the Lyapunov theory and multiple time scale principle, respectively. Finally, simulations and comparisons are performed in order to verify the effectiveness of the developed control algorithm for a group of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs).

AB In lack of information with regard to the diverse topology on the small-body surface, operation safety of the spacecraft can be hardly guaranteed in advance. To improve onboard environment adaptability in future missions, an agile landing control that reacts to real-time environment interactions is investigated. An online collision prediction model is established on the basis of environment sensing and state uncertainty propagation. By searching the minimal residual space margin and the most dangerous direction on the finite horizon, a dynamic environment feedback is formulated. The feedback information is incorporated into model-predictive control, upon which a collision risk-perceptive landing control is obtained. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed method is independent of a priori knowledge of the environment. It is capable of adjusting control objectives according to onboard environment perceptions. Recursive feasibility and stability of the controller are proved. Its effectiveness is demonstrated in a 433-Eros-based landing simulation.

AB Ground segmentation is an important preprocessing task for autonomous vehicles (AVs) with 3D LiDARs. However, the existing ground segmentation methods are very difficult to balance accuracy and computational complexity. This paper proposes a fast point cloud ground segmentation approach based on a coarse-to-fine Markov random field (MRF) method. The method uses the coarse segmentation result of an improved local feature extraction algorithm instead of prior knowledge to initialize an MRF model. It provides an initial value for the fine segmentation and dramatically reduces the computational complexity. The graph cut method is then used to minimize the proposed model to achieve fine segmentation. Experiments on two public datasets and field tests show that our approach is more accurate than both methods based on features and MRF and faster than graph-based methods. It can process Velodyne HDL-64E data frames in real-time (24.86 ms, on average) with only one thread of the 17-8700 CPU. Compared with methods based on deep learning, it has better environmental adaptability.

AB Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) communications are the key to connected and autonomous driving, and pave the way for future Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). To support non-safety and safety critical applications in the demanding out-of-coverage scenario, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has standardized the distributed C-V2X Mode 4 solution, whose behavior has been thoroughly analyzed for periodic traffic. In the current work, the problem of allocating aperiodic traffic in Mode 4 is tackled, a matter that has not been addressed before and that raises several challenging questions. A solution for serving such traffic type is put forth, and an analytical insight on the attainable performance is offered. Further, it is numerically proved that guaranteeing aperiodic flows good service levels is hard when their packets are not small sized. This holds true even for sophisticated physical layer choices and at relatively modest traffic densities, revealing that novel approaches to radio resource assignment are a necessity in Fifth Generation (5G) vehicular communications.

AB This paper presents a novel approach in train control systems based on the concept called virtual coupling or train convoys. This approach follows the recent developments in the field of safe platooning of autonomous vehicles. We use a decentralized model predictive control (MPC) framework for each train participating in a convoy formation. Control designs for the leading and following trains are presented. An optimal control formulation for both controllers is used and its design relies on a numeric solution of a finite horizon optimal control problem. This paper compares the proposed method with alternative control strategies including the well-studied moving block train control concept. A study of a metro line has been chosen as a first analysis for this control approach. The simulation results for this kind of railway lines demonstrate better performance and the benefits of this new concept versus the moving block system. We show that the virtual coupling concept substantially reduces headway and distance between trains while guaranteeing safe separation between two consecutive trains at any instant.

AB Combining state-of-the art digital imaging technology with different kinds of marine exploration techniques such as modern autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), remote operating vehicle (ROV) or other monitoring platforms enables marine imaging on new spatial and/or temporal scales. A comprehensive interpretation of such image collections requires the detection, classification and quantification of objects of interest (OOI) in the images usually performed by domain experts. However, the data volume and the rich content of the images makes the support by software tools inevitable. We define some requirements for marine image annotation and present our new online tool BIIGLE 2.0. It is developed with a special focus on annotating benthic fauna in marine image collections with tools customized to increase efficiency and effectiveness in the manual annotation process. The software architecture of the system is described and the special features of BIIGLE 2.0 are illustrated with different use cases and future developments are discussed.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB We consider cooperative positioning using acoustic range measurements for underwater sensor networks, including networks formed by autonomous unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). Severe multipath scattering from the seabed and ocean surface can result in inaccurate range measurements. In an inhomogeneous medium, such as sea water, the direct path is not necessarily the strongest path or the first arrival. Then, the range measurements based on the first or strongest arrival could be significantly biased. We introduce herein a new centralized cooperative positioning algorithm, referred to as the weighted Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm (WGSA), for underwater sensor networks. We assume that for each acoustic ranging channel, multiple range measurements corresponding to several propagation paths, one of which is the direct path, are available for cooperative positioning. Since it is unknown a priori which path is the direct path, we must identify it first. We show that WGSA can be used to automatically identify the direct path. We also show using numerical examples that WGSA is an effective and efficient approach to cooperative positioning in underwater sensor networks.

AB The miniaturisation of sensors has in recent years led to the ability to provide multiple sensor operations from a single Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) platform. Multiple UAS platforms can be synchronised to link devices from separate UAS platforms thus proving a powerful capability for data collection, while opening up interesting opportunities in the way data is retrieved and used. A range of new sensors being investigated will be discussed with reference to selected case studies that have taken place. As we move into an increasingly growing, data rich environment, data management, quality and pedigree will become of increasing importance. Operations for both defence and non-defence applications will be discussed with reference to the present capability and what is required in future systems. This paper describes some of the sensors currently being evaluated. In the coming years it is expected that we will see a sharp increase in the use of small tactical sized autonomous vehicles in general and a large growth in the capability of the payloads being used.

AB The performance of a glider can be considerably improved by means of soaring and optimization of its trajectory. Recent advances in the area of static soaring assume known linear glider dynamics and no actuator saturation phenomena. In practice, the dynamics of the glider change with flight and environmental conditions, and the actuators moving the control surfaces have mechanical limits. In this paper, we consider the optimization-based static soaring problem in the presence of actuator saturation nonlinearities and large parametric uncertainties in the dynamics of the vehicle. We use ideas from robust adaptive control and anti-windup design tools to develop an adaptive control scheme based on linear quadratic control with disturbance rejection. The saturation-type nonlinearity is addressed by the proposed adaptive version of a linear matrix inequality based anti-windup design. The resulting adaptive control scheme with adaptive anti-windup augmentation allows optimal soaring despite the presence of significant actuator saturation limits and unknown parameters.

AB This article investigates the motion planning and reinforcement learning control method for autonomous landing issue of a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on a moving target. A novel funnel shaped surface is first proposed to maintain the relative position within a preassigned set for precise and safe landing. An orientation constraint planning is designed to avoid the flipping over. Moreover, a data-based reinforcement learning strategy is proposed to update the learning weight online, which not only effectively relieves the typical persistent excitation condition to the finite excitation but also allows the inadmissible initial control condition. A filter-based disturbance estimator is employed to compensate the unknown terms. The stability of the overall closed-loop system is analyzed theoretically and concluded to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation and flight experiment are performed to validate that UAV can land on the moving target along the preassigned trajectory.

AB With the advances in wireless communications and the Internet of Things (IoT), various vehicular applications such as image-aided navigation and autonomous driving are emerging. These vehicular applications require a significant number of computation resources and a lower processing delay. However, these resource-limited and power-constrained vehicles may not meet the requirements of processing these vehicular applications. By offloading these vehicular applications to the edge cloud, vehicular edge computing (VEC) is deemed a novel paradigm for improving vehicular performance. However, how to optimize the allocation of computation resources of both vehicles and VEC servers to reduce the energy and delay is a challenging issue when deploying the VEC systems. In this article, we try to address this issue and propose a vehicular application offloading and computational resources allocation strategy. We formulate an optimization problem and present an efficient offloading scheme for vehicular applications. Extensive simulation results are offered to analyze the performances of the proposed scheme. In comparison with the benchmark schemes, the proposed scheme can outperform them in terms of computation cost.

AB Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) and the services they support are an essential part of intelligent transportation. Through physical technologies, applications, protocols, and standards, they help to ensure traffic moves efficiently and vehicles operate safely. This article surveys the current state of play in VANETs development. The summarized and classified include the key technologies critical to the field, the resource-management and safety applications needed for smooth operations, the communications and data transmission protocols that support networking, and the theoretical and environmental constructs underpinning research and development, such as graph neural networks and the Internet of Things. Additionally, we identify and discuss several challenges facing VANETs, including poor safety, poor reliability, non-uniform standards, and low intelligence levels. Finally, we touch on hot technologies and techniques, such as reinforcement learning and 5G communications, to provide an outlook for the future of intelligent transportation systems.

AB In this paper, the flight principle and accurate dynamics of three-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are detailedly analyzed and a nonlinear robust tracking control strategy is proposed considering unknown time-varying external disturbances. Aiming at the tracking control of the typical underactuated system, the dynamic model of the three-rotor UAV is divided into outer-loop position subsystem and inner-loop attitude subsystem. The feedback linearization algorithm is employed to design the outer-loop controller for the trajectory tracking of the UAV. For the inner-loop control of the UAV, the robust integral of the signum of the error (RISE) method is utilized to formulate the robust attitude controller to deal with the external disturbances. The stability of the closed loop system and the asymptotical tracking of the desired trajectory are proved via Lyapunov based stability analysis. Real-time experiments are implemented to validate the performance of the proposed control strategy.

AB Task allocation plays a pivotal role in the optimisation of multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV) search and rescue (SAR) missions in which the search time is critical and communication infrastructure is unavailable. These two issues are addressed by the proposed BMUTA algorithm, a bee-inspired algorithm for autonomous task allocation in multi-UAV SAR missions. In BMUTA, UAVs dynamically change their roles to adapt to changing SAR mission parameters and situations by mimicking the behaviour of honeybees foraging for nectar. Four task allocation heuristics (auction-based, max-sum, ant colony optimisation, and opportunistic task allocation) were thoroughly tested in simulated SAR mission scenarios to comparatively assess their performances relative to that of BMUTA. The experimental results demonstrate the ability of BMUTA to achieve a superior number of rescued victims with much shorter rescue times and runtime intervals. The proposed approach demonstrates a high level of flexibility based on its situational awareness, high autonomy, and economic communication scheme.

AB Radiative transfer in sea ice is subject to anisotropic, multiple scattering. The impact of anisotropy on the light field under sea ice was found to be substantial and has been quantified. In this study, a large data set of irradiance and radiance measurements under sea ice has been acquired with a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) in the central Arctic. Measurements are interpreted in the context of numerical radiative transfer calculations, laboratory experiments, and microstructure analysis. The ratio of synchronous measurements of transmitted irradiance to radiance shows a clear deviation from an isotropic under-ice light field. We find that the angular radiance distribution under sea ice is more downward directed than expected for an isotropic light field. This effect can be attributed to the anisotropic scattering coefficient within sea ice. Assuming an isotropic radiance distribution under sea ice leads to significant errors in light-field modeling and the interpretation of radiation measurements. Quantification of the light field geometry is crucial for correct conversion of radiance data acquired by Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and ROVs.

AB In this paper, an efficient Model Predictive Control (eMPC) algorithm deploying fewer prediction points and less computational requirement is presented in order to control a small or miniature unmanned quadrotor helicopter. A model reduction technique associated with the dynamics of an unmanned quadrotor helicopter is also put forward so as to minimize the burden of calculations in application of MPC into an airborne platform. For three-dimensional tracking control of the quadrotor helicopter, simulation results corresponding to the algebraic formulation-presented in this paper-versus the standard MPC formulation commonly found in the literature further illustrate effectiveness of this study. Unsuccessful implementation of the standard formulation on the testbed due to computational burden proves the necessity and advantages of this new approach. Eventually, to demonstrate effectiveness of the developed MPC algorithm, the suggested algebraic-based MPC framework is successfully implemented on an unmanned quadrotor helicopter testbed (known as Qball-X4) available at the Networked Autonomous Vehicles Lab (NAVL) of Concordia University for tracking control of the unmanned aerial vehicle.

ID ALGORITHM
AB This paper presents a technique and its system that localizes a rotary-wing Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) in indoor environments even under Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) conditions. The technique is based on the system with the MAV having a wireless microphone and a ground station having multiple microphones. The technique identifies the location of the MAV in two-dimensional space by measuring the Time-of-Arrival (ToA) of acoustic signals caused by the rotation of blades at the MAV. The technique then applies an iterative algorithm that corrects the NLoS errors and computes the true ToA based on maps of known indoor environments in a computationally inexpensive manner. To suppress noise in the received signals and thus improve the robustness of ToA estimation, the generalized cross-correlation with phase transform and a bandpass filter is derived and applied. The performance of the proposed technique was examined experimentally by its comparison with three existing ToA-based localization techniques. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed technique, demonstrating its potential for aiding indoor MAVs in autonomous navigation.

AB We present a vision- and ladar-based approach to autonomous driving on rural and desert roads that has been tested extensively in a closed-loop system. The vision component uses Gabor wavelet filters for texture analysis to find ruts and tracks from which the road vanishing point can be inferred via Hough-style voting, yielding a direction estimate for steering control. The ladar component projects detected obstacles along the road direction onto the plane of the front of the vehicle and tracks the 1-D obstacle "gap" presumed due to the road to yield a lateral offset estimate. Several image- and state-based tests to detect failure conditions such as off-road poses (i.e., there is no road to follow) and poor lighting due to sun glare or distracting shadows are also explained. The system's efficacy is demonstrated with analysis of diverse logged data including from the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge, as well as tests with full control of a vehicle over 15 km of difficult roads at up to 37 km/h with no waypoints.

AB This article describes a localization system for autonomous mobile robot navigation in an indoor semi-structured environment. A peripheral ring of 24 ultrasonic sensors and a camera with a motorized zoom on a pan-tilt platform are used to obtain the information required for the localization process. A non-linear filter based on a genetic algorithm as an emerging optimization method to search for optimal positions is presented. The proposed algorithm is based upon an iterative extended Kalman filter (EKF), which utilizes matches between observed geometric beacons and a generic map of beacon locations and the detection of artificial landmarks, to correct the position and orientation of the vehicle. No exhaustive map of the environment is provided to the mobile robot. It must work with a generic description of the kinds of entities in the environment. The resulting self-localization module has been integrated successfully in a more complex navigation system based on a reactive architecture. Various experimental results show the effectiveness of the presented algorithm, including a comparison with the EKF method.

AB Optical fibres sensitized to their geometric curvature are arranged in loops around an autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) in order to extend the vehicle's tactile sensing range and allow larger speeds that require larger stopping distances. When the AGV approaches other objects (obstacles) within this range, fibre optic loops deform and sense the gradual change in their curvature. No intermediate mechanical elements are used to either transfer the impact loads onto the sensitive element or to provide compliance to it. Optical fibres themselves achieve these two functions simultaneously. As a result, tactility is achieved within a comparatively large position range extending over 15 cm. Throughout this range, virtually no reaction forces are generated with the impacting body. The range mentioned is on top of the one provided by the more traditional elastic bumper on which the optical fibres are mounted. Obstacle avoidance and wall-following AGV guidance can readily be achieved with such loops of optical fibre. A high degree of reactive capability and safety is hence provided in the system. With similar advantages, the method can likewise be applied to fixed or mobile material-handling robots.

ID DISSIPATION
AB We study the Kirchhoff equations for a rigid body immersed in an incompressible, irrotational, inviscid fluid in the case that the centers of buoyancy and gravity coincide. The resulting dynamical equations form a non-canonical Hamiltonian system with a six-dimensional phase space, which may be reduced to a four-dimensional (two-degree-of-freedom, canonical) system using the two Casimir invariants of motion. Restricting ourselves to ellipsoidal bodies, we identify several completely integrable subcases. In the general case, we analyze existence, linear and nonlinear stability, and bifurcations of equilibria corresponding to steady translations and rotations, including mixed modes involving simultaneous motion along two body axes, some of which we show can be stable. By perturbing from the axisymmetric, integrable case, we show that slightly asymmetric ellipsoids are typically non-integrable, and we investigate their dynamics with a view to using motions along homo- and -heteroclinic orbits to execute specific maneuvers in autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB Vehicular ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are an integral part of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that facilitate communications between vehicles and the internet. More recently, VANET communications research has strayed from the antiquated DSRC standard and favored more modern cellular technologies, such as fifth generation (5G). The ability of cellular networks to serve highly mobile devices combined with the drastically increased capacity of 5G, would enable VANETs to accommodate large numbers of vehicles and support range of applications. The addition of thousands of new connected devices not only stresses the cellular networks, but also the computational and storage requirements supporting the applications and software of these devices. Autonomous vehicles, with numerous on-board sensors, are expected to generate large amounts of data that must be transmitted and processed. Realistically, on-board computing and storage resources of the vehicle cannot be expected to handle all data that will be generated over the vehicles lifetime. Cloud computing will be an essential technology in VANETs and will support the majority of computation and long-term data storage. However, the networking overhead and latency associated with remote cloud resources could prove detrimental to overall network performance. Edge computing seeks to reduce the overhead by placing computational resources nearer to the end users of the network. The geographical diversity and varied hardware configurations of resource in a edge-enabled network would require careful management to ensure efficient resource utilization. In this paper, we introduce an architecture which evaluates available resources in real-time and makes allocations to the most logical and feasible resource. We evaluate our approach mathematically with the use of a multi-criteria decision analysis algorithm and validate our results with experiments using a test-bed of cloud resources. Results demonstrate that an algorithmic ranking of physical resources matches very closely with experimental results and provides a means of delegating tasks to the best available resource.

AB Virtual traffic benefits a variety of applications, including video games, traffic engineering, autonomous driving, and virtual reality. To date, traffic visualization via different simulation models can reconstruct detailed traffic flows. However, each specific behavior of vehicles is always described by establishing an independent control model. Moreover, mutual interactions between vehicles and other road users are rarely modeled in existing simulators. An all-in-one simulator that considers the complex behaviors of all potential road users in a realistic urban environment is urgently needed. In this work, we propose a novel, extensible, and microscopic method to build heterogeneous traffic simulation using the force-based concept. This force-based approach can accurately replicate the sophisticated behaviors of various road users and their interactions in a simple and unified manner. We calibrate the model parameters using real-world traffic trajectory data. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through many simulation experiments, as well as comparisons to real-world traffic data and popular microscopic simulators for traffic animation.

TI Mobility-as-a-Service and Demand-Responsive Transport: Practical
   Implementation in Traditional Forecasting Models
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB The increasing effect of Transport Network Companies (TNCs) in major US cities, allied to the expectation that connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) will become the prevailing type of automobile on the streets in the coming decades, requires such a trend to be reflected in our forecasting models. Yet, most of the efforts undertaken in the United States and elsewhere are largely focused on understanding the demand for such types of transportation and have left aside the analysis of crucial differences in envisaged systems, such as pooled versus single-occupancy vehicles, use of CAVs as access modes to mass transit, and the cost corresponding to different levels of service in citywide systems. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm for modeling pooled CAVs and a framework for integrating this into traditional forecasting models. We also present the preliminary results of an application of the proposed methodology to the metropolitan region of Vancouver, British Columbia. The results are promising, although a few implementation choices made for this study have resulted in poor computational performance.

AB We are on the cusp of a revolution in the aviation sector, driven by the significant progress in electric power and battery technologies, and autonomous systems. Several industry leaders and governmental agencies are currently investigating the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or "drones" as commonly known, for an ever-growing number of applications-from blue light services to parcel delivery and urban mobility. Undoubtedly, the operation of UAVs will lead to noise exposure, which has the potential to become a significant public health issue. This paper first describes the main acoustic and operational characteristics of UAVs, as an unconventional noise source compared to conventional civil aircraft. Gaps in the literature and the regulations on the noise metrics and acceptable noise levels are identified and discussed. The state-of-the-art evidence on human response to aircraft and other environmental noise sources is reviewed and its application for UAVs discussed. A methodological framework is proposed for building psychoacoustic knowledge, to inform systems and operations development to limit the noise impact on communities.

AB A relative localization system for micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), which is able to work without any markers or other specialized equipment, is presented in this letter. The system utilizes images from an onboard camera to detect nearby MAVs using a convolutional neural network. When compared to traditional computer vision-based relative localization systems, this approach removes the need for specialized markers to be placed on the MAVs, saving weight and space, while also enabling localization of non-cooperating robots. The system is designed and implemented to run online, onboard an MAV platform in order to enable relative stabilization of several MAVs in a formation or swarm-like behavior, when operating in a closed feedback loop with the control system of the MAVs. We demonstrate the viability and robustness of the proposed method in real-world experiments. The method was also designed for the purpose of autonomous aerial interception and is a fitting complement to other MAV detection and relative localization methods for this purpose, as is shown in the experiments.

AB Road region detection is a hot spot research topic in autonomous driving field. It requires to give consideration to accuracy, efficiency as well as prime cost. In that, we choose millimeter-wave (MMW) Radar to fulfill road detection task, and put forward a novel method based on MMW which meets real-time requirement. In this paper, a dynamic and static obstacle distinction step is firstly conducted to estimate the dynamic obstacle interference on boundary detection. Then, we generate an occupancy grid map using modified Bayesian prediction to construct a 2D driving environment model based on static obstacles, while a clustering procedure is carried out to describe dynamic obstacles. Next, a Modified Random Sample Consensus (Modified RANSAC) algorithm is presented to estimate candidate road boundaries from static obstacle maps. Results of our experiments are presented and discussed at the end. Note that, all our experiments in this paper are run in real-time on an experimental UGV (unmanned ground vehicle) platform equipped with Continental ARS 408-21 radar.

AB Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) are commonly equipped with multi-modality sensors. Fully utilized sensors could improve object detection of USVs. This could further contribute to better autonomous navigation. The purpose of this paper is to solve the problems of 3D object detection of USVs in complicated marine environment. We propose a 3D object detection Depth Neural Network based on multi-modality data of USVs. This model includes a modified Proposal Generation Network and Deep Fusion Detection Network. The Proposal Generation Network improves feature extraction. Meanwhile, the Deep Fusion Detection Network enhances the fusion performance and can achieve more accurate results of object detection. The model was tested on both the KITTI 3D object detection dataset (A project of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago) and a self-collected offshore dataset. The model shows excellent performance in a small memory condition. The results further prove that the method based on deep learning can give good accuracy in conditions of complicated surface in marine environment.

AB This study deals with the design and the optimization of a wireless power transfer (WPT) charging system based on magnetic resonant coupling applied to an electric vertical take-off and landing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). In this study, a procedure for primary and secondary coil design is proposed. The primary circuit in the ground station consists of an array of coils in order to mitigate the negative effects on the coupling factor produced by the possible misalignment between the coils due to an imperfect landing. Key aspects for the design of the secondary coil onboard the UAV are the lightness and compactness of the WPT system components. A demonstrative prototype of the WPT system is applied to a commercial drone. The WPT electrical performances are calculated and measured. Finally, an automatic battery recharge station is built where the drone can autonomously land, recharge the battery and take off to continue its flight mission.

AB The solution to the simultaneous localization and map building (SLAM) problem where an autonomous vehicle starts in an unknown location in an unknown environment and then incrementally build a map of landmarks present in this environment while simultaneously using this map to compute absolute vehicle location is now well understood. Although a number of SLAM implementations have appeared in the recent literature, the need to maintain the knowledge of the relative relationships between all the landmark location estimates contained in the map makes SLAM computationally intractable in implementations containing more than a few tens of landmarks. This paper presents the theoretical basis and a practical implementation of a feature selection strategy that significantly reduces the computation requirements for SLAM. The paper shows that it is indeed possible to remove a large percentage of the landmarks from the map without making the map building process statistically inconsistent. Furthermore, it is shown that the computational cost of the SLAM algorithm can be reduced by judicious selection of landmarks to be preserved in the map.
