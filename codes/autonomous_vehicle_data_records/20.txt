AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to make performance improvements and timely critical execution enhancements for operational flight program (OFP). The OFP is core software of autonomous control system of small unmanned helicopter.
   Design/methodology/approach - In order to meet the time constraints and enhance control application performance, two major improvements were done at real-time operating system (RTOS) kernel. They are thread scheduling algorithm and lock-free thread message communication mechanism. Both of them have a direct relationship with system efficiency and indirect relationship with helicopter control application execution stability through improved deadline keeping characteristics.
   Findings - In this paper, the suitability of earliest deadline first (EDF) scheduling algorithm and non-blocking buffer (NBB) mechanism are illustrated with experimental and practical applications. Results of this work show that EDF contributes around 15 per cent finer-timely execution and NBB enhances kernel's responsiveness around 35 per cent with respect to the number of thread context switch and CPU utilization. These apply for OFP implemented over embedded configurable operating system (eCos) RTOS on x86 architecture-based board.
   Practical implications - This paper illustrates an applicability of deadline-based real-time scheduling algorithm and lock-free kernel communication mechanism for performance enhancement and timely critical execution of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle control system.
   Originality/value - This paper illustrates a novel approach to extend RTOS kernel modules based on unmanned aerial vehicle control application execution scenario. Lock-free thread communication mechanism is implemented, and tested for applicability at RTOS. Relationship between UAV physical and computation modules are clearly illustrated via an appropriate unified modelling language (UML) collaboration and state diagrams. As experimental tests are conducted not only for a particular application, but also for various producer/consumer scenarios, these adequately demonstrate the applicability of extended kernel modules for general use.

TI Smart anomaly detection for Slocum underwater gliders with a variational

DE Anomaly detection; Variational autoencoder; Long short-term memory
   network; Underwater glider; Marine autonomous system
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are used extensively for monitoring the world's oceans, taking measurements of oceanographic characteristics along the water column. Presently, there is no holistic anomaly detection system in operation and AUVs require experienced pilots to monitor the progress of missions. This results in a large operational overhead and reduces the number of AUVs that can be deployed simultaneously. This article proposes an online anomaly detection system for underwater gliders based on a data-driven approach. A novel Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has been developed and trained using field data from four deployments with healthy glider behaviour and then tested against four deployments where faults are present. The system is able to detect wing loss with a high degree of accuracy on gliders unseen during the models training, highlighting the generality of the model to different platforms. Additionally, the VAE method outperforms model-based solution for the detection of biofouling, proving its generality to different types of anomalies. The proposed smart anomaly detection will contribute to increasing the capacity of AUVs and reducing the dependence on support vessels and experienced pilots.

AB This paper proposes a lane detection algorithm using a laser range finder (LRF) for the autonomous navigation of a mobile robot. There are many technologies for ensuring the safety of vehicles, such as airbags, ABS, and EPS. Further, lane detection is a fundamental requirement for an automobile system that utilizes the external environment information of automobiles. Representative methods of lane recognition are vision-based and LRF-based systems. In the case of a vision-based system, the recognition of the environment of a three-dimensional space becomes excellent only in good conditions for capturing images. However, there are so many unexpected barriers, such as bad illumination, occlusions, vibrations, and thick fog, that the vision-based method cannot be used for satisfying the abovementioned fundamental requirement. In this paper, a three-dimensional lane detection algorithm using LRF that is very robust against illumination is proposed. For the three-dimensional lane detection, the laser reflection difference between the asphalt and the lane according to color and distance has been utilized with the extraction of feature points. Further, a stable tracking algorithm is introduced empirically in this research. The performance of the proposed algorithm of lane detection and tracking has been experimentally verified.

TI Autonomous car driving by a humanoid robot
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

DE autonomous driving; humanoid robots; visual control
ID LANE
AB Enabling a humanoid robot to drive a car requires the development of a set of basic primitive actions. These include walking to the vehicle, manually controlling its commands (e.g., ignition, gas pedal, and steering) and moving with the whole body to ingress/egress the car. We present a sensor-based reactive framework for realizing the central part of the complete task, consisting of driving the car along unknown roads. The proposed framework provides three driving strategies by which a human supervisor can teleoperate the car or give the robot full or partial control of the car. A visual servoing scheme uses features of the road image to provide the reference angle for the steering wheel to drive the car at the center of the road. Simultaneously, a Kalman filter merges optical flow and accelerometer measurements to estimate the car linear velocity and correspondingly compute the gas pedal command for driving at a desired speed. The steering wheel and gas pedal reference are sent to the robot control to achieve the driving task with the humanoid. We present results from a driving experience with a real car and the humanoid robot HRP-2Kai. Part of the framework has been used to perform the driving task at the DARPA Robotics Challenge.

   Time-optimal control
ID UNMANNED SURFACE VEHICLE; SHIP; VESSELS; NETWORK
AB Autonomous shipping has been identified as the way forward in maritime transport. There are numerous technologies being developed over the past decades for maritime autonomous surface ships, including advanced automatic manoeuvring control. As one of the essential indices to evaluate ships' manoeuvrability, the timeoptimal problem remains a challenging issue in the process of path planning and path tracking, which has not been properly addressed for the maritime autonomous surface ships. To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a novel time-optimal path planning and tracking control method based on nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) and spatial reformulation. The proposed time-optimal controller is designed as a two-level hierarchical controller to plan the time-optimal path in spatial coordinates and track it in temporal coordinates when considering the low-speed manoeuvring model. At the high level, the nonlinear MPC based on a spatial formulation is used to generate a planned path of minimum manoeuvring time for a manoeuvring ship. At the low level, the optimal planning trajectory is interpolated by a constant time iteration and the vessel tracks the time-optimal planning trajectory by implementing the nonlinear MPC based on a temporal formulation. As an advanced predictive controller, the nonlinear MPC optimises the berthing path to a minimum time mathematically at the planning stage and compensates for the uncertain disturbance during the tracking process. To validate the time-optimal control method, a typical scenario of low-speed berthing operation is analysed. The results of the case study show that the proposed control method can be successfully applied to time-optimal manoeuvring problems.

AB The objective of this research was to conduct in situ measurements of electrical conductivity (EC), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and temperature, and collect water samples simultaneously at different depths using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV system consists of a hexacopter, water sampling cartridges (WSC), and a sensor node. Payload capacity and endurance of the UAV were determined using an indoor test station. The UAV was able to produce 106 N of thrust for 10 min with 6.3 kg of total takeoff weight. The thrust-to-weight ratio of the UAV was 2.5 at 50% throttle. The decision for activating the water sampling cartridges and sensor node was made autonomously from an onboard microcontroller. System functions were verified at 0.5 m and 3.0 m depths in 6 locations over a 1.1 ha agricultural pond. Average measurements of EC, pH, DO, and temperature at 0.5 m depth were 42 mu S/cm, 5.6, 8.2 mg/L, and 31 degrees C, while the measurements at 3 m depth were 80 mu S/cm, 5.3, 5.34 mg/L, and 24 degrees C, respectively. The UAV-assisted autonomous water sampling system (UASS) successfully activated the WSC at each sampling location. The UASS would reduce the duration of water quality assessment and help practitioners and researchers to conduct observations with lower operational costs. The developed system would be useful for sampling and monitoring of water reservoirs, lakes, rivers, and ponds periodically or after natural disasters.

TI Marine self-potential measurement tool for autonomous underwater vehicle
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
LA English
DT Article
AB Marine self-potential (SP) measurement is commonly conducted for seafloor sulfide detection and hydrothermal vent studies in deep water using instruments towed close to the seafloor. However, this method has the following shortcomings: (1) It relies on ships for deep towing, and the need for a dedicated ship time lowers its efficiency. (2) Owing to complex topography, most towed instruments are located far from the seafloor to ensure safety, resulting in large effective signal attenuation and low signal-to-noise ratio. (3) The measurement direction is generally a single axis, with only the electric field of the axial component observed, providing limited information. With the gradual maturity of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) technology, it has become possible to mount marine SP measurement tools on AUVs for detection. Compared with conventional methods, this method has significant advantages in terms of efficiency, signal-to-noise ratio, and multicomponent observation. The proposed tool is a lightweight underwater device having a compact design and low power consumption, making it suitable for AUVs. The overall volume of the tool is D50 mm x L350 mm, and the underwater weight is 0.6 kg. Chopper amplification technology ensures the low-noise measurement of electric field signals. In addition, the reformed electrodes enhance stability, thereby reducing the mechanical vibration noise. Laboratory test results show that the noise of the data logger is 7.8 nV/rt (Hz)@1 Hz. The marine test conducted in the southwest Indian Ocean verified the reliability of the proposed marine SP measurement tool. The maximum working depth was 4000 m. The test lasted & SIM;25 h, and the effective electric field data were collected for & SIM;17 h. This survey found a maximum SP anomaly of 0.55 mV/m in the Yuhuang hydrothermal field, which provided effective data support for the discovery of new seafloor sulfide anomalies.

AB (1) Background: The present development of transport networks focusses on the better management of fuels and energy and the preservation of the environment. To fulfill these desiderates, some countries have already reconsidered the deployment plans of new highways. This research studies the feasibility of less polluting, quasi-self-powered, intelligent highway infrastructure functional blocks accommodating functions for the future introduction of smart wireless sensor grids and connected autonomous vehicles. Subject of investigation are the possibilities of energy harvesting, and the intelligent management of resources. (2) Methods: the research investigates the main technologies for energy harvesting and recommends an optimal solution. It also proposes a framework for the intelligent, AI-based management of energy and the use of an optimized backup solution relying on 5G beamforming for energy supply of the local wireless sensing network devices; (3) Results: recommendations are made for the best energy harvesting solution, an architecture of the energy management system, an algorithm for energy management and backup solution based on 5G beamforming; (4) Conclusions: the research emphasizes the advantages and drawbacks for different solutions regarding energy harvesting in an intelligent green highway scenario with a focus on the infrastructure developed to accommodate future connected and autonomous vehicles. The term "intelligent highway" must be understood in the automotive industry to describe a network of roads where cars communicate with the infrastructure and among themselves for the purpose of avoiding congestion and performing the seamless operation of services, and a space where cars and infrastructure cooperatively process information for obtaining better road safety, less pollution, and efficient energy management. With the recent recession of conventional fuel availability and the increase in prices, a solution to improving autonomy of both cars and infrastructure might be welcomed.

The changes in built environment could result in a reduction in active travel and physical activity, which might lead to increases in non-communicable diseases (NCD) and pose risks to public health. Methodology: Using a combination of available secondary data and the responses of an online survey from adults' residents of the Chicago metropolitan statistical area, this study aims to enhance the understanding of the individual and location-based characteristics that might influence the levels of adoption of AVs. A market segmentation analysis was first conducted to classify respondents into five distinct AV adoption levels and identify common characteristics. Built environment and health-related characteristics, that surround the ZIP codes where different levels of adopters reside, were also examined using an ordered probit model in order to understand the influence that AV adoption would have on the factors related to active travel. Results: The ordered probit estimation results suggest that the level of adoption is associated with a combination of individual and location-based characteristics, some of which are related to active travel behavior. It was found that respondents in the high adopter categories are generally lacking opportunities for active travel and show high levels of NCD in the ZIP codes where they reside. Conclusions: AV implementation based only on the propensity to adoption might result in adverse health outcomes. Our results can inform planning strategies and health interventions so as to avoid a massive shift from active travel modes to AVs and mitigate any other adverse impacts on public health that this technology might bring.

AB Successful adoption of auto-steering agricultural vehicles in Korean paddy fields depends on the ability to accurately follow a full path, including straight and curved paths for agricultural tasks and headland turning in each row, in the presence of sliding caused by wet ground conditions in relatively small fields. To improve the performance of an autonomous tillage tractor originally developed in our previous study, this article describes a simulation study, conducted using a 3D computer simulator, that accounts for the slippery motion of a virtual tractor on ground with varying adherence properties, In addition, this study performed field evaluation of an auto-guided tillage tractor equipped with a slip estimation-based path-tracking algorithm that is robust to slippage in paddy fields. The test platform was built with a 60-kW tractor equipped with an RTK-GPS (real-time kinematic-global positioning system) and IMU (inertial measurement unit) system, a navigation controller that could estimate the sideslips of the tractor in real-time, and a three-point hitch dynamometer that could measure tillage drafts. The results of the computer simulation confirmed that the slip estimation-based path-tracking algorithm was superior in guiding the tractor along curved paths on the ground with relatively low coefficients of cornering stiffness by reducing the lateral deviations as compared with those obtained with the conventional look-ahead distance method. In field tests run in an arable field, the autonomous tillage tractor equipped with the slip observer algorithm demonstrated improved performance as compared to the previously developed system by reducing the RMSE (root mean square error) for lateral deviation on curved paths from 29 cm to 15 cm.

AB Under-ice blooms of phytoplankton in the Chukchi Sea have been observed, with strong implications for our understanding of the production regimes in the Arctic Ocean. Using a combination of satellite remote sensing of phytoplankton biomass, in situ observations under sea ice from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), and in vivo photophysiology, we examined the composition, magnitude and origin of a bloom detected beneath the sea ice Northwest of Svalbard (Southern Yermak Plateau) in May 2010. In situ concentration of up to 20 mg chlorophyll a [Chl a] m(-3), were dominated by the northern planktonic spring species of diatoms, Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii, T. antarctica var. borealis, Chaetoceros socialis species complex and Fragilariopsis oceanica. These species were also found south of the marginal ice zone (MIZ). Cells in the water column under the sea ice were typically high-light acclimated, with a mean light saturation index (E (k) ) of 138 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) and a ratio between photoprotective carotenoids (PPC) and Chl a (w:w) of 0.2. Remotely sensed data of [Chl a] showed a 32,000 km(2) bloom developing south of the MIZ. In effect, our data suggest that the observed under-ice bloom was in fact a bloom developed in open waters south of the ice edge, and that a combination of northward-flowing water masses and southward drifting sea ice effectively positioned the bloom under the sea ice. This have implications for our general understanding of under-ice blooms, suggesting that their origin and connection with open water may be different in different regions of the Arctic.

AB Intelligent vehicular cyber-physical systems (ICPSs) increase the reliability, efficiency and adaptability of urban mobility systems. Notably, ICPSs enable autonomous transportation in smart cities, exemplified by the emerging fields of self-driving cars and advanced air mobility. Nonetheless, the deployment of ICPSs raises legitimate concerns surrounding safety assurance, cybersecurity threats, communication reliability, and data management. Addressing these issues often necessitates specialised platforms to cater to the heterogeneity and complexity of ICPSs. To address this challenge, this paper presents a comprehensive CPS to explore, develop and test ICPSs and intelligent vehicular algorithms. A customisable embedded system is realised using a field programmable gate array, which is connected to a supervisory computer to enable networked operations and support advanced multi-agent algorithms. The platform remains compatible with multiple vehicular sensors, communication protocols and human-machine interfaces, essential for a vehicle to perceive its surroundings, communicate with collaborative systems, and interact with its occupants. The proposed CPS thereby offers a practical resource to advance ICPS development, comprehension, and experimentation in both educational and research settings. By bridging the gap between theory and practice, this tool empowers users to overcome the complexities of ICPSs and contribute to the emerging fields of autonomous transportation and intelligent vehicular systems.

AB This paper investigates the output consensus problem of heterogeneous stochastic nonlinear multiagent systems with directed communication topologies, with a view of making the outputs of a group of follower agents track the output of a leader. Fuzzy logic systems are applied to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions of agents. A special case that all followers can get access to the leader is first considered, and a novel decentralized adaptive fuzzy control law based on the output regulation framework is presented. Next, the proposed control scheme is further applied to design the distributed adaptive fuzzy control law for a more general case that only part of agents can get access to the leader. By applying Lyapunov stability analysis, it is shown that the outputs of followers will achieve consensus to a sufficient small bound of the output of the leader under the proposed control law. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control law is effective and efficient. The developed distributed control scheme can be widely applied to solve the cooperative control problem of practical autonomous systems with uncertain dynamics such as synchronization of mechanical systems with vibration, formation control of autonomous underwater vehicles, etc.

AB Because of the environments in which they will operate, future autonomous systems must be capable of reconfiguring quickly and safely following faults or environmental changes. Past research has shown how, by considering autonomous systems to perform phased missions, reliability analysis can support decision making by allowing comparison of the probability of success of different missions following reconfiguration. Binary decision diagrams (BDDs) offer fast, accurate reliability analysis that could contribute to real-time decision making. However, phased mission analysis using existing BDD models is too slow to contribute to the instant decisions needed in time-critical situations. This paper investigates 2 aspects of BDD models that affect analysis speed: variable ordering and quantification efficiency. Variable ordering affects BDD size, which directly affects analysis speed. Here, a new ordering scheme is proposed for use in the context of a decision-making process. Variables are ordered before a mission, and reordering is unnecessary no matter how the mission configuration changes. Three BDD models are proposed to address the efficiency and accuracy of existing models. The advantages of the developed ordering scheme and BDD models are demonstrated in the context of their application within a reliability analysis methodology used to support decision making in an unmanned aerial vehicle.

AB This letter tackles the problem of energy-efficient coverage path planning for exploring general surfaces by an autonomous vehicle. Efficient algorithms are developed to generate paths on freeform 3-D surfaces according to a special design pattern as height extremity aware Fermat spiral for this purpose. By using the exact boundary-sourced geodesic distances, the method for generating Fermat spiral paths is first introduced to cover a general surface. Then, heuristics for energy efficiency are incorporated to add peak points of a height field as sources for geodesic computation. The paths generated by our method can significantly reduce the cost caused by gravity. Physical experiments have been taken on different terrain surfaces to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

AB Monitoring vehicular road traffic is a key component of any autonomous driving platform. Detecting moving objects, and tracking them, is crucial to navigating around objects and predicting their locations and trajectories. Laser sensors provide an excellent observation of the area around vehicles, but the point cloud of objects may be noisy, occluded, and prone to different errors. Consequently, object tracking is an open problem, especially for low-quality point clouds. This paper describes a pipeline to integrate various sensor data and prior information, such as a Geospatial Information System (GIS) map, to segment and track moving objects in a scene. We show that even a low-quality GIS map, such as OpenStreetMap (OSM), can improve the tracking accuracy, as well as decrease processing time. A bank of Kalman filters is used to track moving objects in a scene. In addition, we apply non-holonomic constraint to provide a better orientation estimation of moving objects. The results show that moving objects can be correctly detected, and accurately tracked, over time, based on modest quality Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data, a coarse GIS map, and a fairly accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) navigation solution.

TI Compact flashlamp-based fluorescence imager for use under ambient-light
   conditions
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
LA English
DT Article
ID PLANTS
AB A low-power, lightweight, multiwavelength fluorescence imager based on the use of a compact xenon flashlamp, bandpass filters, gated charge-coupled device camera, and digital image processing was developed for use on an autonomous rover vehicle. The imager discriminates against ambient light by use of microsecond excitation pulses along with synchronized camera operation to limit the time period in which ambient-light photocounts are accumulated, and digital image subtraction to remove background counts. In a 10 cm square field of view, weak fluorescence, equivalent to 0.05 pmol fluorescein/mm(2), can be quantified against a white-light background equivalent to shaded sunlight. For application in autonomous search for organisms in extreme environments such as in situ desert rock or soil, the instrument was equipped with a set of fluorescence excitation filters (380, 450, 545, and 600 nm) and emission filters (460, 510, 620, and 740 nm) suitable for detection of chlorophyll, applied stains for protein, DNA, lipid and carbohydrate, and autofluorescence. True-color images were obtained through red-green-blue imaging filters (630, 535, and 470 nm) used with white-light flashes. Automated focusing on ground features was based on the R-band image and was carried out prior to fluorescence image acquisition.

TI A fuzzy-logic architecture for autonomous multisensor data fusion
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Fuzzy logic techniques have become popular to address various processes for multisensor data fusion. Examples include the following: 1) fuzzy membership functions for data association; 2) evaluation of alternative hypotheses in multiple hypothesis trackers; 3) fuzzy-logic-based pattern recognition (e.g., for feature-based object identification); and 4) fuzzy inference schemes for sensor resource allocation. These approaches have been individually successful but are limited to only a single subprocess within a data fusion system. At The Pennsylvania State University, Applied Research Laboratory, a general-purpose fuzzy-logic architecture has been developed that provides for control of sensing resources, fusion of data for tracking, automatic object recognition, control of system resources and elements, and automated situation assessment. This general architecture has been applied to implement an autonomous vehicle capable of self-direction, obstacle avoidance, and mission completion. The fuzzy logic architecture provides interpretation and fusion of multisensor data (i.e., perception) as well as logic for process control (action). This paper provides an overview of the fuzzy-logic architecture and a discussion of its application to data fusion in the context of the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL) Data Fusion Process Model. A new, robust, fuzzy calculus is introduced, An application example is provided.

TI Spatially complex distribution of dissolved manganese in a fjord as
   revealed by high-resolution in situ sensing using the autonomous
   underwater vehicle autosub

AB Loch Etive is a fjordic system on the west coast of Scotland. The deep waters of the upper basin are periodically isolated, and during these periods oxygen is lost through benthic respiration and concentrations of dissolved manganese increase. In April 2000 the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Autosub was fitted with an in situ dissolved manganese analyzer and was used to study the spatial variability of this element together with oxygen, salinity, and temperature throughout the basin. Six along-loch transects were completed at either constant height above the seafloor or at constant depth below the surface. The ca. 4000 in situ 10-s-average dissolved Mn (Mn-d) data points obtained provide a new quasi-synoptic and highly detailed view of the distribution of manganese in this fjordic environment not possible using conventional (water bottle) sampling. There is substantial variability in concentrations (<25 to >600 nM) and distributions of Mn-d. Surface waters are characteristically low in Mn-d reflecting mixing of riverine and marine end-member waters, both of which are low in Mn-d. The deeper waters are enriched in Mn-d, and as the water column always contains some oxygen, this must reflect primarily benthic inputs of reduced dissolved Mn. However, this enrichment of Mn-d is spatially very variable, presumably as a result of variability in release of Mn coupled with mixing of water in the loch and removal processes. This work demonstrates how AUVs coupled with chemical sensors can reveal substantial small-scale variability of distributions of chemical species in coastal environments that would not be resolved by conventional sampling approaches. Such information is essential if we are to improve our understanding of the nature and significance of the underlying processes leading to this variability.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are extensively utilized in various autonomous underwater missions, encompassing ocean environment monitoring, underwater searching, and geological exploration. Owing to their profound underwater capabilities and robust autonomy, AUVs have emerged as indispensable instruments. Nevertheless, AUVs encounter several constraints in the domain of underwater navigation, primarily stemming from the cost-intensive nature of inertial navigation devices and Doppler velocity logs, which impede the acquisition of navigation data. Underwater simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques, along with other navigation approaches reliant on perceptual sensors like vision and sonar, are employed to augment the precision of self-positioning. Particularly within the realm of machine learning, the utilization of extensive datasets for training purposes plays a pivotal role in enhancing algorithmic performance. However, it is common for data obtained exclusively from inertial sensors, a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), and depth sensors in underwater environments to not be publicly accessible. This research paper introduces an underwater navigation dataset derived from a controllable AUV that is equipped with high-precision fiber-optic inertial sensors, a DVL, and depth sensors. The dataset underwent rigorous testing through numerical calculations and optimization-based algorithms, with the evaluation of various algorithms being based on both the actual surfacing position and the calculated position.

AB Statistical learning techniques and increased computational power have facilitated the development of self-driving car technology. However, a limiting factor has been the high expense of scaling and maintaining high-definition (HD) maps. These maps are a crucial backbone for many approaches to self-driving technology. In response to this challenge, we present an approach that fuses pre-built point cloud map data with images to automatically and accurately identify static landmarks such as roads, sidewalks, and crosswalks. Our pipeline utilizes semantic segmentation of 2D images, associates semantic labels with points in point cloud maps to pinpoint locations in the physical world, and employs a confusion matrix formulation to generate a probabilistic bird's-eye view semantic map from semantic point clouds. The approach has been tested in an urban area with different segmentation networks to generate a semantic map with road features. The resulting map provides a rich context of the environment that is valuable for downstream tasks such as trajectory generation and intent prediction. Moreover, it has the potential to be extended to the automatic generation of HD maps for semantic features. The entire software pipeline is implemented in the robot operating system (ROS), a widely used robotics framework, and made available.

AB Real-time 3D object detection is a fundamental technique in numerous applications, such as autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and robot vision. However, current LiDAR-based 3D object detection algorithms allocate inadequate attention to the inhomogeneity of LiDAR point clouds and the shape encoding capability of regional proposal schemes. This paper introduces a novel 3D object detection network called the Shape Attention Regional Proposal Network (SARPNET), which deploys a new low-level feature encoder to remedy the sparsity and inhomogeneity of LiDAR point clouds with an even sample method, and embodies a shape attention mechanism that learns the statistic 3D shape priors of objects and uses them to spatially enhance semantic embeddings. Experimental results show that the proposed one-stage method outperforms state-of-the-art one-stage and even two-stage methods on the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark. It achieved a BEV AP of (87.26%, 62.80%), 3D AP of (75.64%, 60.43%), and orientation AP of (88.86%, 71.01%) for the detection of cars and cyclists, respectively. Besides, the method is the third winner in the nuScenes 3D Detection challenge of CVPR2019 Workshop on Autonomous Driving (WAD). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Features such as safety and longer flight times render lighter-than-air robots strong candidates for indoor navigation applications involving people. However, the existing interactive mobility solutions using such robots lack the capability to follow a long-distance user in a relatively larger indoor space. At the same time, the tracking data delivered to these robots are sensitive to uncertainties in indoor environments such as varying intensities of light and electromagnetic field disturbances. Regarding the above shortcomings, we proposed an ultra-wideband (UWB)-based lighter-than-air indoor robot for user-centered interactive applications. We developed the data processing scheme over a robot operating system (ROS) framework to accommodate the robot's integration needs for a user-centered interactive application. In order to explore the user interaction with the robot at a long-distance, the dual interactions (i.e., user footprint following and user intention recognition) were proposed by equipping the user with a hand-held UWB sensor. Finally, experiments were conducted inside a professional arena to validate the robot's pose tracking in which 3D positioning was compared with the 3D laser sensor, and to reveal the applicability of the user-centered autonomous following of the robot according to the dual interactions.

AB Autonomous cyber-physical systems (CPS) can improve safety and efficiency for safety-critical applications, but require rigorous testing before deployment. The complexity of these systems often precludes the use of formal verification and real-world testing can be too dangerous during development. Therefore, simulation-based techniques have been developed that treat the system under test as a black box operating in a simulated environment. Safety validation tasks include finding disturbances in the environment that cause the system to fail (falsification), finding the most-likely failure, and estimating the probability that the system fails. Motivated by the prevalence of safety-critical artificial intelligence, this work provides a survey of state-of-the-art safety validation techniques for CPS with a focus on applied algorithms and their modifications for the safety validation problem. We present and discuss algorithms in the domains of optimization, path planning, reinforcement learning, and importance sampling. Problem decomposition techniques are presented to help scale algorithms to large state spaces, which are common for CPS. A brief overview of safety-critical applications is given, including autonomous vehicles and aircraft collision avoidance systems. Finally, we present a survey of existing academic and commercially available safety validation tools.

ID SIGN DETECTION; VISION
AB In recent years, we have seen a large growth in the number of applications which use deep learning-based object detectors. Autonomous driving assistance systems (ADAS) are one of the areas where they have the most impact. This work presents a novel study evaluating a state-of-the-art technique for urban object detection and localization. In particular, we investigated the performance of the Faster R-CNN method to detect and localize urban objects in a variety of outdoor urban videos involving pedestrians, cars, bicycles and other objects moving in the scene (urban driving). We propose a new dataset that is used for benchmarking the accuracy of a real-time object detector (Faster R-CNN). Part of the data was collected using an HD camera mounted on a vehicle. Furthermore, some of the data is weakly annotated so it can be used for testing weakly supervised learning techniques. There already exist urban object datasets, but none of them include all the essential urban objects. We carried out extensive experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the baseline approach. Additionally, we propose an R-CNN plus tracking technique to accelerate the process of real-time urban object detection.

AB Pigeons may transmit diseases to humans and cause damages to buildings, monuments, and other infrastructure. Therefore, several control strategies have been developed, but they have been found to be either ineffective or harmful to animals and often depend on human operation. This study proposes a system capable of autonomously detecting and deterring pigeons on building roofs using a drone. The presence and position of pigeons were detected in real time by a neural network using images taken by a video camera located on the roof. Moreover, a drone was utilized to deter the animals. Field experiments were conducted in a real-world urban setting to assess the proposed system by comparing the number of animals and their stay durations for over five days against the 21-day-trial experiment without the drone. During the five days of experiments, the drone was automatically deployed 55 times and was significantly effective in reducing the number of birds and their stay durations without causing any harm to them. In conclusion, this study has proven the effectiveness of this system in deterring birds, and this approach can be seen as a fully autonomous alternative to the already existing methods.

ID SYSTEM
AB This paper describes the design, development, and testing of both hardware and software for a visual servoing-based system that enables agents within a heterogeneous marine robotic swarm to share energy. The goal of this system is prolonging the active operational time of the swarm as a whole, allowing it to perform long-term environmental monitoring and data collection missions. The implementation presented in the paper features an over-actuated autonomous surface platform docking up to four floating sensor nodes at a time and replenishing their batteries using wireless inductive charging. Mechanical solutions for each robot segment related to the docking procedure are presented, along with pertinent high-level and low-level control structures. A node featuring an extended Kalman filter and additional heuristics is used to fuse measurements from a neural network trained for object detection and a hue thresholding image processing algorithm, in order to track the docking target and achieve visual servoing. Finally, experimental results in both a controlled environment and challenging conditions on-site are presented. Once deployed, the developed system successfully enables the approach and docking of the designated target, showing its feasibility in different real-life conditions.

AB Redundant navigation systems are critical for safe operation of UAVs in high-risk environments. Since most commercial UAVs almost wholly rely on GPS, jamming, interference, and multi-pathing are real concerns that usually limit their operations to low-risk environments and visual line-of-sight. This letter presents a vision-based route-following system for the autonomous, safe return of UAVs under primary navigation failure such as GPS jamming. Using a Visual Teach and Repeat framework to build a visual map of the environment during an outbound flight, we show the autonomous return of the UAV by visually localizing the live view to this map when a simulated GPS failure occurs, controlling the vehicle to follow the safe outbound path back to the launch point. Using gimbal-stabilized stereo vision and inertial sensing alone, without reliance on external infrastructure, Visual Odometry and localization are achieved at altitudes of 5-25 m and flight speeds up to 55 km/h. We examine the performance of the visual localization algorithm under a variety of conditions and also demonstrate closed-loop autonomy along a complicated 450 m path.

DE Planning under uncertainty; Trajectory prediction; Gaussian processes
ID APPROXIMATION
AB This paper presents a real-time path planning algorithm that guarantees probabilistic feasibility for autonomous robots with uncertain dynamics operating amidst one or more dynamic obstacles with uncertain motion patterns. Planning safe trajectories under such conditions requires both accurate prediction and proper integration of future obstacle behavior within the planner. Given that available observation data is limited, the motion model must provide generalizable predictions that satisfy dynamic and environmental constraints, a limitation of existing approaches. This work presents a novel solution, named RR-GP, which builds a learned motion pattern model by combining the flexibility of Gaussian processes (GP) with the efficiency of RRT-Reach, a sampling-based reachability computation. Obstacle trajectory GP predictions are conditioned on dynamically feasible paths identified from the reachability analysis, yielding more accurate predictions of future behavior. RR-GP predictions are integrated with a robust path planner, using chance-constrained RRT, to identify probabilistically feasible paths. Theoretical guarantees of probabilistic feasibility are shown for linear systems under Gaussian uncertainty; approximations for nonlinear dynamics and/or non-Gaussian uncertainty are also presented. Simulations demonstrate that, with this planner, an autonomous vehicle can safely navigate a complex environment in real-time while significantly reducing the risk of collisions with dynamic obstacles.

ID DESIGN
AB Autonomous take-off and landing on a moving landing pad are extraordinarily complex and challenging functionalities of modern UAVs, especially if they must be performed in windy environments. The article presents research focused on achieving such functionalities for two kinds of UAVs, i.e., a tethered multicopter and VTOL. Both vehicles are supported by a landing pad navigation station, which communicates with their ROS-based onboard computer. The computer integrates navigational data from the UAV and the landing pad navigational station through the utilization of an extended Kalman filter, which is a typical approach in such applications. The novelty of the presented system is extending navigational data with data from the ultra wide band (UWB) system, and this makes it possible to achieve a landing accuracy of about 1 m. In the research, landing tests were carried out in real conditions on a lake for both UAVs. In the tests, a special mobile landing pad was built and based on a barge. The results show that the expected accuracy of 1 m is indeed achieved, and both UAVs are ready to be tested in real conditions on a ferry.

AB This paper reports on the formation and transformation of multiple fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in three-dimensional space. A cooperative guidance law based on the classic missile-type parallel-approach method is designed for the multi-UAV formation control problem. Additionally, formation transformation strategies for multi-UAV autonomous assembly, disbandment, and special circumstances are formed, effective for managing and controlling the formation. When formulating the management strategy for formation establishment, its process is divided into three steps: (i) selecting and allocating target points, (ii) forming loose formations, and (iii) forming short-range formations. The management of disbanding the formation is formulated through reverse thinking: the assembly process is split and recombined in reverse, and a formation disbanding strategy that can achieve a smooth transition from close to lose formation is proposed. Additionally, a strategy is given for adjusting the formation transformation in special cases, and the formation adjustment is completed using the adjacency matrix. Finally, a hardware-in-the-loop simulation and measured flight verification using a simulator show the practicality of the guidance law in meeting the control requirements of UAV formation flight for specific flight tasks.

DE Autonomous driving; city-scale road-boundary detection; HD map;
   self-attention
AB High-Definition (HD) maps can provide precise geometric and semantic information of static traffic environments for autonomous driving. Road-boundary is one important information presented in HD maps since it distinguishes between road areas and off-road areas, which can guide vehicles to drive within road areas. But it is labor-intensive to annotate road boundaries for HD maps at the city scale. To enable automatic HD map annotation, current work uses semantic segmentation or iterative graph growing for road-boundary detection. However, the former could not ensure topological correctness since it works at the pixel level, while the latter suffers from inefficiency and drifting issues. To provide a solution to the aforementioned problems, in this letter, we propose a novel system termed csBoundary to automatically detect road boundaries at the city scale for HD map annotation. Our network takes as input an aerial image patch, and directly infers the continuous road-boundary graph (i.e., vertices and edges) from this image. To generate the city-scale road-boundary graph, we stitch the obtained graphs from all the image patches. Our csBoundary is evaluated and compared on a public benchmark dataset. The results demonstrate our superiority.T

AB Road network graphs provide critical information for autonomous-vehicle applications, such as drivable areas that can be used for motion planning algorithms. To find road network graphs, manual annotation is usually inefficient and labor-intensive. Automatically detecting road network graphs could alleviate this issue, but existing works still have some limitations. For example, segmentation-based approaches could not ensure satisfactory topology correctness, and graph-based approaches could not present precise enough detection results. To provide a solution to these problems, we propose a novel approach based on transformer and imitation learning in this article. In view of that high-resolution aerial images could be easily accessed all over the world nowadays, we make use of aerial images in our approach. Taken as input an aerial image, our approach iteratively generates road network graphs vertex-by-vertex. Our approach can handle complicated intersection points with various numbers of incident road segments. We evaluate our approach on a publicly available dataset. The superiority of our approach is demonstrated through comparative experiments. Our work is accompanied by a demonstration video which is available at https://tonyxuqaq.github.io/projects/RNGDet/.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive and unified presentation of recent developments in skid-steer wheeled mobile robots (SSWMR) with regard to its control, guidance and navigation for the researchers who wish to study in this field. Design/methodology/approach Most of the contemporary unmanned ground robot's locomotion is based upon the wheels. For wheeled mobile robots (WMRs), one of the prominent and widely used driving schemes is skid steering. Because of mechanical simplicity and high maneuverability particularly in outdoor applications, SSWMR has an advantage over its counterparts. Different prospects of SSWMR have been discussed including its design, application, locomotion, control, navigation and guidance. The challenges pertaining to SSWMR have been pointed out in detail, which will seek the attention of the readers, who are interested to explore this area. Findings Relying on the recent literature on SSWMR, research gaps are identified that should be analyzed for the development of autonomous skid-steer wheeled robots. Originality/value An attempt to present a comprehensive review of recent advancements in the field of WMRs and providing references to the most intriguing studies.

AB The advent of autonomous cars, drones, and ships, the complexity of these systems is increasing, challenging risk analysis and risk mitigation, since the incorporation of software failures intro traditional risk analysis currently is difficult. Current methods that attempt software risk analysis, consider the interaction with hardware and software only superficially. These methods are often inconsistent regarding the level of analysis and cover often only selected software failures. This paper is a follow-up article of Thieme et al. [1] and presents a process for the analysis of functional software failures, their propagation, and incorporation of the results in traditional risk analysis methods, such as fault trees, and event trees. A functional view on software is taken, that allows for integration of software failure modes into risk analysis of the events and effects, and a common foundation for communication between risk analysts and domain experts. The proposed process can be applied during system development and operation in order to analyses the risk level and identify measures for system improvement. A case study focusing on a decision support system for an autonomous remotely operated vehicle working on a subsea oil and gas production system demonstrates the applicability of the proposed process.

AB Bird predation is one of the major concerns for fish culture in open ponds. A novel method for dispersing birds is the use of autonomous vehicles. Image recognition software can improve their efficiency. Several image processing techniques for recognition of birds have been tested. A series of morphological operations were implemented. We divided images into 3 types, Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3, based on the level of difficulty of recognizing birds. Type 1 images were clear; Type 2 images were medium clear, and Type 3 images were unclear. Local thresholding has been implemented using HSV (Hue, Saturation, and Value), GRAY, and RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) color models on all three sections of images and results were tabulated. Template matching using normal correlation and artificial neural networks (ANN) are the other methods that have been developed in this study in addition to image morphology. Template matching produced satisfactory results irrespective of the difficulty level of images, but artificial neural networks produced accuracies of 100, 60, and 50% on Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 images, respectively. Correct classification rate can be increased by further training. Future research will focus on testing the recognition algorithms in natural or aquacultural settings on autonomous boats. Applications of such techniques to industrial, agricultural, or related areas are additional future possibilities.

DT Article
DE Deep learning for visual perception; computer vision for transportation
AB Lane-level scene annotations provide invaluable data in autonomous vehicles for trajectory planning in complex environments such as urban areas and cities. However, obtaining such data is time-consuming and expensive since lane annotations have to be annotated manually by humans and are as such hard to scale to large areas. In this work, we propose a novel approach for lane geometry estimation from bird's-eye-view images. We formulate the problem of lane shape and lane connections estimation as a graph estimation problem where lane anchor points are graph nodes and lane segments are graph edges. We train a graph estimation model on multimodal bird's-eye-view data processed from the popular NuScenes dataset and its map expansion pack. We furthermore estimate the direction of the lane connection for each lane segment with a separate model which results in a directed lane graph. We illustrate the performance of our LaneGraphNet model on the challenging NuScenes dataset and provide extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation. Our model shows promising performance for most evaluated urban scenes and can serve as a step towards automated generation of HD lane annotations for autonomous driving. The dataset will be made available at http://lanegraph.informatik.uni-freiburg.de.

AB The needs for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle navigation (AUN) have been emerging for recent years due to the growth of the logistic industry and the need for social distancing during the pandemic. There have been different methods trying to overcome the AUN task, and most of them have focused on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). But the results were still far from satisfactory, and even if the result was good, the environment was usually too trivial and simple. We report in this paper one of the causes of low success rate for AUN in our previous work, which is the apprehensive behavior of agents. After numerous episodes of training, when the agent faces risky scenes, it often moves back and forth repeatedly until running out of the limited steps. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new role, LifeGuard, into the popular DRL model, Actor-Critic, to tackle the apprehensive behavior and expect a better success rate. In addition, we developed a pilot method of unsupervised classification for sequential data to further enhance our reward function from previous work, augmentative backward reward function. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method can eliminate the apprehensive behavior and gain higher success rates than the state-of-the-art method, FORK, with lesser effort.

AB This paper presents new control designs and implementations of truck-trailer path following in forward and backward motions. The path following controls are designed in two modes, which are the controls with reference on the head-truck (RH-control) and with reference on the trailer (RT-control). Both modes aim to converge the distance and orientation errors of the head-truck as well as the trailer with respect to the desired path to zero. Using the designed controls, the asymptotic stabilities of the equilibrium points (i.e., error points equal to zeros) are analyzed using the Lyapunov method. The performances of RH-and RT-controls in controlling the truck-trailer are compared for forward and backward motions. The simulation results show that the RT-controls perform better than the RH-controls and the RT-controls can be applied for a curve-path following in both forward and backward directions. The experimental results of a prototype truck-trailer show the effectiveness of the proposed controls. (C) 2020 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To improve the lane detection accuracy of blurred images, a network (Lane-GAN) for lane line detection is proposed in the paper, which is robust to blurred images. First, real and complex blur kernels are simulated to construct a blurred image dataset, and the improved GAN network is used to reinforce the lane features of the blurred image, and finally the feature information is further enriched with a recurrent feature transfer aggregator. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network can get robust detection results in complex environments, especially for blurred lane lines. Compared with the SOTA detector, the proposed detector achieves a larger gain. The proposed method can enhance the lane detail features of the blurred image, improving the detection accuracy of the blurred lane effectively, in the driver assistance system in high speed and complex road conditions.

ID AUTONOMOUS EXPLORATION
AB As vision-based navigation of small aircraft has been demonstrated to reach relative maturity, research into effective path-planning algorithms to complete the loop of autonomous navigation has been booming. Although the literature has seen some impressive works in this area, efficient path-planning that can be used in tasks such as inspection and coverage is still an open problem. In this spirit, this letter presents an online path-planning algorithm for fast exploration and 3D reconstruction of a previously unknown area of interest. Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) are an ideal candidate for this task due to their maneuverability, but their limited computational power and endurance require efficient planning strategies. Popular sampling-based methods randomly sample the MAV's configuration space and evaluate viewpoints according to their expected information gain. Most often, however, valuable resources are spent on information gain calculations of unpromising viewpoints. This letter proposes a novel informed sampling approach that leverages surface frontiers to sample viewpoints only where high information gain is expected, leading to faster exploration. We study the impact of informed sampling in a wide range of photo-realistic scenes, and we show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art exploration path planners in terms of both speed and reconstruction quality.

AB With the development of autonomous driving, lane-level maps have attracted significant attention. Since the lane-level road network is an important part of the lane-level map, the efficient, low-cost, and automatic generation of lane-level road networks has become increasingly important. We propose a new method here that generates lane-level road networks using only position information based on an autonomous vehicle and the existing lane-level road networks from the existing road-level professionally surveyed without lane details. This method uses the parallel relationship between the centerline of a lane and the centerline of the corresponding segment. Since the direct point-by-point computation is huge, we propose a method based on a trajectory-similarity-join pruning strategy (TSJ-PS). This method uses a filter-and-verify search framework. First, it performs quick segmentation based on the minimum distance and then uses the similarity of two trajectories to prune the trajectory similarity join. Next, it calculates the centerline trajectory for lanes using the simulation transformation model by the unpruned trajectory points. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm and generate a lane-level road network via experiments on a real road.

AB The electric conductivity distribution of the Earth's crust and upper mantle provides a key to unraveling its structure. Information can be obtained from vector data time series of the natural variations of the magnetic and electric field in a directional stable reference frame. Applying this method, known as magnetotellurics, to oceanic regions is challenging since only vector instruments placed at the sea bottom can provide such data. Here, we discuss a concept of marine induction surveying which is based on sea-surface scalar magnetic field measurements from a modern position-keeping platform. The concept exploits scalar magnetic responses that relate variations of the scalar magnetic field at the survey sites with variations of the horizontal magnetic field at a reference site. A 3-D model study offshore Oahu Island (Hawaii) demonstrates that these responses are sensitive to the conductivity structure beneath the ocean. We conclude that the sensitivity, depending on the bathymetry gradient, is typically largest near the coast offshore. We show that such sea-surface marine induction surveys can be performed with the Wave Glider, an easy-to-deploy, autonomous, energy-harvesting floating platform with position-keeping capability.

AB A multi-region scene matching-based localisation system for automated navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) is proposed. This system may serve as a backup navigation error correction system to support autonomous navigation in the absence of a global positioning system such as a Global Navigation Satellite System. Conceptually, the system computes the location of the UAV by comparing the sensed images taken by an on board optical camera with a library of pre-recorded geo-referenced images. Several challenging issues in building such a system are addressed, including the colour variability problem and elimination of time-varying details from the pairs of images. The overall algorithm is an iterative process involving four sub-processes: firstly, exact histogram matching is applied to sensed images to overcome the colour variability issues; secondly, regions are automatically extracted from the sensed image where landmarks are detected via their colour histograms; thirdly, these regions are matched against the library, while eliminating inconsistent regions between underlying image pairs in the registration process; and finally the location of the UAV is computed using an optimisation procedure which minimises the localisation error using affine transformations. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed system in terms of accuracy, robustness and computational efficiency.

AB High-resolution autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-based multibeam bathymetry and chirp sub-bottom profiles were used to map the axial channels of Santa Monica and Redondo Canyon-Channel Systems, offshore southern California. The new bathymetry reveals the seafloor morphology at 1-meter grid resolution, whereas sub-bottom chirp and regional multichannel seismic reflection (MCS) profiles allow characterizing the shallow and deep sedimentary record, respectively. Even though these two submarine canyons have coexisted under the same regional controls (i.e., tectonics and sea-level changes), they have evolved distinctly over time. Turbidity current activity along the Redondo Canyon-Channel System as a result of canyon-head incision to the presentday shoreline resulted in a different geomorphology compared to the abandoned Santa Monica Canyon.
   The Redondo Canyon and channel system presents a number of morphologies, namely terraces, gullies, arcuate scarps, distinctive canyon-floor scarps (DCFS), crescent-shaped bedforms (CSBs) and scours. Their geneses, especially the CSBs along the Redondo axial channel, are the result of the morphodynamic interaction between turbidity flows and the seafloor. We infer that sediment gravity flows are the dominant process shaping the Redondo Canyon and channel system and transporting material to the San Pedro Basin. In contrast, the Santa Monica Canyon displays a smooth, flat-bottomed and partially in-filled axial channel, which lacks axial incision and large sediment bedforms indicating infilling at present. We interpret the large scours on the flanks of Santa Monica Canyon and the sediment waves on the Redondo Fan, respectively, as bedforms produced by repeated cyclic steps in turbidity currents which alternated between net erosional and net depositional.

AB The advancement of autonomous vehicles and concerns about ship navigation safety have resulted in a greater need for ship model quality. However, in situations where there is limited prior information or data available about the system, the development of accurate models can be challenging. To address this issue, we propose a knowledge transfer strategy that can migrate and adapt domain knowledge from a well-modeled benchmark ship to a target ship. The benchmark, or source ship, should resemble the target ship in the feature space and reveal similar trends in the prediction horizon. By incorporating informative trends into the data-driven transfer function, the representative model of the target ship can be considerably enhanced. In this study, the experiments are conducted on two full-scale vessels that characterize different dimensions and dynamic properties. A feature vector is introduced to evaluate the configuration similarity between vessels, and ship maneuverability is compared to authorize the security of predictive tendency. The derived target ship model is verified to accurately predict maneuvering trajectories in various scenarios, demonstrating that knowledge transfer from a source ship facilitates the target ship modeling process. This approach provide new insights into the development of models for systems with confined information.

AB Driving safely requires multiple capabilities from human and intelligent agents, such as the generalizability to unseen environments, the safety awareness of the surrounding traffic, and the decision-making in complex multi-agent settings. Despite the great success of Reinforcement Learning (RL), most of the RL research works investigate each capability separately due to the lack of integrated environments. In this work, we develop a new driving simulation platform called MetaDrive to support the research of generalizable reinforcement learning algorithms for machine autonomy. MetaDrive is highly compositional, which can generate an infinite number of diverse driving scenarios from both the procedural generation and the real data importing. Based on MetaDrive, we construct a variety of RL tasks and baselines in both single-agent and multi-agent settings, including benchmarking generalizability across unseen scenes, safe exploration, and learning multi-agent traffic. The generalization experiments conducted on both procedurally generated scenarios and real-world scenarios show that increasing the diversity and the size of the training set leads to the improvement of the RL agent's generalizability. We further evaluate various safe reinforcement learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms in MetaDrive environments and provide the benchmarks.

AB This article proposes a deep learning-based autonomous concrete crack detection technique using hybrid images. The hybrid images combining vision and infrared thermography images are able to improve crack detectability while minimizing false alarms. In particular, large-scale concrete-made infrastructures such as bridge and dam can be effectively inspected by spatially scanning the unmanned vehicle-mounted hybrid imaging system including a vision camera, an infrared camera, and a continuous-wave line laser. However, the expert-dependent decision-making for crack identification which has been widely used in industrial fields is often cumbersome, time-consuming, and unreliable. As a target concrete structure gets larger, automated decision-making becomes more desirable from the practical point of view. The proposed technique is able to achieve automated crack identification and visualization by transfer learning of a well-trained deep convolutional neural network, that is, GoogLeNet, while retaining the advantages of the hybrid images. The proposed technique is experimentally validated using a lab-scale concrete specimen with cracks of various sizes. The test results reveal that macro- and microcracks are automatically visualized while minimizing false alarms.

ID DIRECTIONAL WAVE SPECTRA
AB Understanding current environmental conditions is essential for autonomous ships, among which real-time estimation of sea conditions is a key aspect. Considering the ship as a large wave buoy, the sea state can be estimated from motion responses without extra sensors installed. This task is challenging since the relationship between the wave and the ship motion is hard to model. Existing methods include a wave buoy analogy (WBA) method, which assumes linearity between wave and ship motion, and a machine learning (ML) approach. Since the data collected from a vessel in the real world are typically limited to a small range of sea states, the ML method might fail when the encountered sea state is not in the training dataset. This article proposes a hybrid approach that combines the above two methods. The ML method is compensated by the WBA method based on the uncertainty of estimation results, and thus, the failure can be avoided. Real-world historical data from the Research Vessel Gunnerus are applied to validate the approach. Results indicate that the hybrid approach improves the estimation accuracy.

ID PARALLEL PARKING
AB This paper presents the design and development of a technique for an Autonomous and Versatile mode Parking System (AVPS) that combines a various number of parking modes. The proposed approach is different from that of many developed parking systems. Previous research has focused on choosing only a parking lot starting from two parking modes (which are parallel and perpendicular). This research aims at developing a parking system that automatically chooses a parking lot starting from four parking modes. The automatic AVPS was proposed for the car-parking control problem, and could be potentially exploited for future vehicle generation. A specific mode can be easily computed using the proposed strategy. A variety of candidate modes could be generated using one developed real time VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) algorithm providing optimal solutions with performance measures. Based on simulation and experimental results, the AVPS is able to find and recognize in advance which parking mode to select. This combination describes full implementation on a mobile robot, such as a car, based on a specific FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) card. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed innovation, an evaluation process comparing the proposed technique with existing techniques was conducted and outlined.

AB This paper presents a scalable prototype surveillance/alarm system for public transportation safety applications over railway environments with emphasis given in the wireless vehicular communication inside a tunnel after an emergency event. An heterogeneous hybrid vehicular wireless network consisted of IEEE 802.11b/g/e and IEEE 802.16e is being deployed inside a tunnel environment for surveillance reasons. We provide a highly modular architecture system design covering a wide range of applications both in terms of monitored spaces (metro stations, trains, buses and other public transport) and in terms of threats to public safety (security incidents, accidental events, natural hazards) based on autonomous, smart monitoring devices that capture data only upon the occurrence of an incident, potentially dangerous for the passengers (like an explosion blast or the triggering of the fire detector). Moreover, we evaluate the experimental performance of the proposed vehicular hybrid WiMAX/WLAN wireless network after an emergency situation, for this reason we emulate the train coaches movement with vehicles inside a tunnel field. Finally, we also survey on the impact of Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) over the hybrid wireless network comparing the experimental results.

AB This paper presents the nonlinear modeling of the yaw and longitudinal dynamics of a tractor-trailer system. First, the yaw dynamic models of both the tractor and trailer are derived considering the lateral forces and side-slip angles. In order to be able to calculate the side-slips precisely, the relaxation length approach is preferred. Since the obtained yaw dynamic models are nonlinear, a constrained nonlinear optimization problem is formulated for the parameter estimation. Second, the longitudinal dynamic model for the system is derived based-on the static and dynamic responses. The static model consist of two inputs, the hydrostat position and the diesel engine speed, and one output, the longitudinal speed of the system. Afterwards, a dynamic model is proposed to define the dynamic effect between the output of the static model and the actual longitudinal speed. Third, the mathematical models of the steering mechanisms both for the tractor and trailer are identified. Consequently, a complete nonlinear dynamic model for the tractor-trailer system is obtained. The overall resulting model is thought to provide useful physical insight on such a complex mechatronic system, and can serve as the input for model based controller design. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Objectives. This study attempts to introduce the Driving Locus of Control (DLoC), a method focused on the internal or external source of attribution of the driving behaviour, to the Czech context. This study also relates DLoC to attitudes towards autonomous vehicles (AVs).
   Participants and setting. Out of the general population, 59 inquirers personally interviewed (CAPI) 1 065 respondents (49% women) in the age range between 15 and 92 years (M = 50, SD = 17). The respondents were sampled via multi-stage random sampling procedure, based on the list of addresses in the Czech Republic. Hypotheses. The authors hypothesised to replicate the original two-factor structure of the DLOC Scale and that the higher levels of internal DLoC result in not considering the improvement in traffic safety as the AVs replace human drivers.
   Statistical analysis. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to analyse the factor structure of DLoC Scale. Hypotheses related to the empirical validity of the method were assessed via structural equation modelling. Reliability of DLoC Scale was calculated in terms of internal consistency (McDonald coefficient).
   Results. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed reasonably good support for structural validity of the one-dimensional DLoC-CZ15 factor model (chi 2 = 426.967, df = 90, CFI = 0.964, TLI = 0.958, SRMR = 0.066, RMSEA = 0.065). In addition, the one-dimensional DLoC-CZ15 factor model showed acceptable internal consistency - omega = 0.9 (95% CI [0.89, 0.91]). The structural equation modelling found a relationship between DLoC and some of the items capturing attitudes towards AVs, too.
   Study limitations. The analysed data were obtained via interviews between respondents and inquirers. As a result, the study does not contain indicators of empirical validity measured by a methodologically different approach, such as an observation of driving behaviour.

AB This paper aims at developing an autonomous entry guidance method that requires no mission dependent adjustments and will be applicable to a wide range of entry scenarios with worldwide destinations. Firstly, a nonlinear reduced-order entry dynamical system with coupled lateral and longitudinal motions as well as a spherical and rotating Earth is proposed. This system relates the vertical and lateral lift-to-drag ratio profiles to the position and azimuth angle variables with the energy as the independent variable. It has a high computational accuracy even only three differential equations are involved. Secondly, a trajectory planning problem with only two bank reversals is formulated based on this reduced-order system with parameterized control. Trajectory integration prediction and linearization method are applied to transfer the original planning problem into iteratively solving a group of linear dynamical equations. Gauss Pseudospectral Method and Calculus of variations are employed to discrete them so as to derive a series of analytical correction formulas to eliminate the final errors, mathematically, which achieves high accuracy with a small number of points. Moreover, these control parameters include not only the magnitude of bank angle, but also bank reversal points, which will significantly increase its ability to shape the entry trajectory. After the last bank reversal, lateral and longitudinal guidance laws are designed to ensure multiple final constraints. Nominal testing and Monte Carlo simulations on the proposed method and the comparison with the typical predictor corrector method are carried out. Results demonstrate that, even in highly dispersed environments, this method has wide applicability, strong robustness, and excellent performance. Moreover, its computational efficiency is so high that it sufficiently satisfies the requirement on onboard application. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Fruit and vegetable intake is insufficient in industrialized nations and long-haul heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers are considered a particularly at-risk group. The aim of the current study was to test the effectiveness of a multi-theory, dual-phase model to predict fruit and vegetable consumption in Australian long-haul HGV drivers. A secondary aim was to examine the effect of past fruit and vegetable consumption on model paths. A prospective design with two waves of data collection spaced one week apart was adopted. Long-haul HGV drivers (N = 212) completed an initial survey containing theory-based measures of motivation (autonomous motivation, intention), social cognition (attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control), and volition (action planning, coping planning) for fruit and vegetable consumption. One week later, participants (n = 84) completed a self-report measure of fruit and vegetable intake over the previous week. A structural equation model revealed that autonomous motivation predicted intentions, mediated through attitudes and perceived behavioural control. It further revealed that perceived behavioural control, action planning, and intentions predicted fruit and vegetable intake, whereby the intention-behaviour relationship was moderated by coping planning. Inclusion of past behaviour attenuated the effects of these variables. The model identified the relative contribution of motivation, social cognition, and volitional components in predicting fruit and vegetable intake of HGV drivers. Consistent with previous research, inclusion of past fruit and vegetable consumption led to an attenuation of model effects, particularly the intention-behaviour relationship. Further investigation is needed to determine which elements of past behaviour exert most influence on future action. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Multi-AUV planning of cooperative path represents the intelligence level of AUV formation system, which has attracted significant attention due to its flexibility and robustness. To enhance the speed and exploration capability of the multi-AUV autonomous path planner, this paper proposes an Age-based Multi-population Particle Swarm Optimization (AMPSO) for three-dimensional path planning of multiple AUVs. Firstly, reverse chaotic mapping is employed to enhance the initial distribution, enabling them to better adapt to the optimi-zation process. In addition, the introduction of multiple populations helps to enhance the diversity within the population, thereby accelerating the convergence rate. Taking into account the search ability, the concept of an "age" coefficient is proposed to optimize the velocity updating formula to reduce the effect of inferior particles. Furthermore, a velocity-independent updating mode is suggested to enhance the population diversity by selecting different update modes. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, Monte Carlo simu-lations are conducted for AUV formations across two tracking tasks within the underwater environment estab-lished in this paper. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other commonly used algorithms in terms of both speed and optimality, so the proposed AMPSO can be used for multi-AUV cooperative planning.

AB Despite the fact that autonomous driving systems are progressing in terms of their automation levels, the achievement of fully self-driving cars is still far from realization. Currently, most new cars accord with the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Level 2 of automation, which requires the driver to be able to take control of the car when needed: for this reason, it is believed that between now and the achievement of fully automated self-driving car systems, there will be a transition, in which remote driving cars will be a reality. In addition, there are tele-operation-use cases that require remote driving for health or safety reasons. However, there is a lack of detailed design and implementation available in the public domain for remote driving cars: therefore, in this work we propose a functional framework for remote driving vehicles. We implemented a prototype, using a commercial car. The prototype was connected to a commercial 4G/5G mobile network, and empirical experiments were conducted, to validate the prototype's functions, and to evaluate its performance in real-world driving conditions. The design, implementation, and empirical evaluation provided detailed technical insights into this important research and innovation area.

AB This work proposes a framework to design, formulate and implement a path tracker for self-driving cars (SDC) based on a nonlinear model-predictive-control (NMPC) approach. The presented methodology is developed to be used by designers in the industrial sector, practitioners, and academics. Therefore, it is straight forward, flexible, and comprehensive. It allows the designer to easily integrate multiple objective terms in the cost function either opposing or correlating. The proposed design of the controller not only targets accurate tracking but also comfortable ride and fast travel time by introducing several sub-objective terms in the main cost function to satisfy these goals. These sub-objective terms are weighted according to their contribution to the optimization problem. The SDC-NMPC framework is developed using the high-performance language C++ and utilizes highly optimized math and optimization libraries for best real-time performance. This makes the SDC-MPC well suited for use in both ADAS and self-driving cars. Extensive simulation studies featuring complex tracks with many sharp turns have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed SDC-NMPC at different speeds. The presented analysis shows that the proposed controller with its tuning technique outperforms that of the PID-based controller.

ID SEPARATION CONTROL; AIRFOIL
AB The concept of a self-governing smart plasma slat for active sense and control of flow separation and incipient wing stall is presented. The smart plasma slat design involves the use. of an aerodynamic plasma actuator on the leading edge of a two-dimensional NACA 0015 airfoil in a manner that mimics the effect of a movable leading-edge slat of a conventional high-lift system. The self-governing system uses a single high-bandwidth pressure sensor and a feedback controller to operate the actuator in an autonomous mode with a primary function to sense And control incipient flow separation at the wing leading edge and to delay incipient stall. Two feedback control techniques are investigated. Wind tunnel experiments demonstrate that the aerodynamic effects of a smart actuator are consistent with the previously tested open-loop actuator, in that stall hysteresis is eliminated, stall angle is delayed by 7 deg, and a significant improvement in the lift-to-drag ratio is achieved over a wide range of angles of attack. These feedback control approaches provide a means to further reduce power requirements for an unsteady plasma actuator for 'practical air vehicle applications. The smart plasma slat concept is well suited for the design of low-drag, quiet, high-lift systems for fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft.

AB Autonomous exploration is a fundamental problem for certain applications of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). Depth cameras are widely used in exploring indoor and specific outdoor environments. However, existing methods suffer from inefficient and unstable performance of exploration in open outdoor environments. This study develops a framework to achieve fast and robust three-dimensional exploration by UGVs with a gimbal camera in challenging outdoor environments. A hierarchical reactive planning approach based on a multilayered map is proposed to improve exploration efficiency. Additionally, an adaptive semantic mapping algorithm is proposed to more accurately and stably represent the environmental localization uncertainty. Localization uncertainty is integrated into the planning approach to decrease odometry drift and prevent localization failure, further enhancing the exploration robustness. A viewpoint tracking controller based on terrain-aware model predictive control is proposed to guarantee the accuracy of the planned viewpoint tracking and to further improve the robustness of localization and exploration on rough terrains. Finally, several physical-engine simulations and experiments in outdoor environments are performed. The comparisons to existing state-of-the-art approaches have verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The code of our system will be available at .

AB This paper presents the results of the design and field deployment of multiple autonomous fixed-wing unmanned aircraft into supercell thunderstorms. As part of a field campaign in Spring 2019, up to three fixed-wing unmanned aircraft were deployed simultaneously into different regions of supercell thunderstorms, To learn more about the atmospheric conditions that lead to the formation of tornadoes. Successful field deployment is attributed to (a) a nomadic concept of operations that allows the unmanned aircraft system team and science team to work seamlessly together while satisfying all aviation regulations and (b) the ruggedized RAAVEN unmanned aircraft system with modular features that favor rapid, ease-of-use over the brute strength of previous designs. The concept of operations and the unmanned aircraft system are described along with results from a 4 day window where four storms were sampled: two of these storms were tornadic (formed tornadoes before, during, or after being sampled) and two were not. These results validate the feasibility of nomadic operation of multiple unmanned aircraft simultaneously in severe weather conditions. Further, the successful field deployments demonstrate the importance of the modular unmanned aircraft design.

AB An autonomous online collision avoidance methodology for satellite clusters is developed and simulated. Contours of probability, defined using state uncertainty ellipsoids, are used to monitor and predict potential collisions over time. The methodology integrates three approaches in order to reduce online computation for autonomous operations while still producing accurate predictions: 1) monitoring distances between bounded probability ellipsoids, which are used to evaluate when and how fast A collision may occur, 2) monitoring ellipsoids as they intersect, then calculating an outer bound of collision probability, and 3) numerical evaluation of collision probability using a three-dimensional (3-D), convolution integral to evaluate conservatism and insure accuracy, The approach assumes the initial state error (relative position and Velocity), sensor error, and disturbance function are. bounded by, ellipsoids to a known level of probability. The methodology can be applied in the presence of different control schemes and system faults. If a collision is imminent, a control reconfiguration can then occur in order to move the healthy satellites to parking orbits. Simulation, results show the proposed methodology to not be overly conservative. In addition, results show that satellite clusters with a close proximity will require a backup system that is accurate and gives measurement updates at least every few minutes.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles, as well as micro-mobility devices (e-scooters, e-bikes, and smartphones), constantly generate tremendous amounts of mobility data, comprising spatio-temporal trajectories and other sensory data, the sharing of which can assist in different safety and intelligent transportation system applications. However, constant sharing of such data for real-time mobility decisions could violate the privacy of respective users. At the same time, malicious users could generate and share false data, which would be potentially harmful for stakeholders relying on this data for their safety and mobility decisions. In this paper, we propose a new framework: Blockchain-Enabled Location Identification and Efficient Validation with Encryption" (BELIEVE)-a blockchain-based platform with multi-party computation (MPC)-to securely validate data from a mobility source without violating the user's privacy. The smart contractin BELIEVE first enables a source to initiate the mobility data validation process, then enables mobile peers in the vicinity to reach a consensus on the data validation using MPC without requiring the source to share raw data, thereby preserving the user's privacy. The spatio-temporal validation is then updated on a distributed ledger (Inter Planetary File System) as an immutable transaction. Real-time data validation is challenging, considering constant mobility alongside the reduction of resource consumption at the devices and, therefore, to address this, we employ an adaptive approach to the problem where the validation frequency as well as storage on the blockchain are dynamically decided by the nodes, based on the network conditions. We evaluate BELIEVE using a simulation model developed for a portion of New York City, U.S., transportation network and it achieves lower delays and overhead.

AB Autonomous outdoor operations of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), such as quadrotors, expose the aircraft to wind gusts causing a significant reduction in their position-holding performance. This vulnerability becomes more critical during the automated docking of these vehicles to outdoor charging stations. Utilising real-time wind preview information for the gust rejection control of UAVs has become more feasible due to the advancement of remote wind sensing technology such as LiDAR. This work proposes the use of a wind-preview-based Model Predictive Controller (MPC) to utilise remote wind measurements from a LiDAR for disturbance rejection. Here a ground-based LiDAR unit is used to predict the incoming wind disturbance at the takeoff and landing site of an autonomous quadrotor UAV. This preview information is then utilised by an MPC to provide the optimal compensation over the defined horizon. Simulations were conducted with LiDAR data gathered from field tests to verify the efficacy of the proposed system and to test the robustness of the wind-preview-based control. The results show a favourable improvement in the aircraft response to wind gusts with the addition of wind preview to the MPC; An 80% improvement in its position-holding performance combined with reduced rotational rates and peak rotational angles signifying a less aggressive approach to increased performance when compared with only feedback based MPC disturbance rejection. System robustness tests demonstrated a 1.75 s or 120% margin in the gust preview's timing or strength respectively before adverse performance impact. The addition of wind-preview to an MPC has been shown to increase the gust rejection of UAVs over standard feedback-based MPC thus enabling their precision landing onto docking stations in the presence of wind gusts.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have been widely applied in the vicinity of the seafloor for various purposes, including pipeline, cable, and structure inspection; bottom detection and following; and bottom-mounted docking systems. Squatting is a crucial problem that occurs when cruising in the vicinity of the seafloor, which affects the maneuverability and safety of an AUV. Therefore, it is necessary to have a high-accuracy prediction of the AUV hydrodynamic performance to obtain an automatic guidance controller for safety. In this study, the hydrodynamic performance was investigated by a physics-based unsteady simulation of a self-propelled AUV approaching seafloor using multi-block hybrid dynamic grid method, combined with six degrees of freedom (6DOF), user-defined functions (UDFs), and Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) approach. This simulation was used to explore the principle of the complex unsteady motions experienced by an AUV operating at the vertical plane in the vicinity of the seafloor. The results indicated that, for an AUV speed higher than the critical speed (0.5 m/s at H/D = 1.832, where R-e = 5.49 x 10(5)), the AUV experienced a speed loss and increased resistance, thrust, and suck force. The speed loss was due to the larger increment in resistance than that in thrust. The magnitude and direction of the trim moment were highly sensitive to variations in AUV speed, resulting from the two low-pressure regions. One region was at the AUV bow neck induced by the bow vortex and the other was at the AUV stern neck induced by the rotating propeller. The unsteady interaction between the AUV and seafloor during AUV self-propulsion was elucidated by flow analysis. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SELF-AWARENESS
AB In recent days, it is becoming essential to ensure that the outcomes of signal processing methods based on machine learning (ML) data-driven models can provide interpretable predictions. The interpretability of ML models can be defined as the capability to understand the reasons that contributed to generating a given outcome in a complex autonomous or semi-autonomous system. The necessity of interpretability is often related to the evaluation of performances in complex systems and the acceptance of agents' automatization processes where critical high-risk decisions have to be taken. This paper concentrates on one of the core functionality of such systems, i.e., abnormality detection, and on choosing a model representation modality based on a data-driven machine learning (ML) technique such that the outcomes become interpretable. The interpretability in this work is achieved through graph matching of semantic level vocabulary generated from the data and their relationships. The proposed approach assumes that the data-driven models to be chosen should support emergent self-awareness (SA) of the agents at multiple abstraction levels. It is demonstrated that the capability of incrementally updating learned representation models based on progressive experiences of the agent is shown to be strictly related to interpretability capability. As a case study, abnormality detection is analyzed as a primary feature of the collective awareness (CA) of a network of vehicles performing cooperative behaviors. Each vehicle is considered an example of an Internet of Things (IoT) node, therefore providing results that can be generalized to an IoT framework where agents have different sensors, actuators, and tasks to be accomplished. The capability of a model to allow evaluation of abnormalities at different levels of abstraction in the learned models is addressed as a key aspect for interpretability.

TI Vacant Parking Slot Recognition Method for Practical Autonomous Valet

SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
LA English
DT Article
DE parking slot detection; parking assist system; parking slot junction;
   parking slot feature
AB The parking assist system (PAS) provides information of parking slots around the vehicle. As the demand for an autonomous system is increasing, intelligent PAS has been developed to park the vehicle without the driver's intervention. To locate parking slots, most existing methods detect slot markings on the ground using an around-view monitoring (AVM) image. There are many types of parking slots of different shapes in the real world. Due to this fact, these methods either limit their target types or use predefined slot information of different types to cover the types. However, the approach using predefined slot information cannot handle more complex cases where the slot markings are connected to other line markings and the angle between slot marking is slightly different from the predefined settings. To overcome this problem, we propose a method to detect parking slots of various shapes without predefined type information. The proposed method is the first to introduce a free junction type feature to represent the structure of parking slot junction. Since the parking slot has a modular or repeated junction pattern at both sides, junction pair consisting of one parking slot can be detected using the free junction type feature. In this process, the geometrically symmetric characteristic of the junction pair is crucial to find each junction pair. The entrance of parking slot is reconstructed according to the structure of junction pair. Then, the vacancy of the parking slot is determined by a support vector machine. The Kalman tracker is applied for each detected parking slot to ensure stability of the detection in consecutive frames. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method by using manually collected datasets, captured in different parking environments. The experimental results show that the proposed method successfully detects various types of parking slots without predefined slot type information in different environments.

AB As the development and deployment of in-vehicle intelligent safety systems (ISS) for crash avoidance and mitigation have rapidly increased in the last decades, the need to evaluate their prospective safety benefits before introduction has never been higher. Counterfactual simulations using relevant mathematical models (for vehicle dynamics, sensors, the environment, ISS algorithms, and models of driver behavior) have been identified as having high potential. However, although most of these models are relatively mature, models of driver behavior in the critical seconds before a crash are still relatively immature. There are also large conceptual differences between different driver models. The objective of this paper is, firstly, to demonstrate the importance of the choice of driver model when counterfactual simulations are used to evaluate two ISS: Forward collision warning (FCW), and autonomous emergency braking (AEB). Secondly, the paper demonstrates how counterfactual simulations can be used to perform sensitivity analyses on parameter settings, both for driver behavior and ISS algorithms. Finally, the paper evaluates the effect of the choice of glance distribution in the driver behavior model on the safety benefit estimation. The paper uses pre-crash kinematics and driver behavior from 34 rear-end crashes from the SHRP2 naturalistic driving study for the demonstrations. The results for FCW show a large difference in the percent of avoided crashes between conceptually different models of driver behavior, while differences were small for conceptually similar models. As expected, the choice of model of driver behavior did not affect AEB benefit much. Based on our results, researchers and others who aim to evaluate ISS with the driver in the loop through counterfactual simulations should be sure to make deliberate and well-grounded choices of driver models: the choice of model matters.

AB The volume of obstacles encountered in the marine environment is rapidly increasing, which makes the development of collision avoidance systems more challenging. Several fuzzy ontology-based simulators have been proposed to provide a virtual platform for the analysis of maritime missions. However, due to the simulators' limitations, ontology-based knowledge cannot be utilized to evaluate maritime robot algorithms and to avoid collisions. The existing simulators must be equipped with smart semantic domain knowledge to provide an efficient framework for the decision-making system of AUVs. This article presents type-2 fuzzy ontology-based semantic knowledge (T2FOBSK) and a simulator for marine users that will reduce experimental time and the cost of marine robots and will evaluate algorithms intelligently. The system reformulates the user's query to extract the positions of AUVs and obstacles and convert them to a proper format for the simulator. The simulator uses semantic knowledge to calculate the degree of collision risk and to avoid obstacles. The available type-1 fuzzy ontology-based approach cannot extract intensively blurred data from the hazy marine environment to offer actual solutions. Therefore, we propose a type-2 fuzzy ontology to provide accurate information about collision risk and the marine environment during real-time marine operations. Moreover, the type-2 fuzzy ontology is designed using Protege OWL-2 tools. The DL query and SPARQL query are used to evaluate the ontology. The distance to closest point of approach (DCPA), time to closest point of approach (TCPA) and variation of compass degree (VCD) are used to calculate the degree of collision risk between AUVs and obstacles. The experimental and simulation results show that the proposed architecture is highly efficient and highly productive for marine missions and the real-time decision-making system of AUVs.

AB In this work, we propose a novel approach for integrating rules into traffic agent trajectory prediction. Consideration of rules is important for understanding how people behave-yet, it cannot be assumed that rules are always followed. To address this challenge, we evaluate different approaches of integrating rules as inductive biases into deep learning-based prediction models. We propose a framework based on generative adversarial networks that uses tools from formal methods, namely signal temporal logic and syntax trees. This allows us to leverage information on rule obedience as features in neural networks and improves prediction accuracy without biasing towards lawful behavior. We evaluate our method on a real-world driving dataset and show improvement in performance over off-the-shelf predictors.

AB In this paper, a stochastic optimization algorithm is proposed to calibrate the three-axis magnetometer onboard. The sensor errors, namely, hard iron, soft iron, nonorthogonality, scale factors, and bias, are taken into account. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) strategy is used to do the calibration, enhanced by the stretching technique to improve the accuracy and robustness. The performance of this algorithm is evaluated with a series of laboratory experiments and a field experiment of autonomous underwater vehicle. Comparisons with other analytical calibration methods are made. The results demonstrate that both the PSO and the stretched PSO algorithm can significantly compensate the magnetometer readings, and the latter algorithm has higher accuracy and more robustness.

AB Understanding the surrounding scene and identifying man-made structures is an important task in autonomous vehicle navigation in an outdoor environment. The ability to generalize the task of landmark recognition to a variety of landmarks belonging to a particular class is a difficult problem compounded by its ill-defined nature. In this paper, we propose a technique for performing landmark recognition based on visual cues of texture, edges and functional form. We use a neural network based classifier to identify regions of interest and extract linear and curved edge features falling in these areas. We combine these cues using heuristics and inference based on the function of the landmark. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Multi-modal fusion overcomes the inherent limitations of single-sensor perception in 3D object detection of autonomous driving. The fusion of 4D Radar and LiDAR can boost the detection range and more robust. Nevertheless, different data characteristics and noise distributions between two sensors hinder performance improvement when directly integrating them. Therefore, we are the first to propose a novel fusion method termed M-2-Fusion for 4D Radar and LiDAR, based on Multi-modal and Multi-scale fusion. To better integrate two sensors, we propose an Interaction-based Multi-Modal Fusion (IMMF) method utilizing a self-attention mechanism to learn features from each modality and exchange intermediate layer information. Specific to the current single-resolution voxel division's precision and efficiency balance problem, we also put forward a Center-based Multi-Scale Fusion (CMSF) method to first regress the center points of objects and then extract features in multiple resolutions. Furthermore, we present a data preprocessing method based on Gaussian distribution that effectively decreases data noise to reduce errors caused by point cloud divergence of 4D Radar data in the x-z plane. To evaluate the proposed fusion method, a series of experiments were conducted using the Astyx HiRes 2019 dataset, including the calibrated 4D Radar and 16-line LiDAR data. The results demonstrated that our fusion method compared favorably with state-of-the-art algorithms. When compared to PointPillars, our method achieves mAP (mean average precision) increases of 5.64% and 13.57% for 3D and BEV (bird's eye view) detection of the car class at a moderate level, respectively.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have become an important and integral part of military and civilian operations in recent years. In many UAV missions, the main purpose is to visit some predetermined checkpoints in operational space. If the number of checkpoints and constraints increases, finding a feasible solution may take up too much time. In this paper; the path planning problem of autonomous UAV in target coverage problems is solved by using artificial intelligent methods including genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony optimizer (ACO), Voronoi diagram, and clustering methods. The main contribution of this article is to propose initial population enhancement methods in GA, and thus accelerate convergence process. The first common enhancement to basic GA structure is to generate a sub-optimal path by implementing ACO. A sub-optimal path can be used to generate initial individuals. However, sub-optimal paths may have the problem that is collision with terrain. To avoid a UAV from any crash three approaches are integrated into an initial population phase of genetic algorithm. The first approach includes Voronoi vertices as additional waypoints to keep clear of trouble. The second approach consists of cluster centers which forms Voronoi vertices as supplemental waypoints. The final proposal comprises again cluster centers but based on a set of collision points. The proposed methods are tested in different three dimensional (3D) environments and the results are compared. Performance results show that collision with terrain surface is a local phenomenon and solving this issue by using the cluster center of collision points provides the best result including at least 70% or much more decrease in the required number of objective function evaluations.

AB Objective Autonomous cars (ACs) controlled by artificial intelligence are expected to play a significant role in transportation in the near future. This study investigated determinants of trust in ACs. Background Trust in ACs influences different variables, including the intention to adopt AC technology. Several studies on risk perception have verified that shared value determines trust in risk managers. Previous research has confirmed the effect of value similarity on trust in artificial intelligence. We focused on moral beliefs, specifically utilitarianism (belief in promoting a greater good) and deontology (belief in condemning deliberate harm), and tested the effects of shared moral beliefs on trust in ACs. Method We conducted three experiments (N= 128, 71, and 196, for each), adopting a thought experiment similar to the well-known trolley problem. We manipulated shared moral beliefs (shared vs. unshared) and driver (AC vs. human), providing participants with different moral dilemma scenarios. Trust in ACs was measured through a questionnaire. Results The results of Experiment 1 showed that shared utilitarian belief strongly influenced trust in ACs. In Experiment 2 and Experiment 3, however, we did not find statistical evidence that shared deontological belief had an effect on trust in ACs. Conclusion The results of the three experiments suggest that the effect of shared moral beliefs on trust varies depending on the values that ACs share with humans. Application To promote AC implementation, policymakers and developers need to understand which values are shared between ACs and humans to enhance trust in ACs.

AB In modern transportation, autonomous driving technology has emerged as a significant innovation, offering improved safety, efficiency, and convenience. One of its core technologies is path planning, which creates an optimal route for vehicles in various traffic situations, ensuring they arrive safely and efficiently. However, existing path planning methods suffer from inflexible and inefficient road sampling, and limitations in path expression due to curve models. In this paper, we introduce a novel path planning framework that operates from a coarse-to-optimal approach. We first introduce an adaptive sampling method to construct a three-dimensional (3D) space-aware profiling map in the Frenet frame to quantify abstract traffic scenarios. This cost map guides the generation of waypoints by incorporating obstacle distributions in the $s$ -direction and cost values in the $l$ -direction. We then design a cost function to obtain the coarse path by considering ride comfort, anti-deviation from the center of the road, and path safety. Finally, a new path model is re-established based on the Taylor series, and a quadratic programming approach is employed to fine-tune the coarse path to attain the optimal path. Experimental results show that the proposed adaptive sampling method can dynamically adjust the sampling strategy according to the change in the number and distribution of obstacles on the road, significantly improving the sampling effectiveness rate to 100%, 99.85%, 99.68% and 99.61% for one-obstacle, two-obstacle, three-obstacle, and four-obstacle scenarios. Compared with the conventional method, the generated path length is shortened by 3.48% and 8.42%, and the maximum heading angle is reduced by 18.68% and 30.21% in the scenarios with obstacles of the same and different sizes.

AB Globally, pedestrians represent 23% of all road deaths. Many solutions to protect pedestrians are proposed; in this paper, we focus on technical solutions of the ADAS-Advanced Driver Assistance Systems-type. Concerning the interaction between drivers and pedestrians, we want to have a closer look at two aspects: how to protect pedestrians with the help of vehicle technology, and how pedestrians-but also car drivers-perceive and accept such technology. The aim of the present study was to analyze and describe the experiences, needs, and preferences of pedestrians-and drivers-in connection with ADAS, or in other words, how ADAS should work in such a way that it would protect pedestrians and make walking more relaxed. Moreover, we interviewed experts in the field in order to check if, in the near future, the needs and preferences of pedestrians and drivers can be met by new generations of ADAS. A combination of different methods, specifically, an original questionnaire, on-the-spot interviewing, and expert interviews, was used to collect data. The qualitative data was analyzed using qualitative text analysis (clustering and categorization). The questionnaire for drivers was answered by a total of 70 respondents, while a total of 60 pedestrians agreed to complete questionnaires concerning pedestrian safety. Expert interviews (five interviews) were conducted by means of personal interviews, approximately one hour in duration. We conclude that systems to protect pedestrians-to avoid collisions of cars with pedestrians-are considered useful by all groups, though with somewhat different implications. With respect to the features of such systems, the considerations are very heterogeneous, and experimentation is needed in order to develop optimal systems, but a decisive argument put forward by some of the experts is that autonomous vehicles will have to be programmed extremely defensively. Given this argument, we conclude that we will need more discussion concerning typical interaction situations in order to find solutions that allow traffic to work both smoothly and safely.

AB The logic relationship among the equality and inequality constraints in a standard constrained optimization problem (SCOP) is the logical AND. Various efficient, convergent and robust algorithms have been developed for such a SCOP. The logic relationship among the equality and inequality constraints in a standard constrained optimization problem (SCOP) is the logical AND. Various efficient, convergent and robust algorithms have been developed for such a SCOP, Motivated by a practical application, a more general constrained optimization problem (GCOP) with not only logic AND but also OR relationships is proposed in this paper. In order to solve such a generalized problem, a mathematical transformation which can transfer a set of inequalities with logic OR into one inequality is developed. This transformation provides a necessary and sufficient condition which enables us to use the algorithms developed for SCOP's to solve the generalized optimization problems. The research is motivated by the requirements of developing an efficient, robust, and reliable navigation algorithm for a mobile robot such as an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), The original contributions of the paper include threefold: First, from the viewpoint of optimization theory, this paper, to our best knowledge, Is the first one to propose such a GCOP, Second, a method is developed to solve such a GCOP, Third, from the viewpoint of robot path planning, this paper presents a new way of using classical optimization approach to solve robot path planning. It is our belief that some other engineering problems may also be cast as such a generalized form of optimization problem and benefit from the solution given in this paper. Results are presented for path planning in three dimensions, showing its effectiveness, efficiency and the approach Is being implemented for European Community MAST project CT97-0083.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) play an important role in ocean exploration. When an AUV works for a long time and discharges at a high rate, the heat of the battery cannot be dissipated due to the narrow and closed working space of the battery module, thus causing a sharp rise in temperature and restricting the safety of the AUV. Therefore, it is very crucial to solve the heat dissipation problem of the battery module in AUV. In this study, a surrogate model is proposed based on the genetic algorithm for parametric optimization, which uses the strategy of microchannel liquid cooling. The optimization design mainly includes establishing a parameterized model and numerical simulation to solve the temperature field, using Latin hypercube sampling to complete the selection of design of experiment points, generating a response surface through the Kriging surrogate model, and using a multi-objective genetic algorithm for solving candidate points under constraint conditions. It can be concluded that the optimized parameters play a certain role in reducing the temperature of the whole battery module and reducing the volume of microchannel. The results show that the temperature field is especially sensitive to the parameters W-1, H-2, and v(1). When the corresponding parameters are W-1 = 3.59 mm, H-1 = 17.93 mm, H-2 = 4.98 mm, and v(1) = 0.02 m/s, the temperature reaches the limit, and the volume of the whole cooling scheme is the smallest. Compared with the initial design point, the maximum temperature is reduced by 0.66 K, and the volume is reduced by 1.84%. In addition, the optimized parameters enable the battery module to reach a lower equilibrium temperature in a shorter time, thereby enhancing the safety and stability of the battery module. This study provides a feasible reference scheme for the heat dissipation of battery modules in the future.

AB A controlled sub-seabed CO2 release experiment (QICS: quantifying and monitoring potential impacts of geological carbon storage) was conducted in Ardmucknish Bay, Scotland, in 2012, to quantify the effect of leaked CO2 on marine environments. In this experiment, CO2 was injected beneath the seafloor, and closely monitored as the CO2 was allowed to leak into the overlying water column. We performed mapping observations using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with sensors to monitor physical and chemical conditions in the vicinity of the CO2 leakage. We also numerically simulated the behavior of the low-pH plume caused by the CO2 leakage, within the calculated tidal current in the bay.
   The results of AUV mapping observations showed that physical and chemical characteristics of the water mass in Ardmucknish bay are sensitive to tidal variations (low or high tide), and the ascent speed of the leaked CO2 bubble and the pH decrease in the vicinity of the CO2 leakage area are predominantly controlled by the tidal phase in the bay. The observations using an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) installed in the AUV indicated that the current in the bay flows westwards at high tide and eastwards at low tide. The simulated tidal current agreed well with the tidal current observed by ADCP. Numerical simulation suggested that the pH decrease due to the leaked CO2 is restricted to the vicinity of the CO2 leakage area, and fluctuates greatly with tidal variations. In flood tide periods, diffusion of the low-pH plume caused by the leaked CO2 is barely detectable because low-pH seawater intrudes into the bay from the bay mouth. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the city, parking space detection can help car owners save time in finding parking spaces, and it can also provide help for autonomous parking. However, existing parking space detection methods based on embedded geomagnetic sensors are usually costly and complex to deploy in a large area. To reduce costs while obtaining sufficient performance, it is desirable to detecting parking spaces with cameras. We adopt a low-cost visual method to solve the above problems, using a convolutional neural network to achieve the parking space classification. We propose a general module called Global Perceptual Feature Extractor (GPFE) based on transformer to achieve global attention, which can be easily combined with other classification networks to improve the accuracy and robustness of the entire system, and alleviate the impact of illumination changing and other issues. We verify the proposed method with other methods on three public parking space detection datasets (CNREXT, PKLot and ACPDS). The results show that the accuracy of the network combined with the GPFE module has been generally improved, especially on scenes with low and high illumination, which verifies the robustness and performance of the module.

AB The automation of railway operations is an activity in constant growth. Different railway stakeholders are already developing their research activities for the future driverless autonomous driving based on computer vision (CV) and artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced perception technologies (e.g., obstacle detection). Unfortunately, the AI models are opaque in nature, and there are no certification accepted rules for CV & AI-enhanced functionality certification. Capturing and labeling camera image in real environment is expensive in terms of time and resources and it does not guarantee enough variation in edge visibility conditions, which makes the resulting database less valuable for the validation and verification (V & V) processes. To meet the increasing needs of trusted CV & AI-based solutions, numerous V & V approaches have been proposed in other sectors such as automotive, most of them based on virtual simulators. Unfortunately, there is currently no virtual perception simulator for railway scenario. This work aims to create a semi-automatic system based on virtual scenarios measuring the CV & AI-enhanced system performance facing different visibility conditions. It will be based on the global accuracy metrics and detected potential safety and operation rules' violations. This work also demonstrates the quantitative and qualitative improvements while reducing current V & V cost.

ID WIRELESS; ACCESS; 5G
AB This article discusses the design and implementation strategy for highly reliable communication systems that support autonomous ambulances on an unmanned aerial vehicle platform. Statistics show that more accidents occur during heavy rainfall, but radio links that operate in excess of 10 GHz are particularly prone to rain-induced attenuation and depolarization. Maximizing quality of service to provide reliable wireless links for telemedicine systems is therefore an important issue to be thoroughly addressed in optimizing system reliability. A prognostics and network health management framework for automated adjustment of the link and system margins is proposed, based on statistical results of point rainfall attenuation obtained from long-term measurement and scattering with a case study of a 39 GHz signal propagating through rain. The results are applied to a self-cognizant prognostics algorithm for smart autonomous ambulances that support critical operations across difficult terrain. Near forward scattering of 58 degrees and near backward scattering of 175 degrees, as well as perpendicular scattering, were studied. This provides important insights into implementing self-cognizant prognostics system resource management such that 5G-based, as well as moving toward 6G, telemedicine systems can be optimized for reliability given the appropriate system fade margin derived from the measurement results.

AB Autonomous recovery technology utilized by autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) is facing enormous challenges resulting from rapid development. In this paper, the current research status of static and dynamic AUV docking is first introduced. Then two styles of underwater dynamic docking devices, captured-style and guided-style, are designed in accordance with two commonly used underwater docking devices. The two types of docking devices, focusing on their respective constitution characteristics, and working principles are introduced. The analysis is conducted on kinematics and movement stability. The two docking devices' dynamic characteristics are analyzed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software known as Star-CCM. The simulation results of the dynamic characteristics of the two docking devices are then compared. Finally, a preliminary lake test for the stable wing is carded out. Through the analysis of the two underwater dynamic docking devices' dynamic characteristics, we obtain conclusions: 1) the docking's stability is related to the relative position of hydrodynamic center point; 2) the relationship between the hydrodynamic characteristics of these two underwater docking devices and the velocity and attack angle is not exactly the same; 3) the velocity is an important factor affecting underwater dynamic docking or recycling an AUV.

AB The basic conditions for mobile robots to be autonomous are that the mobile robot localizes itself in the environment and knows the geometric structure of the environment (map). After these conditions are met, this mobile robot is given a specific task, but how the robot will navigate for this task is an important issue. Especially for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), whose application has increased recently, path planning in a three-dimensional (3D) environment is a common problem. This study performs three experimental applications to discover the most suitable path for UAV in 3D environments with large and many obstacles. Inspired by Rapidly Random-Exploring Tree Star (RRT*), the first implementation develops the Goal Distance-based RRT* (GDRRT*) approach, which performs intelligent sampling taking into account the goal distance. In the second implementation, the path discovered by GDRRT* is shortened using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) (PSO-GDRRT*). In the final application, a network with a Bidirectional Long/Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) layer is designed for fast estimation of optimal paths found by PSO-GDRRT* (BiLSTM-PSO-GDRRT*). As a result of these applications, this study provides important novelties: GDRRT* converges to the goal faster than RRT* in large and obstacle-containing 3D environments. To generate groundtruth paths for training the learning-based network, PSO-GDRRT* finds the shortest paths relatively quickly. Finally, BiLSTM-PSO-GDRRT* provides extremely fast path planning for real-time UAV applications. This work is valuable for real-time autonomous UAV applications in a complex and large environment, as the new methods it offers have fast path planning capability.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Localization capabilities are necessary for autonomous robots that need to keep track of their position with respect to a surrounding environment. A pursuit robot is an autonomous robot that tracks and pursues a moving target, requiring accurate localization relative to the target's position and obstacles in the local environment. Small unmanned ground vehicles (SUGVs) equipped with a monocular camera and wheel encoders could act as effective pursuit robots, but the noisy 2D target position and size estimates from the monocular camera will in turn lead to overly noisy 3D target pose estimates. One possible approach to relative localization for pursuit robots is, rather than simply tracking and estimating a relative robot-target position in each frame, joint localization, in which the purser and target are both localized with respect to a common reference frame. In this paper, we propose a novel method for joint localization of a pursuit robot and arbitrary target. The proposed method fuses the pursuit robot's kinematics and the target's dynamics in a joint state space model. We show that predicting and correcting pursuer and target trajectories simultaneously produces improved results compared to standard filters for estimating relative target trajectories in a 3D coordinate system. For visual tracking, we also introduce an adaptive histogram matching threshold for suspending tracking when the target is lost in a cluttered environment. When tracking is suspended, rather than traversing the entire image to search for a reappearance of the target, we only search the part of the image segmented by histogram backprojection and correctly reinitialize the tracker. The experimental results show that the joint localization method outperforms standard localization methods and that the visual tracker for pursuit robot can deal effectively with target occlusions.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) stakeholders continue to seek assurance of the safety performance of this new technology through AV testing on in-service roads, AV-dedicated road networks, and AV test tracks. However, recent AV-related fatalities on in-service roads have exacerbated public skepticism and eroded some public trust in the safety of AV operations. Further, test tracks are unable to characterize adequately the real-world driving environment. For this reason, driving simulators continue to serve as an attractive means of AV testing. However, in most AV driving simulators, the AV operation is based on commands external to the vehicle and embedded in the code for the driving environment. To address the simulation shortfalls associated with this approach, this paper develops a deep convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) algorithm for self-driving simulation. This algorithm observes and characterizes the AV's driving environment, and controls the AV movement in the driving simulation. The CNN part extracts features that use transfer learning to introduce human prior knowledge, and the LSTM part uses temporal information to process the extracted features, and incorporates temporal dynamics to predict driving decisions. The AV may also use an external server with a database containing road environment data as an additional source of information. It is acknowledged that different driving simulators differ in their functions and their capabilities to access driving-environment data. Therefore, to make it sufficiently flexible to facilitate replication by other researchers that use driving simulators, the algorithm has been designed and demonstrated using only image data of the driving environment as input. This is because roadway image data are easily and readily accessible from the screen of any driving simulator. The proposed algorithm was tested using the open racing car simulator test track platform and was found to be able to mimic human driving decisions with a high degree of accuracy.

AB Uncrewed vessels are increasingly being presented as the future of naval capability. Across the globe navies are turning to autonomous systems, and increasingly large uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) as potential solutions to their budgetary and personnel problems. There has been detailed academic discussion of the technical and legal challenges presented by uncrewed vessels, whilst policymakers, particularly in the United States have debated how they should fit into a war fighting concept of operations. What has been largely ignored has been the question of what impact the adoption of uncrewed vessels will have on the ability of navies to carry out the broad spectrum of their functions. Drawing off the Span of Maritime Tasks set out in Australian Maritime Doctrine, this article focuses on the key peacetime functions of navies, the diplomatic and the constabulary, and highlights the problems that might arise from a growth in the use of uncrewed vessels and autonomous systems. In doing so it challenges the widely accepted narrative that uncrewed platforms will allow navies to do more with less, demonstrating that if navies wish to maintain their capabilities across the full spectrum of operations they will have to treat uncrewed vessels as complementary to, and not a replacement for, crewed ones.

AB This article proposes the Bayesian surprise as the main methodology that drives the cognitive radar to estimate a target's future state (i.e., velocity, distance) from noisy measurements and execute a decision to minimize the estimation error over time. The research aims to demonstrate whether the cognitive radar as an autonomous system can modify its internal model (i.e., waveform parameters) to gain consecutive informative measurements based on the Bayesian surprise. By assuming that the radar measurements are constructed from linear Gaussian state-space models, the paper applies Kalman filtering to perform state estimation for a simple vehicle-following scenario. According to the filter's estimate, the sensor measures the contribution of prospective waveforms-which are available from the sensor profile library-to state estimation and selects the one that maximizes the expectation of Bayesian surprise. Numerous experiments examine the estimation performance of the proposed cognitive radar for single-target tracking in practical highway and urban driving environments. The robustness of the proposed method is compared to the state-of-the-art for various error measures. Results indicate that the Bayesian surprise outperforms its competitors with respect to the mean square relative error when one-step and multiple-step planning is considered.

DE Moving target defenses; Data space randomization; Cyber-physical

AB Non-control data attacks have become widely popular for circumventing authentication mechanisms in websites, servers, and personal computers. These attacks can be executed against cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in which not only authentication is an issue, but safety is at risk. Furthermore, any unauthorized change to safety-critical variables within the software may cause damage or even catastrophic consequences. Moving target defense techniques such as data space randomization (DSR) have become popular for protecting against memory corruption attacks such as non-control data attacks. However, current DSR implementations rely on source code transformations and do not stop critical variables from being overwritten, only that the new overwritten value will be vastly different than expected by the attacker. As such, these implementations are often ineffective for legacy CPS software in which only a binary is available. The problem addressed in this paper is how do we protect against non-control data attacks in legacy CPS software while ensuring that we can detect instances of variable integrity violations. We solve this problem by combining DSR at the binary level with variable comparison checks to ensure that we can detect and mitigate any attacker attempt to overwrite safety-critical variables. Our security approach is demonstrated utilizing an autonomous emergency braking system case study.

AB General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) have been extensively used in the last decade as accelerators in high demanding applications, such as multimedia processing and high-performance computing. Nowadays, these devices are becoming popular even in safety-critical applications, such as in autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles. However, these devices can suffer from the effects of transient faults, such as those produced by radiation effects. Among those effects, Single Event Upsets (SEUs), which are the focus of this paper, can cause application misbehaviors, which may lead to catastrophic consequences. In this work, we first describe how we extended the capabilities of an open-source VHDL GPGPU model (FlexGrip) and developed a new version named FlexGripPlus to study and analyze the effects of SEUs in a GPGPU in a much more detailed manner. We also performed extensive fault injection campaigns using FlexGripPlus, which allowed identifying the most critical effects within the GPGPU architecture. We finally focused on the scheduler controller since it represents a module that is specific to the GPGPU architecture and showed that it has different levels of SEU sensibility depending on the affected location. Moreover, the results of additional analyses varying the number of parallel execution units in the system are presented, demonstrating the correlation between the number of execution units in a GPGPU and the system reliability.

AB Although road-based freight transport has large external costs, it currently dominates the hinterland cargo transport sector in Europe. An increase of the automation levels of inland cargo vessels could advance their competitiveness, hence unlocking more sustainable inland cargo transport. Moreover, these improvements could pave the way for a potential future paradigm shift towards unmanned inland cargo vessels. Therefore, this study investigates the design of an experimental platform in order to study the feasibility and current or future limitations of unmanned inland cargo vessels. To explore this design, the following three questions were handled: (i) How to design an industrially relevant research vessel?, (ii) How can an unmanned inland cargo vessel interact with or perceive its environment?, and (iii) How to control an unmanned or autonomous inland cargo vessel? The answers to these design questions delivered the blueprint to construct a first prototype of an unmanned inland cargo vessel. This prototype performed a set of outdoor experiments to verify and validate the made design choices. The successful execution of these experiments demonstrates that this vessel can serve as an experimental platform for further technological research regarding more automated or unmanned inland cargo vessels and provide fruitful insights for other research domains.

AB The autonomous navigation of smart ships needs to meet their huge inertia and obey existing complex rules. A smart ship has to realise autonomous driving instead of manual operation, which consists of path planning and controlling. Toward to this goal, this research proposes a path planning and manipulating approach based on Q-learning, which can drive a cargo ship by itself without requiring any input from human experiences. At the very beginning, a ship is modelled with the Nomoto model in a simulation waterway. Then, distances, obstacles and prohibited areas are regularized as rewards or punishments, which are used to judge the performance, or manipulation decisions of the ship. Subsequently, Q-learning is introduced to learn the action-reward model and the learning outcome is used to manipulate the ship's movement. By chasing higher reward values, the ship can find an appropriate path or navigation strategies by itself. After a sufficient number of rounds of training, a convincing path and manipulating strategies will likely be produced. By comparing the proposed approach with the existing methods, it is shown that this approach is more effective in self-learning and continuous optimisation, and therefore closer to human manoeuvring.

AB In this letter, a novel approach to fast three-dimensional (3-D) localization of flying objects for their interception by a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) is presented. The proposed method utilizes a depth image from a stereo camera to facilitate onboard detection of drones, flying in its proximity. The method does not rely on using any kind of markers, which enables localization of non-cooperating drones. This approach strongly relaxes the requirements on the drones to he detected, and the detection algorithm is computationally undemanding enough to process images online, onboard an MAV with limited computational resources. This allows using the detection system in the control feedback of an autonomous aerial intercepting system. Output of the detection algorithm is filtered by a 3-D multi-target tracking algorithm to reduce false positives, preserve temporal consistency of the detections, and to predict positions of the drones (e.g., to compensate camera and processing delays). We demonstrate the importance of the advances in flying object localization, presented in this letter, in an experiment with an intruder-interceptor scenario, which would be unfeasible using state-of-the-art detection and localization methods.

AB Measurement and navigation users cannot operate without the positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) service provided by the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) instrumentation, but users are also faced with unpredictable and complex interference and even spoofing. In order to effectively control and even counter the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that may pose security threats, using the GNSS spoofing technology to counter UAV is an effective and important technical means. Compared with the existing spoofing algorithms, this article fully considers the navigation system configuration and flight control principle, as well as antispoofing module of UAV equipped, the UAV dynamic model under GNSS spoofing environment is established, and the response law of UAV state to spoofing is analyzed. In order to realize the covert directional spoofing on UAV equipped with tightly-coupled GNSS and inertial measurement unit (IMU), a GNSS covert spoofing algorithm is proposed. The algorithm includes a fixed-point four-step spoofing strategy and pays attention to avoiding the least-squares residual receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (LSR-RAIM) of UAV, so as to ensure the concealment of the deception process. Through the construction of experimental platform and experimental analysis, the effectiveness and concealment of the algorithm are verified. The experiment shows that the spoofing yaw angle error of GNSS covert directional spoofing is -0.03 degrees. In addition, the spoofer has effectively avoided the LSR-RAIM of UAV system in the whole process, and the evasion rate has reached 100% to achieve covert spoofing. For the actual spoofing scenario application, the spoofing yaw angle error can meet the actual needs. Future work will focus on the research and design of more complex covert spoofing algorithms to meet the spoofing needs of UAV equipped with more complex navigation systems and antispoofing techniques.

AB The Arctic marine climate system is changing rapidly, which is seen in the warming of the ocean and atmosphere, decline of sea ice cover, increase in river discharge, acidification of the ocean, and changes in marine ecosystems. Socio-economic activities in the coastal and marine Arctic are simultaneously changing. This calls for the establishment of a marine Arctic component of the Pan-Eurasian Experiment (MA-PEEX). There is a need for more in situ observations on the marine atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean, but increasing the amount of such observations is a pronounced technological and logistical challenge. The SMEAR (Station for Measuring Ecosystem-Atmosphere Relations) concept can be applied in coastal and archipelago stations, but in the Arctic Ocean it will probably be more cost-effective to further develop a strongly distributed marine observation network based on autonomous buoys, moorings, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These have to be supported by research vessel and aircraft campaigns, as well as various coastal observations, including community-based ones. Major manned drift-ing stations may occasionally be comparable to terrestrial SMEAR flagship stations. To best utilize the observations, atmosphere-ocean reanalyses need to be further developed. To well integrate MA-PEEX with the existing terrestrialatmospheric PEEX, focus is needed on the river discharge and associated fluxes, coastal processes, and atmospheric transports in and out of the marine Arctic. More observations and research are also needed on the specific socioeconomic challenges and opportunities in the marine and coastal Arctic, and on their interaction with changes in the climate and environmental system. MA-PEEX will promote international collaboration; sustainable marine meteorological, sea ice, and oceanographic observations; advanced data management; and multidisciplinary research on the marine Arctic and its interaction with the Eurasian continent.

AB The employment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has greatly facilitated the lives of humans. Due to the mass manufacturing of consumer unmanned aerial vehicles and the support of related scientific research, it can now be used in lighting shows, jungle search-and-rescues, topographical mapping, disaster monitoring, and sports event broadcasting, among many other disciplines. Some applications have stricter requirements for the autonomous positioning capability of UAV clusters, requiring its positioning precision to be within the cognitive range of a human or machine. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is currently the only method that can be applied directly and consistently to UAV positioning. Even with dependable GNSS, large-scale clustering of drones might fail, resulting in drone cluster bombardment. As a type of passive sensor, the visual sensor has a compact size, a low cost, a wealth of information, strong positional autonomy and reliability, and high positioning accuracy. This automated navigation technology is ideal for drone swarms. The application of vision sensors in the collaborative task of multiple UAVs can effectively avoid navigation interruption or precision deficiency caused by factors such as field-of-view obstruction or flight height limitation of a single UAV sensor and achieve large-area group positioning and navigation in complex environments. This paper examines collaborative visual positioning among multiple UAVs (UAV autonomous positioning and navigation, distributed collaborative measurement fusion under cluster dynamic topology, and group navigation based on active behavior control and distributed fusion of multi-source dynamic sensing information). Current research constraints are compared and appraised, and the most pressing issues to be addressed in the future are anticipated and researched. Through analysis and discussion, it has been concluded that the integrated employment of the aforementioned methodologies aids in enhancing the cooperative positioning and navigation capabilities of multiple UAVs during GNSS denial.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) typify the nexus of smart Internet-based technology and prior innovations in transportation. A challenge with AV research is that the technology is not yet readily available for consumers to experience. Thus, public perceptions of AVs are often assessed through survey research which has uncovered demographic and socio-economic differences in the willingness to adopt and pay for AVs. It has also provided information about the perceived benefits and risks associated with AVs and how these perceived benefits and risks affects support for self-driving car technology. More recently, studies have found that political ideology is linked to perceived concerns about self-driving cars but have not yet assessed whether this link extends to the intent to adopt AVs. Given this gap in our knowledge, the contributions of the present paper our twofold. One, we will assess whether political ideology impacts the intention to adopt AVs. Two, we will assess whether political ideology directly or indirectly affects the intention to adopt AVs. As regards the latter, we will conduct a mediation analysis with a path model to assess the extent that political ideology indirectly affects the intention to adopt via the perceived benefits and concerns survey respondents expressed about AVs. Our results reveal political ideology is an important predictor of individuals' intent to adopt AVs, as characterized by both willingness to ride in and to own AVs. Specifically, compared to conservative participants, moderates and liberals reported higher AV adoption intentions. We also find that the effect of political ideology on AV adoption intention is mediated by participants' perceived benefits and concerns about AVs. Compared to conservatives, political moderates reported AV adoption intention via higher perceived benefits about AVs. Compared to conservatives, liberals reported higher AV adoption intention through both higher perceived benefits and lower perceived concerns about AVs.

AB The eastern Bering Sea Shelf is characterized by high biological productivity, seasonal sea ice, and commercially important fisheries. Enhanced productivity is often associated with small-scale oceanographic features. Our objective was to use an autonomous underwater vehicle to examine features typically missed by similar to 20-km spaced shipboard sampling. A coastal glider (Oculus) sampled similar to 3 dives hr(-1) with horizontal spacing of similar to 300 m per dive in August/September 2017. In the north-south transition zone near St. Matthew Island, the glider sampled four eddy-like features associated with weaker vertical stratification. These features had diameters of 15-20 km and were associated with higher surface chlorophyll. Shipboard data collected in the same region approximately a month later showed that a similar feature was associated with high concentrations of small copepods. Incorporating higher resolution sampling available with gliders into the Bering Sea observing network will improve our understanding of ecosystem response to patchiness in the system.
   Plain Language Summary The eastern Bering Sea Shelf is home to an important and well-studied ecosystem, including high biological productivity, endangered marine mammals, and valuable fisheries. Sites of enhanced biological productivity are often associated with small-scale oceanographic features difficult to observe using shipboard observations. The objective of this study was to use an autonomous underwater vehicle, a glider, to examine such features in the Bering Sea. A coastal glider (Oculus) sampled four eddy-like features with diameters of 15-20 km near St. Matthew Island in August/September 2017. The features were associated with higher surface chlorophyll (phytoplankton) surrounding the island and high concentrations of small copepods and may be important in providing food for the seabirds and marine mammals residing on and around St. Matthew Island. Incorporating gliders into the Bering Sea observing network will improve our understanding of ecosystem response to patchiness in the system.

ID MULTIAGENT APPROACH
AB Traffic congestion in urban road networks is a costly problem that affects all major cities in developed countries. To tackle this problem, it is possible (i) to act on the supply side, increasing the number of roads or lanes in a network, (ii) to reduce the demand, restricting the access to urban areas at specific hours or to specific vehicles, or (iii) to improve the efficiency of the existing network, by means of a widespread use of so-called Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). In line with the recent advances in smart transportation management infrastructures, ITS has turned out to be a promising field of application for artificial intelligence techniques. In particular, multiagent systems seem to be the ideal candidates for the design and implementation of ITS. In fact, drivers can be naturally modelled as autonomous agents that interact with the transportation management infrastructure, thereby generating a large-scale, open, agent-based system. To regulate such a system and maintain a smooth and efficient flow of traffic, decentralised mechanisms for the management of the transportation infrastructure are needed.
   In this article we propose a distributed, market-inspired, mechanism for the management of a future urban road network, where intelligent autonomous vehicles, operated by software agents on behalf of their human owners, interact with the infrastructure in order to travel safely and efficiently through the road network. Building on the reservation-based intersection control model proposed by Dresner and Stone, we consider two different scenarios: one with a single intersection and one with a network of intersections. In the former, we analyse the performance of a novel policy based on combinatorial auctions for the allocation of reservations. In the latter, we analyse the impact that a traffic assignment strategy inspired by competitive markets has on the drivers' route choices. Finally we propose an adaptive management mechanism that integrates the auction-based traffic control policy with the competitive traffic assignment strategy.

AB Both recognition and 3D tracking of frontal dynamic objects are crucial problems in an autonomous vehicle, while depth estimation as an essential issue becomes a challenging problem using a monocular camera. Since both camera and objects are moving, the issue can be formed as a structure from motion (SFM) problem. In this paper, to elicit features from an image, the YOLOv3 approach is utilized beside an OpenCV tracker. Subsequently, to obtain the lateral and longitudinal distances, a nonlinear SFM model is considered alongside a statedependent Riccati equation (SDRE) filter and a newly developed observation model. Additionally, a switching method in the form of switching estimation error covariance is proposed to enhance the robust performance of the SDRE filter. The stability analysis of the presented filter is conducted on a class of discrete nonlinear systems. Furthermore, the ultimate bound of estimation error caused by model uncertainties is analytically obtained to investigate the switching significance. Simulations are reported to validate the performance of the switched SDRE filter. Finally, real-time experiments are performed through a multi-thread framework implemented on a Jetson TX2 board, while radar data is used for the evaluation.

ID INTERNAL-MODEL CONTROL
AB As known, internal model control is equivalent to a PI or a PID controller provided that the mathematical model associated to the process to be controlled is of first or second order respectively. So, to go beyond these particular cases and to make an extension in bringing more theoretical results, the article proposes a method to reach the equivalence between an internal model control and a PI controller regardless of the model order. To this end, the key idea consists of using a specific filter that exhibits superior robustness level compared to the classical filter and further leads to get a structure of a PI controller whatever the order of the model is. The developed procedure constitutes the main contribution of this article. To meet given set of specifications, the controller parameters are tuned through a straightforward analytic way using the dynamics of the tracking error. The proposed tuning strategy constitutes another contribution of the article. Furthermore, to evaluate the efficiency level of this procedure, an application to control an autonomous vehicle is described and the simulation results are shown to be satisfactory confirmed by a series of experimental tests.

AB VALKYRIE (Very-deep Autonomous Laser-powered Kilowatt-class Yo-yoing Robotic Ice Explorer) is a NASA-funded project to develop key technologies for an autonomous ice penetrator, or cryobot, capable of delivering science payloads through outer planet ice caps and terrestrial glaciers. This 4 year effort will produce a cylindrical cryobot prototype 280 cm in length and 25 cm in diameter. One novel element of VALKYRIE's design is the use of a high-energy laser as the primary power source. 1070 nm laser light is transmitted at 5 kW from a surface-based laser and injected into a custom-designed optical waveguide that is spooled out from the descending cryobot. Light exits the downstream end of the fiber, travels through diverging optics, and strikes an anodized aluminum beam dump, which channels thermal power to hot-water jets that melt the descent hole. Some beam energy is converted to electricity via photovoltaic cells, for running on-board electronics and jet pumps. Since the vehicle can be sterilized prior to deployment, and forward contamination is minimized as the melt path refreezes behind the cryobot, expansions on VALKYRIE concepts may enable cleaner access to deep subglacial lakes. This paper focuses on laser delivery and beam dump thermal design.

AB The research on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has accomplished enormous attention during the last few decades because of its applications in many marine systems fields. A significant number of AUVs have been developed to solve the wide range of scientific and applied tasks of ocean research and development worldwide. Thus the main aim of this research is to provide an effective mathematical model of Biomimetic AUV dynamics. For instance, to develop high-fidelity AUV simulation and control algorithms, we need to know the overall mathematical model of AUV dynamics. In order to endorse the ability of the proposed model, stability analysis has been performed, and the model is validated by designing a coupled velocity tracking control using a PID controller.

The methodology consists of close-to-reality simulation using a Computed Fluid Dynamics (CFD) module of the ANSYS (TM) Workbench software, the processing of the data, obtained by simulation, with a set of Savistky-Golay filters; and, the application of the Least Square Method in order to estimate the hydrodynamic parameters of the mini-AUV. Finally, these parameters are considered to design the three different controllers that are based on the robot manipulators theory. Numerical simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the controllers.

AB When computing the trajectory of an autonomous vehicle, inevitable collision states must be avoided at all costs, so no harm comes to the device or pedestrians around it. In dynamic environments, considering collisions as binary events is risky and inefficient, as the future position of moving obstacles is unknown. We introduce a time-dependent probabilistic collision state checker system, which traces a safe route with a minimum collision probability for a robot. We apply a sequential Bayesian model to calculate approximate predictions of the movement patterns of the obstacles, and define a time-dependent variation of the Dijkstra algorithm to compute statistically safe trajectories through a crowded area. We prove the efficiency of our methods through experimentation, using a self-guided robotic device.

AB An object t moving in R-3 goes around a solid convex set along the shortest path J under observa- tion. The task of an observer f (moving at the same speed as the object) is to find a trajectory closest to J that satisfies the condition delta <= parallel to f - t parallel to <= K delta for a given delta > 0. This condition makes it possible to track the object along the entire trajectory J. A method is proposed for constructing an observer trajectory that ensures that the indicated inequality holds with a constant K arbitrarily close to unity and the object can be observed on its trajectory J, except for an arbitrarily small segment of J.

MAPTs allow for an accelerated semantics and a layered structure of the state space, so that it is possible to explore the latter dynamically and use heuristics to greatly reduce the computation time needed to address reachability problems.
   We use an available tool for the Petri net implementation of MAPTs, to explore the state space of autonomous vehicle systems. Then, we compare this exploration with timed automata-based approaches in terms of expressiveness of available queries and computation time.

AB This article proposes a flexible and distributed stochastic automaton-based network partitioning algorithm that is capable of finding the optimal k-way partition with respect to a broad range of cost functions, and given various constraints, in directed and weighted graphs. Specifically, we motivate the distributed partitioning (self-partitioning) problem, introduce the stochastic automaton-based partitioning algorithm, and show that the algorithm finds the optimal partition with probability 1 for a large class of partitioning tasks. Also, a discussion of why the algorithm can be expected to find good partitions quickly is included, and its performance is further illustrated through examples. Finally, applications to mobile/sensor classification in ad hoc networks, fault-isolation in electric power systems, and control of autonomous vehicle teams are pursued in detail.

AB Emerging Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) technology have a ubiquitous communication framework. It poses security challenges in the form of cyber-attacks, prompting rigorous cybersecurity measures. There is a lack of knowledge on the anticipated cause-effect relationships and mechanisms of CAVs cybersecurity and the possible system behaviour, especially the unintended consequences. Therefore, this study aims to develop a conceptual System Dynamics (SD) model to analyse cybersecurity in the complex, uncertain deployment of CAVs. Specifically, the SD model integrates six critical avenues and maps their respective parameters that either trigger or mitigate cyber-attacks in the operation of CAVs using a systematic theoretical approach. These six avenues are: i) CAVs communication framework, ii) secured physical access, iii) human factors, iv) CAVs penetration, v) regulatory laws and policy framework, and iv) trust-across the CAVs-industry and among the public. Based on the conceptual model, various system archetypes are analysed. "Fixes that Fail", in which the upsurge in hacker capability is the unintended natural result of technology maturity, requires continuous efforts to combat it. The primary mitigation steps are human behaviour analysis, knowledge of motivations and characteristics of CAVs cyber-attackers, CAVs users and Original Equipment Manufacturers education. "Shifting the burden", where policymakers counter the perceived cyber threats of hackers by updating legislation that also reduces CAVs adaptation by imitations, indicated the need for calculated regulatory and policy intervention. The "limits to success" triggered by CAVs penetration increase the defended hacks to establish regulatory laws, improve trust, and develop more human analysis. However, it may also open up caveats for cyber-crimes and alert that CAVs deployment to be alignment with the intended goals for enhancing cybersecurity. The proposed model can support decision-making and training and stimulate the roadmap towards an optimized, selfregulating, and resilient cyber-safe CAV system.

AB Accurate positioning and mapping are significant for autonomous systems with navigation requirements. In this paper, a coarse-to-fine loosely-coupled (LC) LiDAR-inertial odometry (LC-LIO) that could explore the complementariness of LiDAR and inertial measurement unit (IMU) was proposed for the real-time and accurate pose estimation of a ground vehicle in urban environments. Different from the existing tightly-coupled (TC) LiDAR-inertial fusion schemes which directly use all the considered ranges and inertial measurements to optimize the vehicle pose, the method proposed in this paper performs loosely-couped integrated optimization with the high-frequency motion prediction, which was produced by IMU integration based on optimized results, employed as the initial guess of LiDAR odometry to approach the optimality of LiDAR scan-to-map registration. As one of the prominent contributions, thorough studies were conducted on the performance upper bound of the TC LiDAR-inertial fusion schemes and LC ones, respectively. Furthermore, the experimental verification was performed on the proposition that the proposed pipeline can fully relax the potential of the LiDAR measurements (centimeter-level ranging accuracy) in a coarse-to-fine way without being disturbed by the unexpected IMU bias. Moreover, an adaptive covariance estimation method employed during LC optimization was proposed to explain the uncertainty of LiDAR scan-to-map registration in dynamic scenarios. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed system was validated on challenging real-world datasets. Meanwhile, the process that the proposed pipelines realized the coarse-to-fine LiDAR scan-to-map registration was presented in detail. Comparing with the existing state-of-the-art TC-LIO, the focus of this study would be placed on that the proposed LC-LIO work could achieve similar or better accuracy with a reduced computational expense.

AB Management of the marine environment is often hampered by a lack of comprehensive spatial information on the distribution of diversity and the bio-physical processes structuring regional ecosystems. This is particularly true in temperate reef systems beyond depths easily accessible to divers. Yet these systems harbor a diversity of sessile life that provide essential ecosystem services, sustain fisheries and, as with shallower ecosystems, are also increasingly vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts and environmental change. Here we use cutting-edge tools (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles and ship-borne acoustics) and analytical approaches (predictive modelling) to quantify and map these highly productive ecosystems. We find the occurrence of key temperate-reef biota can be explained and predicted using standard (depth) and novel (texture) surrogates derived from multibeam acoustic data, and geographic surrogates. This suggests that combinations of fine-scale processes, such as light limitation and habitat complexity, and broad-scale processes, such as regional currents and exposure regimes, are important in structuring these diverse deep-reef communities. While some dominant habitat forming biota, including canopy algae, were widely distributed, others, including gorgonians and sea whips, exhibited patchy and restricted distributions across the reef system. In addition to providing the first quantitative and full coverage maps of reef diversity for this area, our modelling revealed that offshore reefs represented a regional diversity hotspot that is of high ecological and conservation value. Regional reef systems should not, therefore, be considered homogenous units in conservation planning and management. Full-coverage maps of the predicted distribution of biota (and associated uncertainty) are likely to be increasingly valuable, not only for conservation planning, but in the ongoing management and monitoring of these less-accessible ecosystems.

AB The experimental optimization of bio-inspired flapping fin trajectories are demonstrated for potential applications as a side or a rear propulsor of an autonomous underwater vehicle. The trajectories are scored based upon their difference from a force set-point and upon their efficiency and are parameterized by 10 variables inspired by fish swimming. The flapping fin is a generic rectangular rigid flat plate with a tapered edge. Optimization occurs as follows. First, a generation of trajectories is created. Second, the trajectories are executed by a spherical parallel manipulator, during which the forces are acquired. Third, the trajectories are scored and a new generation of trajectories is created using the covariance matrix adaptive evolutionary strategy. This loop repeats ad-infinitum until the search converges. Within the first set of searches, two trajectories for optimal side-force generation are found, one is fully three-dimensional while the other is artificially constrained to a line, and one trajectory for optimal thrust generation is found. All searches demonstrate good convergence properties and match the desired force set-point almost immediately. Additional generations primarily improve the efficiency of the maneuver. The two trajectories for generating side-force have a similar efficiency, which shows potential in utilizing a simple trajectory limited to a line. Comparison between the trajectories for generating side-force and thrust suggests that side-force generation is more efficient around Re , similar to 1000, based on the average tip velocity and length of the fin. The second set of searches explores the behavior of the optimal trajectories for generating side-force at a lower force set-point and the third set of searches explores the sensitivity and repeatability of the optimization.

AB Predicting the future trajectories of multiple pedestrians in certain scenes has become a key task for ensuring that autonomous vehicles, socially interactive robots and other autonomous mobile platforms can navigate safely. The social interactions between people and the multimodal nature of pedestrian movement make pedestrian trajectory prediction a challenging task. In this paper, the problem is solved using a generative adversarial network (GAN) and a graph attention network (GAT) based on the spatiotemporal interaction information about pedestrians. Our method, STI-GAN, is based on an end-to-end GAN model that simulates the pedestrian distribution to capture the uncertainty of the predicted paths and generate more reasonable future trajectories. The complex interactions between people are modeled by a GAT, and spatiotemporal interaction information is used to improve the performance of trajectory prediction. We verify the robustness and improvement of our framework by evaluating its results on various datasets and comparing them with the results of several existing baselines. Compared with the existing pedestrian trajectory prediction methods, our method reduces the average displacement error (ADE) and final displacement error (FDE) by 21.9% and 23.8% respectively.

AB This paper investigates the leader-follower cooperative formation control problem of autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) with uncertain dynamics and external disturbances. Especially, ASVs can communicate with each other under a directed interaction topology. Based on directed graph theories, backstepping and the minimal learning parameter (MLP) algorithm, a novel distributed robust formation controller with two different adaptive laws is developed for each ASV. Dynamic surface control (DSC) is utilized to eliminate repeated derivative of virtual control laws, which is important to generate real-time control signals. Neural networks (NNs) approximation combined with an MLP-based adaptive law is incorporated into the proposed controller to enhance the robustness against model uncertainties. Then only one learning parameter instead of the enormous weights matrix is estimated for each ASV. An auxiliary adaptive law is designed to obtain a continuous controller when compensating approximation errors and disturbances. It is shown that desired formation shapes can be achieved with the proposed controller if the interaction topology has a directed spanning tree, and formation errors are guaranteed to be semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Simulations and comparison results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of theoretical results.

AB This paper describes the design and flight test of a completely self-contained autonomous indoor miniature unmanned aerial system (M-UAS). Guidance, navigation, and control algorithms are presented, enabling the M-UAS to autonomously explore cluttered indoor areas without relying on any off-board computation or external navigation aids such as Global Positioning Satellite (GPS). The system uses a scanning laser rangefinder and a streamlined simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm to provide a position and heading estimate, which is combined with other sensor data to form a six-degree-of-freedom inertial navigation solution. This enables an accurate estimate of the, vehicle attitude, relative position, and velocity. The state information, with a self-generated map, is used to implement a frontier-based exhaustive search of an indoor environment. Improvements to existing guidance algorithms balance exploration with the need to remain within sensor range of indoor structures such that the SLAM algorithm has sufficient information to form a reliable position estimate. A dilution of the precision metric is developed to quantify the effect of environment geometry on the SLAM pose covariance, which is then used to update the two-dimensional position and heading in the navigation filter. Simulation and flight-test results validate the presented algorithms.

AB Traffic sign detection is a central part of autonomous vehicle technology. Recent advances in deep learning algorithms have motivated researchers to use neural networks to perform this task. In this paper, we look at traffic sign detection as an image segmentation problem and propose a deep convolutional neural network-based approach to solve it. To this end, we propose a new network, the SegU-Net, which we form by merging the state-of-the-art segmentation architectures-SegNet and U-Net to detect traffic signs from video sequences. For training the network, we use the Tversky loss function constrained by an L1 term instead of the intersection over union loss traditionally used to train segmentation networks. We use a separate network, inspired by the VGG-16 architecture, to classify the detected signs. The networks are trained on the challenge free sequences of the CURE-TSD dataset. Our proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art object detection networks, such as the Faster R-CNN inception Resnet V2 and R-FCN Resnet 101, by a large margin and obtains a precision and recall of 94.60% and 80.21%, respectively, which is the current state of the art on this part of the dataset. In addition, the network is tested on the German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB) dataset, where it achieves a precision and recall of 95.29% and 89.01%, respectively. This is on a par with the performance of the aforementioned object detection networks. These results prove the generalizability of the proposed architecture and its suitability for robust traffic sign detection in autonomous vehicles.

TI Drivers' Braking Behaviors in Different Motion Patterns of
   Vehicle-Bicycle Conflicts
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
ID AUTONOMOUS EMERGENCY BRAKING; COLLISION; AVOIDANCE; SYSTEMS; SPEED
AB Bicycling is one of the popular modes of transportation, but bicyclists are easily involved in injuries or fatalities in vehicle-bicycle (V-B) accidents. The AEB (Autonomous Emergency Braking) systems have been developed to avoid collisions, but their adaptiveness needs to be further improved under different motion patterns of V-B conflicts. This paper analyzes drivers' braking behaviors in different motion patterns of V-B conflicts to improve the performance of Bicyclist-AEB systems. For safety and data reliability, a driving simulator was used to reconstruct two typical conflict types, i.e., SCR (a bicycle crossing the road from right in front of a straight going car) and SSR (a bicycle cut-in from right in front of a straight going car). Either conflict contained various parameterized motion patterns, which were characterized by a combination of parameters: Vc (car velocity), TTC (time-to-collision), Vb (bicycle velocity), and Dlat (lateral distance between the car and the bicycle) or Vlat (maximum lateral velocity of the bicycle). Some 26 licensed drivers participated in an orthogonal experiment for braking behavior analysis. Results revealed that drivers brake immediately when V-B conflicts occur; hence the BRT (brake reaction time) is independent of any motion pattern parameters. This was further verified by another orthogonal experiment with 10 participants using the eye tracking device. BRT in SSR is longer than that in SCR due to the less perceptible risk and drivers' lower expectation of a collision. The braking intensity and brake Pedal Speed are higher in short-TTC patterns in both conflict types. Therefore, TTC is not a proper activation threshold but a reasonable indicator of braking intensity and Pedal Speed for driver-adaptive AEB systems. By applying the findings in the Bicyclist-AEB, the adaptiveness and acceptability of Bicyclist-AEB systems can be improved.

AB Despite their strong dependence on the pelagic environment, seabirds and other top predators in polar marine ecosystems are generally studied during their reproductive phases in terrestrial environments. As a result, a significant portion of their life history is understudied which in turn has led to limited understanding. Recent advances in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) technologies have allowed satellite-tagged Adelie penguins to guide AUV surveys of the marine environment at the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site on the western Antarctic Peninsula. Near real-time data sent via Iridium satellites from the AUVs to a centralized control center thousands of miles away allowed scientists to adapt AUV sampling strategies to meet the changing conditions of the subsurface. Such AUV data revealed the water masses and fine-scale features associated with Adelie penguin foraging trips. During this study, the maximum concentration of chlorophyll was between 30 and 50 m deep. Encompassing this peak in the chlorophyll concentration, within the water-column, was a mixture of nutrient-laden Upper Circumpolar Deep (UCDW) and western Antarctic Peninsula winter water (WW). Together, data from the AUV survey and penguin dives reveal that 54% of foraging by Adelie penguins occurs immediately below the chlorophyll maximum. These data demonstrate how bringing together emerging technologies, such as AUVs, with established methods such as the radio-tagging of penguins can provide powerful tools for monitoring and hypothesis testing of previously inaccessible ecological processes. Ocean and atmosphere temperatures are expected to continue increasing along the western Antarctic Peninsula, which will undoubtedly affect regional marine ecosystems. New and emerging technologies such as unmanned underwater vehicles and individually mounted satellite tracking devices will provide the tools critical to documenting and understanding the widespread ecological change expected in polar regions.

High photoelectric conversion efficiencies over 40% of photovoltaic converters under high-power irradiation over 10 W cm(-2) are required for the practical application in these applications. We achieved a high conversion efficiency of 43.0% of GaInP photonic power converter under high-power 638 nm laser irradiation of 17.0 W cm(-2) by incorporating multi-crossed finger electrodes and a distributed Bragg reflector. The highest efficiency, 46.0% of GaInP converter cell, was also obtained at 1.1 W cm(-2) laser irradiation.

ID NAVIGATION; SLOPE; MODEL
AB Waldo Tobler introduced his hiking function in a little-known article in 1993, as a formal representation of the relationship between topographic gradient and the velocity of an average hiker, with parameters estimated from some previously collected data. Such functions are becoming more useful as apps for route guidance proliferate. Numerous practical issues are raised by any effort to validate these functions empirically. Hiking functions in general allow routes to be measured on various criteria, including travel time, travel distance, or energy consumption, yet, few efforts have been made to calibrate similar functions for other modes of travel, other traveler profiles, and other route criteria. Connected and autonomous vehicles raise the possibility that route choice may take on greater significance in the context of system-wide goals, rather than the current individual self-interest.

AB The municipality of Charagua recently became the first autonomia indigena originaria campesina (autonomous indigenous peasant community) in Bolivia under the 2009 plurinational constitution. A coalition of indigenous leaders backed by a majority of voters embraced the change as a vehicle for bolstering local control over key decisions, thereby advancing local preferences for indigenous forms of governance, values, and control over the development model with special attention to natural resources. The possibility remains, however, that it may operate to incorporate the indigenous community into the governing apparatus, thus making it more legible to the state and open to new forms of regulation, management, and control. Examining the state as a historically contingent and socially determined relationship helps make sense of this situation.

AB The rapid extraction of farmland boundaries is key to implementing autonomous operation of agricultural machinery. This study addresses the issue of incomplete farmland boundary segmentation in existing methods, proposing a method for obtaining farmland boundaries based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images. The method is divided into two steps: boundary image acquisition and boundary line fitting. To acquire the boundary image, an improved semantic segmentation network, AttMobile-DeeplabV3+, is designed. Subsequently, a boundary tracing function is used to track the boundaries of the binary image. Lastly, the least squares method is used to obtain the fitted boundary line. The paper validates the method through experiments on both crop-covered and non-crop-covered farmland. Experimental results show that on crop-covered and non-crop-covered farmland, the network's intersection over union (IoU) is 93.25% and 93.14%, respectively; the pixel accuracy (PA) for crop-covered farmland is 96.62%. The average vertical error and average angular error of the extracted boundary line are 0.039 and 1.473 degrees, respectively. This research provides substantial and accurate data support, offering technical assistance for the positioning and path planning of autonomous agricultural machinery.

AB Point clouds have been a popular representation to describe 3D environments for autonomous driving applications. Despite accurate depth information, sparsity of points results in difficulties in extracting sufficient features from vulnerable objects of small sizes. One solution is leveraging self-attention networks to build long-range connections between similar objects. Another method is using generative models to estimate the complete shape of objects. Both approaches introduce large memory consumption and extra complexity to the models while the geometric characteristics of objects are overlooked. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes Point Augmentation (PA)-RCNN, focusing on small object detection by generating efficient complementary features without trainable parameters. Specifically, 3D points are sampled with the guidance of object proposals and encoded through the 3D grid-based feature aggregation to produce localised 3D voxel properties. Such voxel attributes are fed to the pooling module with the aid of fictional points, which are transformed from sampled points considering geometric symmetry. Experimental results on Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI dataset show a superior advantage in the detection of distant and small objects in comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods.

AB This paper presents the hardware development and testing of a new concept for air sampling via the integration of a prototype spore trap onboard an unmanned aerial system (UAS). We propose the integration of a prototype spore trap onboard a UAS to allow multiple capture of spores of pathogens in single remote locations at high or low altitude, otherwise not possible with stationary sampling devices. We also demonstrate the capability of this system for the capture of multiple time-stamped samples during a single mission. Wind tunnel testing was followed by simulation, and flight testing was conducted to measure and quantify the spread during simulated airborne air sampling operations. During autonomous operations, the onboard autopilot commands the servo to rotate the sampling device to a new indexed location once the UAS vehicle reaches the predefined waypoint or set of waypoints (which represents the region of interest). Time-stamped UAS data are continuously logged during the flight to assist with analysis of the particles collected. Testing and validation of the autopilot and spore trap integration, functionality, and performance is described. These tools may enhance the ability to detect new incursions of spores.

AB Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are autonomous networks that have been frequently deployed to collaboratively perform target localization and classification tasks. Their autonomous and collaborative features resemble the characteristics of agents. Such similarities inspire the development of heterogeneous agent architecture for WSN in this paper. The proposed agent architecture views WSN as multi-agent systems and mobile agents are employed to reduce in-network communication. According to the architecture, an energy based acoustic localization algorithm is proposed. In localization, estimate of target location is obtained by steepest descent search. The search algorithm adapts to measurement environments by dynamically adjusting its termination condition. With the agent architecture, target classification is accomplished by distributed support vector machine (SVM). Mobile agents are employed for feature extraction and distributed SVM learning to reduce communication load. Desirable learning performance is guaranteed by combining support vectors and convex hull vectors. Fusion algorithms are designed to merge SVM classification decisions made from various modalities. Real world experiments with MICAz sensor nodes are conducted for vehicle localization and classification. Experimental results show the proposed agent architecture remarkably facilitates WSN designs and algorithm implementation. The localization and classification algorithms also prove to be accurate and energy efficient.

AB Thanks to the complementary nature of millimeter wave radar and camera, deep learning-based radar-camera 3D object detection methods may reliably produce accurate detections even in low-visibility conditions. This makes them preferable to use in autonomous vehicles' perception systems, especially as the combined cost of both sensors is cheaper than the cost of a lidar. Recent radar-camera methods commonly perform feature-level fusion which often involves projecting the radar points onto the same plane as the image features and fusing the extracted features from both modalities. While performing fusion on the image plane is generally simpler and faster, projecting radar points onto the image plane flattens the depth dimension of the point cloud which might lead to information loss and makes extracting the spatial features of the point cloud harder. We proposed ClusterFusion, an architecture that leverages the local spatial features of the radar point cloud by clustering the point cloud and performing feature extraction directly on the point cloud clusters before projecting the features onto the image plane. ClusterFusion achieved the state-of-the-art performance among all radar-monocular camera methods on the test slice of the nuScenes dataset with 48.7% nuScenes detection score (NDS). We also investigated the performance of different radar feature extraction strategies on point cloud clusters: a handcrafted strategy, a learning-based strategy, and a combination of both, and found that the handcrafted strategy yielded the best performance. The main goal of this work is to explore the use of radar's local spatial and point-wise features by extracting them directly from radar point cloud clusters for a radar-monocular camera 3D object detection method that performs cross-modal feature fusion on the image plane.

AB As an extension and novel category of the Internet of Things (IoT), the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) attracts growing interest in sensing and exploiting ocean. Underwater Sensor Networks (UWSNs) are the existing application to support the concept of IoUT but faced with many challenges in information acquisition as well. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) assisted hierarchical information acquisition system composed of a marine stationary sensor layer and an AUV motion layer. Different from the most existing data-gathering schemes that ignored the energy management of underwater sensor nodes and the angle control in AUV operation, this work designs an energy-aware clustering protocol based on the improved K-Means algorithm (ECBIK) to achieve energy efficiency of sensor nodes and proposes a novel Ant Colony (ACO) algorithm integrating with Markov Reward Process (R-ACO) to optimize the distance and angle in AUV path planning. Specifically, in the sensor layer, we first calculate the accurate number of clusters according to the Elbow method, and then introduce a cluster head dynamic conversion mechanism by considering energy load and node survival rate. In the AUV motion layer, we establish a reliable AUV trajectory model to quantify the angle change during its operation. Meanwhile, we apply far-sighted feature of MRP to path optimization. Finally, simulation results validate the performance of our designed algorithms. Compared with the traditional clustering methods of K-Means and LEACH-L, the node survival rates of the proposed ECBIK are increased by 26% and 129.1% respectively. And in the aspect of path planning, the distance and angle under R-ACO are reduced by 4% and 18% respectively compared with ACO.

This article presents the Analysis of Safety-Critical Systems Using Formal Methods-Based Runtime Evaluation (ASSURE) framework, which is a collection of techniques for aiding in the formal verification of safety-critical aerospace systems. ASSURE supports the rigorous verification of deterministic and nondeterministic properties of both distributed and centralized aerospace applications by using formal theorem proving tools. We present verifiable algorithms and software, formal reasoning models, formal proof libraries, and a data-driven runtime verification approach for aerospace systems toward a provably safe Internet of Planes infrastructure.

AB An improved global stereo matching algorithm is implemented on a single FPGA for real-time applications. Stereo matching is widely used in stereo vision systems, i.e. objects detection and autonomous vehicles. Global algorithms have much more accurate results than local algorithms, but global algorithms are not implemented on FPGA since they rely over high-end hardware resources. In this implementation the stereo pairs are divided into blocks, the hardware resources are reduced by processing one block once. The hardware implementation is based on a Xilinx Kintex 7 FPGA. Experiment results show that the proposed implementation has an accurate result for the Middlebury benchmarks and 30 frames per second (fps) @1920 x 1680 is achieved. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A novel adaptive habitat classifying algorithm is presented, which uses a Monte Carlo simulation technique to select the most informative mission from a set of candidates. Approximations are presented to assign upper and lower bounds to the information expected from the candidate missions. This allows missions to be efficiently pruned from the set of candidates so that the algorithm converges to a preferred candidate with a reduced number of simulations. The performance of this algorithm is evaluated in an experiment carried out using an AUV at Jervis Bay, Australia. (c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID MATHEMATICAL MORPHOLOGY; AVOIDANCE
AB The forward-looking image sonar is a necessary vision device for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV). Based on the acoustic image received from forward-looking image sonar, AUV local path is planned. When the environment model is made to adapt to local path planning, an iterative algorithm of binary conversion is used for image segmentation. Raw data of the acoustic image, which were received from serial port, are processed. By the use of "Mathematic Morphology" to filter noise, a mathematic model of environment for local path planning is established after coordinate transformation. The optimal path is searched by the distant transmission (Dt) algorithm. Simulation is conducted for the analysis of the algorithm. Experiment on the sea proves it reliable.

AB Layered two-dimensional (2D) and quasi-zero-dimensional (0D) materials effectively absorb radiation in the wide ultraviolet, visible, infrared, and terahertz ranges. Photomemristive structures made of such low-dimensional materials are of great interest for creating optoelectronic platforms for energy-efficient storage and processing of data and optical signals in real time. Here, photosensor and memristor structures based on graphene, graphene oxide, bismuth oxyselenide, and transition metal dichalcogenides are reviewed from the point of view of application in broadband image recognition in artificial intelligence systems for autonomous unmanned vehicles, as well as the compatibility of the formation of layered neuromorphic structures with CMOS technology.

DT Article
AB Ghost imaging (GI) is an unconventional imaging method that reconstructs the object information via light-intensity correlation measurements. However, at present, the field of view (FOV) of this method is limited to the illumination range of light patterns. To enlarge the FOV of GI efficiently, we propose an omnidirectional GI system (OGIS) that can achieve a 360 degrees omnidirectional FOV only via the addition of a curved mirror. The OGIS features retina-like annular patterns designed as a log-polar structure and can obtain the undistorted unwrapping-free panoramic images with uniformresolution. This research presents a new, to the best of our knowledge, perspective for the applications of GI, such as pipeline detection, a panoramic situation awareness for autonomous vehicles.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are widely used to explore the mysterious underwater world. Following along predefined spatial paths, AUVs are able to gather valuable seabed information in a designated area by recruiting sonar suites. The acoustic data collected by AUVs are usually in the type of point cloud with range information. Hence, how to reconstruct the topography of seabed via 3D point cloud data is the key to build the 3D seabed map. In order to address the problem, the paper presents a practical mesh method to achieve an accurate reconstruction of seabed surface from raw sonar records. Sonar data processing consists of three stages: point clearing, point normal and 3D surface reconstruction. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Using computational modeling, we probe how to design microfluidic systems in which magnetic microcapsules could autonomously crawl along channel walls. The polymeric microcapsules are fluid-filled elastic shells with embedded superparamagnetic nanoparticles and, thereby, can be controlled by external magnetic fields. We show that when a magnetic force circulates normal to a sticky microchannel wall, capsules can propel in a steady, autonomous manner. The unidirectional capsule propulsion is facilitated by hydrodynamic interactions between the capsules and channel walls, and is most effective when the magnitudes of magnetic and adhesive forces are equal to each other. Furthermore, the propulsion efficiency is greater for compliant capsules. Our findings could be useful for designing novel microfluidic devices where mobile magnetic microcapsules could be harnessed as microscale transport vehicles.

AB We present a novel method for visual mapping and localization for autonomous vehicles, by extracting, modeling, and optimizing semantic road elements. Specifically, our method integrates cascaded deep models to detect standardized road elements instead of traditional point features, to seek for improved pose accuracy and map representation compactness. To utilize the structural features, we model road lights and signs by their representative deep keypoints for skeleton and boundary, and parameterize lanes via piecewise cubic splines. Based on the road semantic features, we build a complete pipeline for mapping and localization, which includes a) image processing front-end, b) sensor fusion strategies, and c) optimization back-end. Experiments on public datasets and our testing platform have demonstrated the effectiveness and advantages of our method by outperforming traditional approaches.

The "Tactile Internet" demands completely new technologies. Low latency, short response times, high reliability and resilience, a network of edge clouds and security are basic requirements. Therefore, 5G is developed. Novel use cases are industrial automation, autonomous vehicles, e-health, and the Internet of Things. For agriculture, 5G is a crucial technology enabler for robotization and Smart Farming processes. Agriculture needs own ad-hoc radio network solutions to efficiently provide coverage and manage data transfer, privacy and flexibility. The synergy of cellular and local mesh communications can solve the problem of unreliable communication and allows farmers to take full control of their data.

AB If an autonomous vehicle is working in an image-based system which needs real-time answers and whose response is critical, it will be very important to reduce computation times and, as we know, this could be performed by increasing the system parallelism. Since morphological filtering is the origin of several applications in computer vision, in this paper we are going to describe some new features to implement morphological operations by using digital signal processors. After that, an application to path planning is proposed The standard shortest path planning problem determines a collision-free path of shortest distance between two distinct locations in an environment scattered with obstacles. Consequently, a path planning algorithm which uses morphological operations and a DSP to process images is then described.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB We propose a new camera-lidar fusion method for road detection where the spherical coordinate transformation is introduced to decrease the gap between the point cloud of 3D lidar data. The camera's color data and the 3D lidar's height data are transformed into the same spherical coordinate, and then input to the convolution neural network for segmentation. Faster segmentation is possible due to the reduced size of input data. To increase the detection accuracy, this modified SegNet expands the receptive field of the network. Using the KITTI dataset, we present the experimental results to show the usefulness of the proposed method.

AB Computer vision for control is a growing domain of research and it is widespread in industry and the autonomous vehicle field. A further step is the employment of low-cost cameras to perform these applications. To apply such an approach, the development of proper algorithms to interpret vision data is mandatory. Here, we firstly propose the development of an algorithm to measure the displacement of a mechanical system in contactless mode. Afterwards, we show two procedures that use a 3D camera as a feedback in control strategies. The first one aims to track a moving object. In the second one, the information gained from vision data acquisition allows the mechanical system control to ensure the equilibrium of a ball placed on a moving slide.

AB This paper introduces two 4-DOF underwater manipulators mounted on autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with grasping claws, such that the AUV can accomplish the underwater task by using dual manipulators. Mechanical design of the manipulator is briefly presented and the feature of the simple structure of dual manipulators is simulated by using Solid Works. In addition, the hydrodynamics of the manipulator is analyzed, considering drag force, added mass and buoyancy. Then, hydrodynamic simulations of the manipulator are conducted by using 3-D model with Adams software, from which the torque of each joint is calculated. This paper presents an integrated result of computed torques by combining the theoretical calculation and simulation results, which is instrumental in determining the driving torque of the manipulators.

AB The paper presents neural dynamic optimization (NDO) as a method of optimal feedback control for nonlinear multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) systems. The main feature of NDO is that it enables neural networks to approximate the optimal feedback solution whose existence dynamic programming (DP) justifies, thereby reducing the complexities of computation and storage problems of the classical methods such as DP. This paper mainly describes the background and motivations for the development of NDO, while the two other subsequent papers of this topic present the theory of NDO and demonstrate the method with several applications including control of autonomous vehicles and of a robot arm, respectively.

AB The verification and validation processes of fully automated vehicles are linked to an almost intractable challenge of reflecting the real world with all its interactions in a virtual environment. Influential stochastic parameters need to be extracted from real-world measurements and real-time data, capturing all interdependencies, for an accurate simulation of reality. A copula is a probability model that represents a multivariate distribution, examining the dependence between the underlying variables. This model is used on drone measurement data from a roundabout containing dependent stochastic parameters. With the help of the copula model, samples are generated that reflect the real-time data. The resulting applications and possible extensions are discussed and explored.

AB Inefficient tumor penetration caused by the characteristics of tumor microenvironments is a primary obstacle to improving drug delivery efficiency, which restricts the chemotherapy drug efficacy. One such promising idea is to construct micro/nanomotors (MNMs) as an effective delivery vehicle by way of producing autonomous motion and converting exogenous stimuli or external energies from the surrounding environment into mechanical forces. In this research, the Pt/DOX nanomotor was prepared, and the enhanced diffusion and positive chemotaxis driven by substrates were verified in vitro, proof of the enhanced cellular uptake and deep penetration of Pt/DOX. As a novel nanovehicle, Pt/DOX potentially provides an intriguing approach to foster the tumor-deep penetration and enhance the drug delivery efficiency.

With a sparse-sample full-wave solver and a dense-sample ray-tracing solver, the surrogate model can be established with a small computational burden. A mapping function is introduced to represent the relationship between two such solvers to overcome the limitations of the conventional fixed linear mapping form. Two numerical examples are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, which demonstrate its ability to achieve an ideal accuracy with limited computational resources.

The time-energy optimal control model is first discretized into a nonlinear programming problem at Gauss collocations by the NAP method. Subsequently, we prove the equivalence between the nonlinear programming problem derived from the NAP method and the time-energy optimal control model problem. Compared to those of the interior point method and the piecewise gauss pseudospectal method, simulation results show that the NAP method has higher computational efficiency and accuracy in solving the time-energy optimal control model problem.

AB In this paper, we propose a Reactive Traffic-Aware Routing Strategy (ReTARS) for real-time urban vehicular environments that makes dynamic routes to avoid unnecessary and dead-end routes. ReTARS leverages prior global knowledge of real-time vehicular traffic to create paths between each vehicle. In ReTARS, the critical decisions are taken by decision making node at intersections which is based on prior global knowledge of real-time vehicular traffic. The simulation results in urban environment for with and without obstacles scenarios show that the ReTARS has better performance as compare to some existing VANET routing protocols in terms of packet delivery ratio, average delay, and hops count.

AB In this work, consideration is given to the thermodynamic limit of the kinetic energy extractable from the ascending or descending motion of a buoyancy engine for use in the contraction or expansion of its own chamber. From the laws of thermodynamics, a simple expression for thermodynamic efficiency was derived. It is shown that contrary to what might be expected, the efficiency is not dependent on the drag coefficient and then on the specific shape of the body but rather only on the normalized Reynolds number Re Re �� , where Re �� is the terminal Reynolds number. The maximum efficiency was found to be & SIME; 40% when the contraction or expansion takes place at & AP; 85% of the terminal velocity.

AB The results of experimental and theoretical studies on the propagation and reception of broadband pulsed signals based on pseudorandom sequences are discussed. The features of impulse response functions for reception of signals with different frequency bands and durations of symbols are investigated. Separation of acoustic energy arrivals in the cross-correlation function of the received and emitted signals is investigated in the framework of the normal mode theory for a deep-sea waveguides. The study concluded that a combination of navigation signals with different symbols duration must be used for solving practical problems of autonomous underwater vehicles positioning.

Notably, our system does not require beacon positions a priori, and our system performs well even when range measurements are severely degraded by noise and outliers. We present a powerful outlier rejection method that can identify groups of range measurements that are consistent with each other, and a method for initializing beacon positions in an extended Kalman filter (EKF). We have successfully applied our algorithms to real-world data and have demonstrated a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system whose navigation performance is comparable to that of systems that assume known beacon locations.

AB The blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) have been the focal point of innovations and received increasing attention of the community over the last years. The blockchain technology is a distributed ledger of reliable digital records that are shared by the participating networks. AI, on the other hand, and its applications have been used for developing futuristic machines that are capable of having human-like intelligence. The use of both technologies in transportation systems has seen a tremendous growth that resulted in transformation of the transportation industry. Various modes of transportation, such as new transit systems, metro rails, high-speed rails, connected and automated vehicles, autonomous trains, and other emerging transportation modes (hyperloop, e-scooters, hoverboards), still face many challenges, including but not limited to economic issues, energy efficiency, social adoption, data privacy, lack of regulatory standards, reliability, security, and ethical issues. The use of blockchain and AI technologies has the potential to fill the technology gaps in transportation systems and effectively address the existing challenges. The convergence of both technologies is likely to yield significant advantages and provide a common distributed platform for data sharing, reliability, and decision-making. The present study is focused on understanding both technologies and their convergence in various industrial domains with a specific emphasis on transportation systems. A detailed state-of-the-art review of the relevant literature is performed to identify the main advantages and challenges in the applications of blockchain and AI in transportation systems and other related domains along with the ways to overcome these challenges. This study also reveals some critical future research needs for successful development and implementation of these technologies in transportation systems.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Depth estimation with monocular cameras is a cheap and promising solution for autonomous vehicles and robots. Even though there are many approaches in the literature, the issue of estimating depth of objects with low optic flow (low parallax) still remains. This work proposes a new two-view monocular depth estimation method that estimates depths with only a monocular camera using two optic flow directions based on the Flat Surface Model, fusing them with optic flow as weights. The proposed method achieves an average depth estimation error of 3.68 m and a maximum error of 107.34 m, which are smaller than those obtained by traditional techniques (22.90 and 9815.44 m, respectively).

Our objective is to achieve a configuration maximizing the coverage of the environment while increasing the graph's connectivity. First, we provide: (i) a dispersion protocol guaranteeing connectivity maintenance; and (ii) a compactness controller with static and variable control gains that minimizes the inter-agent angles. Second, we present a sequential, multi-stage strategy and analyse its stability. Finally, we validate our theoretical results with simulations, where a group of robots are deployed to carry out sensing or communication tasks.

The main contribution of the paper is kinematic formulation of the leader-follower formation based on seeker measurements which omit the need for communication networks. Considering uncertainties in measurement of followers speeds, a robust controller is employed. Then, by proposing an integrated controller-estimator consisting of the robust controller and a disturbance compensator, keeping the formation while the leader is maneuvering is guaranteed. Simulation results verify the accuracy of the integrated controller-estimator system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a range-free, passive, and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-based localization scheme is proposed for underwater acoustic sensor networks. The AUV has used four directional acoustic beams with fixed steering angle and width, which led to the constant ratio of array size to wavelength, in order to localize the sensor nodes. The AUV was moved on a random waypoint path and broadcasted messages periodically. The sensor nodes used two successively received message sequences which were submitted by two beams on one side of the AUV path in order to localize themselves. Extensive simulation results in MATLAB demonstrated that using the proposed localization scheme could yield better localization success than other AUV-based localization methods.

AB We study the minimum cost path problem in an environment in which the cost is direction dependent (anisotropic). The problem arises in sailing, robotics, aircraft navigation, and routing of autonomous vehicles, where the cost is affected by the direction of waves, winds, or slope of the terrain. We present an approximation algorithm to find a minimum cost path for a point robot moving in a planar subdivision, in which each face is assigned a translational flow that reflects the cost of travelling within this face.
   Our main contribution is a data structure that, given a subdivision with translational flows, returns a (1 + epsilon)-approximate minimum cost path in the subdivision between any two query points in the plane. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This manuscript considers the problem of close target reconnaissance by a group of autonomous agents. The overall close target reconnaissance (CTR) involves subtasks of avoiding inter-agent collisions, reaching a close vicinity of a specific target position, and forming an equilateral polygon formation around the target. The agents performing the task fly at a constant speed to mimic the velocity behavior of small fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). A decentralized control scheme is developed for this overall task and the finite-time convergence of the system under the proposed control law is established. Furthermore, it is guaranteed that no collision occurs among the agent. The relevant analysis and simulation test results are provided. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper presents a novel approach based on active-vision paradigm, for generating local collision-free paths for mobile robot navigation, in indoor as well as outdoor environments. Two measurable visual motion cues that provide some measure for a relative change in range as well clearance between a 3D surface and a visually fixating observer in motion are described. The visual fields associated with the cues can be used to demarcate regions around a moving observer into safe and danger zones of varying degree, which is suitable for making local decisions about the steering as well as speed commands to the vehicle.

AB Logistics drones are theoretically advantageous in automating last-mile delivery activities, but practically challenging in urban environments, including public concerns about risk of crashes and privacy. In view of the above concerns existing in the trajectory planning of logistics drones, this paper presents a parallel automatic delivery model following the cyber-physical social system (CPSS) for the last mile delivery of superchilling products, revealing the social value of logistics drone operations. Considering the operational constraints of logistics drone, a multi-objective optimisation model is established to balance the social value, energy efficiency and productivity of using logistics drones in the last-mile superchilling delivery. To effectively achieve the above optimisation, improved strategies, including the material exchange mechanism based on the random proportion rule and the Universe-Particle search strategy, are developed, resulting in an improved two-stage heuristic algorithm. Finally, simulation experiments are carried out in a simulated environment with 154 buildings, and compared with other frontier algorithms used for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory planning. The results show that the proposed framework can effectively reduce the threats to public life safety and improve the energy efficiency of logistics drones, while ensuring the productivity in the delivery process.

AB Viewpoint selection for capturing human motion is an important task in autonomous aerial videography, animation, and virtual 3-D environments. Existing methods rely on heuristics for selecting the "best" viewpoint, which requires human effort to summarize and integrate viewpoint selection rules into a visual servo system to control a camera. In this work, we propose an integrated aerial filming system for autonomously capturing cinematic shots of action scenes on the basis of a set of demonstrations given for imitation. Our model, which is built on the basis of the deep deterministic policy gradient, takes a sequence of a subject's skeleton and the camera pose as input and outputs the camera motion with an optimal viewpoint related to the subject. In addition, we design a spatial attention network to selectively focus on the discriminative joints of the skeleton within each frame. Given the demonstrations with human motions, our framework learns to predict the next best viewpoint by imitating the demonstrations for viewing the motion of the subject. Extensive experimental results in simulated and real outdoor environments demonstrate that our method can successfully mimic the viewpoint selection strategy and capture a more accurate viewpoint than state-of-the-art autonomous cinematography methods.

AB An unmanned swarm system (UWS) is a multiagent system that can fulfill task requirements through autonomous and cooperative behavior strategy learning. However, learning instability is inevitable in a dynamic mission setting, as the agents continuously adapt to an evolving mission objective. This article proposes several knowledge enhancement mechanisms to improve the training efficiency and learning stability of a UWS in a confined-space confrontation mission. Specifically, a punishment for transcending action-space boundary and a reward for satisfying agent space-time distance constraints are introduced as training reward enhancements. Meanwhile, experience sharing among agents is optimized for unanimous behavior. We apply these novel mechanisms to several representative single-agent and multiagent reinforcement learning algorithms and verify their effectiveness on our proprietary, SwarmFlow, simulation system. Simulations show that the proposed mechanisms improve existing algorithms' convergence speed and performance stability. The increase is more prominent for multiagent reinforcement learning algorithms than single-agent algorithms where the convergence time is halved, and the mission success rates increase by 3-4%.

AB The future challenge for field robots is to increase the level of autonomy towards long distance (>1 km) and duration (>1h) applications. One of the key technologies is the ability to accurately estimate the properties of the traversed terrain to optimize onboard control strategies and energy efficient path-planning, ensuring safety and avoiding possible immobilization conditions that would lead to mission failure. Two main hypotheses are put forward in this research. The first hypothesis is that terrain can be effectively detected by relying exclusively on the measurement of quantities that pertain to the robot-ground interaction, i.e., on proprioceptive signals. Therefore, no visual or depth information is required. Then, artificial deep neural networks can provide an accurate and robust solution to the classi-fication problem of different terrain types. Under these hypotheses, sensory signals are classified as time series directly by a Recurrent Neural Network or by a Convolutional Neural Network in the form of higher-level features or spectrograms resulting from additional processing. In both cases, results obtained from real experiments show comparable or better performance when contrasted with standard Support Vector Machine with the additional advantage of not requiring an a priori definition of the feature space.

ID ACTION RECOGNITION
AB There has been increased attention paid to autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) recently because of their usage in several fields. Human action recognition (HAR) in UAV videos plays an important role in various real-life applications. Although HAR using UAV frames has not received much attention from researchers to date, it is still a significant area that needs further study because of its relevance for the development of efficient algorithms for autonomous drone surveillance. Current deep-learning models for HAR have limitations, such as large weight parameters and slow inference speeds, which make them unsuitable for practical applications that require fast and accurate detection of unusual human actions. In response to this problem, this paper presents a new deep-learning model based on depthwise separable convolutions that has been designed to be lightweight. Other parts of the HarNet model comprised convolutional, rectified linear unit, dropout, pooling, padding, and dense blocks. The effectiveness of the model has been tested using the publicly available UCF-ARG dataset. The proposed model, called HarNet, has enhanced the rate of successful classification. Each unit of frame data was pre-processed one by one by different computer vision methods before it was incorporated into the HarNet model. The proposed model, which has a compact architecture with just 2.2 million parameters, obtained a 96.15% success rate in classification, outperforming the MobileNet, Xception, DenseNet201, Inception-ResNetV2, VGG-16, and VGG-19 models on the same dataset. The proposed model had numerous key advantages, including low complexity, a small number of parameters, and high classification performance. The outcomes of this paper showed that the model's performance was superior to that of other models that used the UCF-ARG dataset.

AB For estimating lateral flux in the ocean using fixed or mobile platforms, the authors present a method of analyzing the estimation error and designing the sampling strategy. When an array of moorings is used, spatial aliasing leads to an error in flux estimation. When an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is run, measurements along its course are made at different times. Such nonsynopticity in the measurements leads to an error in flux estimation. It is assumed that the temporal-spatial autocovariance function of the flux variable can be estimated from historical data or ocean models (as in this paper). Using the temporal-spatial autocovariance function of the flux variable, the mean-square error of the flux estimate by fixed or mobile platforms is derived. The method is used to understand the relative strengths of moorings and AUVs (assumed here to be able to maintain constant speed) under different scenarios of temporal and spatial variabilities. The flux estimate by moorings through trapezoidal approximation generally carries a bias that drops quadratically with the number of moorings. The authors also show that a larger number of slower AUVs may achieve a more accurate flux estimate than a smaller number of faster AUVs under the same cumulative speed, but the performance margin shrinks with the increase of the cumulative speed. Using the error analysis results, one can choose the type of platforms and optimize the sampling strategy under resource constraints. To verify the theoretical analysis, the authors run simulated surveys in synthesized ocean fields. The flux estimation errors agree very well with the analytical predictions. Using an ocean model dataset, the authors estimate the lateral heat flux across a section in Monterey Bay, California, and also compare the flux estimation errors with the analytical predictions.

AB Smart Grid is being proposed as a prime solution for the effective growth of electricity market allowing the heterogeneous players to assume real-time autonomous reactions to the changing conditions of the grid and new services (such as demand response, DR, and vehicle-to-grid, V2G) to be introduced. One of the main requisite for such development is represented by advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) which typically provides timely and reliable information about the smart grid. This paper introduces an innovative first block of the AMI represented by a smart sensor based on ARM architecture. The prototype is described in terms of both the hardware and software features and the metrological characterization is provided through the experimental test according to OIML R-46.

AB This paper proposes a new heuristic search technique for obstacle avoidance of autonomous underwater vehicles that are equipped with a looking ahead obstacle avoidance sonar. Fuzzy relational method of Bandler and Kohout is used as the mathematical implementation for the analysis and synthesis of relations between the partitioned sections of sonar and the environmental properties. For the technique used in this paper, sonar range must be partitioned into multi equal sections and membership functions of the properties and the corresponding fuzzy rule bases are estimated by domain experts. The simulation result leads to the conclusion that only with the two properties safety and remoteness and with sonar partitioned in seven sections, the applied technique enables AUVs to safely avoid any obstacle and to navigate on the optimal way to goal.

ID MODEL
AB This paper addresses the issue of collision avoidance using lane-change maneuvers. Of particular interest is to determine the minimum distance beyond which an obstacle cannot be avoided at a given initial speed. Using a planar bicycle model, we first computer the sharpest dynamically feasible maneuver by minimizing the longitudinal distance of a lane transition, assuming given initial and free final speeds. The minimum distance to an obstacle is then determined from the path traced by the optimal maneuver. Plotting the minimum distance in the phase plane establishes the clearance curve, a valuable tool for planning emergency maneuvers. For the bicycle model, the clearance curve is shown to closely correlate with the straight line produced by a point mass model. Examples demonstrate the use of the clearance curve for planning safe avoidance maneuvers.

AB Autonomous scene exposure and exploration, especially in localization or communication-denied areas, useful for finding targets in unknown scenes, remains a challenging problem in computer navigation. In this work, we present a novel method for real-time environment exploration, whose only requirements are a visually similar dataset for pre-training, enough lighting in the scene, and an on-board forward-looking RGB camera for environmental sensing. As opposed to existing methods, our method requires only one look (image) to make a good tactical decision, and therefore works at a non-growing, constant time. Two direction predictions, characterized by pixels dubbed the Goto and Lookat pixels, comprise the core of our method. These pixels encode the recommended flight instructions in the following way: the Goto pixel defines the direction in which the agent should move by one distance unit, and the Lookat pixel defines the direction in which the camera should be pointing at in the next step. These flying-instruction pixels are optimized to expose the largest amount of currently unexplored areas. Our method presents a novel deep learning-based navigation approach that is able to solve this problem and demonstrate its ability in an even more complicated setup, i.e., when computational power is limited. In addition, we propose a way to generate a navigation-oriented dataset, enabling efficient training of our method using RGB and depth images. Tests conducted in a simulator evaluating both the sparse pixels' coordinations inferring process, and 2D and 3D test flights aimed to unveil areas and decrease distances to targets achieve promising results. Comparison against a state-of-the-art algorithm shows our method is able to overperform it, that while measuring the new voxels per camera pose, minimum distance to target, percentage of surface voxels seen, and compute time metrics.

   (1) A pervasive system based on deep learning that can utilize a camera and GPS sensors of a car on a road to provide an up-to-date roadway safety estimation, which is a costly task in existing road asset management systems (RAMS). (2) A system that automatically estimates roadway safety to enable or disable vehicles' autonomous driving or advanced driving active safety (ADAS) functions.
   Extensive research efforts have been devoted to identify and improve roadway features that impact safety. Maintaining roadway safety features relies on costly manual operations of regular road surveying and data analysis. This paper introduces an automatic roadway safety features detection approach, which harnesses the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) computer vision to make the process more efficient and less costly. Given a front-facing camera and a global positioning system (GPS) sensor, the proposed system automatically evaluates ten roadway safety features. The system is composed of an oriented (or rotated) object detection model, which solves an orientation encoding discontinuity problem to improve detection accuracy, and a rule-based roadway safety evaluation module. To train and validate the proposed model, a fully-annotated dataset for roadway safety features extraction was collected covering 473 km of roads. The proposed method baseline results are found encouraging when compared to the state-of-the-art models. Different oriented object detection strategies are presented and discussed, and the developed model resulted in improving the mean average precision (mAP) by 16.9% when compared with the literature. The roadway safety feature average prediction accuracy is 84.39% and ranges between 91.11% and 63.12%. The introduced model can pervasively enable/disable autonomous driving (AD) based on safety features of the road; and empower connected vehicles (CV) to send and receive estimated safety features, alerting drivers about black spots or relatively less-safe segments or roads.

AB Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (HESSs), which are mainly based on Lithium-ion (Li - ion) batteries and supercapacitors (SCs), are extensively investigated for large-scale application such as autonomous trucks, autonomous mobile robots, delivery drones and more precisely Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) applications. This hybridization combines the superior energy density characteristics from Li - ion battery and the quick ability of SC for energy storage with a virtually unlimited number of charge and discharge cycles. The combination of Li - ion battery with SC adds more HEV autonomy but increases the complexity of the power management system (PMS). Generally, a good estimation for the state of charge (SOC) of these two power sources creates an opportunity for optimizing the PMS and the safety of HEV. This paper presents a real time state of charge estimation for Li - ion battery (SOCb) and for SC (SOCsc) using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Whereas, a powerful EKF - SOC estimator needs a precise dynamic battery/SC model. So, an hybrid model that benefits from the advantages of direct measurement Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) method and a Recursive Least Square (RLS) with a forgetting factor is used in this work in order to obtain a globally optimal estimating performance. Nevertheless, this work try to simplify the hard task of Li - ion battery/SC SOC estimation for any modeling needs, just with few preliminary experimental tests. Results show the efficiency of EKF using a RLS - OCV hybrid method for identifying Li - ion battery/SC parameters. Finally, an implementation of this reliable hybrid method had been established in test HEV platform.

AB In this paper, an innovative methodology for the generation of a Road Network Definition File (RNDF) using only an obstacle map as input is presented. This RNDF, which relies on a Multiclass Support Vector Machine(MSVM)-based trajectory generation method, will be used by an autonomous vehicle for transporting people in closed, unstructured areas for which no previous information is available, such as residential areas or industrial parks. The advantages of using this technique are the generation of a safe and smooth trajectory graph (making the trip more comfortable for riders by having trajectories pass as far away as possible from obstacles). Moreover, although there exist other previous Support Vector Machine (SVM) path planning methods, this is the first to use a MSVM. The advantages of doing so are that by obtaining a decision boundary for each object in the scene, all possible trajectories are computed and joined to form a graph. This is done through a combination of a Nearest-Neighbor Graph (NNG) and a Relative Neighborhood Graph (RNG). The method was tested with real data and in real conditions, yielding good results. At the end of the paper, results for two kinds of studies are presented. The first set of tests is intended to determine the best parameter values for the proposed methodology. In the second set of evaluations, the approach is compared with other state-of-the-art SVM-based methods, as well as with a classical approach, demonstrating that the method outperforms them in some aspects. Furthermore, the source code of the method is available for testing, as are some videos in which the output of the method is shown, including a comparison with previous methods.

The presented veri. cation methodology is equally applicable for avionics applications ( such as the traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS)), train applications ( such as the European train control system (ETCS)), or automotive applications (such as platooning). We present a veri. cation rule explicating the essence of employed design patterns, guaranteeing global safety properties of the kind "a collision will never occur'', and whose premises can either be established by off-line analysis of the worst-case behaviour of the involved traffic agents, or by purely local proofs, involving only a single traffic agent.

AB Estimation algorithms, such as the sliding window filter, produce an estimate and uncertainty of desired states. This task becomes challenging when the problem involves unobservable states. In these situations, it is critical for the algorithm to "know what it doesn't know", meaning that it must maintain the unobservable states as unobservable during algorithm deployment. This letter presents general requirements for maintaining consistency in sliding window filters involving unobservable states. The value of these requirements for designing navigation solutions is experimentally shown within the context of visual-inertial SLAM making use of IMU preintegration.

AB This article takes a historical geographical approach to suggest that transport modes - in particular bicycles, trains, trams and cars - have given rise to a range of shifting social practices and helped to constitute youth culture in New Zealand and elsewhere between 1880 and 1950. It examines diaries, memoirs and newspaper reports to reveal how adolescents experienced and articulated transport's importance in their own lives, sometimes in complex ways that challenged established social norms. The spaces in, on and around transport vehicles provided opportunities for youthful independence, identity performances and gendered experiences to take place. Over time these contributed to the emergence of the modern teenager as a semi-autonomous social subject. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Team Cornell's Skynet is an autonomous Chevrolet Tahoe built to compete in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge. Skynet consists of many unique subsystems, including actuation and power distribution designed in-house, a tightly coupled attitude and position estimator, a novel obstacle detection and tracking system, a system for augmenting position estimates with vision-based detection algorithms, a path planner based on physical vehicle constraints and a nonlinear optimization routine, and a state-based reasoning agent for obeying traffic laws. This paper describes these subsystems in detail before discussing the system's overall performance in the National Qualifying Event and the Urban Challenge. Logged data recorded at the National Qualifying Event and the Urban Challenge are presented and used to analyze the system's performance. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

DE extrinsic calibration; multiple LiDAR sensors; plane-based registration;
   non-linear optimization
AB Three-dimensional light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors have received much attention in the field of autonomous navigation owing to their accurate, robust, and rich geometric information. Autonomous vehicles are typically equipped with multiple 3D LiDARs because there are many commercially available low-cost 3D LiDARs. Extrinsic calibration of multiple LiDAR sensors is essential in order to obtain consistent geometric information. This paper presents a systematic procedure for the extrinsic calibration of multiple 3D LiDAR sensors using plane objects. At least three independent planes are required within the common field of view of the LiDAR sensors. The planes satisfying the condition can easily be found on objects such as the ground, walls, or columns in indoor and outdoor environments. Therefore, the proposed method does not require environmental modifications such as using artificial calibration objects. Multiple LiDARs typically have different viewpoints to reduce blind spots. This situation increases the difficulty of the extrinsic calibration using conventional registration algorithms. We suggest a plane registration method for cases in which correspondences are not known. The entire calibration process can easily be automated using the proposed registration technique. The presented experimental results clearly show that the proposed method generates more accurate extrinsic parameters than conventional point cloud registration methods.

AB The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) scanner provides a versatile and efficient platform for mobile laser scanning in construction-related scenarios. Recent studies on UAVs have demonstrated point-to-point navigation, yet there has been sparse investigation on scan coverage planning to fully explore a construction site, and on kinodynamic motion planning to ensure energy-efficient trajectories. This study develops a Building Information Model (BIM)-supported framework to facilitate scan planning and motion planning of autonomous LiDAR-carrying UAVs. The proposed framework selectively integrates the geometry and semantics from BIM to construct a probabilistic 3D voxel map. Then, a greedy algorithm is developed to iteratively generate waypoints with optimized coverage. After that, a collision-free guiding path is computed for traversing all the waypoints before it is further transformed into a high-degree polynomial trajectory. The proposed framework was validated in a simulated construction scenario of water treatment facilities using MATLAB and Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). The planned trajectory demonstrated smoothness, energy efficiency, and sufficient coverage. It reduced 86.17% of required moments from motors over the regular A* algorithm and achieved 91.67% scan coverage on the target facility.

AB Autonomous driving highly depends on depth information for safe driving. Recently, major improvements have been taken towards improving both supervised and self-supervised methods for depth reconstruction. However, most of the current approaches focus on single frame depth estimation, where quality limit is hard to beat due to limitations of supervised learning of deep neural networks in general. One of the way to improve quality of existing methods is to utilize temporal information from frame sequences. In this paper, we study intelligent ways of integrating recurrent block in common supervised depth estimation pipeline. We propose a novel method, which takes advantage of the convolutional gated recurrent unit (convGRU) and convolutional long short-term memory (convLSTM). We compare use of convGRU and convLSTM blocks and determine the best model for real-time depth estimation task. We carefully study training strategy and provide new deep neural networks architectures for the task of depth estimation from monocular video using information from past frames based on attention mechanism. We demonstrate the efficiency of exploiting temporal information by comparing our best recurrent method with existing image-based and video-based solutions for monocular depth reconstruction.

AB The objective of this article is to present a method for developing collision risk indicators applicable for autonomous remotely operated vehicles (AROVs), which are essential for promoting situation awareness in decisions support systems. Three suitable risk based collision indicators are suggested for AROVs namely, time to collision, mean time to collision and mean impact energy. The proposed indicators are classified into different thresholds; low, intermediate and high. An AROV flight path is simulated to gather input data to calculate the proposed indicators and three collision targets are established, i.e., subsea structure, seabed and a cooperating AROV. The proposed indicator development method together with the case study show a proof-of-concept that the combination of mean time to collision and mean impact energy indicators can identify risk prone waypoints in the AROV path. The method results in an overall risk picture for a given AROV path. The results may provide useful input in replanning of mission paths and for implementation of risk reducing measures. Even though the method focuses on collision risk, it can be used for other accident scenarios for AROVs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Current pavement condition-assessment procedures are extensively time consuming and laborious; in addition, these approaches pose safety threats to the personnel involved in the process. In this study, a RGB-D sensor is used to detect and quantify defects in pavements. This sensor system consists of a RGB color image, and an infrared projector and a camera that act as a depth sensor. An approach, which does not need any training, is proposed to interpret the data sensed by this inexpensive sensor. This system has the potential to be used for autonomous cost-effective assessment of road-surface conditions. Various road conditions including patching, cracks, and potholes are autonomously detected and, most importantly, quantified, using the proposed approach. Several field experiments have been carried out to evaluate the capabilities, as well as the limitations of the proposed system. The global positioning system information is incorporated with the proposed system to localize the detected defects. This approach has the potential to be deployed as a supplementary sensor system in pavement surface-assessment vehicles and reduce the operation cost. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB High-frequency, shore-based radars (HFR) collect hourly, real-time surface current data over broad areas of the coastal ocean and yield insights on time-varying circulation, predict oil spill trajectories, evaluate circulation models, and, in case of a spill, provide responders with real-time data on spill evolution. HFR requires 7.5 kWh/day of power, but the lack of power availability inhibits HFR use in Alaska. We developed a modular, autonomous remote power module (RPM) for Arctic environments. The RPM design facilitates setup and transport to remote sites using small vehicles, and it contains subsystems for power generation, satellite communications, and power performance monitoring. The subsystems are powered by a battery bank (with a 5-day power reserve) charged primarily by wind and solar and secondarily by a biodiesel generator. The RPM is a stand-alone device for long-term deployments. It minimizes permit issues associated with diesel generators and logistics costs associated with refueling and maintenance. Performance data from a prototype RPM setup in Barrow, Alaska, in fall 2010 is provided. The system is designed for high latitudes but can be modified for remote coasts elsewhere.

AB Modern digital cameras employ silicon focal plane array (FPA) image sensors featuring millions of pixels. However, it is possible to make a camera that only needs one pixel. In these cameras a spatial light modulator, placed before or after the object to be imaged, applies a time-varying pattern and synchronized intensity measurements are made with a single-pixel detector. The principle of compressed sensing then allows an image to be generated. As the approach suits a wide a variety of detector technologies, images can be collected at wavelengths outside the reach of FPA technology or at high frame rates or in three dimensions. Promising applications include the visualization of hazardous gas leaks and 3D situation awareness for autonomous vehicles.

AB Energy usage by mobile robots is becoming a larger concern as autonomous systems increase mission durations. Understanding and characterizing energy usage is key to reliable mission operation. This paper presents a methodology for characterizing energy usage of a ground robot traveling at a constant speed applicable to both open and "black box" (proprietary) platforms. To address testing area limitations, we introduce a "rounded box" path to approximate straight line travel. For a case study, this methodology was applied to an iRobot Packbot on grass and asphalt surfaces. Our results show a decrease in electrical energy used with increasing speed for soft grass and constant energy usage on asphalt. For both surfaces, a similar electrical-to-mechanical efficiency curve is obtained.

AB The scanning process of lidar scanners is extended over time. Hence, relative motion between sensor and object during the scanning leads to a motion-dependent blur, here called motion-scan effect. Due to this effect the lidar's distance map is deteriorated, which has a negative impact on the subsequent signal processing. This paper quantifies this effect and compares it to statistical errors. In order to compensate for the negative impact, motion models for a simple car model are formulated, and the model parameters are checked for identifiability. Identification of the parameters allows to compensate for the effect. Thus the accuracy and the control mode can be improved, which is particularly important for. safety-critical applications, e.g., autonomous vehicles.

ID AUTOMOTIVE SAR; VISION
AB Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) techniques are commonly used in spaceborne and airborne side-looking radar imaging applications, where the relatively high platform speeds enable the formation of very long synthetic apertures, which provide images with high angular resolution. However, the recent development of new autonomous ground vehicles, with relatively slow speeds, calls for new SAR imaging methods to obtain high angular resolution images. In this paper, the concept of forward-looking multiple-input multiple-output SAR (FL-MIMO-SAR) is analyzed and applied for short-range millimeter-wave radar forward-looking imaging in autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). Moreover, if the antenna inter-element spacing in the MIMO array is small, the FL-MIMO-SAR imaging system will provide low or no angular resolution refinement at the radar boresight region, i.e., Doppler beam sharpening (DBS) ineffective region. To solve that, the combination of FL-MIMO-SAR and sparse MIMO arrays with large inter-element spacing (FL-sparseMIMO-SAR) is proposed. Aspects such as the signal model, image reconstruction, complexity reduction, and the left-right ambiguity for FL-MIMO-SAR imaging systems are addressed. In addition, different imaging scenarios for AMRs are simulated using a frequency-modulated continuous wave radar simulator. Simulation results are validated with real measurements. It is shown that the proposed combination of FL-MIMO-SAR and MIMO arrays with large inter-element spacing manages to significantly suppress the grating lobes, which come from the sparsity in the antenna array. Moreover, the proposed FL-sparseMIMO-SAR helps to relax the requirements on the synthetic aperture length and solves the DBS-blind region problem, thanks to the larger real sparse MIMO array and the grating lobes suppression with the FL-SAR processing. Finally, the results show high potential for radar imaging systems, with FL-sparseMIMO-SAR capabilities, to be employed in the applications of AMRs towards smart factories and warehouses.

AB The image source method was originally developed to estimate sediment sound speed as a function of depth assuming plane-layered sediments. Recently, the technique was extended to treat dipping, i.e., non-parallel layers and was tested using synthetic data. Here, the technique is applied to measured reflection data with dipping layers and mud volcanoes. The data were collected with an autonomous underwater vehicle towing a source (1600-3500Hz) and a horizontal array of hydrophones. Data were collected every 3 m criss-crossing an area about 1 km(2). The results provide a combination of two-dimensional sections of the sediment sound-speeds plotted in a three-dimensional picture. (C) 2016 Acoustical Society of America

AB Advancements in self-driving car technology have the potential to revolutionize transportation by enhancing safety, efficiency, and accessibility. Nonetheless, the successful integration of autonomous vehicles into our urban landscapes necessitates robust and reliable pedestrian detection and tracking systems. As we frequently observe pedestrians moving together, tracking them as a group becomes a beneficial approach, mitigating occlusion and enhancing both the accuracy and speed of object detection and tracking. However, utilizing a human-view camera in an autonomous vehicle presents challenges as pedestrians occupy varied fields of view. In some instances, pedestrians closer to the camera may overlap with those farther away, as seen from the camera's viewpoint, which causes the mis-groupings to happen. To address these challenges, we proposed a strategy to divide the image into distinct zones and perform grouping within each, significantly minimizing mis-groupings. First, an object detection method extracted pedestrians and their bounding boxes from an image. Second, zone detection was applied to separate the image into several zones. Third, clustering methods were applied to detect pedestrian groups within each zone. Last, the object tracking method was utilized to track pedestrian groups. We repeated the process over a ten-frame sequence to achieve better performance, with object detection executed in the first frame and object tracking in the remaining nine frames. The comparison of processing times of different group detection methods indicated that tracking pedestrian groups is more time-efficient than tracking individuals and achieved a 4.5% to 14.1% improvement. Furthermore, according to the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) evaluation metric, our proposed zone-based group detection method outperforms the other commonly used approaches by achieving scores of 0.635 on the MOT17 dataset and 0.781 on the KITTI dataset. In addition, the proposed approach surpasses the other approaches in addressing scenarios where individuals from different fields of view intersect with each other.

ID REPRESENTATIONS
AB Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have presented amazing performance in the task of semantic segmentation. However, the network model is complex, the training time is prolonged, the semantic segmentation accuracy is not high and the real-time performance is not good, so it is difficult to be directly used in the semantic segmentation of road environment images of autonomous vehicles. As one of the three models of deep learning, the auto-encoder (AE) has powerful data learning and feature extracting capabilities from the raw data itself. In this study, the network architecture of auto-encoder and convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) is improved, supervised learning auto-encoder and improved convolutional auto-encoder are proposed, and a hybrid convolutional auto-encoder model is constructed by combining them. It can extract low-dimensional abstract features of road environment images by using convolution layers and pooling layers in front of the network, and then supervised learning auto-encoder are used to enhance and express semantic segmentation features, and finally de-convolution layers and un-pooling layers are used to generate semantic segmentation results. The hybrid convolutional auto-encoder model proposed in this paper not only contains encoding and decoding parts which are used in the common semantic segmentation models, but also adds semantic feature enhancing and representing parts, so that the network which has fewer convolutional and pooling layers can still achieve better semantic segmentation effects. Compared to the semantic segmentation based on convolutional neural networks, the hybrid convolutional auto -encoder has fewer network layers, fewer network parameters, and simpler network training. We evaluated our proposed method on Camvid and Cityscapes, which are standard benchmarks for semantic segmentation, and it proved to have a better semantic segmentation effect and good real-time performance.

AB The Arctic region is greatly affected by climate change, with evident alterations in both physical and biological processes: temperatures are changing at a rate that is twice the global average and phytoplankton productivity is directly affected by ice melting. Continuous monitoring of this ecosystem is fundamental to gain greater understanding of the impact of changes on the natural environment, but the Global Ocean Observing System only provides partial coverage in these extreme areas, which are particularly difficult to reach. Technological progress in oceanographic measurement capabilities is indispensable for the implementation of marine observatories, especially in these remote regions. In recent years, autonomous systems and cost-effective technologies have proved to be valuable for increasing spatial and temporal coverage of data. This is the case with the innovative ArLoC (Arctic Low-Cost) probe, which was designed and developed for easy integration into various types of platforms, enabling continuous measurement of temperature, pressure and fluorescence of chlorophylla. This work reports on the results of two scientific campaigns carried out in Kongsfjorden (Svalbard Islands) in 2018 in the framework of the UVASS (Unmanned Vehicles for Autonomous Sensing and Sampling) research project. The ArLoC probe was integrated onboard the PROTEUS (Portable RObotic TEchnology for Unmanned Surveys) unmanned semi-submersible vehicle and this allowed us to collect important data in the stretches of sea near tidewater glacier fronts. The acquired data showed several significant effects of glacier melting such as: high temperature and salinity gradients, which cause considerable variations in water mass stratification, and an increase in turbidity and the chlorophyllaconcentration, which directly affects primary productivity and the trophic chain. During the surveys, ArLoC proved to be an easy-to-integrate, very reliable instrument, which permitted high spatial resolution investigation of ecological processes during glacier melting as never studied before.

TI Seabed corrugations beneath an Antarctic ice shelf revealed by

   history of Pine Island Glacier

AB Ice shelves are critical features in the debate about West Antarctic ice sheet change and sea level rise, both because they limit ice discharge and because they are sensitive to change in the surrounding ocean. The Pine Island Glacier ice shelf has been thinning rapidly since at least the early 1990s, which has caused its trunk to accelerate and retreat. Although the ice shelf front has remained stable for the past six decades, past periods of ice shelf collapse have been inferred from relict seabed corrugations (corrugated ridges), preserved 340km from the glacier in Pine Island Trough. Here we present high-resolution bathymetry gathered by an autonomous underwater vehicle operating beneath an Antarctic ice shelf, which provides evidence of long-term change in Pine Island Glacier. Corrugations and ploughmarks on a sub-ice shelf ridge that was a former grounding line closely resemble those observed offshore, interpreted previously as the result of iceberg grounding. The same interpretation here would indicate a significantly reduced ice shelf extent within the last 11kyr, implying Holocene glacier retreat beyond present limits, or a past tidewater glacier regime different from today. The alternative, that corrugations were not formed in open water, would question ice shelf collapse events interpreted from the geological record, revealing detail of another bed-shaping process occurring at glacier margins. We assess hypotheses for corrugation formation and suggest periodic grounding of ice shelf keels during glacier unpinning as a viable origin. This interpretation requires neither loss of the ice shelf nor glacier retreat and is consistent with a stable grounding-line configuration throughout the Holocene.

AB Using the DNA origami technique, we constructed a DNA nanodevice functionalized with small interfering RNA (siRNA) within its inner cavity and the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX), intercalated in the DNA duplexes. The incorporation of disulfide bonds allows the triggered mechanical opening and release of siRNA in response to intracellular glutathione (GSH) in tumors to knockdown genes key to cancer progression. Combining RNA interference and chemotherapy, the nanodevice induced potent cytotoxicity and tumor growth inhibition, without observable systematic toxicity. Given its autonomous behavior, exceptional designability, potent antitumor activity and marked biocompatibility, this DNA nanodevice represents a promising strategy for precise drug design for cancer therapy.

AB The results of an experiment conducted in September 2017 are considered with regard to the applicability of the acoustic "mudslide" effect for positioning autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) operating substantially deeper than the axis of the deep sound channel (DSC). The results of the experimental study and numerical analysis of the effect of focusing acoustic energy in the bottom layer on the Sea of Japan shelf and transitional zone with the deep water (up to 500 m deep) for summer-autumn hydrological conditions are presented. Mathematical modeling of the propagation of acoustic waves in a waveguide reproducing the experimental conditions using the parabolic equation method has been performed. The effective propagation velocities of the signal are explained in terms of the modal-analysis method.

AB Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) is bursting in many fields, including critical ones, giving rise to reliable AI that means ensuring safety of autonomous decisions. As the false negatives may have a safety impact (e.g., in a mobility scenario, prediction of no collision, but collision in reality), the aim is to push them as close to zero as possible, thus designing "safety regions" in the feature space with statistical zero error. We show here how sensitivity analysis of an explainable AI model drives such statistical assurance. We test and compare the proposed algorithms on two different datasets (physical fatigue and vehicle platooning) and achieve quite different conclusions in terms of achievable performance that strongly depend on the level of noise in the dataset rather than on the algorithms at hand.

AB Wide-area monitoring applications of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) connected wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of sensor nodes (SNs) with limited hardware and energy sources. The distributed nature of such a network and the difficulty of remote access make it more demanding to design an energy-efficient WSN. Moreover, long-range and low-power wireless connectivity is a challenge in IoT-connected applications. Present WSN topologies deal mainly with fixed SNs, SN distribution, and fixed data sink (DS). The majority of the control layer is implemented in the lower hierarchical layer or in a virtual middle layer, which reduces the network lifetime due to excessive processing and data transmission activities. This article proposes a real-time lightweight dynamic clustering algorithm (LDCA) for a WSN that supports the following two scenarios with limited processing resources: 1) with mobile DSs and static SNs (such as DS and SNs mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous vehicles) and 2) with mobile SNs and static DSs (such as livestock monitoring or autonomous robots in smart farming, and urban monitoring). The proposed algorithm is based on the received signal strength indicator and signal-to-noise ratio of a long-range (LoRa) interface and its residual energy. Mathematical models were derived for real-time clustering using LoRa. Memory requirement and clustering efficiency of the constrained SN and DS for various mobility scenario were evaluated. The proposed LDCA reduces the energy requirement to 33% compared to static clustering, by reducing the number of concurrent clusters and hops. In addition, a hardware-based approach was used to validate the LDCA algorithm, and evaluate its performance in terms of energy efficiency, packet delivery rate, and network lifetime.

AB This paper aims to answer the research question as to optimal design of decision-making processes for autonomous vehicles (AVs), including dynamical selection of driving velocity and route choices on a transportation network. Dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) has been widely used to model travelers' route choice or/and departure-time choice and predict dynamic traffic flow evolution in the short term. However, the existing DTA models do not explicitly describe one's selection of driving velocity on a road link. Driving velocity choice may not be crucial for modeling the movement of human drivers but it is a must-have control to maneuver AVs. In this paper, we aim to develop a game-theoretic model to solve for AVs' optimal driving strategies of velocity control in the interior of a road link and route choice at a junction node. To this end, we will first reinterpret the DTA problem as an N-car differential game and show that this game can be tackled with a general mean field game-theoretic framework. The developed mean field game is challenging to solve because of the forward and backward structure for velocity control and the complementarity conditions for route choice. An efficient algorithm is developed to address these challenges. The model and the algorithm are illustrated on the Braess network and the OW network with a single destination. On the Braess network, we first compare the LWR based DTA model with the proposed game and find that the driving and routing control navigates AVs with overall lower costs. We then compare the total travel cost without and with the middle link and find that the Braess paradox may still arise under certain conditions. We also test our proposed model and solution algorithm on the OW network.

AB Current research on autonomous vehicles tends to focus on making them safer through policies to manage innovation, and integration into existing urban and mobility systems. This article takes social, cultural and philosophical approaches instead, critically appraising how human subjectivity, and human-machine relations, are shifting and changing through the application of big data and algorithmic techniques to the automation of driving. 20th century approaches to safety engineering and automation-be it in an airplane or automobile-have sought to either erase the human because she is error-prone and inefficient; have design compensate for the limits of the human; or at least mould human into machine through an assessment of the complementary competencies of each. The 'irony of automation' is an observation of the tensions emerging therein; for example, that the computationally superior and efficient machine actually needs human operators to ensure that it is working effectively; and that the human is inevitably held accountable for errors, even if the machine is more efficient or accurate. With the emergence of the autonomous vehicle (AV) as simultaneously AI/ 'robot', and automobile, and distributed, big data infrastructural platform, these beliefs about human and machine are dissolving into what I refer to as the ironies of autonomy. For example, recent AV crashes suggest that human operators cannot intervene in the statistical operations underlying automated decision-making in machine learning, but are expected to. And that while AVs promise 'freedom', human time, work, and bodies are threaded into, and surveilled by, data infrastructures, and re-shaped by its information flows. The shift that occurs is that human subjectivity has socio-economic and legal implications and is not about fixed attributes of human and machine fitting into each other. Drawing on Postphenomenological concepts of embodiment and instrumentation, and excerpts from fieldwork, this article argues that the emergence of AVs in society prompts a rethinking of the multiple relationalities that constitute humanity through machines.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB The emerging time-critical Internet-of-Things (IoT) use cases, e.g., augmented reality, virtual reality, autonomous vehicle, etc., involve computation-intensive tasks powered by artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Due to the limited computation resource at IoT devices, it is challenging to fulfill the latency and reliability requirements. Offloading computation tasks using mobile-edge computing (MEC) are a promising solution. The service reliability in AI-powered time-critical services can be modeled by the transmission reliability, timeout probability, and inference accuracy. To improve service reliability, the state-of-the-art work emphasizes on transmission reliability and requires error-free transmission. We show that the AI-powered time-critical services can tolerate small image distortion and still remain the inference accuracy. Therefore, to improve service reliability, it is more important to minimize the timeout probability by shortening transmission latency than perfect error-free transmission. Motivated by this insight, we study the feasibility of user datagram protocol (UDP)-based offloading for such services in the MEC system. A prototype is developed and a series of experiments are conducted to understand how image distortion affects inference accuracy. We measure the latency and transmission reliability of transmission control protocol (TCP)-based and UDP-based offloading in real-life environments and evaluate the service reliability both experimentally and numerically. The evaluation results demonstrate that compared with the TCP-based offloading, the UDP-based offloading can improve the normalized service reliability by up to 70% for time-critical services. In addition, we propose an early termination of image reception (ETR) offloading scheme which can further improve the normalized service reliability by up to 10%, compared with the baseline UDP-based scheme.

AB Real-time responses for multiple robots motion planning demand heuristic algorithms. This paper presents a method to evaluate the efficiency of these algorithms in order to compute coordinated trajectories for multiple car-like robots on a segment of a highway. The idea is to compare the results of these algorithms with the optimal result obtained by a proposed mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model. The MILP model considers the main elements of a traffic system, such as topography of lanes, traffic rules and individual capacity of acceleration. Moreover, new indexes for microscopic traffic assessment are proposed a well. Several tests have been carried out to validate both the MILP model and the algorithm used.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have played an important role in recent high-tech local wars. Seizing air control rights with UAVs will undoubtedly be a popular topic in future military development. Autonomous air combat is complex, antagonistic and mutable, and consequently, the decision-making that depends on unmanned systems is extremely challenging with very little research having been conducted on it. An intelligent air combat learning system inspired by the learning mechanisms of the brain is proposed in this paper. In accordance with research on learning, knowledge and memory, we constructed a cognitive mechanism model of the brain. Based on this model and the inferential abilities of humans, a long short-term hierarchical multi-line learning system is established. Then, the bio-inspired architecture and the basic learning principle of the system are clarified. Taking advantage of the conclusions of studies on information theory, the relationship between the knowledge updating cycle and the system learning performance is analysed. The updating cycle length adjustment problem is transformed into an optimization problem optimization problem, and system performance improvement is guaranteed. Experiments show that the system designed in this paper can acquire confrontation abilities through self-learning without prior rules; the parallel universe mechanism can significantly improve the system & x2019;s learning speed when the number of parallels is within 40, and the performance of the system improves gradually and continuously. The system can master actions similar to classical tactical manoeuvres such as the high yo-yo and the barrel-roll-attack without prior knowledge. Compared with the Bayesian inference and moving horizon optimization (BI & x0026;MHO) method, the learning system proposed in this paper is more flexible in situation assessment and in the prediction of opponents & x2019; actions. Although it cannot be deployed quickly, it has a continuous learning ability.

ID MARINE SURFACE VEHICLES
AB At present, marine autonomous surface ships (MASSs) play a huge role in marine shipping, surveying and mapping, safeguarding the rights and interests of marine space, and other maritime tasks. The cooperative operation of a swarm of MASSs can extend the scope of operation of the MASSs, and thus allow them to carry out more complex tasks. Path tracking is an important problem for the control of a swarm of MASSs. In this paper, the control of underactuated MASSs is decoupled, to control the heading and speed, respectively. First of all, in the path tracking, the improved arc LOS guidance law is introduced, and the heading torque controller is designed, so that the MASS can track the reference path efficiently and accurately. Then the single-path guided path tracking without formation of the swarm of MASSs is studied, the reference path of the swarm center tracking is defined, and the heave thrust controller of the swarm of MASSs is designed based on consensus theory, so that the surge velocity of the MASS can tend towards consistentcy, and finally converge to the desired speed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified by two groups of simulation experiments.

The use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has expanded the scope of Computer Vision (CV) and revealed their vulnerability to deliberate adversarial attacks. These attacks involve the careful introduction of perturbations crafted through complex optimization problems. Exploiting vulnerabilities in advanced deep neural network algorithms present security concerns, particularly in practical applications with high stakes like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellite imagery in computer vision. Adversarial attacks, both in digital and physical dimensions, pose a serious threat in the field. This research provides a comprehensive examination of state-of-the-art adversarial attacks specific to aerial imagery using autonomous platforms such as UAVs and satellites. This review covers fundamental concepts, techniques, and the latest advancements, identifying research gaps and suggesting future directions. It aims to deepen researchers' understanding of the challenges and threats related to adversarial attacks on aerial imagery, serving as a valuable resource to guide future research and enhance the security of computer vision systems in aerial environments.

AB Forest regeneration by means of seedlings grown in container nurseries is usually performed manually with the use of the standard dibble bar or the tube dibble. Manual placement of a large number of seedlings in the soil requires a lot of work. Manual removal of the soil cover and digging the soil in spots with a diameter of 0.4 m requires, under average conditions, about 38 man-hours/ha, while planting with a dibble bar requires about 34 man-hours/ha. Addi-tional work time is needed to carry seedlings over an area that is being afforested. At present, forestry does not have automatic planters that would enable the establishment of forest cul-tures. The aim of the paper is to present the concept of an autonomous robot and an innovative technology of performing forest regeneration and afforestation of former agricultural and re-claimed areas. The paper also presents the design solutions of the key working unit, which is a universal, openable dibble, cooperating with a three-toothed shaft to prepare a planting spot. The solution proposed enables continuous operation of the machine, i.e. without the need to stop the base vehicle.

AB To evaluate the performance of autopilots in real scenarios for maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS), this article investigates four autopilots via the experimental study instead of the theoretical analysis and discusses their application capabilities. Free running model tests with four autopilot algorithms were performed using a scale model of a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) carrier in the towing tank at Flanders Hydraulics Research (FHR), and they were tested at different forward speeds and Under Keel Clearances (UKCs) focusing on the autopilot performance in shallow water. Furthermore, an innovative method combining the model evaluation mechanism and the grey relational decision-making theory was proposed to comprehensively evaluate the performance of autopilots. Finally, we discussed the application potential of the autopilots for controlling a surface ship in shallow water and presented shallow water effects on autopilots' performance. The four autopilots presented in this research could successfully follow the desired trajectories with satisfactory control effects in shallow water, but their performance varied in different scenarios. Our results indicate the tested controllers can be applied in the towing tank, but for optimum selection of autopilot algorithms, we should take into consideration multiple factors including controller parameters, trajectory, and test condition, etc.

AB The application of ridesharing strategy to autonomous taxi system holds great promise for improving the efficiency in the future on-demand ride-hailing services. Prior to the implementation of dispatching strategies to the autonomous taxi system, it is necessary to gain insight into the performance of the dispatching strategies. This study aims to solve the dynamic ridesharing problem and conduct a comprehensive quantity analysis of the ridesharing efficiency for various demand levels and carrying capacities in a metropolitan area. We quantify the success rate of serviced requests, the trip travel time, the discount rate of taxi fare, and total energy consumption for different carrying capacities and demand levels in the road network of Shenzhen city. The simulation results show that the ride-matching success rate within 3 minutes enables to increase by more than 13% in the ridesharing mode, and over 80% of the passengers can be served within 6 minutes if the carrying capacity is set to four. The trip travel time and energy consumption also show a significant downward trend as the capacity of the taxi increases in the ridesharing mode.

ID IMAGE
AB Camera-equipped unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or "drones," are a recent addition to standard audiovisual shooting technologies. As drone cinematography is expected to further revolutionize media production, this paper presents an overview of the state-of-the-art in this area, along with a brief review of current commercial UAV technologies and legal restrictions on their deployment. A novel taxonomy of UAV cinematography visual building blocks, in the context of filming outdoor events where targets (e.g., athletes) must be actively followed, is additionally proposed. Such a taxonomy is necessary for progress in intelligent/autonomous UAV shooting, which has the potential of addressing current technology challenges. Subsequently, the concepts and advantages inherent in multiple-UAV cinematography are introduced. The core of multiple-UAV cinematography consists in identifying different combinations of multiple single-UAV camera motion types, assembled in meaningful sequences. Finally, based on the defined UAV/camera motion types, tools for managing a partially autonomous, multiple-UAV fleet from the director's point of view are presented. Although the overall focus is on cinematic coverage of sports events, the majority of our contributions also apply in different scenarios, such as movies/TV production, newsgathering, or advertising.

AB Goal reasoning has a bright future as a foundation for the research and development of intelligent agents. Goal reasoning is the study of agents that can deliberate on and self-select their objectives, which is a desirable capability for some applications of deliberative autonomy. This capability is of interest to several Al subcommtinities and applications. Our group has focused on how goal reasoning can assist with controlling autonomous systems. The importance of how agents reason about goals is growing and it merits increased attention, particularly from the perspective of research on AI safety. In this article, I introduce goal reasoning, briefly relate it to other Al topics, summarize some of our group's work on goal reasoning foundations and emerging applications, and describe some current and future research directions.

AB This paper concerns an outdoor mobile robot that learns to avoid collisions by observing a human driver operate a vehicle equipped with sensors that continuously produce a map of the local environment. We have implemented steering control that models human behavior in trying to avoid obstacles while trying to follow a desired path. Here we present the formulation for this control system and its independent parameters and then show how these parameters can be automatically estimated by observing a human driver. We also present results from operation on an autonomous robot as well as in simulation, and compare the results from our method to another commonly used learning method. We find that the proposed method generalizes well and is capable of learning from a small number of samples. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This article considers an approach to synthesizing a multilevel system to control movements of a multilink manipulator (MM) mounted on an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) for performing autonomous manipulative operations in the mode of dynamic positioning over various objects on the seafloor. The system is based on an upgraded method that, using point clouds received from the machine vision systems (MVS), provides high-accuracy determination of the shape and location of the work object relative to UUV. The preset trajectories of the MM working tool are overlaid on the identified surface of the object, with possible silting, fouling or deformation of the latter taken into account. To execute the programmed trajectories with the MM working tool, the following methods have been implemented in software: stabilization of UUV in hovering mode near the object, high-precision control of working tool's movements, and also corrections of its trajectory taking into account UUV's displacements relative to the object. The synthesized system has been developed in the C++ programming language. The operation of the system has been numerically simulated using a model of UUV with MM, as well as models of the environment and the target object, in the Matlab/Simulink and V-REP software packages. The results of the study show a high efficiency of the system both in processing sensor information and in providing the dynamic control of movements of an UUV with a MM.

AB We present a general framework Tor the control of Lagrangian systems with as many inputs as degrees of freedom. Relying on the geometry of mechanical systems on manifolds, we propose a design algorithm for the tracking problem. The notions of error function and transport map lead to a proper definition of configuration and velocity error. These are the crucial ingredients in designing a proportional derivative feedback and feedforward controller. The proposed approach includes as special cases a variety of results on control of manipulators, pointing devices and autonomous vehicles. Our design provides particular insight into both aerospace and underwater applications where the configuration manifold is a Lie group. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB It is only a matter of time until autonomous vehicles become ubiquitous; however, human driving supervision will remain a necessity for decades. To assess the drive's ability to take control over the vehicle in critical scenarios, driver distractions can be monitored using wearable sensors or sensors that are embedded in the vehicle, such as video cameras. The types of driving distractions that can be sensed with various sensors is an open research question that this study attempts to answer. This study compared data from physiological sensors (palm electrodermal activity (pEDA), heart rate and breathing rate) and visual sensors (eye tracking, pupil diameter, nasal EDA (nEDA), emotional activation and facial action units (AUs)) for the detection of four types of distractions. The dataset was collected in a previous driving simulation study. The statistical tests showed that the most informative feature/modality for detecting driver distraction depends on the type of distraction, with emotional activation and AUs being the most promising. The experimental comparison of seven classical machine learning (ML) and seven end-to-end deep learning (DL) methods, which were evaluated on a separate test set of 10 subjects, showed that when classifying windows into distracted or not distracted, the highest F1-score of 79%; was realized by the extreme gradient boosting (XGB) classifier using 60-second windows of AUs as input. When classifying complete driving sessions, XGB's F1-score was 94%. The best-performing DL model was a spectro-temporal ResNet, which realized an F1-score of 75%; when classifying segments and an F1-score of 87%; when classifying complete driving sessions. Finally, this study identified and discussed problems, such as label jitter, scenario overfitting and unsatisfactory generalization performance, that may adversely affect related ML approaches.

AB A compact solution for the accurate and automated collection of field data in forests has long been anticipated, and tremendous efforts have been made by applying various remote sensing technologies. The employment of advanced techniques, such as the smartphone-based relascope, terrestrial and mobile photogrammetry, and laser scanning, have led to steady progress, thus steering their applications to a practical stage. However, all recent strategies require human operation for data acquisition, either to place the instrument on site (e.g., terrestrial laser scanning, TLS) or to carry the instrument by an operator (e.g., personal laser scanning, PLS), which remained laborious and expensive. In this paper, a new concept of autonomous forest field investigation is proposed, which includes data collection above and inside the forest canopy by integrating an unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV) with autonomous driving. As a first step towards realizing this concept, the feasibility of automated tree-level field measurements from a mini-UAV laser scanning system is evaluated. A "low-cost" Velodyne Puck LITE laser scanner is applied for the test. It is revealed that, with the above canopy flight data, the detection rate was 100% for isolated and dominant trees. The accuracy of direct measurements on the diameter at breast height (DBH) from the point cloud is between 5.5 and 6.8 cm due to the system and the methodological error propagation. The estimation of DBH from point cloud metrics, on the other hand, showed an accuracy of 2.6 cm, which is comparable to the accuracies obtained with terrestrial surveys using mobile laser scanning (MLS), TLS or photogrammetric point clouds. The estimation of basal area, stem volume and biomass of individual trees could be obtained with less than 20% RMSE, which is adequate for field reference measurements at tree level. Such results indicate that the concept of UAV laser scanning-based automated tree-level field reference collection can be feasible, even though the whole topic requires further research.

AB An autonomous surface vehicle instrumented with optical and acoustical sensors was deployed in Kane ohe Bay, HI, U.S.A., to provide high-resolution, in situ observations of coral reef reflectance with minimal human presence. The data represented a wide range in bottom type, water depth, and illumination and supported more thorough investigations of remote sensing methods for identifying and mapping shallow reef features. The in situ data were used to compute spectral bottom reflectance and remote sensing reflectance, R-rs,R-lambda, as a function of water depth and benthic features. The signals were used to distinguish between live coral and uncolonized sediment within the depth range of the measurements (2.5-5 m). In situ R-rs,R-lambda were found to compare well with remotely sensed measurements from an imaging spectrometer, the Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), deployed on an aircraft at high altitude. Cloud cover and in situ sensor orientation were found to have minimal impact on in situ Rrs, suggesting that valid reflectance data may be collected using autonomous surveys even when atmospheric conditions are not favorable for remote sensing operations. The use of reflectance in the red and near infrared portions of the spectrum, expressed as the red edge height, REH lambda, was investigated for detecting live aquatic vegetative biomass, including coral symbionts and turf algae. The REH lambda, signal from live coral was detected in Kane'ohe Bay to a depth of approximately 4 m with in situ measurements. A remote sensing algorithm based on the REH lambda signal was defined and applied to AVIRIS imagery of the entire bay and was found to reveal areas of shallow, dense coral and algal cover. The peak wavelength of REH lambda decreased with increasing water depth, indicating that a more complete examination of the red edge signal may potentially yield a remote sensing approach to simultaneously estimate vegetative biomass and bathymetry in shallow water.

AB Existing transportation infrastructure and traffic control systems face increasing strain as a result of rising demand, resulting in frequent congestion. Expanding infrastructure is not a feasible solution for enhancing the capacity of the road. Hence, Intelligent Transportation Systems are often employed to enhance the Level of Service (LoS). One such approach is Variable Speed Limit (VSL) control. VSL increases the LoS and safety on motorways by optimizing the speed limit according to the traffic conditions. The proliferation of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) presents fresh prospects for improving the operation and measurement of traffic states for the operation of the VSL control system. This paper introduces a method for the detection of multiple congested areas that is used for state estimation for a dynamically positioned VSL control system for urban motorways. The method utilizes Q-Learning (QL) and CAVs as mobile sensors and actuators. The proposed control approach, named Congestion Detection QL Dynamic Position VSL (CD-QL-DPVSL), dynamically detects all of the congested areas and applies two sets of actions, involving the dynamic positioning of speed limit zones and imposed speed limits for all detected congested areas simultaneously. The proposed CD-QL-DPVSL control approach underwent an evaluation across six distinct traffic scenarios, encompassing CAV penetration rates spanning from 10% to 100% and demonstrated a significantly better performance compared to other control approaches, including no control, rule-based VSL, two Speed-Transition-Matrices-based QL-VSL configurations with fixed speed limit zone positions, and a Speed-Transition-Matrices-based QL-DVSL with a dynamic speed limit zone position. It achieved enhancements in macroscopic traffic parameters such as the Mean Travel Time and Total Time Spent by adapting its control policy to every simulated scenario.

AB Dynamic network topology can pose important challenges to communication and control protocols in networks of autonomous vehicles. For instance, maintaining connectivity is a key challenge in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. However, tracking and computational resources of the observer module might not be sufficient for constant monitoring of all surrounding nodes in large-scale networks. In this article, we propose an optimal measurement policy for network topology monitoring under constrained resources. To this end, We formulate the localization of multiple objects in terms of linear networked systems and solve it using Kalman filtering with intermittent observation. The proposed policy includes two sequential steps. We first find optimal measurement attempt probabilities for each target using numerical optimization methods to assign the limited number of resources among targets. The optimal resource allocation follows a waterfall-like solution to assign more resources to targets with lower measurement success probability. This provides a $\text{10}\%$ to $\text{60}\%$ gain in prediction accuracy. The second step is finding optimal on-off patterns for measurement attempts for each target over time. We show that a regular measurement pattern that evenly distributed resources over time outperforms the two extreme cases of using all measurement resources either in the beginning or at the end of the measurement cycle. Our proof is based on characterizing the fixed-point solution of the error covariance matrix for regular patterns. Extensive simulation results confirm the optimality of the most alternating pattern with up to 10-fold prediction improvement for different scenarios. These two guidelines define a general policy for target tracking under constrained resources with applications to network topology prediction of autonomous systems.

AB The Lucia Chica channel system is an avulsion belt with four adjacent channels that progressively avulsed to the north-east from a single, upslope feeder channel. Avulsion occurred from underfilled channels, leaving open channels that were reactivated by flows stripped from younger, adjacent channels. Differences in relief (height from channel thalweg to levee crest), sinuosity and levee stratigraphy between adjacent channels correspond to relative channel age, and indicate a change in channel morphology and architecture with time. Potential triggers for the change over time include differences in gradient, flow behaviour and characteristics, and channel evolution. Gradient does not appear to be a major control on channel formation and avulsion because adjacent channels formed on the same gradient. Based on available ultra-high-resolution remote imaging obtained with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle, differences in adjacent channel morphology are interpreted to be primarily a result of differences in channel maturity. The interpreted sequence of channel maturity involves erosional channel inception through scouring and incipient channels (defined by linear trains of scours) prior to development of continuous thalwegs. Channel narrowing, formation and growth of levees, increasing channel relief and development of sinuosity occurred as channels evolved. The evolutionary sequence interpreted from the high-resolution Lucia Chica dataset provides a unique perspective on intrinsic controls of architecture for single channel elements. In addition to helping bridge the gap between outcrop and industry-standard reflection-seismic data resolutions and scopes, interpretations in this study also expose potential problems with hierarchical classifications in three-dimensional imaging of distributary systems, and provide potentially important analogues for evolutionary morphologies not resolved in other deep-water channel systems.

AB Uncertainty in dynamic environment increases complexity and difficulty in obstacle avoidance of robots. An avoidance method with dynamic obstacle avoidance risk region in a dynamic environment is proposed in this study. First, using the state estimation of the extended kalman filter, a dynamic obstacle avoidance risk region is constructed along the direction of the obstacle movement. Second, the robot's safe obstacle avoidance operation against dynamic obstacles combined with nonlinear model predictive control is realized. Finally, a series of experiments are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results showed that the robot can easily control its movement and a flat obstacle avoidance trajectory is obtained via the proposed method.

AB A 42-year-old woman has been in a motor vehicle accident in which her seat belt tightened. She has upper abdominal pain and is evaluated with computed tomography (CT). This imaging shows no evidence of intraabdominal trauma but reveals a well-circumscribed and homogeneous left adrenal mass that is 3.2 cm in diameter. The mass has an attenuation value of 7 Hounsfield units on unenhanced CT. The patient's history is remarkable for obesity and newly diagnosed mild hypertension. On physical examination, the blood pressure is 142/90 mm Hg. There is sternal and upper abdominal bruising but no striae, moon facies, or fat accumulation over the dorsocervical spine ("buffalo hump"). How should this patient be further evaluated and treated?

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) collaboration has become the main means of indoor and outdoor regional search, railway patrol, and other tasks, and navigation planning is one of the key, albeit difficult, technologies. The purpose of UAV navigation planning is to plan reasonable trajectories for UAVs to avoid obstacles and reach the task area. Essentially, it is a complex optimization problem that requires the use of navigation planning algorithms to search for path-point solutions that meet the requirements under the guide of objective functions and constraints. At present, there are autonomous navigation modes of UAVs relying on airborne sensors and navigation control modes of UAVs relying on ground control stations (GCSs). However, due to the limitation of airborne processor computing power, and background command and control communication delay, a navigation planning method that takes into account accuracy and timeliness is needed. First, the navigation planning architecture of UAVs of end-cloud collaboration was designed. Then, the background cloud navigation planning algorithm of UAVs was designed based on the improved particle swarm optimization (PSO). Next, the navigation control algorithm of the UAV terminals was designed based on the multi-objective hybrid swarm intelligent optimization algorithm. Finally, the computer simulation and actual indoor-environment flight test based on small rotor UAVs were designed and conducted. The results showed that the proposed method is correct and feasible, and can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of navigation planning of UAVs.

ID LARGE INTELLIGENT SURFACES; OPTIMIZATION
AB To boost the performance of wireless communication networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) aided communications have drawn dramatically attention due to their flexibility in establishing the line of sight (LoS) communications. However, with the blockage in the complex urban environment, and due to the movement of UAVs and mobile users, the directional paths can be occasionally blocked by trees and high-rise buildings. Intelligent reflection surfaces (IRSs) that can reflect signals to generate virtual LoS paths are capable of providing stable communications and serving wider coverage. This is the first paper that exploits a three-dimensional geometry dynamic channel model in IRS- assisted UAV-enabled communication system. Moreover, we develop a novel deep learning based channel tracking algorithm consisting of two modules: channel pre-estimation and channel tracking. A deep neural network with off-line training is designed for denoising in the pre-estimation module. Moreover, for channel tracking, a stacked bi-directional long short term memory (Stacked Bi-LSTM) is developed based on a framework that can trace back historical time sequence together with bidirectional structure over multiple stacked layers. Simulations have shown that the proposed channel tracking algorithm requires fewer epochs to convergence compared to benchmark algorithms. It also demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is superior to different benchmarks with small pilot overheads and comparable computation complexity.

AB COVID-19 pandemic may positively impact the transportation sector's use of automated vehicles (AVs) and hasten AV adoption in areas such as contactless delivery. However, resistance or negative attitudes toward AVs and fear over safety creates unknowns about whether people are willing to adopt driverless AVs if available in similar pandemics. Two vignette-based studies (N = 1087) found that the pandemic can lead Chinese participants to be more willing to use driverless Robotaxis and exhibit more positive responses to Robotaxis than traditional, manned taxis. In Study 1, their preference for a Robotaxi was greater in the pandemic than in the normal condition. They also preferred the Robotaxi over the manned taxi in the pandemic when we manipulated the Robotaxi to be merely as safe as or superior to the manned taxi. Study 2 compared the Robotaxi and manned taxis with equal safety in both conditions. Participants expressed greater negative affect (fear and anxiety) and lower willingness to ride in a Robotaxi in the normal condition. However, in the pandemic condition, they expressed lower negative affect and greater willingness to ride in the Robotaxi. Trust in Robotaxi was lower than in the manned taxi in the normal condition, whereas there was no difference in trust in both taxis in the pandemic. There was no difference in risk acceptance across the two conditions. Our research provides unique and empirical evidence for supporting the adoption of AVs in similar situations and calls on policy support to develop and deploy AVs to meet the consumer need for driverless mobility services in these situations.

AB This study aimed to propose a gantry virtual track train (G-VTT) architecture and investigate the path-tracking control of it. Based on the decoupling control theory, the concept and judgment criterion of the path-tracking independence of the G-VTT was proposed to provide a method to analyzing the compatibility between motion control and mechanical architecture, and instructing the design of the architecture of the G-VTT that could realize autonomous path-tracking with simple control strategy. The controllability and observability of the path-tracking control system were discussed from the perspective of vehicle kinematics and the decouplibility of each tracking point's lateral motion and the path-tracking independence of the vehicle was proved. The distributed virtual driving (DVD) model based on self-adaptive preview PID algorithm was proposed to achieve independent path-tracking of each axle. This model consists of two parts: forward preview model based on the fractional calculus theory simulating the driver's visual field and the parameter self-tuning PID controller based on variable universe fuzzy control theory (VUF-PID controller). The effectiveness and adaptability of the DVD model were verified by co-simulation test. The results show that the VUF-PID controller has an excellent control performance and could realize the self-tuning of PID parameters effectively and could adapt to the noticeable hysteresis effect with the forward preview model introduced. Moreover, the VUF-PID controller could significantly improve the curve-passing stability of the G-VTT, and exhibits excellent adaptability to the traveling speed, curve radius, and vehicle payload. Even when the train travels under an adverse operating condition with lateral acceleration about 3.2m/s(2), the maximum tracking error could still be kept below +/- 0.02 m.

AB Effective networking over wireless media has become extremely essential today as communication between massive Internet of things (IoT) devices is on an increase, thereby leading to a limited spectrum resource for utilisation. Specifically, for healthcare infrastructure in a remote or critical situation, providing uninterrupted communication between the macro base station and IoT devices or user nodes is imperative. However, owing to their limited spectral capacity, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-based networks can provide an efficient solution and utilise both licensed and unlicensed bands for communication among users or devices. In this paper, our focus is on cache-enabled cognitive networking for secondary users (SUs) that accredits precise communication delivery for critical healthcare systems that are performed by the cognitive UAV (CUAV). In addition, we develop a caching strategy wherein a CUAV is capable of caching relevant information from high-power (HP) and moderate-power (MP) devices in its local and cloud storage by applying a non-orthogonal multiple-access method. In the downlink scenario, the CUAV proactively transmits the requested HP and MP information to the designated SUs considering this entire model over two states, namely effectual state and interference state, which we can realise by any presence or absence of interference. To maximise this system's energy efficiency, we formulate an optimisation problem to minimise the transmission power and satisfy the target performance in terms of throughput for SUs. We solve the optimisation issue using the Lagrangian approach and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. In all simulations, the energy efficiency during the effectual state renders an average performance of approximately 400% better than that of the interference state.

AB This paper presents an overview of recent advances in the field of the vehicle routing problem (VRP), based on papers published in high-quality journals during the period from January 2015 to July 2017. A distinctive feature of the presented survey is its focus on new versions of the VRP, which have recently emerged or gained momentum, and the corresponding new solution methods, with particular emphasis on computational intelligence (CI) approaches. The list of newly proposed or currently popular VRP formulations include last mile and same day delivery, crowdshipping, bike sharing systems, post-disaster response plans, local routing in large production or cargo plants, customer-centric VRP, autonomous delivery, unnamed aerial vehicle delivery, green VRP, waste collection VRP, rich VRP, or VRP with backhauls. Simultaneously, an adequate increase of interest in the application of traditional CI methods (e.g., genetic, memetic, ant colony or particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, or their various hybrid versions) can be observed in the VRP domain. At the same time, approaches proven efficient in other optimization areas (e.g., hyperheuristics, methods based on Monte Carlo simulations, algorithms rooted in game theory and bi-level optimization-Stackelberg games,or cognitively motivated methods) have lately entered the VRP field and become a viable alternative to more traditional techniques. Since VRP is one of the fastest growing fields in the operations research area, we believe that an analysis of the recently published VRP papers from the perspective of their novelty in problem formulation and/or applied solution method can provide a true value for the CI community, especially young researchers entering the field and seeking challenges in this interesting and fast developing research area.

AB Mounting compact and lightweight base stations on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a cost-effective and flexible solution to provide seamless coverage on the existing terrestrial networks. While the coverage probability in UAV-assisted cellular networks has been widely investigated, it provides only the first-order statistic of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). In this paper, to analyze high-order statistics of SINR and characterize the disparity among individual links, we provide a meta distribution (MD)-based analytical framework for UAV-assisted cellular networks, in which the probabilistic line-of-sight channel and realistic antenna pattern are taken into account for air-to-ground transmissions. To accurately characterize the interference from UAVs, we relax the widely applied uniform off-boresight angle (OBA) assumption and derive the exact distribution of OBA. Using stochastic geometry, for both steerable and vertical antenna scenarios, we obtain mathematical expressions for the moments of condition success probability, the SINR MD, and the mean local delay. Moreover, we study the asymptotic behavior of the moments as network density approaches infinity. Numerical results validate the tightness of the theoretical results and show that the uniform OBA assumption underestimates the network performance, especially in the regime of moderate altitude of UAV. We also show that when UAVs are equipped with steerable antennas, the network coverage and user fairness can be optimized simultaneously by carefully adjusting the UAV parameters.

AB The Angle-of-Arrival (AoA)-based approach is an appealing solution for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) positioning, and has received significant interest recently. In this article, we propose a novel framework for UAV three-dimensional (3-D) positioning, the core of which is to measure the two-dimensional (2-D) Angle-of-Departure (2D-AoD) and 2D-AoA via a bistatic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar. Unlike the existing positioning architectures, the MIMO radar is equipped with polarized array antennas. An estimator based on the parallel factor (PARAFAC) decomposition is developed. It first obtains the direction matrices via performing the PARAFAC decomposition of the array data. Thereafter, the rotational invariance characteristic is utilized to form a normalized polarization response vector, from which the 2D-AoD, 2D-AoA, and polarization status of the UAVs are achieved via incorporating the vector cross-product method and the least squares (LSs) technique. Finally, the 3-D positions of the UAVs are easily calculated via the location relationship between the 2D-AoD, 2D-AoA, and the coordinates of transmitting/receiving (Tx/Rx) array. The proposed framework is computationally friendly, and is capable of positioning anonymous UAV. Moreover, it is insensitive to the geometry of the Tx/Rx array, indicating that the proposed framework supports configurable Tx/Rx antennas. Simulation results are provided to verify our theoretical advantages.

AB The role of road markings is fundamental for traffic safety, as it represents an essential optical driving instrument both for effective drivers and autonomous vehicles. This research aims to evaluate the effects of the decay of road marking visibility along curves, specifically the variability in lateral acceleration. Traditionally, issues related to the correct interpretation of a road alignment were studied by means of trajectory analyses. However, they involved information about the vehicle's geometrical position without any indication on dynamics. To explore this aspect further, an experiment in a simulated environment involving 21 drivers was performed. They drove along a test road in a standardized scenario considering only three variables: the curve direction (right or left), the deviation angle (70 degrees or 30 degrees), and the road marking visibility percentage (100%, 50%, 10%, and 0%). The results, in differences between theoretical (depending on design speed and curve radius) and effective lateral accelerations, provide further evidence of the strategic role of the markings. However, when markings deteriorate, drivers activate some balancing mechanisms to mitigate the dynamic effects along curves and, in turn, to improve comfort and safety. The proposed procedure is not only of direct practical interest, but it is also fully generalizable to other contexts and issues, involving several other elements that may influence the phenomenon, such as road geometry, visibility conditions, and traffic flow speed.

AB Emerging cellular-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) communication poses both opportunities and challenges to the current research of UAV applications. On the one hand, the advanced cellular technologies and authentication mechanisms make significant performance improvements of reliability, security, coverage, and throughput of UAVs possible. On the other hand, the considerably dynamic characteristics of the new aerial users bring some complicated and open issues to the future heterogeneous network. To throw some light on this field, the authors study the joint power allocation and channel reuse problem of uplink transmission in a cellular-enabled UAVs network with full consideration of the rapid channel variations resulting from high mobility of UAVs. Given the diverse requirements of terrestrial cellular users (CUs) and UAVs, i.e. large capacity for CU links and ultra-reliability for UAV links, they formulate the problem as optimising the uplink capacities of CUs with reliable transmission constraint of UAVs. By decoupling the intricate problem into two sub-problems, a joint resource allocation algorithm is proposed, which relies only on the statistical information of dynamic channels to implement, hence is robust. Finally, numerical results are provided to corroborate the anticipated performances of the proposed scheme.

AB Automated driving systems (ADSs) aim to improve the safety, efficiency and comfort of future vehicles. To achieve this, ADSs use sensors to collect raw data from their environment. This data is then processed by a perception subsystem to create semantic knowledge of the world around the vehicle. State-of-the-art ADSs' perception systems often use deep neural networks for object detection and classification, thanks to their superior performance compared to classical computer vision techniques. However, deep neural network-based perception systems are susceptible to errors, e.g., failing to correctly detect other road users such as pedestrians. For a safety-critical system such as ADS, these errors can result in accidents leading to injury or even death to occupants and road users. Introspection of perception systems in ADS refers to detecting such perception errors to avoid system failures and accidents. Such safety mechanisms are crucial for ensuring the trustworthiness of ADSs. Motivated by the growing importance of the subject in the field of autonomous and automated vehicles, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the techniques that have been proposed in the literature as potential solutions for the introspection of perception errors in ADSs. We classify such techniques based on their main focus, e.g., on object detection, classification and localisation problems. Furthermore, this paper discusses the pros and cons of existing methods while identifying the research gaps and potential future research directions.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which can operate autonomously in dynamic and complex environments, are becoming increasingly common. Deep learning techniques for motion control have recently taken a major qualitative step since vision-based inference tasks can be executed directly on edge. The goal is to fully integrate the machine learning (ML) element into small UAVs. However, given the limited payload capacity and energy available on small UAVs, integrating computing resources sufficient to host ML and vehicle control functions is still challenging. This paper presents a modular and generic system that can control the UAV by evaluating vision-based ML tasks directly inside the resource-constrained UAV. Two different vision-based navigation configurations were tested and demonstrated. The first configuration implements an autonomous landing site detection system, tested with two models based on LeNet-5 and MobileNetV2, respectively. This allows the UAV to change its planned path accordingly and approach the target to land. Moreover, a model for people detection based on a custom MobileNetV2 network was evaluated in the second configuration. Finally, the execution time and power consumption were measured and compared with a cloud computing approach. The results show the ability of the developed system to dynamically react to the environment to provide the necessary maneuver after detecting the target exploiting only the constrained computational resources of the UAV controller. Furthermore, we demonstrated that moving to the edge, instead of using cloud computing inference, decreases the energy requirement of the system without reducing the quality of service.

AB The modern driver-assistance and autonomous technologies in vehicles increase the ease of driving vehicles. The increased vehicle usage increases the requirement of efficient group communication between the vehicles to support the safety as well as the non-safety applications in Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANET). In VANET, multicast communication is mostly preferred for the effective utilization of computational resources and the attainment of the Quality of Service (QoS). To implement an efficient multicast communication, we need to build and retain a multicast tree. Due to the high mobility and rapid topology changes, the formation and maintenance of a multicast tree are challenging in VANET. Existing multicast communication techniques are either centralized or location-based flooding and suffer from tree reconfiguration overhead. In this paper, a novel Distributed Treebased Multicast Routing (DTMR) algorithm is proposed. During the link failure, the connection is switched to a predetermined and highly stable guardian node. Further, the tree fragmentation and the rejoining delay is reduced in VANET using the proposed algorithm, DTMR. From the simulation results, it is evident that the DTMR achieves a significant performance improvement against the existing multicast techniques such as Distributed Time-limited Reliable Broadcast Incremental Power Strategy (DTRBIP) and Energy Efficient Multicast routing protocol based on Software Defined Networks and Fog computing for Vehicular networks (EEMSFV) in terms of delay, packet loss ratio, scalability, and reliability. In terms of end-to-end delay, packet loss rate, and reliability, the DTMR outperforms the existing DTRBIP and EEMSFV protocols. DTMR achieves 94-96% reliability in highway scenarios and 96-99% reliability in urban environments. Further, as a proof of concept, the proposed, DTMR is implemented and analyzed in real-time. It is found that the real-time experimental results are on par with the simulation results. Hence, the proposed DTMR achieves network stability and reliability in real-time.

AB Introduction: Scholarly research on road accidents over the past 50 years has generated substantial literature. We propose a robust search strategy to retrieve and analyze this literature. Method: Analyses was focused on estimating the size of this literature and examining its intellectual anatomy and temporal trends using bibliometric indicators of its articles. Results: The size of the literature is estimated to have exceeded N = 25,000 items as of 2020. At the highest level of aggregation, patterns of term co-occurrence in road accident articles point to the presence of six major divisions: (i) law, legislation & road trauma statistics; (ii) vehicular safety technology; (iii) statistical modelling; (iv) driving simulator experiments of driving behavior; (v) driver style and personality (social psychology); and (vi) vehicle crashworthiness and occupant protection division. Analyses identify the emergence of various research clusters and their progress over time along with their respective influential entities. For example, driver injury severity " and crash frequency show distinct characteristics of trending topics, with research activities in those areas notably intensified since 2015 Also, two developing clusters labelled autonomous vehicle and automated vehicle show distinct signs of becoming emerging streams of road accident literature. Conclusions: By objectively documenting temporal patterns in the development of the field, these analyses could offer new levels of insight into the intellectual composition of this field, its future directions, and knowledge gaps. Practical Applications: The proposed search strategy can be modified to generate specific subsets of this literature and assist future conventional reviews.

AB Introduction: Understanding the shortcomings of child-pedestrians in evaluating traffic situations may contribute to producing intervention techniques that may increase their awareness to potential hazards as well as inform and inspire designers of autonomous vehicle and infrastructure systems to deal with the complications of crossing pedestrians. Method: The present work examined pedestrians' hazard-perception (HP) skills in complex traffic scenes. Two experiments explored how pedestrians' HP abilities vary with age and experience. In the first, adults and youngsters (7-13-year-olds) were presented with pairs of photographs displaying traffic situations and instructed to compare between the hazard levels of the two. Findings revealed a marked trend where experienced-adults tended to rate photographs depicting field of view partially obscured by parked vehicles as more hazardous. Moreover, adults tended to rate photographs depicting vehicles closer to the crossing site as more hazardous. Lastly, adults tended to rate photographs depicting complex configurations like traffic circles, as more hazardous than T-junctions. Results: Findings suggested that youngsters may be highly influenced by cueing. Next, pedestrians' HP was tested using a crossing decision task. Participants observed traffic scenes presented in a dynamic simulated environment of an urban road from a pedestrian's perspective and pressed a response button whenever they assumed it was safe to cross. Compared to experienced-adults and 7-8-year-olds, 9-13-year-olds presented a less decisive performance. Compared to previous findings regarding simpler road crossing configurations, most participants, regardless of age, related more to the approaching vehicles and presence of a pedestrian crossing while refraining from addressing the road configuration. Implications for road-safety are discussed. (C) 2019 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the development of the BI (Business intelligence) applications, robots and robot-based technology appear in various fields. Compact robotic automated parking system will facilitate the informatization and modernization of urban development and environmental protection. Compact robotic automated parking (CRAP) system is a new system with higher storage utilization and rapid response to store and handle cars. This system has double storage rings, instead of one storage ring in old compact automated parking (CAP) system for storing cars in each tier, and each tier is equipped with inner rotating ring and tier-captive automated guided vehicle for horizontal transport. The CRAP system has one elevator with vertical automated guided vehicle in the outer ring instead of the center part in the old CAP system for vertical transport. We first estimate the system performance using queuing network models. Second, we validate the analytical models through simulation and a real case. The simulation results show that we make an accurate estimation. Third, we optimize system configurations by minimizing the car retrieval time. Finally, given the same storage capacity, we compare the car retrieval time based on a real application and footprint area of CRAP system with CAP system. The results show that the car retrieval time can be reduced by at least 29.7% when the system capacity C is 400, and the space utilization can be improved by at least 32.0%.

AB In this study, the authors propose a backstepping-based, distributed formation control method that is stable independent of time delays in communication among multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Centralised formation control of UAVs requires each agent to maintain a separation distance from other agents, which burdens the communication network of the UAVs. To overcome this problem, the authors consider a distributed control scheme wherein each agent updates its attitude and position based on the state information gathered through its neighbours. Instead of directly controlling the thrust generated by the propellers, they partition the mathematical model of the UAV into two subsystems, a linear attitude control loop and a non-linear position control loop. A backstepping-based outer position controller is then designed that interfaces seamlessly with the inner attitude controller of the cascaded control system. The closed-loop stability is established using a rigorous Lyapunov-Krasovskii analysis under the influence of distributed network time delays. Using the directed graph topology and a distributed backstepping structure, it is shown that the stability criterion is delay-independent. The proposed control algorithms are verified in simulation and then implemented in hardware, and actual flight test experiments prove the validity of these algorithms.

AB In order to improvethe yaw angle accuracy of multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle and meet the requirement of autonomous flight, a new calibration and compensation method for magnetometer based on Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is proposed in this paper. A novel mathematical calibration model with clear physical meaning is established. "Hard iron" error and "Soft iron" error of magnetometer which affect the yaw accuracy of unmanned aerial vehicle are compensated. Initially, Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is applied to the process of sphere fitting for the original magnetometer data; the optimal estimation of sphere radius and initial "Hard iron" error are obtained. Then, the ellipsoid fitting is performed, and the optimal estimation of "Hard iron" error and "Soft iron" error are obtained. Finally, the calibration parameters are used to compensate for the magnetometer's output during unmanned aerial vehicle flight. Traditional ellipsoid fitting based on least squares algorithm is taken as reference to prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Semi-physical simulation experiment proves that the proposed magnetometer calibration method significantly enhances the accuracy of magnetometer. Static test shows that the yaw angle error is reduced from 1.2 degrees to 0.4 degrees when using the proposed calibration model to calibrate magnetometers. In dynamic tests, the sensor MTi's output is used as reference. The data fusion of magnetometer compensated by the proposed new calibration model based on Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm can accurately track the desired attitude angle. Experimental results indicate that the accuracy of magnetometer in the yaw angle estimation has been greatly enhanced. In the process of attitude estimated, the compensation magnetometer data given by this new method have faster convergence speed, higher accuracy, and better performance than the compensation magnetometer data given by traditional ellipsoid fitting based on least squares algorithm.

AB Localization is critical for automated vehicles as it provides essential position, velocity, and heading angle information to perform object tracking, trajectory prediction, motion planning, and control. However, model/environmental uncertainties (including road friction) and noises in sensor measurements have a significant effect on the accuracy of the localization and vehicle state estimation, specially for perceptually degraded conditions. In this article, an integrated localization method based on the fusion of an inertial dead reckoning model and 3D LiDAR-based map matching is proposed and experimentally verified in an urban environment with varying environmental conditions. Leveraging a global navigation satellite system (GNSS), inertial navigation system (INS), and 3D LiDAR point clouds, a novel light point cloud map generation method, which only keeps the necessary point clouds (i.e., buildings and roads regardless of vegetation varying with seasonal change), is proposed. Subsequently, based on the onboard sensors and the pre-built light point cloud map, a dead reckoning model is derived and integrated with the normal distribution transformation (NDT) based map matching algorithm by an error-state-constrained Kalman filter to limit the localization error. On top of the Kalman filter, the stability analysis of the estimator is presented. Finally, the performance of the algorithm is validated in real road experiments under various environmental conditions. Thorough experiments in winter and summer and associated results confirm the advantages of integrating the proposed light point cloud map generation with the dead reckoning model in terms of accuracy and reduced computational complexity.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled mobile edge computing (MEC) in IoT systems has recently gained prominence as a solution to accommodate the low latency and high energy efficiency needs of emerging and developing 5G-and-beyond IoT applications. Given the limited spectrum available, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) communication scheme provides a spectral- and power-efficient task offloading means. In this work, a novel framework is proposed for a multiple-UAV-enabled MEC IoT system incorporating uplink NOMA. The goal is to maximize the sum bits offloaded from all the IoT devices (IoTDs) in a finite service period. This is achieved through joint optimization of the associations between the IoTDs and the UAVs, the IoTD transmit powers, as well as the UAV trajectories, given UAV and IoTD energy budgets and quality-of-service (QoS) criteria. Towards that end, a specialized penalty block coordinate descent (P-BCD) algorithm is proposed to decompose the original problem into 4 subproblems that are solved alternately and iteratively. By direct comparison with several benchmark schemes including orthogonal multiple access (OMA), our proposed scheme displays performance enhancement in terms of sum bits offloaded and energy expenditure. Finally, a performance comparison is carried out for the proposed scheme with different number of employed UAVs to find the most cost-effective number of UAVs to deploy.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as suitable platforms for transporting and positioning communications nodes on demand, including Wi-Fi Access Points and cellular Base Stations. This paved the way for the deployment of flying networks capable of temporarily providing wireless connectivity and reinforcing coverage and capacity of existing networks. Several solutions have been proposed for the positioning of UAVs acting as Flying Access Points (FAPs). Yet, the positioning of Flying Communications Relays (FCRs) in charge of forwarding the traffic to/from the Internet has not received equal attention. In addition, state of the art works are focused on optimizing both the flying network performance and the energy-efficiency from the communications point of view, leaving aside a relevant component: the energy spent for the UAV propulsion. We propose the Energy and Performance Aware relay Positioning (EPAP) algorithm. EPAP defines target performance-aware Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) values for the wireless links established between the FCR UAV and the FAPs and, based on that, computes the trajectory to be completed by the FCR UAV so that the energy spent for the UAV propulsion is minimized. EPAP was evaluated in terms of both the flying network performance and the FCR UAV endurance, considering multiple networking scenarios. Simulation results show gains up to 25% in the FCR UAV endurance, while not compromising the Quality of Service offered by the flying network.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB The wake up of power gating (PG) components leads to flow of inrush current which quickly discharges the battery. An arrangement of instruction controlled hybrid battery supercapacitor (SC) elongates battery life in systems with PG. The present work improves a batterysingle SC system (BSC) model to its equivalent batterydual SC system (B2SC). Instructions: disconnect battery (db) and connect battery (cb) have been introduced along with architectural support for B2SC. During wakeup db disconnects (i) battery from the PG components, and (ii) either one or both of the SCs from the battery. Hence, simultaneously either both SCs can discharge or one can discharge while the other's charging. While cb connects the battery to the PG components and SCs. A suboptimal version of B2SC (B2SC(sopt)) is introduced, where the SCs are connected to the PG components requiring higher inrush current while rest remains connected to the battery. The efficacy of the proposed methods are evaluated on cardiac pacemaker, unmanned aerial vehicle and benchmark programmes. B2SC reduces battery ratecapacityeffect (Crate) by an average of 21.87% at the cost of average performance loss of 9.25%. (B2SC(sopt)) reduces Crate by an average of 29.37% at the cost of average performance loss of 16.87%.

AB Increasing number of skyscrapers along with the large number of tall bridges in the urban setting throughout the world also increases the demand of robust and autonomously controlled structural health monitoring (SHM) in order to enhance the reliability of such structures and their surroundings. In this paper, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based autonomous SHM system has been investigated, in which the images of the structural site captured by the UAV were stitched together to form the complete view of the structure. The image-stitching task has been done by using a well-known speeded up robust features (SURF)-based feature detection algorithm. The large number of features resulting from SURF are first reduced with random sample consensus algorithm and then the respective transformations are applied to align the images for final stitching. The comparison between the current and previous view of the structural site provides the structural differences. The proposed approach is tested on a sample structure in a lab with different possible realistic types of defects that are induced in the structure, and the performance of the proposed methodology is compared with the existing approaches. It has been shown that the proposed system can perform image stitching even if the UAV suffers angular displacement due to wind thrusts or calibration issues. The proposed approach has also been applied on a concrete structure, and the displacement detected on the column of the structure's backyard verified the feasibility for real-world SHM.

AB Achieving intelligent rock excavation is an important development direction in underground engineering construction. Currently, some rock-drilling jumbos are able to perform autonomous operations under ideal contour surfaces. However, irregular contour surfaces resulting from factors such as rock characteristics, drilling deviation, and blasting effects present a significant challenge for automated drilling under non-ideal surfaces, which constrains the intelligentization of rock excavation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a method for extracting contour surfaces and planning drilling paths based on a vehicle-mounted 3D scanner. This method effectively extracts contour surfaces and optimizes drilling paths, thereby improving work efficiency and safety. Specifically, the proposed method includes: (i) the real-time scanning of cross-sectional contours using a vehicle-mounted 3D scanner to construct an accurate three-dimensional point-cloud model and obtain contour over-digging information; the acquired data are compared with theoretical drilling maps in the vehicle's coordinate system to re-plan the blasting-hole point set; (ii) the development of a volume-based dynamic search algorithm based on the irregularities of contour surfaces to detect potential collisions between holes; and (iii) the conversion of the drilling sequence planning based on the new blasting hole point set into a traveling salesman problem (TSP), and optimization using a Hybrid Greedy Genetic Algorithm (HGGA) to achieve path traversal of all drilling positions. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified using rock excavation in a certain mine as an example. The results show that the overall recognition rate of the contour over-digging reached over 80%, the number of arm collisions was significantly reduced, and the distance traveled by the drilling rig was reduced by 35% using the improved genetic algorithm-based rock-drilling rig path planning.

AB This paper addresses a learning-based path following control scheme for a biomimetic underwater vehicle (BUV) driven by undulatory fins. A dynamic line-of-sight (DLOS) guidance system is designed, which uses a virtual ball with a dynamic radius to detect the reference path. This DLOS system guides our BUV in the path following control and extracts essential information for the Markov decision process (MDP) of the control task. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, sample-observed soft actor-critic (SOSAC) is proposed. The can train out control policy with greater cumulative reward and higher success rate by using two tricks: sample observation and sample diversification. Based on the DLOS system, the MDP of the control task, and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) trained by the SOSAC, our control scheme is established. Experiments show that our BUV can successfully achieve path following control in an indoor pool environment by using this control scheme.Note to Practitioners-The motivation of this paper is to design a practical end-to-end path following control scheme for the BUV driven by undulatory fins, and verify this scheme in a real-world environment. Unlike common autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) using axial propellers, the BUVs apply biomimetic propellers such as the undulatory fin. Multimodel wave patterns can be implemented by the undulatory fin, which generates nonlinear thrust and lateral force simultaneously. This propulsive feature makes the driving force on different directions of the BUV to be strong coupled, and it is complicated to convert the outputs of a common controller into waveform parameters of the undulatory fins to control the BUV. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed an end-to-end learning-based path following controller, which observes environmental information and directly generates waveform parameters to control our BUV. Experiments suggest that our control scheme is practical and valid.

AB In recent years, substantial technological development has made unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) more versatile, cheaper, and accessible to the public. Alongside many positive effects and use cases, safety concerns are increasing as a plethora of incidents demonstrate the destructive potential of UAVs. To counteract this development and, thus, protect people and critical infrastructure, UAV detection, tracking, and defense has gained more and more research attention. Whereas different drone detection technologies such as RADAR, radio frequency, and acoustic detection are deployed within multispectral systems, optical detection and imaging of approaching objects provide key information to correctly assess the situation. As reaction time is a crucial parameter for successful UAV defense, the operating distance of the optical detection system needs to be improved further. This article presents the analysis, development, and evaluation of a telescope-based UAV detection system. The system consists of a high-precision mount and a telescope equipped with a camera. UAVs are detected in the captured video frames by the deep learning algorithm YOLOv4 using a modified architecture. The proposed system, which uses an f/10 telescope with a focal length of f = 2540 mm and a camera equipped with a 7.3 mm x 4.1 mm sensor, allows a significant increase in the optical detection range to more than 3 km of UAVs down to 0.3 m in diameter under daylight conditions and sufficient contrast, extending the reaction time significantly for counter UAV systems.

AB This study proposes a high-accuracy two-stage trilateration method that enables real-time positioning in global position system (GPS)-denied areas, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under bridges and targets in vegetation or indoors, where automated drone operation is difficult, and there are few localization methods. This method uses ultrawideband (UWB) with high-ranging accuracy and a high transmission rate as the positioning sensor. The drone and the target are equipped with multiple UWBs, and the relative distance is calculated through the signal transmission between the UWB devices so as to determine the position of the target in a fixed coordinate system. In practice, this method uses the UWB anchors on the ground to locate the UAV moving in the air, and the altitude error can be reduced from 8-10 m to less than 1 m. The moving UAV can also be used as the anchor to locate fixed objects on the ground in areas with poor GPS, and the relative position error is reduced from 2.02 to 0.35 m, and the relative altitude error is reduced from 3.39 to 0.32 m. This study alleviates the insufficient accuracy of the trilateration method when the UWB anchors are in the coplanar space, so as to improve the reliability of the positioning and navigation of the UAV in the GPS-denied area.

AB Vehicular cloud computing (VCC) and connected vehicles have prompted the intensive investigation of communication and computing solutions. As an important enabler, software-defined network (SDN) broadly changes the design of vehicle services, from resource allocation to ambitious autonomous cars. However, current VCC architectures face challenges that hinder the vision of providing reliable services to connected vehicles. As a result, deploying VC services using SDN network has emerged as a viable option. Therefore, software-defined VC architecture (SDVC) dynamically manages the control and resource utilization of VC by centralizing the overall knowledge. In addition, SDN stands as the representative technique of virtual resources and network function virtualization (NFV). NFV is integrated into SDVC frameworks to design extended SDVC (ESDVC) for dynamic, adaptive VC maintenance, VC network slicing management, and to meet constraint requirements such as network latency and reliable connectivity. This paper presents and discusses: (1) the architecture scenario of both SDVC and ESDVC; (2) the effective deployment methods enabling NFV and network slicing (NS) frameworks to customize VC frameworks; (3) challenges and future concepts of more VC services based on ESDVC architecture. From this survey, we believe readers would find relevant methods for realigning information dispersed across the SDVC, fifth generation (5G)-based VC, and NS domains and comprehending the relationships between these technologies while encouraging further debate on the fusion of 5G enabling technologies over SDVC to enable VC network slicing.

ID PRESERVING AUTHENTICATION SCHEME
AB The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) self-organizing network is composed of multiple UAVs with autonomous capabilities according to a certain structure and scale, which can quickly and accurately complete complex tasks such as path planning, situational awareness, and information transmission. Due to the openness of the network, the UAV cluster is more vulnerable to passive eavesdropping, active interference, and other attacks, which makes the system face serious security threats. This paper proposes a Blockchain-Based Data Acquisition (BDA) scheme with privacy protection to address the data privacy and identity authentication problems in the UAV-assisted data acquisition scenario. Each UAV cluster has an aggregate unmanned aerial vehicle (AGV) that can batch-verify the acquisition reports within its administrative domain. After successful verification, AGV adds its signcrypted ciphertext to the aggregation and uploads it to the blockchain for storage. There are two chains in the blockchain that store the public key information of registered entities and the aggregated reports, respectively. The security analysis shows that the BDA construction can protect the privacy and authenticity of acquisition data, and effectively resist a malicious key generation center and the public-key substitution attack. It also provides unforgeability to acquisition reports under the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) assumption. The performance analysis demonstrates that compared with other schemes, the proposed BDA construction has lower computational complexity and is more suitable for the UAV cluster network with limited computing power and storage capacity.

AB The satellite-air-ground networks (SAGNs) are experiencing unprecedented deployment for the advantages of global coverage and flexibility. However, the open light-of-sight communication links from satellites to the unmanned aerial vehicles (S2U) in SAGNs are vulnerable to malicious jamming and inadvertent interferences from other communication satellites, challenging the reliability of SAGNs. Despite the great importance, the anti-jamming S2U communication problem in SAGNs has been largely overlooked. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage anti-jamming scheme that embraces the cooperation among the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) within the same group and jointly designs the hovering altitude of UAVs and the beamformers of satellites and cooperative UAVs to combat the malicious jamming and the cross-tier interferences. Specifically, following the proposed scheme, we formulate the problem of maximizing the minimum rate of the UAVs with the presence of the malicious jamming and inadvertent interferences into a nonconvex optimization problem. We then transform the problem into two tractable convex subproblems with feasible point pursuit successive convex approximation (FPP-SCA) method and provide the solutions to configure the hovering altitudes and the beamformers. We also conduct extensive simulations and the results show that the proposed anti-jamming scheme is efficient in terms of the UAVs' capacity and the anti-jamming ability compared with the ones without cooperative UAVs and with fixed cooperators (FixCo).

AB This research aims to develop a farm management emulation tool that enables agrifood producers to effectively introduce advanced digital technologies, like intelligent and autonomous unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), in real-world field operations. To that end, we first provide a critical taxonomy of studies investigating agricultural robotic systems with regard to: (i) the analysis approach, i.e., simulation, emulation, real-world implementation; (ii) farming operations; and (iii) the farming type. Our analysis demonstrates that simulation and emulation modelling have been extensively applied to study advanced agricultural machinery while the majority of the extant research efforts focuses on harvesting/picking/mowing and fertilizing/spraying activities; most studies consider a generic agricultural layout. Thereafter, we developed AgROS, an emulation tool based on the Robot Operating System, which could be used for assessing the efficiency of real-world robot systems in customized fields. The AgROS allows farmers to select their actual field from a map layout, import the landscape of the field, add characteristics of the actual agricultural layout (e.g., trees, static objects), select an agricultural robot from a predefined list of commercial systems, import the selected UGV into the emulation environment, and test the robot's performance in a quasi-real-world environment. AgROS supports farmers in the ex-ante analysis and performance evaluation of robotized precision farming operations while lays the foundations for realizing "digital twins" in agriculture.

AB In this paper, we consider the problem of completely flying over an area just hit by an earthquake with a fleet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to opportunely direct rescue teams. The cooperation between UAVs ensures that the search for possible survivors can be faster and more effective than the solutions currently implemented by civil protection. To study this scenario, we introduce the Cover by Multitrips with Priorities (CMP) problem, which tries to keep into account all the main real-life issues connected to the flight and coordination of the UAVs. We conduct a theoretical study to estimate the best number of UAVs and additional batteries, to give indications to the organization that leads the rescue teams to be able to guarantee rapid and effective rescue. Finally, based on some theoretical considerations, we propose some heuristics that tackle the problem of flying over the whole area with a fleet of UAVs in the shortest possible time. Simulations show that they work efficiently in both the proposed scenarios and provide better performance than previous solutions once they are arranged to work in our scenarios. The main advantages of our approach w.r.t. the current drone-based solutions used by the civil defense are that UAVs do not need drivers so the time of all available rescue workers can be invested in doing something else. In our model, we take into account that some sites (e.g. buildings with a high fire risk or schools and hospitals) have a higher priority and must be inspected first, and the possibility that UAVs can make a decision based on what they detect. Finally, our approach allows UAVs to collaborate so that the same sites will be flown over exactly once in order to speed up the rescue mission.

AB Visual inertial odometry (VIO) is widely used for the state estimation of multicopters, but it may function poorly in environments with few visual features or in overly aggressive flights. In this work, we propose a perception-aware collision avoidance trajectory planner for multicopters, that may be used with any feature-based VIO algorithm. Our approach can fly the vehicle to a goal position at high speed, avoiding obstacles in an unknown stationary environment while achieving good VIO state estimation accuracy. The proposed planner samples a group of minimum jerk trajectories and finds collision-free trajectories among them, which are then evaluated based on their speed to the goal and perception quality. Both the motion blur of features and their locations are considered for the perception quality. Our novel consideration of the motion blur of features enables automatic adaptation of the trajectory's aggressiveness under environments with different light levels. The best trajectory from the evaluation is tracked by the vehicle and is updated in a receding horizon manner when new images are received from the camera. Only generic assumptions about the VIO are made, so that the planner may be used with various existing systems. The proposed method can run in real-time on a small embedded computer on board. We validated the effectiveness of our proposed approach through experiments in both indoor and outdoor environments. Compared to a perception-agnostic planner, the proposed planner kept more features in the camera's view and made the flight less aggressive, making the VIO more accurate. It also reduced VIO failures, which occurred for the perception-agnostic planner but not for the proposed planner. The ability of the proposed planner to fly through dense obstacles was also validated. The experiment video can be found at https://youtu.be/qO3LZIrpwtQ.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; CONTROL BARRIER FUNCTIONS; SYSTEMS; ROADS;

AB We address the problem of optimizing the performance of a dynamic system while satisfying hard safety constraints at all times. Implementing an optimal control solution is limited by the computational cost required to derive it in real time, especially when constraints become active, as well as the need to rely on simple linear dynamics, simple objective functions, and ignoring noise. The recently proposed Control Barrier Function (CBF) method may be used for safety-critical control at the expense of sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we develop a real-time control framework that combines optimal trajectories generated through optimal control with the computationally efficient CBF method providing safety guarantees. We use Hamiltonian analysis to obtain a tractable optimal solution for a linear or linearized system, then employ High Order CBFs (HOCBFs) and Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) to account for constraints with arbitrary relative degrees and to track the optimal state, respectively. We further show how to deal with noise in arbitrary relative degree systems. The proposed framework is then applied to the optimal traffic merging problem for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) where the objective is to jointly minimize the travel time and energy consumption of each CAV subject to speed, acceleration, and speed-dependent safety constraints. In addition, when considering more complex objective functions, nonlinear dynamics and passenger comfort requirements for which analytical optimal control solutions are unavailable, we adapt the HOCBF method to such problems. Simulation examples are included to compare the performance of the proposed framework to optimal solutions (when available) and to a baseline provided by human-driven vehicles with results showing significant improvements in all metrics.

AB With the advances in smart vehicles and fog computing, Fog computing is extended to traditional Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). As a geographically distributed paradigm, Vehicle Fog Service (VFS) overcomes the limitations of VANETs in real-time response and location awareness. It supports a wide range of traffic information services, such as road warnings, congestion control, and autonomous driving. Secure communication between VFS entities is a critical problem in an open network. Meanwhile, most fog nodes are deployed in the public domain and are vulnerable to physical attacks. This paper proposes a secure authentication scheme for VFS to address the above issues. The scheme combines blockchain and physical unclonable function (PUF) to achieve two-way authentication of on-board units (OBU) and road side units (RSU) with the untrusted fog nodes. Our scheme provides conditional anonymity and non-repudiation, offering recourse in case of malicious behavior. Unlike other schemes, the proposed scheme only needs to determine whether the pseudo-identity has a revocation tag instead of scanning the whole certificate revocation list (CLS), significantly reducing the computational overhead. In addition, we use the Real-Or-Random ROR model and formally prove that the proposed scheme is provably secure, and informal security analysis shows that the scheme is robust to various known attacks. Finally, compared with existing schemes, our scheme maintains lower communication and computation costs and provides more security features, which shows that our scheme is more suitable for secure VFS environments.

AB Spectrum sharing, as an approach to significantly improve spectrum efficiency in the era of 6th generation mobile networks (6G), has attracted extensive attention. Radio Environment Map (REM) based low-complexity spectrum sharing is widely studied where the spectrum occupancy measurement (SOM) is vital to construct REM. The SOM in three-dimensional (3D) space is becoming increasingly essential to support the spectrum sharing with space-air-ground integrated network being a great momentum of 6G. In this paper, we analyze the performance of 3D SOM to further study the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency in 3D SOM. We discover that the error of 3D SOM is related with the area of the boundary surfaces of licensed networks, the number of discretized cubes, and the length of the edge of 3D space. Moreover, we design a fast and accurate 3D SOM algorithm that utilizes unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to measure the spectrum occupancy considering the path planning of UAV, which improves the measurement efficiency by requiring less measurement time and flight time of the UAV for satisfactory performance. The theoretical results obtained in this paper reveal the essential dependencies that describe the 3D SOM methodology, and the proposed algorithm is beneficial to improve the efficiency of 3D SOM. It is noted that the theoretical results and algorithm in this paper may provide a guideline for more areas such as spectrum monitoring, spectrum measurement, network measurement, planning, etc.

AB The precise tracking of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in coal mines remains a challenging task that faces strict energy constraints. The existing approaches mainly focus on achieving better accuracy but ignore energy consumption. This article proposes an on-demand precise tracking (OPT) framework based on the fusion of the ultrawideband (UWB) and inertial measurement unit (IMU). The fusion unscented Kalman filter (fusion UKF) is devised for energy-efficient tracking with customized performance. First, OPT provides an adaptive adjustment mechanism of UWB signal transmission to trade off between accuracy and energy consumption for UAV local positioning in coal mines. Second, we propose an on-demand trigger algorithm for UAV remote tracking to determine whether the data are transmitted to the ground server. Especially, the on-demand trigger condition is ameliorated due to the existence of packet drops in complicated coal mines. Finally, extensive simulations in the Gazebo Platform and field experiments utilizing P440 UWB nodes in the indoor and coal mine laboratories have been conducted to verify the feasibility. Results show that OPT is efficient and practical and balances the performance and energy consumption under appropriate parameters. Compared with the existing event-triggered extended Kalman filter (ET-EKF) scheme, the accuracy is improved by 10.3 & x0025;, and the communication rate is contracted by 11.4 & x0025; in the coal mine environment.

AB This paper presents a study in investigating the generational gaps between Millennials and Generation X in terms of their mobility attitudes. A comprehensive analytical framework was proposed in this study and applied to data obtained from an SP survey in the U.S. Four modeling steps were involved, to measure the attitudes, identify generational gaps, recognize potential contributors to the attitudes, and decompose the contributions into Endowment, Coefficient, and Interaction effects. The Endowment effects measure how much of the generational differences can be attributed to socioeconomic and demographic variables, while the Coefficient effects reflect the gap that is due to actual behavioral changes or attitudinal shifts between the generations. The findings of this study confirmed the existence of generational gaps in mobility attitudes and revealed that a dominant portion of the gaps stemmed from the different perspectives between the generational cohorts. This indicates that these attitudinal disparities are likely to persist and remain at significant magnitudes, reflecting the unique views and values of the Millennials. Particularly, the preferences for transit and alternative modes and less reliance on private vehicles among Millennials were more of a reflection of their preferences in lifestyle choices and not so much constrained by their socioeconomic status as the previous generation. This study provides empirical evidence of the generational gaps between Millennials and the previous generation in terms of their mobility preferences. The findings provide valuable inputs for policy development in promoting sustainable transportation and community design.

AB Vehicular networking has become a significant research area due to its specific features and applications such as standardization, efficient traffic management, road safety and infotainment. Vehicles are expected to carry relatively more communication systems, on board computing facilities, storage and increased sensing power. Hence, several technologies have been deployed to maintain and promote Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Recently, a number of solutions were proposed to address the challenges and issues of vehicular networks. Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC) is one of the solutions. VCC is a new hybrid technology that has a remarkable impact on traffic management and road safety by instantly using vehicular resources, such as computing, storage and internet for decision making. This paper presents the state-of-the-art survey of vehicular cloud computing. Moreover, we present a taxonomy for vehicular cloud in which special attention has been devoted to the extensive applications, cloud formations, key management, inter cloud communication systems, and broad aspects of privacy and security issues. Through an extensive review of the literature, we design an architecture for VCC, itemize the properties required in vehicular cloud that support this model. We compare this mechanism with normal Cloud Computing (CC) and discuss open research issues and future directions. By reviewing and analyzing literature, we found that VCC is a technologically feasible and economically viable technological shifting paradigm for converging intelligent vehicular networks towards autonomous traffic, vehicle control and perception systems.

AB In Internet of Underwater Things, data collection is assisted by autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to enhance the reliable transmission. AUV acts as a mobile collector and transmits the collected data to the station via relay nodes. However, the highly mobile nature of AUV needs an adaptive and efficient relay selection scheme for achieving good capacity performance. In this article, we propose a new contextual multiarmed bandit with evolving relay set (CMAB-ERS) learning framework, which successfully addresses crucial issues, including dynamic environment conditions and evolving relay set. To deal with the evolving relay set, CMAB-ERS incorporates collaborative effects into inference as well as learning processes, the new relays will acquire prior knowledge by having experienced nodes sharing observations, reducing the learning time significantly. To overcome the uncertainty of environmental information, we exploit the contextual environment factors to assist relay reward estimation and execute time-sensitive parameter update after every transmit-receive cycle, aiming for minimizing potential loss due to the time-varying channel. Correspondingly, the collaboration-aware online contextual bandit learning (COCBL) algorithm is designed that enables AUV to switch optimal relay adaptively and promises high-capacity transmission. Further, we rigorously prove the convergence of the COCBL algorithm by considering the evolving relay set and give its upper bound on the cumulative regret. Finally, extensive simulation results elucidate the effectiveness of the proposed COCBL.

AB The use of aerial base stations on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a notable solution for providing disaster victims with communication services because they can be quickly deployed immediately after a disaster. In this study, we investigate how a single circling UAV with an aerial base station can be used for collecting uplink information from users on the ground. In this system, users within the coverage area of an aerial base station share the available system bandwidth. Consequently, since a UAV's flying speed is constant, a fairness issue becomes significant among ground users distributed over the service area when their spatial density differs largely from place to place. To solve this fairness issue, we focus on a speed-control technique for the UAV. We begin by formulating the amount of transmitted data from each user equipment (UE) as a function of the communication time, during which the user is within the coverage of the aerial base station, and which depends on the speed of the UAV. The objective function can be defined as a maximization of the minimum amount of data transmitted by each UE. Then, we develop the proposed speed-control technique by analyzing the quantitative relationship between the UAV's flying speed and the amount of data transmitted by each UE. Finally, we use computer simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique.

AB The novel signaling and architectural features of 5G promise a major role in providing accurate, precise, and continuous positioning where satellite-based positioning systems may fail. In the case of time-based trilateration, optimal estimators like extended Kalman filter (EKF) can be used to estimate the position with the aid of time-of-arrival (TOA) and round-trip-time (RTT) measurements. However, the linearization of the measurement model used by EKF may lead to positioning errors. Such errors are further magnified due to the narrow geometrical placement of road-side 5G micro base stations (BSs) and due to the closeness of the vehicle to these BSs, leading to significant positioning errors. In this article, the impact of the 5G geometrical setup on the traditional EKF positioning estimation is analyzed. In addition, we propose a dynamically tuned covariance matrix (DTCM) EKF that is automatically tuned based on the measured ranges to trust less the BSs that would lead to high positioning errors. The performance of the proposed method was tested in Siradel's S_5GChannel simulator that mimics the urban canyons of downtown Toronto. The proposed DTCM-EKF has sustained reliable positioning with sub-meter-level accuracy 90% of the time. The DTCM-EKF has reduced the rms and maximum position error of the EKF by approximately 60% and 67%, respectively.

AB The regular detection of pavement cracks is critical for life and property security. However, existing deep learning-based methods of crack detection face difficulties in terms of data acquisition and defect counting. An automatic intelligent detection and tracking system for pavement cracks is proposed. Our system is formed of a pavement crack generative adversarial network (PCGAN) and a crack detection and tracking network called YOLO-MF. First, PCGAN is used to generate realistic crack images, to address the problem of the small number of available images. Next, YOLO-MF is developed based on an improved YOLO v3 modified by an acceleration algorithm and median flow (MF) algorithm to count the number of cracks. In a counting loop, our improved YOLO v3 detects cracks and the MF algorithm tracks the cracks detected in a video. This improved algorithm achieves the best accuracy of 98.47% and F1 score of 0.958 among other algorithms, and the precision-recall curve was close to the top right. A tiny model was developed and an acceleration algorithm was applied, which improved the detection speed by factors of five and six, respectively. In on-site measurement, three cracks were detected and tracked, and the total count was correct. Finally, the system was embedded in an intelligent device consisting of a calculating module, an automated unmanned aerial vehicle, and other components.

AB Nowadays there is a growing research interest on the possibility of enriching small flying robots with autonomous sensing and online navigation capabilities. This will enable a large number of applications spanning from remote surveillance to logistics, smarter cities and emergency aid in hazardous environments. In this context, an emerging problem is to track unauthorized small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) hiding behind buildings or concealing in large UAV networks. In contrast with current solutions mainly based on static and on-ground radars, this paper proposes the idea of a dynamic radar network of UAVs for real-time and high-accuracy tracking of malicious targets. To this end, we describe a solution for real-time navigation of UAVs to track a dynamic target using heterogeneously sensed information. Such information is shared by the UAVs with their neighbors via multi-hops, allowing tracking the target by a local Bayesian estimator running at each agent. Since not all the paths are equal in terms of information gathering point-of-view, the UAVs plan their own trajectory by minimizing the posterior covariance matrix of the target state under UAV kinematic and anti-collision constraints. Our results show how a dynamic network of radars attains better localization results compared to a fixed configuration and how the on-board sensor technology impacts the accuracy in tracking a target with different radar cross sections, especially in non line-of-sight (NLOS) situations.

AB This article investigates a wirelessly powered mobile edge computing (MEC) framework with the cooperation between an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a center Cloud. In this system, we minimize the waiting delay of user equipments (UEs) under controllable energy consumption for a UAV serving a large area, where the UAV is equipped with an MEC server and an energy transmitter (ET). Thus, it can provide energy and computing services for UEs and transmit intractable tasks to the Cloud for further execution. To make the UAV serve all UEs, we propose the method by using a long and short time slots mixed mechanism, and handle the offloading decision and flying area selection by a mixed strategy with the Stackelberg game architecture during long-time slots, while the resource allocation and trajectory optimization issues are settled within short time slots. Specifically, considering limited battery capacity and severe energy propagation loss of the wireless power transfer (WPT), energy consumption can be controlled through queue optimization in short time slots. We decompose the original nonconvex problem into a series of deterministic optimization subproblems based on the Lyapunov optimization theory. Furthermore, using the Lagrangian duality theory, alternative optimization, and successive convex approximation (SCA) technique, we can obtain the closed-form solutions to the original problem. Performance analysis and simulation results demonstrate the convergence and the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

AB Highly-dynamic (HD) map is an indispensable building block in the future of autonomous driving, allowing for fine-grained environmental awareness, precise localization, and route planning. However, since HD maps include rich, multidimensional information, the volume of HD map data is substantial and cannot be transmitted frequently by several vehicles over vehicular networks in real-time. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a data source selection scheme for effective HD map transmissions in vehicular named data networking (NDN) scenarios. To achieve our goal, we created a vehicular NDN environment for data collection, processing, and transmission using the CARLA simulator and robot operating system 2 (ROS2). Next, due to our vehicular NDN's dynamic and complex nature, we formulate the data source selection problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and solve it using a reinforcement learning approach. For simplicity, we termed our proposed scheme data source optimization with reinforcement learning (DSORL), which selects suitable vehicles for HD map data transmission to MEC servers. The experiment results indicate that our suggested method outperformed existing baseline schemes, such as RLSS, Pro-RTT, and HDM-RTT, across all performance criteria in the evaluation. For instance, the system throughput increases by 65% - 72.68% compared to other baseline systems. Similarly, the proposed approach can minimize packet loss rate, data size, and transmission time by up to 60.6%, 77.5%, and 54.1%, respectively.

TI Health burden of road traffic noise in the EU in 2020-2035
SO NOISE CONTROL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The negative health effects of road traffic noise in the EU are analyzed over the period 2020-2035. For a baseline scenario, with autonomous traffic growth and fleet development, we find that there will be 31 million highly annoyed persons and 15 million highly sleep-disturbed persons in the EU in 2030. The corresponding EU health burden in 2030 is equivalent to the loss of 1.7 million "healthy life years ". Various noise abatement scenarios are analyzed, with noise solutions such as quiet road surfaces, quiet tires, and electric vehicles. The health benefits of the scenarios are calculated as health-burden differences from the baseline scenario. The calculation methodology is based on the noise exposure distributions reported in 2017 by EU member states, for urban agglomerations and for major roads. Changes in noise exposure are calculated with EU model Cnossos for vehicle emission, considering different types of roads (residential streets, main roads, motorways,...), and taking into account the separate contributions of rolling noise and propulsion noise to the vehicle emission. Two different noise valuation methods are used to express the health benefits in Euros. The monetized health benefits are used as input for a cost-benefit analysis of the scenarios over the period 2020-2035. For quiet tires, for example, high health benefits and low costs are found, resulting in a high benefit-cost ratio. This work was part of a study for the European Commission, exploring different options for reducing the EU health burden caused by noise from road, rail, and air traffic.

AB Building an efficient and reliable collision perception visual system is a challenging problem for future robots and autonomous vehicles. The biological visual neural networks, which have evolved over millions of years in nature and are working perfectly in the real world, could be ideal models for designing artificial vision systems. In the locust's visual pathways, a lobula giant movement detector (LGMD), that is, the LGMD2, has been identified as a looming perception neuron that responds most strongly to darker approaching objects relative to their backgrounds; similar situations which many ground vehicles and robots are often faced with. However, little has been done on modeling the LGMD2 and investigating its potential in robotics and vehicles. In this article, we build an LGMD2 visual neural network which possesses the similar collision selectivity of an LGMD2 neuron in locust via the modeling of biased-ON and -OFF pathways splitting visual signals into parallel ON/OFF channels. With stronger inhibition (bias) in the ON pathway, this model responds selectively to darker looming objects. The proposed model has been tested systematically with a range of stimuli including real-world scenarios. It has also been implemented in a micro-mobile robot and tested with real-time experiments. The experimental results have verified the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model for detecting darker looming objects against various dynamic and cluttered backgrounds.

   FRAMEWORK
AB competitiveness in the aircraft manufacturing industry requires continuous improvement and modernization of its manufacturing processes, in order to keep the companies competitive in the market. In this context, the use of advanced manufacturing technologies and systems has been incessantly pursued to achieve productivity gains, sustainability and reduction of production costs, as well as being important in the individuals' quality of life. Autonomous robotic systems such as Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) have been used on shop floor to assist the aggregation of these competitive advantages to the business. Coupled to the use of these vehicles, other technologies such as the internet, digital factory and cloud-computing have been integrated into manufacturing in direction of the so-called advanced manufacturing, or Industry 4.0. Thus, this work aims to apply the concepts of digital factory in an example of aircraft manufacturing system, to analyze the efficiency and workload of the AGVs that transport materials from the warehouse to the assembly stations. Based on a theoretical approach by discrete-event simulation method and guided by the principles of Industry 4.0, analysis related to needed amount of AGVs, cycle times, deliveries and downtime of the vehicles were performed for different situations. Thus, it searches for better results in terms of productivity and decision-making support regarding adding-value related to materials transporting and information over long distances, delays, waiting and unnecessary movement of workers, in order to obtain improvement and profits for the aircraft manufacturing system.

AB Electric vehicles (EVs) are recently gaining traction in the power sector due to various challenges and opportunities they provide to utility operators. For electric utilities that incorporate demand side management (DSM) programs, EVs could become either a burden or an advantage depending on their charging control strategy and the signaling of the DSM program. This paper proposes a decentralized fuzzy-based controller to successfully integrate and coordinate the charging of EVs that ensures fair charging of EVs at different point of connections (POCs) in the distribution grid where voltage conditions might not be the same. The controller operates in an autonomous mode that reduces the monetary cost of the communication overhead and preserves bandwidth. The proposed controller takes into consideration the owner requirements in terms of energy needed and time to charge, the voltage at the POC with the grid, and the pricing signal coming from the utility. The controller is tested under different DSM programs that exist in the literature. This paper also proposes a new DSM program that is capable of benefiting from EVs as prosumers that can provide grid services. The controller's performance was validated through MATLAB simulations that showed the controller's ability to successfully coordinate the charging of EVs in a fair manner and achieve flat system peaks without any rebound effect. The controller was also successfully tested in the presence of voltage control units, such as capacitor banks, and in the presence of distributed generations.

AB Different from conventional reflecting-only metasurfaces, intelligent omni-surfaces (IOSs) are capable of reflecting and transmitting the received signals simultaneously. As such, users located at the both sides of IOSs can be served efficiently. In this paper, a novel IOS-enhanced aerial secure offloading system is proposed in the presence of multiple ground eavesdroppers. Specifically, the IOS is adopted to prevent information leakage, improve legitimate reception quality and expand the security deployment range of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). To maximize the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) of the considered system, a non-convex resource allocation problem is formulated by allocating computing frequency, determining offloading strategy, controlling transmit power, designing phase shifts, and deploying UAV locations. The formulated problem is non-trivial and challenging to be solved directly due to the highly coupled variables. To tackle this issue, the alternating optimization technique is invoked to decouple the original one into five subproblems, and then the computing and communication settings are alternatively optimized using a low complexity iterative algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that: i) In terms of the SEE performance, our IOS-enhanced aerial secure offloading system significantly outperforms the benchmark schemes; ii) Compared with reflecting-only surfaces, IOSs can take full advantage of the flexible deployment ability of UAVs, such that their secure offloading space can be considerably expanded.

AB With the popularity of computationally intensive applications, more and more computing resources are required. Mobile edge computing (MEC) is widely applied as an effective method to meet the increasing computing demands. In a relatively stable state, MEC can provide computing services with low latency and energy consumption. However, in special cases such as communication traffic, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), by taking advantage of its mobility and flexibility, can assist the edge server to cope with the challenge of instantaneous computing surge. In this study, the authors consider a UAV-enabled edge computing system. In addition to delay and energy consumption, the authors also consider computing resources costs in the offloading model. Besides, in order to minimise the computing cost of each mobile user (MU), they apply the non-cooperative game method to model the channel and computing resources competition among MUs. Then, the authors prove that the proposed game is an ordinal potential game and the existence of Nash equilibrium in the game. The authors propose the UAV-enabled computation offloading (UECO) algorithm to obtain the equilibrium strategy. Finally, the authors show that the UECO algorithm can quickly converge through iterative experiments, and it can achieve lower computing cost through comparative experiments.

AB With the high mobility, flexibility and manoeuvrability, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-enabled mobile edge computing (MEC) plays an important role in many applications that lack of available terrestrial infrastructures, such as disaster response, emergency relief and military scenarios. However, the high mobility of UAVs may severely degrade the implementation of UAV-enabled MEC in computation-intensive or delay-sensitive scenarios from a physical layer signalling perspective, e.g. frequency selective fading effect caused by the low altitude and low elevation angle routes of UAVs. In this study, a generalised weighted-type fractional Fourier transform (GWFRFT) based signal energy-spreading transmission (EST) scheme is proposed for signalling and quality of service (QoS) provisioning for UAV-enabled MEC. In the proposed scheme, the communication signal energy is redistributed evenly at the time-frequency plane to enhance the robustness of UAV communications against the severe fading channels. The signalling provisioning mechanism of the GWFRFT-EST scheme is analysed and simulated under poor air-to-ground channels with low RicianK-factor. Simulation results show that the proposed method greatly improves the bit error rate performance with a negligible computational complexity increase.

AB The rapid advancement of sensor technologies and artificial intelligence are creating new opportunities for traffic safety enhancement. Dashboard cameras (dashcams) have been widely deployed on both human driving vehicles and automated driving vehicles. A computational intelligence model that can accurately and promptly predict accidents from the dashcam video will enhance the preparedness for accident prevention. The spatial-temporal interaction of traffic agents is complex. Visual cues for predicting a future accident are embedded deeply in dashcam video data. Therefore, the early anticipation of traffic accidents remains a challenge. Inspired by the attention behavior of humans in visually perceiving accident risks, this paper proposes a Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Attention (DSTA) network for the early accident anticipation from dashcam videos. The DSTA-network learns to select discriminative temporal segments of a video sequence with a Dynamic Temporal Attention (DTA) module. It also learns to focus on the informative spatial regions of frames with a Dynamic Spatial Attention (DSA) module. A Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is trained jointly with the attention modules to predict the probability of a future accident. The evaluation of the DSTA-network on two benchmark datasets confirms that it has exceeded the state-of-the-art performance. A thorough ablation study that assesses the DSTA-network at the component level reveals how the network achieves such performance. Furthermore, this paper proposes a method to fuse the prediction scores from two complementary models and verifies its effectiveness in further boosting the performance of early accident anticipation.

AB One of the most important and fundamental topics in autonomous navigated vehicle research is the lane change maneuver for obstacle avoidance or overtaking maneuver. In the literature, the lane change maneuver path for car-like vehicles has widely been generated with geometrically smooth segments by solving boundary conditions under given constraints. This paper proposes a new method of continuous curvature path generation for the issue of lane change maneuver for obstacle avoidance while solving the clothoids composition problem using an efficient algorithmic procedure. Conventional approaches resorting to mathematical or engineering optimization without considering human-side activity and response may fail to deliver driving performance that is favorable to humans. The novelty of the proposed method lies in its adoption of a human driving pattern, which is non-symmetric and composed of two different modes of avoidance and recovery during the maneuver, and utilizes the property given by an appropriate iterative algorithm which takes into account all the constraints in order to solve the problem. As compared to conventional methods, the proposed method not only provides overall safety for obstacle avoidance, but also exhibits efficiency of increased comfort and human like steering motion during the lane change maneuver. The proposed path planning method is compared to other methods in order to validate its efficiency for safe and smooth obstacle avoidance maneuver.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relaying is deemed as a promising solution to enhance the achievable rate and widespread connectivity in millimeter-wave (mm-wave) systems for tomorrow's 6G wireless networks. In this paper, we study both the performance and user association optimization for the UAV relay-assisted mm-wave massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system, where multiple base stations (BSs) serve their respective users with the help of one beamforming UAV relay. Both the beamforming and the UAV relay have essential impact on the achievable sum-rate of the system. Thus, a multi-user hybrid beamforming scheme is designed to mitigate the inter-user interference issues and achieve better trade-off between performance and complexity in UAV-enabled communications. Also, to exploit UAV relay-based architecture in serving different ground BS-user pairs, we propose a UAV relay-assisted multi-BS mm-wave massive MIMO system with hybrid beamforming architecture, which prevent sudden link disconnections caused by high path loss and line-of-sight (LoS) blockage in the mm-wave frequency band. Then, we formulate a user association problem with multiple constraints such that the sum-rate of the overall UAV relay-assisted mm-wave massive MIMO system is maximized. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed UAV relay-enabled architecture.

AB Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) is an innovative form of urban transportation which might provide an alternative to car use. PRT is conceptualized by an array of autonomous pods, providing shared riding service to a small number of travelers per vehicle, on a dedicated guideway. PRT is considered by many to be a travel mode that reduces energy use and emissions levels, compared with traditional cars. To evaluate the cost effectiveness and benefits associated with the energy consumed by a typical urban PRT system, a detailed techno-economic analysis of two energy supply alternatives is presented. The technologies considered are: battery storage and third-rail conductors. This paper demonstrates a methodological approach to evaluate PRT energy costs, illustrated by a case study: the city of Herzliya (ISR). First, a PRT system model was developed, including both infrastructure design and operational characteristics, with a total track length of 12.5 km. Then, vehicles tractive and grid energy requirements were derived from the case study data using rigid body mechanics and lumped powertrain properties. Following, an economic evaluation was carried out taking into account capital costs as well as operating costs based on tractive, auxiliary and parasitic energy requirements. In both cases, the energy consumption is about 0.08 [kWh/p-km], while the energy costs are 0.031 and 0.100 [$/p-km] for the battery and third rail, respectively. Future research is discussed in the directions of further modeling development and extending the scope of alternatives.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB In this work, an energy planning strategy is proposed for over-actuated unmanned road vehicles (URVs) having redundant steering configurations. In fact, indicators on the road geometry, the actuation redundancy, the optimal velocity profile, and the driving mode are evaluated for each segment of the URV's trajectory. To reach this objective, a power consumption estimation model is developed for the URV. Due to the presence of unknown dynamic parameters of the URV and uncertainties about its interaction with the environment, an artificial intelligence (AI) technique, based on data-learning qualitative method, is used for the power consumption estimation, namely Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The ANFIS model is obtained using trained data from a Real URV dynamics. Then, an energy digraph is built with all feasible configurations taking into account the kinematic and dynamic constraints based on a 3D grid map setup, according to velocity, arc-length, and driving mode. In this weighted directed graph, the edges describe the consumed energy by the URV along a segment of a trajectory. The vertices describe the start and end points of each segment. Subsequently, an optimization algorithm is applied on the digraph to get a global optimal solution combining driving mode, power consumption, and velocity profile of the URV. The obtained results are compared with the dynamic programming method for global offline optimization. Finally, the obtained simulation and experimental results, applied on RobuCar URV, highlight the effectiveness of the proposed energy planning.

AB Current forest monitoring technologies including satellite remote sensing, manned/piloted aircraft, and observation towers leave uncertainties about a wildfire's extent, behavior, and conditions in the fire's near environment, particularly during its early growth. Rapid mapping and real-time fire monitoring can inform in-time intervention or management solutions to maximize beneficial fire outcomes. Drone systems' unique features of 3D mobility, low flight altitude, and fast and easy deployment make them a valuable tool for early detection and assessment of wildland fires, especially in remote forests that are not easily accessible by ground vehicles. In addition, the lack of abundant, well-annotated aerial datasets - in part due to unmanned aerial vehicles' (UAVs') flight restrictions during prescribed burns and wildfires - has limited research advances in reliable data-driven fire detection and modeling techniques. While existing wildland fire datasets often include either color or thermal fire images, here we present (1) a multi-modal UAV-collected dataset of dual-feed side-by-side videos including both RGB and thermal images of a prescribed fire in an open canopy pine forest in Northern Arizona and (2) a deep learning-based methodology for detecting fire and smoke pixels at accuracy much higher than the usual single-channel video feeds. The collected images are labeled to "fire " or "no-fire " frames by two human experts using side-by-side RGB and thermal images to determine the label. To provide context to the main dataset's aerial imagery, the included supplementary dataset provides a georeferenced pre-burn point cloud, an RGB orthomosaic, weather information, a burn plan, and other burn information. By using and expanding on this guide dataset, research can develop new data-driven fire detection, fire segmentation, and fire modeling techniques.

AB Transportation is a backbone of modern globalized societies. It also causes approximately one third of all European Union and U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, represents a major health hazard for global populations, and poses significant economic costs (e.g., due to traffic congestion). However, rapid innovation in vehicle technology, mobile connectivity, computing hardware, and artificial intelligence-powered information systems heralds a deep socio-technical transformation of the sector. The emergence of connected, autonomous, shared, and electric vehicle technology has created a digital layer that resides on top of the traditional physical mobility system. The resulting layered modular architecture is similar to that seen in other cyber-physical systems. Yet, it also comes with several characteristics and challenges that are unique to the domain of mobility and require entirely new solution approaches. Although other management and domain-specific research disciplines have started to embrace the new opportunities for research resulting from this deep structural change, the information systems (IS) community's involvement in smart mobility research has been marginal. Yet, we argue that our field's uniquely multidisciplinary, data-driven, and socio-technical research lens puts it in a strong position to address many of the large-scale societal challenges encountered in the mobility sector. Therefore, we make the case for IS research to play an active role in delivering a smart sustainable mobility ecosystem that is beneficial to users, mobility providers and the environment. We contribute a research framework to direct IS research efforts while providing a shared understanding of the smart sustainable mobility domain. We also present seven IS research opportunities along the dimensions of this framework and propose concrete angles of attack which we hope will spur an impactful and structured research agenda in the area.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to estimate the safety benefits of in vehicle lane departure warning (LDW) and lane keeping aid (LKA) systems in reducing relevant real-world passenger car injury crashes.Methods: The study used an induced exposure method, where LDW/LKA-sensitive and nonsensitive crashes were compared for Volvo passenger cars equipped with and without LDW/LKA systems. These crashes were matched by car make, model, model year, and technical equipment; that is, low-speed autonomous emergency braking (AEB) called City Safety (CS). The data were extracted from the Swedish Traffic Accident Data Acquisition database (STRADA) and consisted of 1,853 driver injury crashes that involved 146 LDW-equipped cars, 11 LKA-equipped cars, and 1,696 cars without LDW/LKA systems.Results: The analysis showed a positive effect of the LDW/LKA systems in reducing lane departure crashes. The LDW/LKA systems were estimated to reduce head-on and single-vehicle injury crashes on Swedish roads with speed limits between 70 and 120 km/h and with dry or wet road surfaces (i.e., not covered by ice or snow) by 53% with a lower limit of 11% (95% confidence interval [CI]). This reduction corresponded to a reduction of 30% with a lower limit of 6% (95% CI) for all head-on and single-vehicle driver injury crashes (including all speed limits and all road surface conditions).Conclusions: LDW/LKA systems were estimated to lower the driver injury risk in crash types that the systems are designed to prevent; that is, head-on and single-vehicle crashes. Though these are important findings, they were based on a small data set. Therefore, further research is desirable to evaluate the effectiveness of LDW/LKA systems under real-world conditions and to differentiate the effectiveness between technical solutions (i.e., LDW and LKA) proposed by different manufacturers.

AB As deep learning models have become increasingly complex, it is critical to understand their decision-making, particularly in safety-relevant applications. In order to support a quantitative interpretation of an autonomous agent trained through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in the highway-env simulation environment, we propose a framework featuring three types of views for analyzing data: (i) episode timeline, (ii) frame by frame, and (iii) aggregated statistical analysis, also including heatmaps for a better spatial understanding. Our methodology allowed a novel, consistent description of the behavior of the agent. The main motivator for the taken action is typically the longitudinal distance from the second-closest and, to a lower extent, third-closest vehicle. In the overtakes, also the agent's position in lanes becomes relevant. The analysis identified interesting patterns and an issue in the last frames of an episode, when the agent is unable to overtake the last two vehicles, arguably because of the lack of reference vehicles ahead. We observed a clear differentiation between attention and SHAP values (estimating the importance of each feature for each decision), reflecting the architecture of the neural network, where the first layer implements the attention mechanism, while the deeper ones make the actual decision. Attention focuses on the proximity of the ego, while the decision is taken on a wider horizon, denoting a valuable anticipation capability. To support research, the proposed framework is released as open source.

ID ACCURATE
AB Stereo matching is a fundamental task in 3-D scene reconstruction. Recently, deep learning-based methods have proven effective on some benchmark datasets, such as KITTI and SceneFlow. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are commonly used for surface observation, and the images captured are frequently used for detailed 3-D reconstruction because of their high resolution and low-altitude acquisition. Currently, mainstream supervised learning networks require a significant amount of training data with ground-truth labels to learn model parameters. However, owing to the scarcity of UAV stereo-matching datasets, learning-based stereo matching methods in UAV scenarios are not fully investigated yet. To facilitate further research, this study proposes a pipeline for generating accurate and dense disparity maps using detailed meshes reconstructed based on UAV images and LiDAR point clouds. Through the proposed pipeline, we constructed a multiresolution UAV scenario dataset called UAVStereo, with over 34 000 stereo image pairs covering three typical scenes. To the best of our knowledge, UAVStereo is the first stereo matching dataset for UAV low-altitude scenarios. The dataset includes synthetic and real stereo pairs to enable generalization from the synthetic domain to the real domain. Furthermore, our UAVStereo dataset provides multiresolution and multiscene image pairs to accommodate various sensors and environments. In this article, we evaluate traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning methods, highlighting their limitations in addressing challenges in UAV scenarios and offering suggestions for future research.

AB As one of the most promising new technologies in the upcoming 6G communication, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can significantly improve the reliability of wireless transmission and deal with the security threat in the presence of eavesdroppers by smartly reconfiguring the wireless propagation environment. However, existing research mainly focuses on terrestrial communication networks. In contrast, there is not much research on IRS-aided secure unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication problems, especially for ground-to-air (G2A) communication scenarios with air eavesdroppers that will bring greater security threats. In this article, we consider an IRS-assisted G2A communication network with an altitude-dependent Rician fading channel, where the ground base station (BS) transmits legitimate information to the UAV user in the presence of air eavesdroppers. The transmission power, active and passive beamforming, and UAV 3-D trajectory are jointly optimized to maximize the average secrecy rate. Due to the nonconvexity of the optimization problem, the block coordinate descent method is used to solve it. Specifically, the overall optimization problem is divided into four subproblems, and nonconvex subproblems are solved by successive convex approximation and semidefinite relaxation algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed alternating optimization algorithm has a good convergence performance and can increase the average secrecy rate by 28% compared with the scenario without IRS assistance.

AB This study presents building entry loss and capacity results obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-to-indoor narrowband dual-polarised multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channel measurement campaign. Six different measurement scenarios were carried out with the transmitter (Tx) located on a low altitude platform (LAP) and the receiver (Rx) at various floors and distances from the external windows of a multi-storey building. An analytic and simple procedure is proposed for the calculation of entry loss. The results reveal that there is a strong dependence on the propagation geometry and the orientation of the receiver with respect to the moving LAP transmitter. The processed data for both entry loss and capacity indicate a two-state process that is closely related to the Tx-Rx relative azimuth and elevation angle. The average entry loss levels vary from 33 to 50 dB. The overall ergodic capacity varies between 3.1 and 4.1 b/s/Hz with insignificant variations with the floor level and the distance from the window. Finally, the K-factor of the channel lies below 6 dB tending to decrease with higher elevation angles.

AB The use of drones, formally known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), has significantly increased across a variety of applications over the past few years. This is due to the rapid advancement towards the design and production of inexpensive and dependable UAVs and the growing request for the utilization of such platforms particularly in civil applications. With their intrinsic attributes such as high mobility, rapid deployment and flexible altitude, UAVs have the potential to be utilized in many wireless system applications. On the one hand, UAVs are able to operate as flying mobile terminals within wireless/cellular networks to support a variety of missions such as goods delivery, search and rescue, precision agriculture monitoring, and remote sensing. On the other hand, UAVs can be utilized as aerial base stations to increase wireless communication coverage, reliability, and the capacity of wireless systems without additional investment in wireless systems infrastructure. The aim of this article is to review the current applications of UAVs for civil and commercial purposes. The focus of this paper is on the challenges and communication requirements associated with UAV-based communication systems. This article initially classifies UAVs in terms of various parameters, some of which can impact UAVs' communication performance. It then provides an overview of aerial networking and investigates UAVs routing protocols specifically, which are considered as one of the challenges in UAV communication. This article later investigates the use of UAV networks in a variety of civil applications and considers many challenges and communication demands of these applications. Subsequently, different types of simulation platforms are investigated from a communication and networking viewpoint. Finally, it identifies areas of future research.

AB Objective: Real-world driving studies, including those involving speeding alert devices and autonomous vehicles, can gauge an individual vehicle's speeding behavior by comparing measured speed with mapped speed zone data. However, there are complexities with developing and maintaining a database of mapped speed zones over a large geographic area that may lead to inaccuracies within the data set. When this approach is applied to large-scale real-world driving data or speeding alert device data to determine speeding behavior, these inaccuracies may result in invalid identification of speeding. We investigated speeding events based on service provider speed zone data.Methods: We compared service provider speed zone data (Speed Alert by Smart Car Technologies Pty Ltd., Ultimo, NSW, Australia) against a second set of speed zone data (Google Maps Application Programming Interface [API] mapped speed zones).Results: We found a systematic error in the zones where speed limits of 50-60km/h, typical of local roads, were allocated to high-speed motorways, which produced false speed limits in the speed zone database. The result was detection of false-positive high-range speeding. Through comparison of the service provider speed zone data against a second set of speed zone data, we were able to identify and eliminate data most affected by this systematic error, thereby establishing a data set of speeding events with a high level of sensitivity (a true positive rate of 92% or 6,412/6,960).Conclusions: Mapped speed zones can be a source of error in real-world driving when examining vehicle speed. We explored the types of inaccuracies found within speed zone data and recommend that a second set of speed zone data be utilized when investigating speeding behavior or developing mapped speed zone data to minimize inaccuracy in estimates of speeding.

TI Mapping dilution of precision (MDOP) and map-matched GPS
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB A novel method of map matching using the Global Positioning System (GPS) has been developed which uses digital mapping and height data to augment point position computation. This method reduces the error in position, which is a sum from several sources, including signal delay due to the ionosphere and atmosphere and until recently from 'selective availability' (S/A). S/A was imposed by the US military to degrade purposefully the accuracy of GPS, but was switched off on 2 May 2000, and is to be replaced with 'regional denial capabilities in lieu of global degradation' (Interagency GPS Executive Board, 2000). Taylor et al. (2001) describe the Road Reduction Filter (RRF) in detail. RRF is a method of detecting the correct road on which a vehicle is travelling. In the work described here, the position error vector is estimated in a formal least squares procedure, as the vehicle is moving. This estimate is a map-matched correction, that provides an autonomous alternative to DGPS for in-car navigation and fleet management. In this paper, a formula is derived for 'Mapped Dilution of Precision' (MDOP), defined as the theoretical ratio of position precision using map-matched corrections to that using perfect Differential GPS (DGPS) correction. This is shown to be purely a function of route geometry, and is computed for examples of basic road shapes. MDOP is favourable unless the route has less than a few degrees curvature for several kilometres. MDOP can thus provide an objective estimate of positioning precision to a vehicle driver. Precision estimates using MDOP are shown to agree well with 'true' positioning errors determined using high precision (cm) GPS carrier phase techniques. The exact location of a vehicle on a road is essential for accurate surveying applications.

ID HISTOGRAMS
AB The map-based localization method is considered an effective supplement to the localization under the GNSS-denied environment. However, since the map is constituted by the dispersed keyframes, it sometimes happens that the initial position of the unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) lies between the map keyframes or is not on the mapping trajectory. In both cases, it will be impossible to precisely estimate the pose of the vehicle directly via the relationship between the current frame and the map keyframes, leading to localization failure. In this regard, we propose a localization algorithm based on the global descriptor and dynamic range search (LA-GDADRS). In specific, we first design a global descriptor shift and rotation invariant image (SRI), which improves the rotation invariance and shift invariance by the methods of coordinates removal and de-centralization. Secondly, we design a global localization algorithm for shift and rotation invariant branch-and-bound scan matching (SRI-BBS). It first leverages SRI to obtain an approximate priori position of the unmanned vehicle and then utilizes the similarity between the current frame SRI and the map keyframes SRI to select a dynamic search range around the priori position. Within the search range, we leverage the branch-and-bound scanning matching algorithm to search for a more precise pose. It solves the problem that global localization tends to fail when the priori position is imprecise. Moreover, we introduce a tightly coupled factor graph model and a HD map engine to achieve real-time position tracking and lane-level localization, respectively. Finally, we complete extensive ablation experiments and comparative experiments to validate our methods on the benchmark dataset (KITTI) and the real application scenarios at the campus. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves the performance of mainstream localization algorithms.

AB Cyclists are expected to interact with automated vehicles (AVs) in future traffic, yet we know little about the nature of this interaction and the safety implications of AVs on cyclists. On-bike human-machine interfaces (HMIs) and connecting cyclists to AVs and the road infrastructure may have the potential to enhance the safety of cyclists. This study aimed to identify cyclists' needs in today's and future traffic, and explore on-bike HMI functionality and the implications of equipping cyclists with devices to communicate with AVs. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 cyclists in Norway and 15 cyclists in the Netherlands. Thematic analysis was used to identify and contextualise the factors of cyclist-AV interaction and on-bike HMIs. From the analysis, seven themes were identified: Interaction, Bicycles, Culture, Infrastructure, Legislation, AVs, and HMI. These themes are diverse and overlap with factors grouped in sub-themes. The results indicated that the cyclists prefer segregated future infrastructure, and in mixed urban traffic, they need confirmation of detection by AVs. External on-vehicle or on-bike HMIs might be solutions to fulfil the cyclists' need for recognition. However, the analysis suggested that cyclists are hesitant about being equipped with devices to communicate with AVs: Responsibility for safety should lie with AV technology rather than with cyclists. A device requirement might become a barrier to cycling, as bicycles are traditionally cheap and simple, and additional costs might deter people from choosing cycling as a transport mode. Future studies should investigate user acceptance of on-bike HMIs among cyclists on a larger scale to test the findings' generalisability, and explore other, perhaps more viable solutions than on-bike HMIs for enhancing AVcyclist interaction.

AB In this paper, we consider a mobile edge computing (MEC) network where multiple cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can offload their computation tasks to multiple ground base stations (GBSs). In practice, the UAVs are generally unable to master stochastic information of task arrival and channel changes in advance, which may cause a severe issue in terms of energy consumption. Therefore, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem with the goal of minimizing the average weighted sum energy consumption, by jointly optimizing UAV-GBS associations, communication and computation resource allocation, and three-dimensional (3D) UAV trajectories, during which a velocity-triggered penalty term (VTPT) is designed to suppress a large amount of the energy consumption of the UAVs. To handle the stochastic problem, we propose an online resource allocation and trajectory optimization algorithm with outer and inner structures. The outer structure transforms the original problem to a deterministic one by applying the Lyapunov-based optimization framework. The inner structure solves the obtained deterministic problem via the Lagrange duality method and the successive convex approximation technique, based on the block coordinate descent framework. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) VTPT dramatically decreases the UAVs' energy consumption, and 2) the proposed algorithm not only reduces the energy consumption but also ensures the computation queue stability compared with other benchmark schemes.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are emerging technology that attracts the interests of many transportation professionals and computational scientists. Several recent studies have investigated different model frameworks of CAVs in different transportation environments, such as on freeways and at conventional intersections. Nevertheless, few efforts have been made to investigate the performances of CAVs at innovative intersections, and the lack of knowledge can result in an inaccurate prediction of CAVs performances in the existing transportation network. This research intends to mitigate this research gap by studying the traffic delay and fuel consumption of CAVs in the environment of the superstreet and its equivalent conventional intersection through simulation-based experiments. A real-world superstreet in Leeland, NC, is selected and used. A conventional intersection with equivalent road designs is established in the simulation platform to make a comparison with the selected superstreet. This research develops both platooning and trajectory planning modeling frameworks to examine the implications of CAVs with different capabilities. The Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) is selected and applied to model the CAV behaviors, while Wiedemann 99 (W99) is used to model Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs). The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of both platooning and trajectory planning, respectively. Different effects of CAVs in the superstreet and its equivalent conventional intersection are observed. The findings from this research can provide an important reference for transportation planners and policymakers in predicting the influence of CAVs on the existing transportation infrastructure.

TI Extracting Overtaking Segments by Unsupervised Clustering and Predicting
   Nonmotorized Vehicle's Trajectory
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; MANEUVERS; MODEL
AB Interpretation of flexible cycling behavior has always been a tough task. It is meaningful to understand the overtaking behavior of cyclists for its threats to safety and its high frequency on shared roads. Advanced unsupervised nonparametric clustering methods are compared to distinguish the overtaking segments from the whole trajectory based on the cycling characteristics of nonmotorized two-wheelers, while the hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model (HDPHMM) outperforms the mixture model via the Dirichlet process (DP mixture model) and topic model via the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP topic model). HDPHMM clusters each record into different states and results in more continuous segments. Based on marked vehicle types, which state of clustering model represents the overtaking condition is deduced. The overtaking segments resulted from HDPHMM show the highest homogeneity in cycling features with actual overtaking behavior. Another practical task is to predict the overtaking trajectory and respond to overtaking behavior in advance. Comparing original trajectory and subdivided trajectory, it is found that training model with grouped data, which have homogeneous features, can improve prediction accuracy. With enough trainable samples, CNN + LSTM hybrid structure can achieve trajectory prediction with a mean absolute error of 3 cm. The segmentation produces trajectory segments with similar characteristics. The model is trained with overtaking trajectory segments. With tens of times less trainable data, the prediction on overtaking trajectory still keeps a mean absolute error of about 5 cm. Subdividing trajectory into segments with homogeneous features can improve the prediction accuracy and reduce the requirement of trainable data volume.

ID ATTENTION
AB Object detection is an important task for self-driving vehicles or advanced driver assistant systems (ADASs). Additionally, visual selective attention is a crucial neural mechanism in a driver's vision system that can rapidly filter out unnecessary visual information in a driving scene. Some existing models detect all objects in driving scenes from the aspect of computer vision. However, in a rapidly changing driving environment, detecting salient or critical objects appearing in drivers' interested or safety-relevant areas is more useful for ADASs. In this paper, we managed to detect salient and critical objects based on drivers' fixation regions. To this end, we built an augmented eye tracking object detection (ETOD) dataset based on driving videos with multiple drivers' eye movement collected by Deng et al. Furthermore, we proposed a real-time salient object detection network named increase-decrease YOLO (ID-YOLO) to discriminate the critical objects within the drivers' fixation region. The proposed ID-YOLO shows excellent detection of major objects that drivers are concerned about during driving. Compared with the present object detection models in autonomous and assisted driving systems, our object detection framework simulates the selective attention mechanism of drivers. Thus, it does not detect all of the objects appearing in the driving scenes but only detects the most relevant ones for driving safety. It can largely reduce the interference of irrelevant scene information, showing potential practical applications in intelligent or assisted driving systems.

AB Unmanned vehicle systems are often teleoperated, semiautonomous, and strictly dependent on human operators. In complex and dynamic environments, unmanned vehicles should be autonomous in a stricter sense, which means they should exhibit a human-like behavior to he capable of accurately perceiving the environment; understanding the situation, locating and interacting with environmental elements; and reporting solutions to humans. In order to address these desiderata, a modeling of a proactive, context-aware unmanned system is presented. Precisely, the system framework is designed for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that flies over an area, and collects data in the form of video frames, sensor values, etc. It recognizes situations, senses scene object and environment data, acquires the awareness about the evolving scenes, and, finally, takes a decision based on the perception of the overall scenario. The system design is based on two primary building blocks: 1) the semantic web technologies that provide the high-level object description in the tracked scenario, and 2) the fuzzy cognitive map model that provides the cognitive accumulation of spatial knowledge in order to discern specific situations that need a decision. Although the paper presents a UAV-based surveillance system model, its applicability is shown based on a realistic case study (viz., broken car on the highway); moreover, several possible scenario configurations have been simulated to assess the criticality level perceived by the system (UAV) in a given situation and to validate the effective response/decision in the case of critical situations.

AB In this era of the big data revolution, the desired capabilities of Earth Observing Systems are growing fast: we need ever more frequent data sets, covering a larger part of the frequency spectrum, with lower latency, and higher spatial resolution. To better address these needs, the space systems community has been exploring the value of shifting from highly monolithic architectures, in which large and isolated spacecraft carry multiple instruments with synergistic and complementary goals, toward more distributed architectures, where the functions of these large systems are partitioned into a larger number of smaller satellites. In this paper, we present an agent-based simulation framework that can help systems engineers assess whether or not it makes sense to be able to change system modularity during operations by means of temporary coalitions. Systems of observing autonomous vehicles work together to perform a set of observational tasks. The vehicles can decide to form physical coalitions with other vehicles for collective sensing of a target, when no agent alone can carry out the task, or individual observation results in degraded satisfaction. The framework extends the well-known decentralized Coupled-Constraint Consensus-Based Bundle Algorithm to multivehicle single-task allocation and introduces constraints on the formation of coalitions, so that agents can create or split a coalition depending on the benefits and costs associated with these actions. The framework is described in detail and demonstrated on a case study.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been widely deployed in efficient data collection for Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Information freshness in data collection can be characterized by the Age of Information (AoI). It is highly challenging to schedule multiple energy-constrained UAVs to improve information freshness especially when the generation instants of sensing samples are unpredictable. To deal with this issue, we leverage state-of-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods to design flight trajectories of UAVs without knowing the sampling mode each sensor node (SN) adopts. Each SN can sample the environment at periodical or random intervals. Multiple energy-constrained UAVs are dispatched to collect update packets from the SNs when flying over them. The UAV trajectory planning problem for AoI minimization is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP). The objective is to minimize the average AoI of the SNs under the constraints of energy capacity and collision avoidance for the UAVs. Then, we propose two learning algorithms based on the Sarsa and value-decomposition network (VDN), respectively, which allow the UAVs to fulfill data collection tasks requested by the SNs. By learning directly from the environment, the Sarsa-based algorithm can approach the optimal policy asymptotically when certain conditions are satisfied. As one of the most popular multiagent deep RL methods, the VDN-based algorithm enables each UAV to make its own decision independently on its flight and data collection based on the partially observed network information. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed two learning-based algorithms compared with baseline policies.

ID CONTROLLER
AB This paper investigates side-channel vulnerabilities of a wireless communication application in vehicular environments (DSRC/WAVE) protocol implementation of a traffic intersection application. A prototype roadside unit (RSU) was implemented using real DSRC devices. The functionality of the WAVE short message (Wsm)-channel is extended to include an implementation of WAVE short message protocol (WSMP) for broadcasting GPS data and RSU instructions in vehicular communications. In the example used, DSRC is used to replace an intersection stoplight. Denial of service attacks are executed that leverage DSRC RSU timing and packet size side-channels to selectively disable the stoplight. Simulations are implemented to determine our ability to stealthily drop packets so as to force two vehicles to collide. Hidden Markov models (HMM) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are constructed from sniffed side-channel information. We use inter-packet delay time and packet size side-channel information to design our attackes. In operational networks, packets should be encrypted in order to hide the contents of the packet payloads, but packet sizes and timing are not affected by encryption. HMMs were inferred using only side-channel information. The inferred HMMs track the protocol status over time. The SVM classifier was inferred using both side-channel data and packet payloads. At run-time, though, the SVM only had access to side-channel information. Simulation experiments were implemented to test HMM and SVM ability to identify packets used to signal vehicles to stop and yield right-of-way. Timing HMM side-channel attack caused collision with 2.5% false positive rate (FPR), while the packet size one resulted 9.5% FPR.

AB Owing to their intrinsic advantages of seamless coverage and of high data rate, space-air-ground communications networks (SAGCN) are recognized as one of the emerging technologies for the future wireless communications systems. However, the broadcasting nature of wireless communications inevitably imposes security issues on SAGCN. In this paper, we consider the uplink of the full-duplex unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided three-layer SAGCN, comprising of ground Internet of Remote Things (IoRT) terminals, an unmanned aerial vehicle, and a low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite, where eavesdroppers are intercepting the information transmitted. In order to ensure a secure uplink transmission, a joint UAV deployment and power allocation scheme is conceived for maximizing the secrecy rate of the SAGCN, subject to the following constraints: i) UAV's power, ii) the UAV deployment area, and iii) the secrecy rate, which are imposed on the different layers. More explicitly, once we formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the secrecy rate, we decouple the variables and decompose the original problem into multiple subproblems in a tractable manner. Then, we simplify the subproblems with the aid of slack variables and solve them relying on the successive convex approximation method. Following this, initialization schemes are designed to exploit the one-direction greedy method for diverse environment settings, for speeding up the convergence of the iterative algorithm proposed. Finally, simulation results reveal that the convergence can be achieved within a small number of iterations by the proposed initialization scheme, while the algorithm conceived is capable of attaining a substantial improvement of the secrecy rate for the SAGCN.

AB Vision-based object detection and scene understanding are becoming key features of environment perception and autonomous driving. In the past couple of years, numerous large-scale datasets for visual object detection and semantic understanding have been released which has enormously benefited the environment perception in self-driving cars. However, these datasets like Kitti and Cityscapes only focus on well organized and urban road traffic scenarios of European countries while ignoring the dense and unpattern traffic conditions of subcontinent countries like Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. Consequently, the environment perception system developed on these datasets cannot efficiently assist self-driving cars in traffic scenarios of subcontinent countries. To this end, we present CARL-D, a large-scale dataset and benchmark suite for develop 2D object detection and instance/pixel-level segmentation methods for self-driving cars. CARL-D comprises largescale stereo vision-based driving videos captured from more than 100 cities of Pakistan, including motorways, dense and unpattern traffic scenarios of urban, rural, and hilly areas. As a benchmark selection, 15,000 suitable images are labeled for 2D object detection and recognition. Whereas semantic segmentation benchmark contains 2500 images with pixel-level high-quality fine annotations and 5000 coarse-annotated images which could help in enabling the deep neural networks to leverage the weakly labeled data. Alongside the dataset, we also present transfer learning-based 2D vehicle detection and scene segmentation methods to evaluate the performance of existing state-of-the-art deep neural networks on our dataset. Lastly, an extensive experimental evaluation along with the comparative study has been carried out which demonstrates the upper edge of our dataset in terms of interclass-diversity, scene-variability, and annotations richness. The proposed benchmark suite is available at https://carl-dataset.github.io/index/.

AB Planar motion mechanism tests have been widely used in simulations, i.e, virtual environments for ocean craft, especially for underwater vehicles. These tests involve a pre-determined sinusoidal trajectory. While there are general guidelines for the choice of amplitude and frequency for such trajectories in existing literature, there are none for smaller submerged ocean craft. The direct application of the work presented in this paper is for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). A series of two articles presents analysis of virtual planar motion mechanism (VPMM) specific to AUVs. An arbitrary selection of amplitudes and frequencies for VPMM can result in significant uncertainty in hydrodynamic derivatives. The results in this article explain the effect of frequencies and amplitudes of pure sway and pure yaw VPMM implemented in a lumped parameter maneuvering model (LPM) for the horizontal plane. This article shows that for typical AUV geometries that the use of non-dimensional frequency up to a value of 0.5 and a non-dimensional amplitude of up to 0.25 remains acceptable for pure sway and pure yaw VPMM despite fluid memory effects. For the first time, a detailed methodology to determine appropriate amplitudes and frequencies for any craft is presented, with the results of one craft shown as an example. Overall, this series of articles sheds light on the process to determine the amplitude and frequency for pure sway and pure yaw VPMM for an AUV in the early design stage.

AB The coordination between aerial and ground nodes has enhanced the versatility and quality of the traditional networks. The application of aerial systems in mission-critical operations, as well as civilian applications, brings in the context of safeguarding unmanned aerial systems (UAS) from malicious attackers. This study discusses the threats and attacks mounted on UAS, alongside the challenges introduced by the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network structure itself. A framework for safeguarding UAS against malicious attackers and recovering the rogue UAVs is proposed in the study. The proposed framework enforces a dynamic conceptual grid-based layout over the actual geographical deployment. The dynamically shuffling grid ascertains the security of transmission channels, as every time the grid is shuffled periodically or based on abnormal behaviour, the safety paradigm is reinitiated. Public key cryptographic algorithms are deployed for securing the communication links. Neural networks-based predictions are used for detecting abnormality in behavioural, statistical, and mobility patterns. Principal component analysis based on multivariate statistical analysis is used for detecting outliers in the aerial network environment. The behaviour prediction and outlier detection algorithms significantly improve the overall performance of the network and provide immunity against the intruders with reduced false positives, high accuracy, and better detection rate.

AB This paper investigates a wireless powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication network with backscatter and caching technologies. Specifically, we assume a self-energized UAV with a cache memory is deployed as a flying backscatter device (BD), term the UAV-enabled BD (UB), to relay the source's signals to the destination. Whereas the source S can act as a wireless charging station or a base station to supply power or transmit information to the UB using the dynamic time splitting (DTS) method. The UAV utilizes its harvested energy for backscattering (i.e., passive communication) and transmit information (i.e., active communication) to the destination. In this context, we aim to maximize the total throughput by jointly optimizing the DTS ratio and the UB's trajectory with caching capability at the UB. The formulation is troublesome to solve since it is a non-convex problem. To find solutions, we decompose the original problem into two sub-problems, whereas we first optimize the DTS ratio for a given UB's trajectory and the UB's trajectory optimization for a given DTS ratio. By using the KKT conditions, a closed-form expression for the optimal value of the DTS ratio is obtained, greatly reducing the computation time. Moreover, the solution of the second sub-problem can be acquired by adopting the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Consequently, an efficient alternating algorithm is proposed by leveraging the block coordinate descent (BCD) method. To show the advantages of the proposed BCD-based algorithm, we also provide the solution of the original problem applying the inner approximation (IA) method. Finally, the intensive numerical results demonstrate that our proposed schemes achieve significant throughput gain in comparison to the benchmark schemes.

AB Drone-swarm-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) provides extra computation and storage capacity for smart city applications and the Industrial Internet of Things. To solve the problems of traditional fixed base stations in a complex terrain, including cost of deployment, transmission loss of telecommunication, and limited coverage, this article brings forward the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as MEC nodes in the air. For the purpose of matching the dynamic mobile devices and UAV trajectory, this article raises a multi-UAVs-assisted MEC offloading algorithm based on global and local path planning controlled by ground station and onboard computer. Firstly, this article considers a drone swarm scheduling and allocation strategy based on the priority of monitoring areas, UAVs residual energy and distance to target points, so as to minimize the global flight length and energy consumption. Secondly, based on user mobility, this article calculates the optimal communication coverage of a UAV, and jointly optimizes the local path planning and computing offloading, so as to maximize the number of offloading services and minimize the total latency in completing the computation task. Finally, based on the total latency and energy consumption of path planning and computation offloading, a UAV cluster computation offloading strategy with optimized energy efficiency is realized. Experimental results prove that the proposed algorithm can provide more offloading services while obtaining shorter path length and greater energy efficiency.

AB Numerous changes in algorithms have been observed by object detection to enhance both speed and accuracy. In this research, we present a method to improve the behavioral clone of self-driving cars. Thus, we first create a collection of videos and information required for safe driving on different routes and conditions. The detection of obstacles is done with the proposed algorithm called "YOLO non-maximum suppression fuzzy algorithm, which performs the driver reaction to obstacles with greater accuracy and more speed than the obstacles detection algorithms using the designed framework. The network is trained by the driver's performance, and hence, the output used to control the vehicle is obtained. The non-maximum suppression algorithm plays an essential role in object detection and tracking. An effective hybrid method of fuzzy and NMS algorithms is provided in this paper to improve the problem mentioned. The proposed method improves the average accuracy of the detection network. The performance of the designed algorithm was examined using two different types of KITTI data and the data collected using the personal vehicle and the data we gathered. The proposed algorithm was assessed with evaluation accuracy criteria, which revealed that the method has a higher speed (above 64.41%), a lower FPR (below 6.89%), and a lower FNR (below 3.95%) compared with the baseline YOLOv3 model. According to the loss function, the accuracy rate of the network performance is 95%, implying that we have achieved good results.

AB Perceiving the horizon line is a critical alternative for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomous navigation, especially in the presence of noise-induced drift, unavailability of satellite navigation, and multipath errors. However, it's quite tough to detect the horizon line, due to the remotely sensed big data, the dynamic changes in flight, and the serious consequences of failure. To address these problems, we propose a graph-based horizon line detection technique that is composed of graph-based image segmentation, connected domain cascade filtering, horizon line extraction, and UAV attitude estimation. We improve the graph-based image segmentation algorithm so that the segmentation results are more conducive to horizon line detection. We then determine the sky-component by cascade filtering and extract the horizon line based on the boundaries of the sky-component. Furthermore, we directly compute the roll and pitch according to the extracted horizon line and eliminate the ambiguity of the angles. To validate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively, we designed a fixed-wing UAV system. We then validated our algorithm through extensive flights under various conditions and compared the estimated rolls and pitches to the IMU ones. Statistical results show that the proposed technique provides unbiased attitude angles with error variance of about 2(o), which verify the validity and robustness of our method. For engineering, our program runs at approximately 60 fps on the fly after optimizing.

AB Driver gaze has been shown to be an excellent surrogate for driver attention in intelligent vehicles. With the recent surge of highly autonomous vehicles, driver gaze can be useful for determining the handoff time to a human driver. While there has been significant improvement in personalized driver gaze zone estimation systems, a generalized system which is invariant to different subjects, perspectives, and scales is still lacking. We take a step toward this generalized system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We finetune four popular CNN architectures for this task, and provide extensive comparisons of their outputs. We additionally experiment with different input image patches, and also examine how the image size affects performance. For training and testing the networks, we collect a large naturalistic driving dataset comprising of 11 long drives, driven by ten subjects in two different cars. Our best performing model achieves an accuracy of 95.18% during cross-subject testing, outperforming current state-of-the-art techniques for this task. Finally, we evaluate our best performing model on the publicly available Columbia gaze dataset comprising of images from 56 subjects with varying head pose and gaze directions. Without any training, our model successfully encodes the different gaze directions on this diverse dataset, demonstrating good generalization capabilities.

AB The technological advancements of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) are outpacing the current reg-ulatory regime, potentially resulting in a disconnect between legislators, technology, and CAV stakeholders. Although many studies explore the regulatory requirements of operations of CAVs, studies on regulatory chal-lenges specific to the cybersecurity of CAVs are also emerging and receiving lots of attention among researchers and practitioners. However, studies providing an up-to-date synthesis and analysis on CAVs regulatory re-quirements specific to cyber-risk reduction or mitigation are almost non-existent in the literature. This study aims to overcome this limitation by presenting a comprehensive overview of the role of key Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) stakeholders in CAV's cybersecurity. These stakeholders include road operators, service providers, automakers, consumers, repairers, and the general public.The outcome of this review is an in-depth synthesis of CAV-based ITS stakeholders by visualising their scope in developing a Cybersecurity Regulatory Framework (CRF). The study demonstrated the compliance requirements for ITS communication service providers, regulatory standards for CAVs automakers, policy readiness for CAVs customers and the general public who interact with CAVs, and the role of the CAVs Network Operator Centre in regulating CAVs data flow. Moreover, the study illuminates several critical pathways necessary in future for synthesizing and forecasting the legal landscape of CAV-based transportation systems to integrate the regulatory framework for CAV stakeholders. The paper's findings and conclusions would assist policymakers in developing a comprehensive CRF.

AB As automated driving technology continues to advance, the question of how users prefer to be driven in their new, more passive role is becoming increasingly relevant. In this paper, a real-world study on a German motorway with 42 participants was conducted to analyze driving style preferences for conditional automated driving, taking the participants' personal driving style into account. In the first part, participants' personal driving style (PDS) was recorded during a manual drive in the first half on a given route. For the second half, participants were asked to demonstrate their desired driving style (DDS) for conditional automated driving. In the second part, participants were driven on the same route in a defensive automated vehicle (AV) while rating driving comfort and safety. Subsequently, the relationship between driving style differences and ratings was analyzed. Furthermore, a comparison between PDS and DDS was performed. The results show that very defensive to moderate drivers perceived the AV's driving style, being similar to their own, as equally safe but significantly more comfortable than moderate to very aggressive drivers. No influence of driving style differences was found on the increase in trust. However, a significant increase in trust after experiencing an automated vehicle has been observed. Furthermore, the rated system characteristics of anthropomorphism, safety, and overall driving strategy had a significant influence on driving style preferences for AVs. This study makes an important contribution to answering the question of how users want to be driven in conditional automated driving.

AB In this study, we explicitly modeled how individuals' perceptions of automated vehicle (AV) safety and the importance they place on car ownership affect mode choices involving conventional and automated vehicles in the context of privately owned cars and ridehailing services. We adopted psychometric questions to capture these two latent variables and designed a stated preference survey based on the participants' actual travel patterns. Then, we quantified the impact of these latent variables on mode choices using an integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV) model. We found that both latent variables have a statistically significant effect on mode choices. The results show that car ownership importance has the most potent effect on privately owned cars (conventional car and self-driving car), followed by driverless ridehailing and conventional ridehailing. We also found that changes in safety perception are equivalent to sizable changes in price. We further investigated the impact of improvements in safety perception through four scenarios. The scenario testing results show that as the distribution of perceived safety is compressed toward positive safety perception, the market share of AVs spikes and dominates regular cars. Our results demonstrate that based on our respondents' current understanding of AVs, even if AV prices were comparable to regular cars, we cannot expect widespread use of AVs. However, improvements in AVs' safety and, consequently, consumer safety perception can considerably expand AVs' market share, and may offset the high cost of using the technology.

AB As one of the core technologies of the automatic control system for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), autonomous collision avoidance algorithm is the key to ensure the safe navigation of USVs. In this paper, path planning and dynamic collision avoidance (PPDC) algorithm which obeys COLREGs is proposed for USVs. In order to avoid unnecessary collision avoidance actions, the risk assessment model is developed, which is used to determine the switching time of path planning and dynamic collision avoidance. In order to train the algorithm which complies with the COLREGs, the encounter situation is divided quantitatively, which is regarded as the input state of the system, so that the high-dimensional input is successfully avoided. The state space of the USV is defined by relative parameters to improve the generalization ability of the algorithm, meanwhile, a network structure based on DDPG is designed to achieve the continuous output of thrust and rudder angle. Combined with path planning, collision avoidance, compliance with COLREGs and smooth arrival task, four kinds of reward functions are designed. In order to solve the problem of low training efficiency of experience replay mechanism in DDPG, cumulative priority sampling mechanism is proposed. Through the simulation and verification in a variety of scenarios, it is proved that PPDC algorithm has the function of path planning and dynamic collision avoidance in compliance with COLREGs, which has good real-time performance and security.

ID TRAJECTORY PREDICTION; FRAMEWORK
AB An effective understanding of the environment and accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding dynamic obstacles are indispensable for intelligent mobile systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles, social robots) to achieve safe and high-quality planning when they navigate in highly interactive and crowded scenarios. Due to the existence of frequent interactions and uncertainty in the scene evolution, it is desired for the prediction system to enable relational reasoning on different entities and provide a distribution of future trajectories for each agent. In this paper, we propose a generic generative neural system (called STG-DAT) for multi-agent trajectory prediction involving heterogeneous agents. The system takes a step forward to explicit interaction modeling by incorporating relational inductive biases with a dynamic graph representation and leverages both trajectory and scene context information. We also employ an efficient kinematic constraint layer applied to vehicle trajectory prediction. The constraint not only ensures physical feasibility but also enhances model performance. Moreover, the proposed prediction model can be easily adopted by multi-target tracking frameworks. The tracking accuracy proves to be improved by empirical results. The proposed system is evaluated on three public benchmark datasets for trajectory prediction, where the agents cover pedestrians, cyclists and on-road vehicles. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves better performance than various baseline approaches in terms of prediction and tracking accuracy.

AB Accurate positioning and navigation play a vital role in vehicle-related applications, such as autonomous driving and precision agriculture. With the rapid development of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Precise Point Positioning (PPP) technique, as a global positioning solution, has been widely applied due to its convenient operation. Nevertheless, the performance of PPP is severely affected by signal interference, especially in GNSS-challenged environments. Inertial Navigation System (INS) aided GNSS can significantly improve the continuity and accuracy of navigation in harsh environments, but suffers from degradation during GNSS outages. LiDAR (Laser Imaging, Detection, and Ranging)-Inertial Odometry (LIO), which has performed well in local navigation, can restrain the divergence of Inertial Measurement Units (IMU). However, in long-range navigation, error accumulation is inevitable if no external aids are applied. To improve vehicle navigation performance, we proposed a tightly coupled GNSS PPP/INS/LiDAR (GIL) integration method, which tightly integrates the raw measurements from multi-GNSS PPP, Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS)-IMU, and LiDAR to achieve high-accuracy and reliable navigation in urban environments. Several experiments were conducted to evaluate this method. The results indicate that in comparison with the multi-GNSS PPP/INS tightly coupled solution the positioning Root-Mean-Square Errors (RMSEs) of the proposed GIL method have the improvements of 63.0%, 51.3%, and 62.2% in east, north, and vertical components, respectively. The GIL method can achieve decimeter-level positioning accuracy in GNSS partly-blocked environment (i.e., the environment with GNSS signals partly-blocked) and meter-level positioning accuracy in GNSS difficult environment (i.e., the environment with GNSS hardly used). Besides, the accuracy of velocity and attitude estimation can also be enhanced with the GIL method.

AB Collision warning system plays a key role in the prevention of driving distractions and drowsy driving. Previous studies have proven the advantages of tactile warnings in reducing driver's brake response time. At the same time, tactile warnings have been proved effective in take-over request (TOR) for partially autonomous vehicles.
   How the performance of tactile warnings can be optimized is an ongoing hot research topic in this field. Thus, the presented low-cost driving simulation software and methods are introduced to attract more researchers to take part in the investigation. The presented protocol has been divided into five sections: 1) participants, 2) driving simulation software configuration, 3) driving simulator preparation, 4) vibrating toolkit configuration and preparation, and 5) conducting the experiment.
   In the exemplar study, participants wore the tactile vibrating toolkit and performed an established car-following task using the customized driving simulation software. The front vehicle braked intermittently, and vibrating warnings were delivered whenever the front vehicle was braking. Participants were instructed to respond as quickly as possible to the sudden brakes of the front vehicle. Driving dynamics, such as the brake response time and brake response rate, were recorded by the simulation software for data analysis.
   The presented protocol offers insight into the exploration of the effectiveness of tactile warnings on different body locations. In addition to the car-following task that is demonstrated in the exemplar experiment, this protocol also provides options to apply other paradigms to the driving simulation studies by making simple software configuration without any code development. However, it is important to note that due to its affordable price, the driving simulation software and hardware introduced here may not be able to fully compete with other high-fidelity commercial driving simulators. Nevertheless, this protocol can act as an affordable and user-friendly alternative to the general high-fidelity commercial driving simulators.

AB One of the primary requirements in cellular-enabled multiunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) Internet of Things (IoT) networks is to preserve data rates according to the IoT users' (IUs) requirements. The mobility of IUs, 3-D movement of UAVs, environmental conditions, and bandwidth allocation to the IUs increase the challenges to maintain the data rates due to the continual change in the channel state. A constant extraction of channel state is crucial in this regard. We construct a sum-rate maximization problem considering the channel-state information (CSI). Unlike previous work, we propose CSI-driven data rate optimization for multi-UAV IoT networks (CARTEL). First, it allocates optimized bandwidth to IUs and accomplishes UAV-IU associations by adopting the matrix minima method. Subsequently, it maximizes the sum-rate invoking four modules: 1) parameter selector (PS); 2) IU tracker (IT); 3) path-loss estimator (PE); and 4) policy generator (PG). PS, IT, and PE help to extract the CSI by selecting suitable environmental parameters, tracking the IU mobility, and estimating the path loss, respectively. Finally, PG maximizes the data rates by adjusting the 3-D position and transmitting the power of a UAV. Extensive simulation results depict that the sum-rate in CARTEL improves by 26.03% and 65.46% than learn-as-you-fly (LAYF) and random selection (RS), respectively.

AB Utilizing the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm to realize location awareness of ground users (GUs) is a promising technology in green aerial Internet of Things (IoT) systems. However, a typical UAV-based positioning system is frequently applied in dense urban areas, where the traditional satellite positioning systems are severely impaired. Due to the co-frequency interference and the inevitable defect of limited resources of the positioning anchors, the UAVs positioning ability and system resource utilization suffer serious challenges. In this article, we propose a novel ranging code design for UAV swarm self-positioning, which consists of the code truncation algorithm and Greedy-based code group optimization algorithm, aiming to obtain the code group with the optimal correlation characteristics and shorter code length based on the pseudo noise (PN) code. In particular, the design can flexibly change the truncated length, so as to ensure the self-positioning accuracy with less positioning resource. To evaluate the influence of the proposed design for the self-positioning of UAVs on the aerial IoT, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of UAVs self-positioning is provided, and based on this, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of GUs location estimate is derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the ranging code design is a superior way for future green aerial IoT in both positioning and resource utilization, as compared with a state-of-the-art approach.

AB When there are unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) performing their specifically assigned tasks in the air, some of them still have available resources to access different ground communication networks to improve their communication performance, especially for the wireless sensor network. Technically, when they execute their own given missions with predetermined trajectories, they can also provide opportunistic assistance for terrestrial networks at the same time. In this article, we solve an opportunistic UAV-assisted data transmission problem in a wireless sensor network from a novel perspective. In consideration of UAVs dynamic behaviors, varying transmission tasks, and real-time matching between UAVs and sensor clusters, we propose to jointly optimize UAV scheduling and power control aiming to obtain optimal policies to maximize the network data transmission in a long run under the opportunistic access mode. We reformulate this optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and take deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as our tool to obtain solutions. We develop a DQN-based and a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based optimization approaches to adjust the power allocation of cluster heads, and the scheduling and bandwidth allocation of UAVs during their missions over the covered area to improve the whole network data transmission performance. Simulation results demonstrate the validity and superiority of our proposed approaches compared with other benchmark policies in different perspectives.

AB Fully autonomous vehicles and the need to improve road safety have led to increased demands on the reliability of various advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Automotive radar is a key component of ADAS as it adds both safety and comfort features in vehicles. A key challenge in developing automotive radar is demonstrating reliability especially in corner cases. Building and testing radar systems for corner cases is time-consuming, costly, and impractical. Simulation is the only practical way of investigating the countless possible automotive radar corner cases. An interesting corner case is the reduction of radar returns due to sharp road bends. Specifically, crucial targets with low radar cross sections (RCS) such as pedestrians can become invisible to radar when driving around sharp road bends. In this article, a high fidelity, full physics-based simulation of a 77GHz automotive radar scene will be used to investigate this corner case. The dependence of radar returns on the position of an ego vehicle negotiating a sharp bend will be presented. Results from these simulations show a pedestrian disappearing from view at an approaching angle of 60 degrees with a degradation of over 40dB in pedestrian radar returns. Using results from this study, a terrain-adaptive technique for improving radar target detection capabilities is proposed. This technique is shown to improve pedestrian radar returns by over 26dB. Improved radar returns can help in early detection of pedestrians and other relevant targets. Early target detection can help reduce accidents while potentially saving pedestrian lives.

TI Influence of Large-Scale Freestream Turbulence on the Performance of a
   Thin Airfoil
SO AIAA JOURNAL

ID SEPARATION BUBBLE; DYNAMIC-STALL; LEADING-EDGE
AB Micro air vehicles are typically small in size And are remotely controlled or autonomous aircraft that fly slowly (50, 000 < Reynolds number <206, 000) and very close to the Earth's surface. Due to the combined influences of low Reynolds number effects and the high levels of freestream turbulence, present within the atmospheric boundary layer, micro air vehicles are very difficult to control/fly outdoors. Freestream turbulence present within the atmospheric boundary layer can generally be characterized in terms of its intensity and integral length scale. This work provides insights on the individual influence of turbulence intensity and longitudinal integral length scales, of the order to typical micro air vehicles, on airfoil performance at low Reynolds numbers. The performance of a thin flat-plate airfoil was assessed by taking time varying surface pressure measurements when the airfoil was subjected to a range of large-scale turbulence conditions, starting from nominally smooth flow to varying turbulence intensities while keeping longitudinal integral length scale constant and vice versa. Smoke-flow visualization was also conducted to provide qualitative insights on the flow structure over the airfoil. It was identified that turbulence intensity and integral length scale had an opposing influence on the lift curve slope while increase in both resulted an increase in C-Lmax and significant delay in stall. Elevated levels of turbulence had a relatively lesser influence on the pressure drag, and the influence of turbulence intensity and length scale on the pitching moment coefficient was considerable only at higher angles of attack.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION
AB For the past decade, there has been a significant increase in customer usage of public transport applications in smart cities. These applications rely on various services, such as communication and computation, provided by additional nodes within the smart city environment. However, these services are delivered by a diverse range of cloud computing-based servers that are widely spread and heterogeneous, leading to cybersecurity becoming a crucial challenge among these servers. Numerous machine-learning approaches have been proposed in the literature to address the cybersecurity challenges in heterogeneous transport applications within smart cities. However, the centralized security and scheduling strategies suggested so far have yet to produce optimal results for transport applications. This work aims to present a secure decentralized infrastructure for transporting data in fog cloud networks. This paper introduces Multi-Objectives Reinforcement Federated Learning Blockchain (MORFLB) for Transport Infrastructure. MORFLB aims to minimize processing and transfer delays while maximizing long-term rewards by identifying known and unknown attacks on remote sensing data in-vehicle applications. MORFLB incorporates multi-agent policies, proof-of-work hashing validation, and decentralized deep neural network training to achieve minimal processing and transfer delays. It comprises vehicle applications, decentralized fog, and cloud nodes based on blockchain reinforcement federated learning, which improves rewards through trial and error. The study formulates a combinatorial problem that minimizes and maximizes various factors for vehicle applications. The experimental results demonstrate that MORFLB effectively reduces processing and transfer delays while maximizing rewards compared to existing studies. It provides a promising solution to address the cybersecurity challenges in intelligent transport applications within smart cities. In conclusion, this paper presents MORFLB, a combination of different schemes that ensure the execution of transport data under their constraints and achieve optimal results with the suggested decentralized infrastructure based on blockchain technology.

AB The fast-growing market of autonomous vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, and fleets in general necessitates the design of smart and automatic navigation systems considering the stochastic latency along different paths in the traffic network. The longstanding shortest path problem in a deterministic network, whose counterpart in a congestion game setting is Wardrop equilibrium, has been studied extensively, but it is well known that finding the notion of an optimal path is challenging in a traffic network with stochastic arc delays. In this work, we propose three classes of risk-averse equilibria for an atomic stochastic congestion game in its general form where the arc delay distributions are load dependent and not necessarily independent of each other. The three classes are risk-averse equilibrium (RAE), mean-variance equilibrium (MVE), and conditional value at risk level alpha equilibrium (CVaR $_{alpha}$ E) whose notions of risk-averse best responses are based on maximizing the probability of taking the shortest path, minimizing a linear combination of mean and variance of path delay, and minimizing the expected delay at a specified risky quantile of the delay distributions, respectively. We prove that for any finite stochastic atomic congestion game, the risk-averse, mean-variance, and CVaR $_{alpha}$ equilibria exist. We show that for risk-averse travelers, the Braess paradox may not occur to the extent presented originally since players do not necessarily travel along the shortest path in expectation, but they take the uncertainty of travel time into consideration as well. We show through some examples that the price of anarchy can be improved when players are risk-averse and travel according to one of the three classes of risk-averse equilibria rather than the Wardrop equilibrium.

AB The increasing demand for more sensors inside vehicles pursues the intention of making vehicles more "intelligent". In this context, the vision of fully connected and autonomous cars is becoming more tangible and will turn into a reality in the coming years. The use of these intelligent transport systems will allow the integration of efficient performance in terms of route control, fuel consumption, and traffic administration, among others. Future vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication will require a wider bandwidth as well as lower latencies than current technologies can offer, to support high-constraint safety applications and data exhaustive information exchanges. To this end, recent investigations have proposed the adoption of the millimeter wave (mmWave) bands to achieve high throughput and low latencies. However, mmWave communications come with high constraints for implementation due to higher free-space losses, poor diffraction, poor signal penetration, among other channel impairments for these high-frequency bands. In this work, a V2X communication channel in the mmWave (28 GHz) band is analyzed by a combination of an empirical study and a deterministic simulation with an in-house 3D ray-launching algorithm. Multiple mmWave V2X links has been modeled for a complex heterogeneous urban scenario in order to capture and analyze different propagation phenomena, providing full volumetric estimation of frequency/power as well as time domain parameters. Large- and small-scale propagation parameters are obtained for a combination of different situations, taking into account the obstruction between the transceivers of vehicles of distinct sizes. These results can aid in the development of modeling techniques for the implementation of mmWave frequency bands in the vehicular context, with the capability of adapting to different scenario requirements in terms of network topology, user density, or transceiver location. The proposed methodology provides accurate wireless channel estimation within the complete volume of the scenario under analysis, considering detailed topological characteristics.

AB Next-generation communication networks have become widely popular as ad-hoc networks, broadly categorized as the mobile nodes based on mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET) and the vehicular nodes based vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET). VANET is aimed at maintaining safety to vehicle drivers by begin autonomous communication with the nearby vehicles. Each vehicle in the ad-hoc network performs as an intelligent mobile node characterized by high mobility and formation of dynamic networks. The ad-hoc networks are decentralized dynamic networks that need efficient and secure communication requirements due to the vehicles being persistently in motion. These networks are more susceptible to various attacks like Warm Hole attacks, denial of service attacks and Black Hole Attacks. The paper is a novel attempt to examine and investigate the security features of the routing protocols in VANET, applicability of AODV (Ad hoc On Demand) protocol to detect and tackle a particular category of network attacks, known as the Black Hole Attacks. A new algorithm is proposed to enhance the security mechanism of AODV protocol and to introduce a mechanism to detect Black Hole Attacks and to prevent the network from such attacks in which source node stores all route replies in a look up table. This table stores the sequences of all route reply, arranged in ascending order using PUSH and POP operations. The priority is calculated based on sequence number and discard the RREP having presumably very high destination sequence number. The result show that proposed algorithm for detection and prevention of Black Hole Attack increases security in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) and reduces the effect of malicious node in the VANET.

AB In the complicated or hard-to-reach communication areas, sometimes much higher average achievable rate (AAR) or wider coverage is in urgent and temporary need. To address this challenge, this article proposes a novel amplify-and-forward (AF) relay-based cooperation communication scheme with reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enhancing. The UAV acts as a moving RIS in the sky, which provides additional links to enhance the performance of the AF relay-based cooperation on the ground. Aiming to maximize the AAR of the proposed scheme, we jointly optimize the trajectory of UAV and the phase shift matrices of RIS over total time frames. At first, we decompose the original intractable problem into two subproblems of the phase shift matrices optimization and trajectory optimization. Subsequently, the optimal phase shift matrices are achieved by aligning the phases of received signals. Since the trajectory optimization subproblem is still complicated and nonconvex, we apply the successive convex approximation (SCA) method to reformulate it into a convex problem and further solve it by iterative method. Simulation results demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed scheme as compared with the benchmark schemes and also reveal the effects of various factors on its performance.

AB Digital maps of the transportation network are the foundation of future mobility solutions. Autonomous and connected vehicles rely on real-time, at-scale updating of the environment in which they operate. Successful operation in a hybrid environment, where human and machine intelligence coexist, requires explicit knowledge of the traffic regulator infrastructure. Future generation traffic management strategies and path planning systems must be tightly integrated with the regulator infrastructure in order to improve traffic dynamics and reduce congestion in urban environments. In this article, we present Intersense, a regulator identification and categorization system that leverages raw, naturalistic GPS trajectory data to infer the existence and type of regulators present at network intersections. A supervised learning approach, based on the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, combines infrastructure and vehicle telemetry data features to analyze movement patterns vehicles follow when approaching intersections. For the most widely used regulator types (traffic light, stop sign and right of way), the achieved accuracy surpasses 96%. Permutation feature importance is used to evaluate the relative importance of the generated features, providing a detailed view of the classification model and insights for future data collection and processing stages. We showcase the Intersense's adaptability to various GPS data sources with uneven penetration and sampling rates and we illustrate the system's transferability across very diverse cities by performing experiments in San Jose and San Francisco. Finally, the relationship between the number of available trajectories and classification accuracy is derived to determine the necessary data collection investment.

AB Hybrid rice row detection at the pollination stage is critical for the automation of in-field pollination agricultural vehicles. The parental crops of hybrid rice are planted at intervals in seed production fields with narrow inter-row spacing. During the advance of the pollination vehicle, in addition to the centerline of the crop row, information on the crop region boundaries is required to guide the vehicle and prevent it from running over the crop. For complete crop row detection, a novel machine vision-based method was presented to identify each of the individual regions of the crop rows, more than the centerlines, by line-shaped mask scanning combined with the vanishing point of the crop rows. The approach consisted of grayscale transformation, vanishing point detection, crop region identification, boundary position fine-tuning and crop region segmentation. Its region detection performance outperformed the convolutional neural network-based (CNN-based) methods with an intersection over union (IoU) of 0.832, an accuracy of 90.48%, a recall of 86.36%, a precision of 98.96% and an f1-Score of 92.23%. Its centerline extraction ability was compared with Hough Transform-based and SegNet-based methods on the basis of average lateral distance (ALD) between the ground truth line and the detected line. The proposed method resulted in an ALD of 1.943 pixels in a 640*360 resolution image, which was superior to the Hough Transform-based (5.704) and the SegNet-based (3.555) methods.

AB Purpose The paper aims to investigate the compatibility of manned-aircraft airborne collision avoidance systems (ACAS) for use on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Design/methodology/approach The paper uses the Fault Tree method for defining ACAS model adapted for the UAV operations, with the aim of showing the presence of certain factors that configure in such ACAS system, and whose failure can lead to an adverse event - mid-air collision. Findings Based on the effectiveness analysis of ACAS solution adapted for the UAV operations, for given inputs, it can be concluded that the probability of ACAS failure is on the order of 10-4, as well as that in the case of autonomous ACAS solution for the UAV, the probability is reduced to 10-5. The most influential factors for the failure of the UAV's ACAS are as follows: technical implications on the UAV, human factor, sensor error, communication and C2 link issue. Practical implications The established model could be used both in the UAV's ACAS design and application phases, with the aim of assessing the effectiveness of the adopted solution. The model outputs not only highlight the critical points of the system but also provide the basis for defining the Target Level of Safety (TLOS) for the UAV operations. Originality/value The developed model can be expected to speed up the design and adoption process of ACAS solutions for the UAVs. Also, the paper presents one of the first attempts to quantify TLOS for the UAV operations in the context of collision avoidance systems.

AB The combination of nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provides an effective solution for achieving massive connections and improving spectrum efficiency. However, the related security risk becomes serious due to the line-of-sight (LoS) channels involved and high transmit power for weaker users in NOMA-UAV networks. In this article, a UAV-assisted NOMA transmission scheme is proposed to achieve secure downlink transmission via artificial jamming, where a UAV flies straightly to serve multiple ground users in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. During the flight, only the closest NOMA users are chosen to connect with the UAV in each time slot to achieve high LoS probability. To balance the security and transmission performance, the tradeoff between the jamming power and the sum rate is investigated by jointly optimizing the power allocation, the user scheduling and the UAV trajectory. The formulated problem is mixed-integer and nonconvex due to the coupled variables. To address this, we first decompose the problem into two subproblems of power allocation and trajectory optimization. Then, they are transformed into convex ones via the first-order Taylor expansion. After that, an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the convex problem. Finally, numerical results show that the security of the network is well enhanced and verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

DE IEEE 802.11 Standard; routing protocols; unmanned aerial vehicles;
   vehicular ad hoc networks
AB This paper reports experimental results on self-organizing wireless networks carried by small flying robots. Flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) composed of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are flexible, inexpensive, and fast to deploy. This makes them a very attractive technology for many civilian and military applications. Due to the high mobility of the nodes, maintaining a communication link between the UAVs is a challenging task. The topology of these networks is more dynamic than that of typical mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) and of typical vehicle ad hoc networks. As a consequence, the existing routing protocols designed for MANETs partly fail in tracking network topology changes. In this paper, we compare two different routing algorithms for ad hoc networks: optimized link-state routing (OLSR) and predictive OLSR (P-OLSR). The latter is an OLSR extension that we designed for FANETs; it takes advantage of the Global Positioning System(GPS) information available on board. To the best of our knowledge, P-OLSR is currently the only FANET-specific routing technique that has an available Linux implementation. We present results obtained by both media-access-control (MAC) layer emulations and real-world experiments. In the experiments, we used a testbed composed of two autonomous fixed-wing UAVs and a node on the ground. Our experiments evaluate the link performance and the communication range, as well as the routing performance. Our emulation and experimental results show that P-OLSR significantly outperforms OLSR in routing in the presence of frequent network topology changes.

AB Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a multinode network that exchanges information in an open, wireless environment. Various communication activities exist between IoV entities to share important information such as (ID, location, speed, messages, and traffic information), necessary for network operation. As part of intelligent transportation, IoV is considered a hot subject for researchers, because it is still facing many unresolved challenges, especially those concerning security and privacy. The variation of security-privacy threats that can menace the safety, privacy, and lives of vehicle occupants makes security the leading point of interest. The development of communication protocols for autonomous vehicles opens to us new issues to study and enhance the performance of IoV networks in terms of security and privacy. Several works have been reported, proposing many solutions for practical security challenges including a considerable number of survey-review papers published in respectable channels. The main motive of this review paper is to present the latest developments related to IoV security, as well as to address existing limitations. The high frequency of publication on IoV architecture, security, and new solutions leads us to write a compact, comprehensive, and up-to-date review. Inclusion criteria for selected papers include recent publications, number of citations, and impact of the research. In the present survey paper, the IoV architecture model is defined with all related communication types, and security and privacy issues are analyzed and presented with recently proposed solutions in a clear method. Clear classifications of threats, attacks, protocols, and solutions are presented. Moreover, the use of blockchain-based IoV to improve system security is discussed highlighting the most important trends and taxonomies. The paper was written to be a candidate as the first to read on the topic of the IoV security challenge, presenting problems and solutions in a clear, smooth, complete, and integrated manner.

AB In present times, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely employed in several real time applications due to their autonomous, inexpensive, and compact nature. Aerial image classification in UAVs has gained significant interest in surveillance systems that assist object detection and tracking processes. The advent of deep learning (DL) models paves a way to design effective aerial image classification techniques in UAV networks. In this view, this paper presents a novel optimal Squeezenet with a deep neural network (OSQNDNN) model for aerial image classification in UAV networks. The proposed OSQN-DNN model initially enables the UAVs to capture images using the inbuilt imaging sensors. Besides, the OSQN model is applied as a feature extractor to derive a useful set of feature vectors where the coyote optimization algorithm (COA) is employed to optimally choose the hyperparameters involved in the classical SqueezeNet model. Moreover, the DNN model is utilized as a classifier that aims to allocate proper class labels to the applied input aerial images. Furthermore, the usage of COA for hyperparameter tuning of the SqueezeNet model helps to considerably boost the overall classification performance. For examining the enhanced aerial image classification performance of the OSQN-DNN model, a series of experiments were performed on the benchmark UCM dataset. The experimental results pointed out that the OSQN-DNN model has resulted in a maximum accuracy of 98.97% and a minimum running time of 1.26mts.

AB The conventional methods used to estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of linear frequency modulated (LFM) signals at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), such as the echoes reflected by a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), demonstrate major performance deterioration. In order to eliminate the problem and achieve highly accurate DOA estimation for low-SNR echoes, this paper proposes a novel estimation approach that applies two accumulative methods based on fractional Fourier transform (FrFT). According to the findings of this paper, the algorithm directly accumulates the FrFT result of each echo when it is not possible to determine in advance the speed of the target. When the radial velocity of the small UAV has been estimated ahead of time, the algorithm performs phase compensation to enhance the accumulative effect. Through coherent integration, the algorithm then extracts all the peaks of the target echo waveform, which are then used for the construction of a fractional autocorrelation matrix. Thereafter, multiple signal classification is employed for DOA estimation. Furthermore, with the proposed algorithm, the DOAs of multi-target echoes can be estimated accurately. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was verified using Monte-Carlo simulation trials, and the root-mean-square-error of DOA estimation was close to the Cramer-Rao bound.

AB With the development of autonomous vehicle technology, the controller area network (CAN) bus has become the de facto standard for an in-vehicle communication system because of its simplicity and efficiency. However, without any encryption and authentication mechanisms, the in-vehicle network using the CAN protocol is susceptible to a wide range of attacks. Many studies, which are mostly based on machine learning, have proposed installing an intrusion detection system (IDS) for anomaly detection in the CAN bus system. Although machine learning methods have many advantages for IDS, previous models usually require a large amount of labeled data, which results in high time and labor costs. To handle this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning-based convolutional adversarial autoencoder model in this paper. The proposed model combines two popular deep learning models: autoencoder and generative adversarial networks. First, the model is trained with unlabeled data to learn the manifolds of normal and attack patterns. Then, only a small number of labeled samples are used in supervised training. The proposed model can detect various kinds of message injection attacks, such as DoS, fuzzy, and spoofing, as well as unknown attacks. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves the highest F1 score of 0.9984 and a low error rate of 0.1% with limited labeled data compared to other supervised methods. In addition, we show that the model can meet the real-time requirement by analyzing the model complexity in terms of the number of trainable parameters and inference time. This study successfully reduced the number of model parameters by five times and the inference time by eight times, compared to a state-of-the-art model.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB This research aimed to identify objects from a real-time video (30 Hz) stream transmitted from a low-altitude long-endurance (LALE) fixed-wing hybrid vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) designed for asset monitoring. Illumination, rotation, and scale variations complicate the video frames created by UAVs' optical payload, requiring preprocessing. Detection, identification, and classification of different objects (or targets) from a real-time video feed require fast and reliable detection algorithms, models, and computation. The weight restrictions and the onboard power supply only allowed for a Raspberry Pi onboard the UAV, thereby seriously limiting computational power. Image frames were created from the video data after enhancing its quality using image processing algorithms. Then, anchor-based object detection algorithms were applied to the processed and enhanced image frames. The Raspberry Pi at airspeeds of 16-18 m/s requires fast object detection algorithms having minimal computational overhead. A supervised learning technique using a supporting library further augmented the real-time detection at the ground control station (GCS). Four scenarios trained the candidate algorithms, namely: 1) helipad; 2) green area; 3) burned area; and 4) under construction area. The single-shot multibox detector (SSD) aided the supervised learning process during trials utilizing the labeled image datasets. The comparison of detection and identification performance of the SSD with ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 backbones with other methods, such as Faster-RCNN with four backbone architectures, namely: 1) ResNet-101; 2) ResNet-50; 3) deformable ResNet; and 4) FPN in four detection scenarios indicated better precision and reduced detection delays.

AB Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) supporting the seamless operation of autonomous vehicles introduce various network-connected devices. The widespread devices are engaged in VANETs so that users can enjoy advantageous computing and reliable services. The combination brings in massive real-time message propagation and dissemination, which would be leveraged by the adversaries to perform data association, integration analysis and privacy mining. To address such challenges, existing authentication schemes use n pseudonym certificates for predefined k times and try to keep the vehicles anonymous. These schemes require fresh certificates for each authentication process, which cost more communication and storage resources. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving authentication protocol (P2BA) in bilinear groups, where a registered vehicle signs a traffic-related message and sends it to the nearby Roadside Unit (RSU) together with its blinded certificate. The RSU is able to independently check the message for validity based on a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof protocol. In this way, the computation time has been reduced from O(n) to O(1) while the storage overhead from O(nk) to O(n) compared to anonymous authentication protocols. Moreover, our scheme provides privacy properties such as anonymity and unlinkability. The simulations show that the message authentication can be processed by individual RSUs within 1 ms under the batchenabled scheme, which outperforms the existing schemes in terms of computation overhead and latency.

AB Performance of global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) mounted on aerial platforms could be degraded by the presence of jamming or spoofing threats. Detection of jamming and spoofing is essential considering practical applications of satellite navigation in passenger aircrafts, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), helicopters and fighters. Different algorithms and methods have been proposed for detection of these threats; however, their usage has many limitations because of their demanding weight, size and computational complexity, when embedded on aerial systems. In this study, the authors develop a theoretical framework to detect the presence of the threat of UAVs. The idea is based on the fact that, due to the UAV motion, the samples of received signal power from a fixed threat and from a GNSS satellite have different empirical probability density functions. Moreover, by using two antennas (an omnidirectional and a down-tilted-directional), they introduce a new method to distinguish between aerial and ground-based threats. The proposed algorithms have a low-computational burden and can consider the fading loss as well. Simulation results show the superior performance of the proposed methods, in terms of detection and false alarm probability, compared to the existing methods.

AB A recovery system for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using a steerable parafoil is an attractive concept. However, due to the complex interaction between the parafoil and the UAV, this parafoil system has not seen widespread use in the UAV recovery. Under the influence of the UAV, the suspension lines of the system are not always tight, so most of the existing models do not work. To analyze the parafoil and UAV interaction when the suspension lines are tight or slack, this study presents a method for improving a multibody dynamic model for a parafoil-UAV system. The parafoil and UAV are modeled as usual, while the suspension lines are modeled as a combination of several linear viscoelastic elements. All models are coupled, and the nonlinear equations of motion are then derived. To analyze the influence of the invalid suspension lines, this improved model has been compared with an 8-degrees of freedom model. The comparisons demonstrate that the simulation results of the improved model and the 8-DoF model are similar under a small control input. However, under a large control input, the results become significantly different. In an actual flight test, the accuracy of this improved model is found to be better than the 8-DoF model. Finally, an attitude optimal control system is designed for this improved model. The performance of this autonomous control is presented at the end of this paper.

AB In this paper, a flight control and guidance method for a scaled-down quad tilt prop personal air vehicle (PAV) is presented through simulations and flight tests. The developed scaled-down PAV does not fully transit into a fixed-wing flight mode, but longitudinally tiltable nacelles are used to control the longitudinal translation speed. This design concept can realize a flight maneuver with minimized attitude change because it is only necessary to tilt the nacelles of the propellers and not the attitude angle of the whole body. Although controls of a similar tilt-rotor and quad-tilt vehicles have been reported, a research on a guidance algorithm of a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) PAV is deficient. Therefore, this paper focuses on the guidance algorithm for the quad tilt prop PAV that requires minimized fluctuation for a passenger. The dynamic behavior and responses of attitude and velocity controllers are identified with reasonable accuracy for a simulated test. Using this model, a guidance algorithm is developed for a circular path to minimize variation of a control input and system states. Through the simulated evaluation against the widely-used proportional navigation guidance algorithm, it was found that the proposed circular path guidance method has better performance in terms of total variation. In addition, through the flight test, the feasibility of the current concept for using the propeller nacelle tilt angle as a control input in forward speed control of a quad tilt prop PAV is proved.

AB The concept of the "connected car " offers the potential for safer, more enjoyable and more efficient driving and eventually autonomous driving. However, in urban Vehicular Networks (VNs), the high mobility of vehicles along roads poses major challenges to the routing protocols needed for a reliable and flexible vehicular communications system. Thus, urban VNs rely on static Road-Side-Units (RSUs) to forward data and to extend coverage across the network. In this paper, we first propose a new Q-learning-based routing algorithm, namely Infrastructure-aided Traffic-Aware Routing (I-TAR), which leverages the static wired RSU infrastructure for packet forwarding. Then, we focus on the multi-source, multi-destination problem and the effect this imposes on node availability, as nodes also participate in other communications paths. This motivates our new hybrid approach, namely Hybrid Infrastructure-aided Traffic Aware Routing (HI-TAR) that aims to select the best Vehicle-to-Vehicle/Infrastructure (V2V/I) route. Our findings demonstrate that I-TAR can achieve up to 19% higher average packet-delivery-ratio (APDR) compared to the state-of-the-art. Under a more realistic scenario, where node availability is considered, a decline of up to 51% in APDR performance is observed, whereas the proposed HI-TAR in turn can increase the APDR performance by up to 50% compared to both I-TAR and the state-of-the-art. Finally, when multiple source-destination vehicle pairs are considered, all the schemes that model and consider node availability, i.e. limited-availability, achieve from 72.2% to 82.3% lower APDR, when compared to those that do not, i.e. assuming full-availability. However, HI-TAR still provides 34.6% better APDR performance than I-TAR, and similar to 40% more than the state-of-the-art.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are considered to be excellent candidates of airborne relays or base stations for the 3-D ad hoc networks. They can be promptly deployed to serve large bursts of communication traffic in cellular networks or provide timely network support in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). It is desirable but challenging to dynamically find the optimal deployment strategy of UAVs in the air to provide a better Quality of Service (QoS) for a UAV-assisted wireless network. In this article, we propose a novel Gibbs-sampling distributed algorithm (GSDA) to dynamically optimize the UAVs' locations when they serve as airborne base stations for ground users. In our proposed GSDA, channel capacity is adopted as the objective function and a distributed approach is employed such that each UAV is able to optimize its location independently and asynchronously. Furthermore, we propose a polynomial-regression-based predictor to make use of users' moving trajectories and take advantage of the predicted users' future locations to expedite the convergence of the GSDA. Meanwhile, we also compare our proposed GSDA with the existing distributed genetic algorithm. The asynchronization of UAV location updates and the location errors are also investigated to evaluate the robustness of the GSDA. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed novel GSDA is quite robust and superior to the existing distributed genetic algorithm.

AB An electric vehicle (EV) charger can operate in an autonomous mode to create its own grid by utilizing the EV batteries during grid blackouts. This requires three-phase four-wire inverters as the grid-side ac/dc port of the EV charger to supply unbalanced loads. Although silicon carbide (SiC) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) can be adopted to increase the power density of these inverters, the second-order ripples exhibited on the dc bus caused by unbalanced loads need to be mitigated by a large dc capacitance-increasing the size of inverters. In this article, an improved neutral leg for three-phase four-wire inverters is presented, which not only provides the neutral current for unbalanced loads, such as a conventional neutral leg, but also reduces the second-order ripples on the dc bus without the need for additional hardware components. Furthermore, it can reduce by 50% the dc capacitance compared to its conventional counterpart. A control strategy featuring power decoupling capability is included for the improved leg. It was built with SiC MOSFETs and experimentally assessed with a three-phase inverter, with results verifying its effectiveness. For completeness, the performance of the improved neutral leg is also evaluated through simulations in PLECS and compared to a conventional neutral leg.

AB Accurate localization is an important component of the vehicle's autonomous navigation. The appearance of the moving objects may lead to a feature-matching error with the map features, thereby causing a serious decline in localization accuracy. A neuromorphic vision (NeuroIV) sensor is a kind of dynamic vision sensor with the properties of high temporal resolution, movement capture, and lightweight computation. In view of this, this research proposes to combine the NeuroIV and LiDAR points to acquire the static landmark features and robust navigation localization. However, as a younger and smaller research field compared to RGB computer vision, NeuroIV vision is rarely associated with the intelligent vehicle. For this purpose, we built a novel dataset recorded by NeuroIV sensor, and a state-of-the-art YOLO-small network is designed to detect the moving objects with the dataset. In order to completely deduct the whole dynamic zones, a sensors' novel fusion model is built by the zones' segmentation and matching, so the LiDAR's static environment is obtained completely by the remained points. By evaluating different types of LiDAR points, the feature-matching error can be alleviated further, making the localization more accurate. Together with qualitative and quantitative results, this work provides a moving objects' detection improvement of 14.13% mAP with the new NeuroIV dataset and an obvious localization accuracy improvement with LiDAR points' evaluation.

AB The efficiency and profitability of photovoltaic (PV) plants are highly controlled by their operation and maintenance (O&M) procedures. Today, the effective diagnosis of any possible fault of PV plants remains a technical and economic challenge, especially when dealing with large-scale PV plants. Currently, PV plant monitoring is carried out by either electrical performance measurements or image processing. The first approach presents limited fault detection ability, it is costly and time-consuming, and it is incapable of fast identification of the physical location of the fault. In the second approach, Infrared Thermography (IRT) imaging has been used for the characterization of PV module failures, but their setup and processing are rather complex and an experienced technician is required. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for IRT imaging of PV plants for health status monitoring of PV modules has been identified as a cost-effective approach that offers 10--15 fold lower inspection times than conventional techniques. However, previous works have not performed a comprehensive approach in the context of automated UAV inspection using IRT. This work provides a fully automated approach for the: (a) detection, (b) classification, and (c) geopositioning of the thermal defects in the PV modules. The system has been tested on a real PV plant in Spain. The obtained results indicate that an autonomous solution can be implemented for a full characterization of the thermal defects.

AB The significance of thermal heterogeneities in small surface water bodies as drivers of mixing and for habitat provision is increasingly recognized, yet obtaining three-dimensionally-resolved observations of the thermal structure of lakes and rivers remains challenging. Remote observations of water temperature from aerial platforms are attractive: such platforms do not require shoreline access; they can be quickly and easily deployed and redeployed to facilitate repeated sampling and can rapidly move between target locations, allowing multiple measurements to be made during a single flight. However, they are also subject to well-known limitations, including payload, operability and a tradeoff between the extent and density over which measurements can be made within restricted flight times. This paper introduces a novel aerial thermal sensing platform that lowers a temperature sensor into the water to record temperature measurements throughout a shallow water column and presents results from initial field experiments comparing in situ temperature observations to those made from the UAS platform. These experiments show that with minor improvements, UASs have the potential to enable high-resolution 3D thermal mapping of a approximate to 1-ha lake in 2-3 flights (circa 2 h), sufficient to resolve diurnal variations. This paper identifies operational constraints and key areas for further development, including the need for the integration of a faster temperature sensor with the aerial vehicle and better control of the sensor depth, especially when near the water surface.

AB For plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, deeper battery discharge provides more electrical energy at a lower cost than fossil fuel, which reduces the overall energy consumption cost. However, it also accelerates battery degradation and increases the equivalent cost of battery life loss. Therefore, the battery depth of discharge (DOD) needs to be optimized to minimize the overall cost. For connected plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, the longitudinal velocity planning determines the energy demands, which directly affects the charging or discharging current to the battery and therefore affects DOD, aging, and fuel consumption as well. For connected plug-in hybrid electric buses running on fixed routes, in order to coordinate the velocity planning and battery health protection, this paper proposes a real-time energy management strategy aimed at achieving the minimum overall cost by optimizing the DOD and velocity planning. The proposed method is evaluated in an urban traffic scenario, and the goal of achieving optimal DOD is divided into a co-optimization problem over each moving horizon, where the velocity planning and energy management are traded off by minimizing the sum of driving safety cost, energy consumption cost, and equivalent cost of battery life loss. The results show that the proposed far-sighted economy-oriented methodology is superior to a short-sighted velocity planning and energy management method, and has an obvious advantage in the total cost compared with other conventional methods using a preset DOD. Moreover, the impacts of possible communication delays and prediction horizon lengths on the optimization performance and computational cost are investigated. The proposed method provides a promising management strategy for future connected and autonomous mobility design, which can mitigate battery capacity degradation and improve the fuel economy.

AB Objectives: To explore whether the driving style is static or dynamic, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of drivers' personality traits and driving scenarios on left-turn behaviors. We also evaluated drivers' perceptions in different situations to understand the occurrence of unreasonable driving behaviors. Methods: Two self-administered questionnaires were used to calculate participants' personality dimensions and driving style scores, respectively. Two experimental tasks were conducted by driving simulator with different weather, light, and speed of the opposing through vehicles. Results: Results showed that personality was significantly related to driving style. Neither the left-turn response process nor gap acceptance maneuvers were directly influenced by light conditions. In the test area, the average speed and the minimum speed of the left-turning vehicle, as well as the distance of the vehicle from the collision point when the speed is the smallest were significantly related to the weather, interaction type, and velocity difference, and the time to collision during which first brake or release gas pedal occurs was significantly related to velocity difference. Three out of the four driving conditions (except for light conditions) exhibited a statistically significant effect on the judgment of the arrival time of autonomous vehicles and their risk assessment, and personality was significantly related to risk assessment. Moreover, dangerous driving behavior was found to be significantly associated with drivers' driving personality. Conclusions: The driving style is dynamic and influenced by personality and driving conditions. Not only the wrong assessment of driving scenarios may lead to danger, but also the driver's personality characteristics such as self-interest, impulsively, and lack of self-confidence will lead to decision-making mistakes even when the judgment of driving scenarios is correct.

AB This article considers minimizing the communications bit error rate (BER) of unmanned aerial vehicles when assisted by intelligent reflecting surfaces. By noting that increasing the number of IRS elements in the presence of phase errors does not necessarily improve the system's BER, it is crucial to use only the elements that contribute to reducing such a parameter. To this end, we propose an efficient algorithm to select the elements that can improve BER. The proposed algorithm has lower complexity and comparable BER to the optimum selection process, which is an NP-hard problem. The accuracy of the estimated phase is evaluated by deriving the probability distribution function (PDF) of the least-square channel estimator, and showing that the PDF can be closely approximated by the von Mises distribution at high signal-to-noise ratios. The obtained analytical and simulation results show that using all the available reflectors can significantly deteriorate the BER, and thus, partial element selection is necessary. It is shown that, in some scenarios, using about 26% of the reflectors provides more than tenfold BER reduction. The number of selected reflectors may drop to only 10% of the total elements. As such, the unassigned 90% of the elements can be allocated to serve other users, and the overhead associated with phase information is significantly reduced.

AB Cotton harvest can be increased by having real-time information on the state of cotton aphid populations. However, traditional cotton aphid monitoring relies on ground sample methods supported by models such as linear regression, resulting in low forecast accuracy. Therefore, this paper purposes to enhance the precision of the remote sensing prediction model by investigating the cotton aphid prediction model construction approach. We explored the effectiveness of the XGBoost algorithm combined with the GWO algorithm and SVR method for cotton aphid prediction relying on vegetation indices derived from UAV multispectral photography. Originally, 12 indices related to cotton aphids were calculated by UAV multispectral reflectance. Additionally, the optimal index combination for pest prediction was determined utilizing analysis of correction and two-way ANOVA, combined with the XGBoost algorithm. Furthermore, a pest prevalence prediction model for cotton aphids was constructed via the SVR methodology associated with the optimal catalog combination, and the model was optimized using the GWO algorithm. Compared with the seven algorithms, experimental results demonstrate that the MSE and MAE of the XGBoostGWO-SVR model are reduced by 90.20% and 70.36% (SVR), 90.14% and 70.26% (XGBoost-SVR), 7.47% and 0.14% (XGBoost-GA-SVR), 5.80% and 0.11% (XGBoost-PSO-SVR), 12.06% and 58.95% (LR), and 84.77% and 89.22% (BPNN), whereas the R-2 is increased by 22.5% (SVR and XGBoost-SVR), 0.3% (LR), and 12.51% (BPNN). The R-2 of the prediction model of XGBoost-SVR combined with GWO, PSO, and GA is not significantly different. Among these models, the XGBoost-GWO-SVR obtained the highest R-2 of 0.980 and the lowest MAE of 2.838.

AB In recent years, as automated vehicle (AV) technologies are advancing at a breathtaking pace, path controlling has engaged increasing attentions among transportation researchers. As an emerging technology for transport management, it employs AVs as mobile actuators to regulate traffic flow on transportation networks, aiming at alleviating inefficiency due to selfish routing. Existing studies have proved the potential of such a path control scheme for mitigating traffic congestion, but research on its competence for environmental management is still lacking. Given above, this paper develops a path control scheme to achieve expected goals of both mobility and emission. Specifically, we assume a fully automated environment where all the vehicles on the network are highly automated and serve as candidates for the path control scheme. We assume that they originally follow the classic user-equilibrium (UE) principle and can be controlled as either system-optimum (SO) or least-emission (LE) users by the central agent. We formulate the mixed traffic equilibrium including the three classes of users as a variational inequality (VI) problem and integrate it as an equilibrium constraint into the optimal control problem. To compensate for the travel utility loss for being controlled, we also propose an integrated path controlling and subsidy scheme, under which travelers who suffer from the control scheme will be compensated with subsidy. The total subsidy, along with the network performance, are considered in the objective function. A sensitivity-analysis-based Frank-Wolfe (SA-FW) method is applied to solve the proposed problems. Using example networks, we test the computational performance of the SA-FW method and examine the control performance of the control scheme under various settings. Based on the numerical results, it is found that considering LE users and environmental benefits renders the control problem more complex than merely achieving SO.

AB The mission of an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) tethered to a small unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is considered. As opposed to the majority of existing tethered UAV work, which assumes a taut tether, this paper addresses the challenge of tether management for a slack, hanging tether in a dynamic ocean environment up to sea state 4 on the Douglas scale. A prototype smart reel system for a UAV-USV team was designed and experimentally validated in controlled and uncontrolled dynamic environments. A reference model for tether control based on static catenary cable theory was extended and shown to be valid through the entire operational envelop. A Kalman filter was developed to fuse slow (4 Hz) differential GPS (dGPS) relative position measurements with fast (100 Hz) inertial measurements, to output a 100 Hz estimate of relative position, relative velocity, and inertial sensor bias. A relative velocity-based gain-scheduled proportional-derivative (PD) controller was developed, and demonstrated robustness to heave, pitch, and roll motion of the USV. Experimental testing with a UAV surrogate showed successful decoupling of heave motion from the UAV altitude in a controlled indoor environment. Taut tether control, in contrast, exhibited 12 times more tether tension at the UAV compared to the controller proposed here. The performance of the tuned controller with feedback from the Kalman filter exhibited minimal deviation from static catenary cable theory during the dynamic experiments. Indoor flight testing showed the developed reference model and controller essentially decoupled the dynamic motion of the USV from that of the UAV; the measured deflections of the UAV altitude and position essentially matched that of untethered flight. Outdoor flights validated the effectiveness of the controller in an unknown dynamic environment, for a larger relative position between the UAV and USV, using the dGPS Kalman filter solution to measure relative position. Initial experimental results look promising for continued on-water testing of hanging-tether UAV/USV teams.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be integrated into wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for smart city applications in several ways. Among them, a UAV can be employed as a relay in a "store-carry and forward" fashion by uploading data from ground sensors and metering devices and, then, downloading it to a central unit. However, both the uploading and downloading phases can be prone to potential threats and attacks. As a legacy from traditional wireless networks, the jamming attack is still one of the major and serious threats to UAV-aided communications, especially when also the jammer is mobile, e.g., it is mounted on a UAV or inside a terrestrial vehicle. In this article, we investigate anti-jamming communications for UAV-aided WSNs operating over doubly selective channels in the downloading phase. In such a scenario, the signals transmitted by the UAV and the malicious mobile jammer undergo both time dispersion due to multipath propagation effects and frequency dispersion caused by their mobility. To suppress high-power jamming signals, we propose a blind physical-layer technique that jointly detects the UAV and jammer symbols through serial disturbance cancelation based on symbol-level post-sorting of the detector output. Amplitudes, phases, time delays, and Doppler shifts-required to implement the proposed detection strategy-are blindly estimated from data through the use of algorithms that exploit the almost-cyclostationarity properties of the received signal and the detailed structure of multicarrier modulation format. Simulation results corroborate the anti-jamming capabilities of the proposed method, for different mobility scenarios of the jammer.

AB Controlling or accessing remotely has become a prevalent form of operating numerous types of platforms and infrastructure. An exploding number of vehicles such as drones or cars, in particular, are being controlled wirelessly or connected through networks. This has brought unanimous concern that today's networked vehicle systems are vulnerable to attacks and the results could be fatal. Unfortunately, in contrast to active investigation on the security of the vehicles themselves, sensors, or communication channels, existing approaches for these real-time, safety-critical systems do not take controllers into enough consideration. In order to protect the controller that performs the arithmetic operations using sensor measurements and generates command signals, we adopt homomorphic cryptography for the controller. It removes risks associated with the management of the secret key inside the controller, by eliminating the need to encrypt and decrypt the data for the mathematical operation within the controller. Specifically, we propose an efficient linearly homomorphic authenticated encryption (LinHAE) scheme for the ground control center of a multi-rotor drone, in a manner that enables real-time operation for safe autonomous flight. To facilitate the linear scheme, we design the ground controller targeted to allow state update using additions and multiplications by a system-specific constant. The proposed LinHAE guarantees the security against eavesdropping and forgery attacks, unlike homomorphic encryption alone that does not provide means to check whether the received signal at the drone side is authentic or compromised. We introduce a LinHAE with security and computational tractability, and describe how it can fit into the standard architecture for drone systems and how the specific controller is implemented. Building on these ingredients, we report the first successful operation of a multi-rotor flying robot that autonomously flies under the ground controller with real-time homomorphic authenticated encryption.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used to perform search and tracking tasks in military and civil fields. To perform these tasks autonomously, a swarm of multiple UAVs need to be endowed with intelligence through machine learning (ML). However, the traditional centralized ML cannot be directly applied in UAV networks, since it is challenging to transmit raw data with limited bandwidth and energy budget. As a distributed manner, federated learning (FL) is more suitable for UAV networks than traditional ML schemes in order to boost edge intelligence for UAVs. Considering the limited energy supply of UAVs, we study how to minimize UAVs' overall training energy consumption by jointly optimizing the local convergence threshold, local iterations, computation resource allocation, and bandwidth allocation, subject to the FL global accuracy guarantee and maximum training latency constraint. The formulated nonconvex mixed-integer programming problem is solved by a joint training and resource allocation optimization algorithm. In addition, we also study how to solve the problem considering fairness among different UAVs by changing the objective to minimizing the maximum energy consumption of UAVs, and extend the aforementioned approach to this problem. Our simulation results show that while satisfying both the training accuracy and latency constraints, the proposed algorithm can reduce more UAVs' overall training energy consumption and the maximum energy consumption in the UAV swarm than four baseline schemes.

AB Due to their promising applications and intriguing characteristics, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be dispatched as flying base stations to serve multiple energy-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors. Moreover, to ensure fresh data collection while providing sustainable energy support to a large set of IoT devices, a required number of UAVs should be deployed to carry out these two tasks efficiently and promptly. Indeed, the data collection requires that UAVs first make Wireless Energy Transfer (WET) to supply IoT devices with the necessary energy in the downlink. Then, IoT devices perform Wireless Information Transmission (WIT) to UAVs in the uplink based on the harvested energy. However, it turns out that when the same UAV performs WIT and WET, its energy usage and the data collection time are severely penalized. Worse yet, it is difficult to efficiently coordinate between UAVs to improve the performance in terms of WET and WIT. This work proposes to divide UAVs into two teams to behave as data collectors and energy transmitters, respectively. A Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) method, called TEAM, is leveraged to jointly optimize both teams' trajectories, minimize the expected Age of Information (AoI), maximize the throughput of IoT devices, minimize the energy utilization of UAVs, and enhance the energy transfer. Simulation results depict that TEAM can effectively synchronize UAV teams and adapt their trajectories while serving a large-scale dynamic IoT environment.

AB Drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are among the most beneficial and emerging technologies, with a wide range of applications that can support the sustainability concerns of smart cities and ultimately improve citizens' quality of life. The goals of this systematic review were to explore the involvement of surveillance drones in smart cities in terms of application status, application areas, proposed models, and characteristics of drones. We conducted this systematic review based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyzes (PRISMA) guidelines. We systematically searched the Web of Science and Scopus for journal articles and conference papers written in English and published up to August 2021. Of the 323 records identified, 43 met the inclusion criteria. Findings showed that surveillance drones were used in seven distinct research fields (transportation, environment, infrastructure, object or people detection, disaster management, data collection, and other applications). Air pollution and traffic monitoring were the dominant application areas. The majority of reviewed models were based on the application of rotary-wing single-drones with the camera as the aerial sensor. Reviewed models showed that the adoption of a single or multiple UAVs, either as a stand-alone technology or integrated with other technologies (e.g., internet of things, wireless sensor networks, convolutional neural networks, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, cloud computing, web applications), can offer efficient and sustainable solutions compared to conventional surveillance methods. This review can benefit academic researchers and practitioners.

AB With the rapid development of the economy, the scale of transmission networks has been expanding, bring higher demands and challenges on transmission line operation and maintenance. In this paper, the multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) safety inspection rules and automatic detailed inspection methods for transmission towers are studied. The theoretical model of multi-rotor UAVs of transmission lines inspection is established. The imaging calculation range of multi-rotor UAV-equipped cameras is determined. According to the inspection theory model, the flight safety judgment standard is designed, and the key parts of the transmission lines that need to be inspected are determined according to the accurate model of the transmission tower. Then the inspection waypoints are manually operated, and the photographing position and angle of each waypoint from the flight control are recorded through the waypoint planning function. Finally, the waypoints are connected in order, and the inspection route is automatically generated to achieve automatic detailed inspection. The inspection efficiency, error analysis and position accuracy comparing the proposed method with some state-of-the-art methods have been evaluated. The results show that the position error of UAVs automatic detailed inspection is less than 10 cm. The error of height is between 1.26 and 1.76 meter. Compared with the traditional manual inspection, the efficiency of multi-rotor UAVs automatic detailed inspection can be increased by 57.98%similar to 62.88% and can be applied to large-scale inspection of transmission lines.

AB Hundreds of new features and functionalities have been introduced as in-vehicle systems (IVS) mature. However, it remains unclear whether these novel designs have appropriately addressed driver preferences and requirements, especially when factors such as geographical or cultural differences are considered. An empirical study was conducted to determine cultural differences between young Chinese and German drivers with respect to (a) preferences for 18 selected IVS and (b) behavioral effects in six secondary driving tasks. Data from 232 Chinese and 94 German drivers were collected through an online questionnaire and the results indicate that young Chinese drivers value most of the selected IVS designs more significantly than the Germans do, except in categories such as radio, navigation and autonomous emergency braking. In addition, rotary with a display screen is the most preferred interaction modality for both groups. As for behavioral effects when performing secondary tasks, young Chinese drivers are more likely to engage in safety-related scenarios while the Germans in efficiency-related scenarios. An ordinal logistic regression analysis suggested a strong correlation between secondary tasks (looking up navigation, dialing the phone and connecting Bluetooth) and behavioral degradation for young Chinese drivers, whereas the six secondary tasks seem to affect German drivers minimally. Based on the preference analysis and attitudes to behavioral impacts, implications for the design of IVS are discussed to better satisfy needs from drivers of different cultural backgrounds.

AB The evolution towards future Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is significantly influenced by enabling telematics and safety services for vehicular use-cases, especially for autonomous driving. These vehicular use-cases have their own network requirements, with a variety of instantaneous requirements and dynamic characterizations that make delivering data via a single Radio Access Technology (RAT) severely challenging. By utilizing current and future network context and vehicular use-case requirements, the RAT selection scheme must select the optimum network that guarantees the continuity and high throughput data transfer. Moreover, the consideration of on-time stochastic queue backlog of all use-cases in each RATs, while maximizing throughput is important for a reliable vehicular use-case deployment. In this paper, we developed a Service-Oriented Joint LSTM Multi-Criteria (SOLMC) RAT selection scheme for Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) networks. The objective of this scheme is to maximize the overall network throughput while reducing the current stochastic queue backlog in deployed RATs. LSTM prediction technique is used as a network filter process that rejects the worst channel quality before the initialization RAT selection scheme. Transmission capacity, connectivity time, data delivery cost, and queue backlog are the decision criteria in our proposed SOLMC RAT scheme. In particular, to characterize the importance of these criteria factors, we construct Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) for each use-case. Extensive simulations are carried out under different network context conditions. The results demonstrate that the SOLMC scheme can significantly achieve up to 47.5% network throughput maximization and 20.42% packet delivery ratio improvement, using lower queue length compared to nearest-RAT-based selection. In addition, implementing LSTM in SOLMC improves the total average throughput by up to 3.1% and 6% packet delivery ratio.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication has become a prominent technology that can effectively assist in IoT systems. The inherent features of UAV such as mobility, flexibility, and fast deployment make it preferable for emergency Internet of Things (IoT) applications. In this paper, we consider a multi-UAV assisted wireless network to support uplink communication for IoT devices distributed over a disaster area. The network involves two types of UAVs: sector UAV (SU) and anchor UAV (AU). The SU hovers at a fixed height over the sector around the temporary base station (TBS), collects the information from the respective IoT devices and relays them to the TBS via AU. The AU revolves continuously around the TBS and relays the information between the SUs and TBS periodically. We aim to improve the uplink capacity of the system. To achieve this, we employ non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), where we jointly optimize the positions of SUs and the power control of IoT devices. We propose a two-step approach to solve this. First, we optimize the position of SU in each sector by minimizing the sum distances of SU from the respective IoT devices. Then, by considering the optimal SU location, we optimize the transmit power of IoT devices using Lagrange dual method. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed scheme improves the system capacity by 22% compared to the state-of-the-art schemes.

AB Radar has emerged as a core sensing technology for many active-safety and comfort related advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) being deployed in today's vehicles. Using radar technology, the ego vehicle can simultaneously detect the range and velocity of multiple targets. With multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) arrays, it is also possible to detect the angle of arrival of targets in azimuth and elevation. 4D automotive radar sensors can determine the range, velocity, azimuth and elevation angles-of-arrival (AoA) of targets in a traffic scene. Currently, radar-returns from traffic scenes have been mainly obtained through measurement. While measurement is valuable, it can be costly, time consuming, restrictive due to practicality issues and also unsafe in some corner-case traffic scenarios. Simulation has emerged as a potential alternative source of synthetic radar-returns that can be used to develop, test and refine signal processing techniques and detection algorithms. A key challenge in simulation has been to retain an accurate representation of actors in full-scale traffic scenes while still being able to solve electrically large problems efficiently. The introduction of MIMO arrays further increases the complexity and computational load demands of such simulations. In this paper, we present a computationally efficient, high fidelity, physics-based simulation workflow for a 77 GHz frequency-modulated continuous-waveform (FMCW)-based, 512-channel MIMO radar sensor. We demonstrate how the synthetic radar returns obtained from full-scale traffic scene simulations can be used to create 4D-radar point clouds. The accuracy of the synthetic radar returns is then evaluated by overlaying the resulting 4D-radar point clouds on 4 corresponding full-scale traffic scenes with varying levels of complexity. Results from this study demonstrate how accurate radar returns obtained from simulation can be used to develop next-generation radar sensors for autonomous vehicles.

ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE
AB The unmanned surface vehicles (USV) are required to perform a dynamic obstacle avoidance during fulfilling a task. This is essential for USV safety in case of an emergency and such action has been proved to be difficult. However, little research has been done in this area. This study proposes an emergency collision avoidance algorithm for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) based on a motion ability database. The algorithm is aimed to address the inconsistency of the existing algorithm. It is proposed to avoid collision in emergency situations by sharp turning and treating the collision avoidance process as a part of the turning movement of USV. In addition, the rolling safety and effect of speed reduction during the collision avoidance process are considered. First, a USV motion ability database is established by numerical simulation. The database includes maximum rolling angle, velocity vector, position scalar, and steering time data during the turning process. In emergency collision avoidance planning; the expected steering angle is obtained based on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs), and the solution space, with initial velocity and rudder angle taken as independent variables, is determined by combining the steering time and rolling angle data. On the basis of this solution space, the objective function is solved by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, and the optimal initial velocity and rudder angle are obtained. The position data corresponding to this solution is the emergency collision avoidance trajectory. Then, the collision avoidance parameters were calculated based on the afore mentioned model of motion. With the use of MATLAB and Unity software, a semi-physical simulation platform was established to perform the avoidance simulation experiment under emergency situation. Results show the validity of the algorithm. Hence results of this research can be useful for performing intelligent collision avoidance operations of USV and other autonomous ships.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have been developed and used in research to perform various tasks such as marine surveys and the collection of bathymetric data in certain areas that are difficult for humans to access, such as deep seas. Because AUVs are limited in terms of their execution of tasks that require an extensive amount of energy, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and launch and recovery systems (LARS) are jointly used for the transport to task sites as well as the launch and recovery. To comply with international environmental regulations, there are ongoing attempts to reduce the generation of pollutants in USVs. This study focuses on developing an energy storage system (ESS) based power system and electric propulsion system for reducing the pollutants generated by USVs. A USV task scenario is set, and the required power amount is calculated; a power system that satisfies the required power is also configured. Furthermore, an energy management system (EMS) is designed and produced for monitoring and controlling the configured system. The performance is verified through a land experiment by designing and producing the components of the configured ESS-based electric propulsion system. The verified system is installed on a catamaran USV, and a field test was performed in the West Sea of Korea. The load required for propelling a catamaran USV having a length overall (LOA) of 11 m is analyzed through a marine field test, and the effects of a steering function of a vessel on the main thruster system are examined.

AB Radiation transmitted through sea ice and snow has an important impact on the energy partitioning at the atmosphere-ice-ocean interface. Snow depth and ice thickness are crucial in determining its temporal and spatial variations. Under-ice surveys using autonomous robotic vehicles to measure transmitted radiation often lack coincident snow depth and ice thickness measurements so that direct relationships cannot be investigated. Snow and ice imprint distinct features on the spectral shape of transmitted radiation. Here, we use those features to retrieve snow depth. Transmitted radiance was measured underneath landfast level first-year ice using a remotely operated vehicle in the Lincoln Sea in spring 2018. Colocated measurements of snow depth and ice thickness were acquired. Constant ice thickness, clear water conditions, and low in-ice biomass allowed us to separate the spectral features of snow. We successfully retrieved snow depth using two inverse methods based on under-ice optical spectra with 1) normalized difference indices and 2) an idealized two-layer radiative transfer model including spectral snow and sea ice extinction coefficients. The retrieved extinction coefficients were in agreement with previous studies. We then applied the methods to continuous time series of transmittance and snow depth from the landfast first-year ice and from drifting, melt-pond covered multiyear ice in the Central Arctic in autumn 2018. Both methods allow snow depth retrieval accuracies of approximately 5 cm. Our results show that atmospheric variations and absolute light levels have an influence on the snow depth retrieval.

AB Drivers' take-over intention is important for the design of the automated driving systems and affects the safety of automated driving. This study explored the influence factors on drivers' take-over intention during conditionally automated driving, examined the correlations among factors through path analysis, and established a take-over intention model. A questionnaire survey was conducted in Hefei, China, and a sample of 277 drivers was obtained. Our study shows that the average take-over intention of those aged under 20 is lower than that of the older age groups. In the positive emotions (PE) scenarios, the take-over intention of aged 31-40 is significantly higher than that of the other age groups. Education and occupation have a significant influence on the take-over intention. The perceived ease of use (PEofU) and perceived usefulness (PU) of automated driving are significantly negatively correlated with drivers' take-over intention in the road conditions (RC) and climate conditions (CC) scenarios. In addition, through path model analysis, our study shows that trust in the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) plays an important role in drivers' take-over intention. Technology acceptance, risk perception and self-efficacy has indirectly correlated with take-over intention through trust in the safety of AVs. In general, drivers with lower technology acceptance, lower self-efficacy and higher risk perception are less likely to trust automated driving technology and have shown stronger intention to take-over the control of the vehicles.

ID RECOGNITION
AB It is of practical importance for individual vehicles to automatically identify traffic signal light status to facilitate their decision makings for traffic safety performance enhancement and operation efficiency maximization when they are approaching intersections, especially in near-future fully-or semi-autonomous vehicle-penetrated traffic systems. Traditional methods aim to directly extract information from the light emitting area of a traffic signal light head, but this can easily result in missed or false signal light status identification due to changes in detection distance and lighting conditions. To address these research gaps, an innovative computer vision-based algorithm is developed for signal control light status identification and countdown time recognition. Based on the unique characteristics of black traffic light boards, color segmentation is conducted in both RGB and HSV channels, and traffic light boards and countdown time display boards are located through cascade filtering algorithms. In the HSV color space, the H component can be extracted and highlighted to determine the current signal status by distinguishing the distribution of the pixel points of the H component. Based on the nearest neighbor interpolation algorithm, an adaptive threading method is developed to improve countdown time recognition. The experimental tests were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the developed approach under various scenarios with acceptable recognition accuracy and execution efficiency. The developed approach can be applied and integrated with other detection and control algorithms to strengthen vehicle-crossing safety performance and operational efficiency at intersections.

AB The enabling technology of vehicular networks for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), smart cities and autonomous driving, offers promising on-board services such as road-safety, easy navigation, comfort driving and infotainment. These services can co-exist simultaneously in the system. One challenging issue is to provide the different quality of service (QoS) requirements adequate to each service. This may not be an easy task because of the constrained factors characterizing these networks (e.g., growing number of connected vehicular devices, wireless communications, etc.). In this paper, we investigate the radio resources allocation problem to match different QoS requirements in terms of data rate whilst reducing the interference ratio. We first proposed a radio allocation model that aims to maximize the data rate and minimize the transmission power for all users. However, since not all vehicles use services that require high data rates, it will be more efficient to consider different required data rate for each user. Hence, we develop an efficient model for transmission power allocation that aims to reduce the interference ratio while providing the data rate required by each user. The proposed model is based on Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE) game where the users compete to acquire the radio resources. We proposed also two water-filling algorithms to solve the spectrum allocation game during Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication over multiple channels. The extensive simulations have shown that our model can satisfy the users regarding different.

AB Deep learning has drawn a lot of attention recently. It is successful in a variety of applications from natural language processing to autonomous vehicle control. A main difference from traditional learning is that deep learning learns the representations of the data, i.e., the features, via greedy layer-wise pre-training. The characteristics of deep learning promotes it as a power tool to mine the data from Internet of Vehicles (boy). The paper focuses on the economic aspect of IoV and investigates deep learning enabled IoV market for data trading and processing. The economic model of IoV consists of three side: the data provider, the service provider, and the user. The data provider collects the data for the user. The user buys the raw data. The data is further processed by the service provider, who provides the learned features for the user to obtain some profit. To optimize the profit of three-sided participators, a Stackelberg game is proposed to model the interactions among them. We derive the equilibrium pricing mechanism of the providers and corresponding demands of the users. The existence and the uniqueness of the equilibrium strategies are proved. Our analysis reveals that the strategy of each participator is related to the utility of the user and the data/service provider's cost. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the data provider and the service provider directly interact with the user in the data market. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are expected to improve both traffic safety and efficiency by reducing the human driver errors. Recently, many researchers have focused on the simulation-based studies in order to evaluate the benefits of CAVs due to the lack of real-world data. However, none of the previous studies have attempted to differentiate the benefits of CAVs over automated vehicles (AVs) by incorporating multiple preceding vehicle information (i. e., acceleration, position, etc.). This paper aims to fill the existing gap by utilizing separate car-following models for both CAVs and AVs in order to approximate their driving behavior in the Aimsun Next simulation platform. Additionally, a different car-following model is used for the connected vehicles (CVs) without automation by addressing the human driver compliance factor. This study also utilizes mixed penetration of CAV and CV with no automation. A well calibrated and validated simulation testbed is developed for SR417 in Orlando, Florida which is the base scenario in this study. To this end, the impact of CAVs, AVs, and CVs are evaluated based on both traffic efficiency (i.e., travel time) and safety (i.e., traffic conflicts) under various market penetration rates (MPRs). The traffic efficiency results show that travel time is significantly reduced for any MPRs of CAVs, AVs, and the mixture of CVs and CAVs compared to the base scenario. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) model is developed to quantify the travel time improvement for CAVs, AVs, and the mixture of CVs and CAVs. The results suggest at least 20% penetration is required for CAVs to get travel time improvement while 40% penetration is needed for AVs. Also, CAV significantly outperforms AV for the same MPRs. For the safety assessment, traffic conflicts are estimated by using different surrogate measures i.e., time-to-collision (TTC) and time exposed time-to-collision (TET). The results imply that crash risk is significantly reduced for CAVs, AVs, and the mixture of CVs and CAVs scenarios compared to the base condition. A Bayesian zero-inflated negative binomial model is developed in order to model the number of traffic conflicts as a function of MPRs of CAVs, AVs, mixture of CVs and CAVs, and traffic parameters. The results confirm that CAVs are more efficient in reducing crash risk compared to AVs for the same MPR. The mix penetration rate of CV (60%) and CAV (20%) shows almost similar reduction of crash risk with the 80% MPR of AV. Also, crash risk analysis based on different vehicle types shows that CAVs driving behavior is safer compared to the AVs. Finally, the results of this study indicate a significant improvement of both traffic efficiency and safety by implementing CAV with multivehicle communication system on the freeway segments.

ID AUTONOMOUS EMERGENCY BRAKING
AB The purpose of this study was to analyze car-to-cyclist accidents to determine the challenges for an active safety system on car to avoid accidents. Based on 2261 car-to-cyclist accidents provided by in-depth accident databases, accidents are analyzed more specifically from kinematic reconstructions. The main accident scenarios are determined: crossing nearside, crossing farside, longitudinal, turning (right and left) and others. Proportion of brakes activation by the drivers before the impact was also given for those scenarios. The relative positions of the cyclists to the vehicle are analyzed from few seconds before the impact until the crash. It is observed that one second before the impact most of the cyclists were at a lateral distance smaller than 5 m to the center line of the car and less than 20 m ahead of car front. Finally, the possible detection of the cyclist by implemented sensors in the vehicle and the possible triggering of an active safety system like an Automatic Emergency Braking or a Forward Collision Warning are studied. Required detection sensors parameters, such as Field Of View (FOV) and the detection range, were analyzed relatively to the scenario's characteristics, e.g. remaining time after cyclist appearance and before the collision, differences between scenario types. Different sensor FOVs and detection ranges were analyzed to determine their possible rates of cyclist detection. The study concluded that a FOV of 60 degrees and a range of 35 m would detect most of the cyclists in car-to-cyclist accident scenarios. It was also concluded that in about 80% of cases, the last time to trigger brake (t(LTTB)), i.e. the last moment to brake in order to avoid the accident based on physical and comfort braking limitations by the car, was 1 s before the collision. It was also calculated that with a FOV of 60 degrees, 51% of cyclists could be detected up to 4 s before t(LTTB), and 72% up to 1 s before t(LTTB). Values found in this paper can be useful to determine some of the specifications of an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS), e.g. detection sensor coverages, available time to trigger an autonomous emergency braking or forward collision warning device. Those values are given for general ADAS sensors specification but also per scenario in the case of sensors that can adapt to a specific scenario.

AB Introduction: Automated vehicles in everyday real-world traffic are predicted to be developed soon (Gasser et al., Rechtsfolgen zunehmender Fahrzeugautomatisierung, Wirtschaftsverlag NW, Berichte der Bundesanstalt fur Strassenwesen F83, 2012). New technologies such as advanced object detection and artificial intelligence (AI) that use machine or deep-learning algorithms will support meeting all the maneuvering challenges involved in different degrees of automation (Society of Automotive Engineers - SAE international, Levels of driving automation for on road vehicles, Warrendale, PA., 2014; National Highway Traffic Safety Administration - NHTSA, Preliminary statement of policy concerning automated vehicles, Washington, DC, 2018). For automated series production, these vehicles of course must be safe in real-world traffic under all weather conditions. Therefore, system validation, ethical aspects and testing of automated vehicle functions are fundamental basics for successfully developing, market launching, ethical and social acceptance.
   Method: In order to test and validate critical poor visibility detection challenges of automated vehicles with reasonable expenditure, a first area-wide analysis has been conducted. Because poor visibility restricts human perception similar corresponding to machine perception it was based on a text analysis of 1.28 million area-wide police accident reports followed by an in-depth case-by-case analysis of 374 identified cases concerning bad weather conditions (see chap. 1.3). For this purpose the first time ever a nationwide analysis included all police reports in the whole area within the state of Saxony from the year 2004 until 2014.
   Results: Within this large database, 374 accidents were found due to perception limitations - caused by "rain", "fog", "snow", "glare"/"blinding" and "visual obstruction" - for the detailed case-by-case investigation. All those challenging traffic scenarios are relevant for automated driving. They will form a key aspect for safe development, validation and testing of machine perception within automated driving functions.
   Conclusions: This first area-wide analysis does not only rely on samples as in previous in-depth analyses. It provides relevant real-world traffic scenarios for testing of automated vehicles. For the first time this analysis is carried out knowing the place, time and context of each accident over the total investigated area of an entire federal state. Thus, the accidents that have been analyzed include all kinds of representative situations that can occur on motorways, highways, main roads, side streets or urban traffic. The scenarios can be extrapolated to include similar road networks worldwide. These results additionally will be taken into account for developing standards regarding early simulations as well as for the subsequent real-life testing. In the future, vehicle operation data and traffic simulations could be included as well. Based on these relevant real-world accidents culled from the federal accident database for Saxony, the authors recommend further development of internationally valid guidelines based on ethical, legal requirements and social acceptance.

TI The potential impacts of automated cars on urban transport: An
   exploratory analysis
SO TRANSPORT POLICY

ID LAND-USE; VEHICLES; DYNAMICS
AB Objective: The concept of automated cars is rapidly becoming a reality. Yet there has been very little analysis of the impacts of such developments on the performance of urban transport systems. These impacts are potentially complex. On the positive side, automation has the potential to increase road capacity, make driving available to more people, and reduce accidents and emissions. On the negative side, it could attract users away from public transport, walking and cycling, substantially increase traffic levels and stimulate urban sprawl. These impacts cannot currently be measured empirically and, by the time that they can, it will be too late to change the implementation model to rectify any resulting problems. Predictive assessments are therefore needed. This paper considers the possible impacts of automated vehicles, predicts their effects on the urban land use and transport system, and discusses the policy implications. We focus on automation of the car fleet, and do not consider the potential of automation of public transport or freight.
   Methods: We consider the literature on the range of attributes of automated vehicles which might affect transport and land use patterns, and suggest potential outcomes for each over the period to 2050. These include the proportion of automated vehicles in the car fleet, whether automated vehicles are privately purchased or publicly shared, the impacts on network capacity, the reduced need to pay for and walk from parking places, the potential reduction in the value of in-vehicle time and the potential use by current non-drivers. We represent these attributes in an expanded causal link diagram of the urban land use and transport system and import those causal links into the MARS system dynamics model. We determine from the literature a level for each attribute, and test the impacts in a set of ten scenarios using an updated MARS model of Leeds.
   Results: Based on our input assumptions, we find that car-km in 2050 could be over 50% higher than in the business as usual scenario. Public transport use could fall by 18%, threatening accessibility for those dependent on it, while walking and cycling could fall by 13%, reducing their health benefits. Overall person-km would rise, suggesting a reduction in sustainability. A requirement that all automated cars are shared vehicles could reduce these adverse impacts somewhat, but the effects are sensitive to the charge per km.
   Discussion: Our use of a single value for each attribute means that our analysis is exploratory, but the size of the resulting impacts demonstrates the importance of understanding the scale of systems response to each of the attributes which we have considered. It will be important to manage the way in which automated cars are introduced into urban areas, if they are not to lead to a worsening of the urban environment, accessibility and health. A requirement to make all such vehicles part of shared fleets offers one way forward, but more work is needed to understand the way in which use of such fleets should be charged.

AB Services are constantly changing with the introduction of new technologies, which affect the service systems of both conventional and autonomous driving. New theories and technologies are also key factors affecting the design and development trends of service models and solutions. Major automobile manufacturers aspire to provide customers with unique services and experiences, resulting in a growing demand for systematic approaches to characterize customer behaviors and scientific methods to accurately interpret data stored in databases. This study proposes a scientific engineering and operation framework for driving services that enables conventional automobile manufacturers to re-evaluate their service models and solutions as they expand into the domain of autonomous driving, integrating customized consumer interactions and mass production efficiency to develop new technologies, and subsequently applying these technologies to innovate their driving services, form service innovation guidelines, and accelerate the development of smart applications for the automobile industry. A Kano two-dimensional model of quality was employed. A Kano questionnaire was administered to analyze consumers' perceived satisfaction concerning different service quality elements; the elements were then ranked in the order of requiring improvement to determine the elements that are essential in conventional vehicles. Finally, suggestions were proposed for improving the service quality of driving products and evaluating driver satisfaction. A total of 56 valid questionnaires were collected from potential buyers of four-door sedans. The questionnaire evaluated respondents' perceived value and satisfaction of 30 product elements categorized into two groups (specific functions and intangible value-added services) across eight major quality dimensions (basic safety functions, multimedia entertainment systems, information and communication systems, value-added systems, active matching, automatic service systems, hardware software integration, and customer service and support). In addition, Kano quality categories were statistically analyzed to elucidate whether significant differences existed between groups. Using the Kano quality categories, 30 design elements were classified: 10 as "attractive," 7 as "one-dimensional," 3 as "must-be," 4 as "indifferent," and 6 as "reverse." Enterprises can effectively reduce customer dissatisfaction and enhance customer satisfaction based on the quality category of the product and the product improvement order proposed in this study.
   Relevance to industry: This study determined that using the Kano quality categories, enterprises can effectively reduce customer dissatisfaction and enhance customer satisfaction based on the quality category of the product and the product improvement order proposed in this study.

AB What will cyclists do in future conflict situations with automated cars at intersections when the cyclist has the right of way? In order to explore this, short high-quality animation videos of conflicts between a car and a cyclist at five different intersections were developed. These videos were 'shot' from the perspective of the cyclist and ended when a collision was imminent should the car or the bicyclist not slow down. After each video participants indicated whether they would slow down or continue cycling, how confident they were about this decision, what they thought the car would do, and how confident they were about what the carwould do. The appearance of the approaching car was varied as within-subjects variable with 3 levels (Car type): automated car, automated car displaying its intentions to the cyclists, and traditional car. In all situations the cyclist had right of way. Of each conflict, three versions were made that differed in the moment that the video ended by cutting off fractions from the longest version, thus creating videos with an early, mid, and late moment for the cyclist to decide to continue cycling or to slow down (Decision moment). Before the video experiment started the participants watched an introductory video about automated vehicles that served as prime. This video was either positive, negative, or neutral about automated vehicles (Prime type). Both Decision moment and Prime type were between subject variables. After the experiment participants completed a short questionnaire about trust in technology and trust in automated vehicles. 1009 participants divided in nine groups (one per Decision moment and Prime) completed the online experiment in which they watched fifteen videos (5 conflicts x 3 car types). The results show that participants more often yielded when the approaching car was an automated car than when it was a traditional car. However, when the approaching car was an automated car that could communicate its intentions, they yielded less often than for a traditional car. The earlier the Decision moment, the more often participants yielded but this increase in yielding did not differ between the three car types. Participants yielded more often for automated cars (both types) after they watched the negative prime video before the experiment than when they watched the positive video. The less participants trusted technology, and the capabilities of automated vehicles in particular, the more they were inclined to slow down in the conflict situations with automated cars. The association between trust and yielding was stronger for trust in the capabilities of automated vehicles than for trust in technology in general. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Magnetic anomaly variations near mid-ocean ridge spreading centers are sensitive to a variety of crustal accretionary processes as well as geomagnetic field variations when the crust forms. We collected near-bottom vector magnetic anomaly data during a series of 21 autonomous underwater vehicle Sentry dives near 9 degrees 50'N on the East Pacific Rise (EPR) covering similar to 26 km along-axis. These data document the 2-3 km wide axial anomaly high that is commonly observed at fast-spreading ridges but also reveal the presence of a superimposed similar to 800 m full wavelength anomaly low. The anomaly low is continuous for >= 13 km along axis and may extend over the entire survey region. A more detailed survey of hydrothermal vents near 9 degrees 50.3'N reveals similar to 100 m diameter magnetic lows, which are misaligned relative to active vents and therefore cannot explain the continuous axial low. The axial magnetization low persists in magnetic inversions with variable extrusive source thickness, indicating that to the extent to which layer 2A constitutes the sole magnetic source, variations in its thickness alone cannot account for the axial low. Lava accumulation models illustrate that high geomagnetic intensity over the past similar to 2.5 kyr, and decreasing intensity over the past similar to 900 years, are both consistent with the broad axial anomaly high and the superimposed shorter wavelength low. The continuity of this axial low, and similar features elsewhere on the EPR suggests, that either crustal accretionary processes responsible for this anomaly are common among fast-spread ridges, or that the observed magnetization low may partially reflect global geomagnetic intensity fluctuations. Plain Language Summary Near-bottom magnetic anomaly data provide valuable information on crustal accretion processes at mid-ocean ridges. Using autonomous underwater vehicle data, we analyze near-bottom magnetic anomalies at the EPR 9 degrees 50'N to study crustal accretion at mid-ocean ridges. We find a continuous axial anomaly low superimposed on the typical broad axial magnetic high, located along the spreading axis covering an along-axis distance of more than 10 km. This axial anomaly low has been observed at other fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges, but the cause of the anomaly low is not well understood. Using magnetic inversion results and numerical models, we consider three possible causes for the axial anomaly low: variations in the thickness of the pillow lavas that are typically modeled as being the primary contributor to the magnetic signal, variations in Earth's geomagnetic field intensity, and hydrothermal vents chemically altering the magnetic minerals in the seafloor basalts. While the global occurrence of the axial anomaly low at other ridges makes it likely that geomagnetic field variations contribute to the low, it is likely that the observed axial magnetic low is caused by a combination of these three factors.

AB Satellite chlorophyll a (chl a) observations have repeatedly noted summertime phytoplankton blooms in the North Pacific subtropical gyre (NPSG), a region of open ocean that is far removed from any land-derived or Ekman upwelling nutrient sources. These blooms are dominated by N-2-fixing diatom-cyanobacteria associations of the diatom genera Rhizosolenia Brightwell and Hemiaulus Ehrenberg. Their nitrogen fixing endosymbiont, Richelia intracellularis J.A. Schmidt, is hypothesized to be critical to the development of blooms in this nitrogen limited region. However, due to the remote location and unpredictable duration of the summer blooms, prolonged in situ observations are rare outside of the Station ALOHA time-series off of Hawai'i. In summer, 2015, a proof-of-concept mission using the autonomous vehicle, Honey Badger (Wave Glider SV2; Liquid Robotics, a Boeing company, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), collected near-surface (<20 m) observations in the NPSG using hydrographic, meteorological, optical, and imaging sensors designed to focus on phytoplankton abundance, distribution, and physiology of this bloom-forming region. Hemiaulus and Rhizosolenia cell abundance was determined using digital holography for the entire June-November mission. Honey Badger was not able to reach the 30 degrees N subtropical front region where most of the satellite chl a blooms have been observed, but near-real time navigational control allowed it to transect two blooms near 25 degrees N. The two taxa did not co-occur in large numbers, rather the blooms were dominated by either Hemiaulus or Rhizosolenia. The August 2-4, 2015 bloom was comprised of 96% Hemiaulus and the second bloom, August 15-17, 2015, was dominated by Rhizosolenia (75%). The holograms also imaged undisturbed, fragile Hemiaulus aggregates throughout the sampled area at similar to 10 L-1. Aggregated Hemiaulus represented the entire observed population at times and had a widespread distribution independent of the summer export pulse, a dominant annual event suggested to be mediated by aggregate fluxes. Aggregate occurrence was not consistent with a density dependent formation mechanism and may represent a natural growth form in undisturbed conditions. The photosynthetic potential index (F-v:F-m) increased from similar to 0.4 to similar to 0.6 during both blooms indicating a robust, active phytoplankton community in the blooms. The diel pattern of F-v:F-m (nocturnal maximum; diurnal minimum) was consistent with macronutrient limitation throughout the mission with no evidence of Fe-limitation despite the presence of nitrogen fixing diatom-diazotroph assemblages. During the 5-month mission, Honey Badger covered similar to 5,690 km (3,070 nautical miles), acquired 9,336 holograms, and reliably transmitted data onshore in near real-time. Software issues developed with the active fluorescence sensor that terminated measurements in early September. Although images were still useful at the end of the mission, fouling of the LISST-Holo optics was considerable, and appeared to be the most significant issue facing deployments of this duration.

AB In this study, a set of different search strategies for locating submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) are investigated. This set includes pre-defined path planning (PPP), adapted random walk (RW), particle swarm optimisation (PSO), inertia Levy-flight (ILF), self-organising-migration-algorithm (SOMA), and bumblebee search algorithm (BB). The influences of self-localisation and communication errors and limited travel distance of the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) on the performance of the proposed algorithms are investigated. This study shows that the proposed search strategies could not outperform the classic search heuristic based on full coverage path planning if all AUVs followed the same search strategy. In this study, the influence of self-localisation and communication errors was investigated. The simulations showed that, based on the median error of the search runs, the performance of SOMA was in the same order of magnitude regardless the strength of the localisation error. Furthermore, it was shown that the performance of BB was highly affected by increasing localisation errors. From the simulations, it was revealed that all the algorithms, except for PSO and SOMA, were unaffected by disturbed communications. Here, the best performance was shown by PPP, followed by BB, SOMA, ILF, PSO, and RW. Furthermore, the influence of the limited travel distances of the AUVs on the search performance was evaluated. It was shown that all the algorithms, except for PSO, were affected by the shorter maximum travel distances of the AUVs. The performance of PPP increased with increasing maximum travel distances. However, for maximum travel distances > 1800 m the median error appeared constant. The effect of shorter travel distances on SOMA was smaller than on PPP. For maximum travel distances < 1200 m, SOMA outperformed all other strategies. In addition, it can be observed that only BB showed better performances for shorter travel distances than for longer ones. On the other hand, with different search strategies for each AUV, the search performance of the whole swarm can be improved by incorporating population-based search strategies such as PSO and SOMA within the PPP scheme. The best performance was achieved for the combination of two AUVs following PPP, while the third AUV utilised PSO. The best fitness of this combination was 15.9. This fitness was 26.4% better than the performance of PPP, which was 20.4 on average. In addition, a novel mechanism for dynamically selecting a search strategy for an AUV is proposed. This mechanism is based on fuzzy logic. This dynamic approach is able to perform at least as well as PPP and SOMA for different travel distances of AUVs. However, due to the better adaptation to the current situation, the overall performance, calculated based on the fitness achieved for different maximum travel distances, the proposed dynamic search strategy selection performed 32.8% better than PPP and 34.0% better than SOMA.

AB In this article, we consider a scenario of a decode-and-forward (DaF) wireless system supporting the communication of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a ground-control-station (GCS) through an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS). Particularly, the UAV moves according to the three-dimensional (3D) random way point model at low altitude in a complex urban environment. However, a stationary relay-station (RS) decodes and forwards the UAV's signal over an IRS-aided virtual line-of-sight (LoS) link to a GCS. The highly dynamic and terrain-dependent UAV-to-RS channel follows the Beaulieu-Xie fading model. However, the RS-to-IRS and IRS-to-GCS links enjoy clear LoS; thus, follow the Rice fading model. We derive new closed-form expressions for the probability density functions (PDFs) and the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). Then based on the derived statistical expressions, several performance metrics including outage probability, average bit error rate, and ergodic channel capacity are derived in closed-forms. Additionally, simple and accurate approximated expressions in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime are also provided. The analytical results are validated through some representative numerical examples and supported by Monte-Carlo simulation results.

AB Understanding pedestrian behaviors is crucial for a safe navigation of self-driving vehicles. However, pedestrians exhibit a large variety in their motion behaviors that are affected by interaction with the environment and other users of the road/sidewalk. Most of current models are limited to batch (offline) settings which requires to learn from the entire datasets. This letter presents a similarity-based model fusion algorithm, called SimFuse, for improving the prediction accuracy which enables autonomous agents to incrementally update their knowledge by communicating with other vehicles (V2V) by infrastructures (V2I). In the proposed framework, knowledge is shared in a compact form of "learned model" instead of raw data which provides a scalable sharing paradigm between agents. This work extends our prior work SILA [1] by providing multi model fusion of n >= 2models at the same time. We evaluate our algorithm in both intersection and non intersection scenarios and compare it with other baselines. The results show our algorithm outperforms state of the art in terms of Average Displacement Error at intersection scenarios and it has comparable result for non intersection scenarios with 3% improvement over SILA in ADE. The results also show that SimFuse updating time is up to 12 times faster than SILA with similar performance.

AB Perception is a vital part of driving. Every year, the loss in visibility due to snow, fog, and rain causes serious accidents worldwide. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the impact of weather conditions on perception performance while driving on highways and urban traffic in all weather conditions. The goal of this paper is to provide a survey of sensing technologies used to detect the surrounding environment and obstacles during driving maneuvers in different weather conditions. Firstly, some important historical milestones are presented. Secondly, the state-of-the-art automated driving applications (adaptive cruise control, pedestrian collision avoidance, etc.) are introduced with a focus on all-weather activity. Thirdly, the most involved sensor technologies (radar, lidar, ultrasonic, camera, and far-infrared) employed by automated driving applications are studied. Furthermore, the difference between the current and expected states of performance is determined by the use of spider charts. As a result, a fusion perspective is proposed that can fill gaps and increase the robustness of the perception system.

AB This article presents the origins and evolution of midrange terrestrial laser scanning (TLs), spanning primarily from the 1950s to the time of publication. Particular attention is given to developments in hardware and software that document the physical dimensions of a scene as a point cloud. These developments include parameters for accuracy, repeatability, and resolution in the midrange-millimeter and centimeter levels when recording objects at building and landscape scales up to a kilometer away. The article is split into two parts: Part one starts with early space and defense applications, and part two examines the survey applications that formed around TLS technologies in the 1990s. The origins of midrange TLS, ironically, begin in space and defense applications, which shaped the development of sensors and information processing via autonomous vehicles. Included are planetary rovers, space shuttles, robots, and land vehicles designed for relative navigation in hostile environments like space and war zones. Key people in the midrange TLS community were consulted throughout the 10-year period over which this article was written. A multilingual and multidisciplinary literature review-comprising media written or produced in Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese, Italian, and Russian-was also an integral part of this research.

AB With the development of IT convergence technology, autonomous driving has gradually developed; however, the vehicle is still operated by the driver, who should always be in good health - but sometimes, this is not the case. It is especially dangerous to drive when drowsy, and unable to fully concentrate on driving, such as when taking certain medicines, or through fatigue. Drowsy driving is at least eight times more dangerous than normal driving, and as dangerous as drunk driving. Previous research has looked at technology to detect drowsiness, in order to wake up drivers when necessary, or to safely stop the vehicle. Furthermore, many studies have been conducted to find out when drowsiness occurs. However, it is more desirable for the driver to take sufficient rest during a break, in order to be able to continue to focus and drive. In other words, it is important to maintain a normal state before drowsiness. In this study, we introduce a sound source to increase driver concentration and prevent drowsiness, another that can improve the quality of sleep, and a system that produces these sound sources. The proposed system has a noise reduction effect of about 15 dB. We have confirmed that the proposed sound induces an EEG of the desired form.

AB This paper aims to develop a novel attitude determination system aided by polarization sensor. An improved heading angle function is derived using the perpendicular relationship between directions of E-vector of linearly polarized light and solar vector in the atmospheric polarization distribution model. The Extended Kalman filter (EKF) with quaternion differential equation as a dynamic model is applied to fuse the data from sensors. The covariance functions of filter process and measurement noises are deduced in detail. The indoor and outdoor tests are conducted to verify the validity and feasibility of proposed attitude determination system. The test results showed that polarization sensor is not affected by magnetic field, thus the proposed system can work properly in environments containing the magnetic interference. The results also showed that proposed system has higher measurement accuracy than common attitude determination system and can provide precise parameters for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flight control. The main contribution of this paper is implementation of the EKF for incorporating the self-developed polarization sensor into the conventional attitude determination system. The real-world experiment with the quad-rotor proved that proposed system can work in a magnetic interference environment and provide sufficient accuracy in attitude determination for autonomous navigation of vehicle.

DT Article
AB Visual maps of the seafloor can provide objective information to characterize benthic ecosystems and survey the distribution of mineral deposits on spatial scales that cannot be otherwise assessed. This paper proposes a three-dimensionalmapping method based on light sectioning that enables the simultaneous capture of both structure and color from the images of a single camera. The advantages of the method include high and consistent resolution of the bathymetry, and the simplicity of the setup and the algorithm used to process the data it obtains. The hardware requirements for collecting the data are a single camera, a line laser, and a light, making it possible to deploy the mapping device along with other sensors and devices on underwater platforms such as autonomous underwater vehicles and remotely operated vehicles that can log navigation data. The system has been deployed on a total of 11 cruises, among others, to survey manganese-rich crust deposits on the slopes of Takuyo #5 seamount in the Pacific at depths of more than 2,000 m. In this paper, we present the data that were obtained on one of these cruises. (C) 2016 The Authors. Journal of Field Robotics published byWiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This paper studies an evolutionary algorithm to solve a new multiobjective optimization problem, the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows and Demands (PDP-TW-D), which is applicable to operational optimization in various mobile network systems. With respect to multiple optimization objectives, PDP-TW-D is to find a set of Pareto-optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles (e.g., mobile robots, drones and autonomous heavy-haulage trucks) in order to serve given transportation requests. The proposed algorithm uses a population of individuals, each of which represents a solution candidate, and evolves them through generations to seek the Pareto-optimal solutions. In addition to the evolution-based global search process, the proposed algorithm allows individuals to improve their optimality in each generation with a local search process, which is designed based on iterative neighborhood search. Experimental results demonstrate that the integration of global and local search processes improves the optimality of individuals and expedites convergence speed. The proposed algorithm outperforms two well-known existing EMOAs, NSGA-II and MOEA/D, in relatively large-scale problems that have up to 400 pickup and delivery locations.

While the standard provides excellent descriptions of test procedures, it does not provide detail on methods to carry out the calculations necessary to calculate relative cross-track error (XTE), which is the primary error statistic used to judge accuracy. Given the travel speed and sampling constraints provided by the standard, the difference between a method based on nearest points or one based on path interpolation could hypothetically be as large as 25 cm. In this project, the standard was used to estimate the guidance accuracy of a relatively low-accuracy vehicle at 1.25 and 0.5 m s(-1). At 1.25 m s(-1), a basic nearest point calculation overestimated mean XTE by 0.8 cm, or 8.2%. The location sampling density was much higher with a 0.5 m s(-1) travel speed, and mean XTE was only overestimated by 0.1 cm with the nearest point method. There are clearly situations where the calculation method will affect results, and the use of the more complicated methods explained in this article are suggested when using this standard.

TI Volvo Drivers' Experiences With Advanced Crash Avoidance and Related
   Technologies
SO TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION
LA English
DT Article

   collision warning; lane departure warning; adaptive cruise control;
   driver assistance
AB Objective: Crash avoidance technologies can potentially prevent or mitigate many crashes, but their success depends in part on driver acceptance. Owners of 2010-2012 model Volvo vehicles with several technologies were interviewed about their experiences.
   Methods: Interviews were conducted in summer 2012 with 155 owners of vehicles with City Safety as a standard feature; 145 owners with an optional technology package that included adaptive cruise control, distance alert, collision warning with full auto brake (and pedestrian detection on certain models), driver alert control, and lane departure warning; and 172 owners with both City Safety and the technology package. The survey response rates were 21 percent for owners with City Safety, 30 percent for owners with the technology package, and 27 percent for owners with both. Ten percent of owners opted out before the telephone survey began, and 18 percent declined to participate when called.
   Results: Despite some annoyance, most respondents always leave the systems on, although fewer do so for lane departure warning (59%). For each of the systems, at least 80 percent of respondents with the system would want it on their next vehicle. Many respondents reported safer driving habits with the systems (e.g., following less closely with adaptive cruise control, using turn signals more often with lane departure warning). Fewer respondents reported potentially unsafe behavior, such as allowing the vehicle to brake for them at least some of the time. About one third of respondents experienced autonomous braking when they believed they were at risk of crashing, and about one fifth of respondents thought it had prevented a crash. About one fifth of respondents with the technology package reported that they were confused or misunderstood which safety system had activated in their vehicle.
   Conclusions: Consistent with the results for early adopters in the previous survey of Volvo and Infiniti owners, the present survey found that driver acceptance of the technologies remains high, although less so for lane departure warning. This study is the first to report drivers' experiences with City Safety, a collision avoidance system provided as standard equipment on certain Volvo 2010-2012 models, and driver acceptance of this system was high, although not to the same extent as the optional forward collision avoidance system. Future research should continue to monitor drivers' experiences with these technologies as they become available in more vehicles.

AB As one of the most indispensable means of transportation in modern society, vehicles guarantee our daily commuting and logistics transportation. However, with the increasing number of vehicles, vehicles have also caused increasingly serious traffic safety problems while providing convenience to our lives. One of the most common of these is traffic accidents caused by vehicle yaw due to driver distraction. As a potential solution to this problem, lane departure warning systems (LDWS) focus on detecting and determining whether the vehicle is deviating from the driveway, considered an essential part of autonomous driving technology, and have received significant attention in recent years. A large number of different types of LDWS systems have been developed, especially in recent years, with the development of artificial intelligence technology, many methods based on deep learning and machine vision have been proposed. However, it is well known that due to the complexity of the network structure in deep learning-based object detection algorithms, the operation of such methods relies on a large amount of computing power support. However, due to the limitation of the overall energy supply of the vehicle, it is usually unable to support computing power similar to the laboratory level. Therefore, how to realize efficient lane departure warnings under the condition of limited computing power is a critical problem to be solved. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a novel lightweight LDWS model. Different from deep learning methods of LDWS, our LDWS model LEHA can achieve high accuracy and efficiency by relying only on simple hardware. The proposed LEHA consists of three modules: the image processing module, the lane detection module, and the lane departure recognition module. The image pre-processing module is applied to pre-process the original road image, which can improve the accuracy and efficiency of the following lane detection module. After obtaining the processed image, lane detection begins to detect and label the lanes. Finally, lane departure recognition is used to calculate the deviation distance and direction to determine whether the warning should be initiated. To evaluate the performance of LEHA, we compare our method with other state-of-the-art LDWS models in terms of detection accuracy and processing time under ideal and non-ideal lane conditions based on the KITTI dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our LEHA outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.

AB In recent decades, there has been a constant increase in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). There has also been a huge growth in the number of control algorithms to support the many applications embodied by the vehicles, including challenges and open issues to develop. This paper focuses on three major classes of control methods applied to quadrotors in order to create an open-source model based on the Arduino Mega that allows for the derivation and design of quadrotor control strategies. We consider the perspective classes, including linear, nonlinear, and intelligent methods representing in details with applications in developing an open-source controller for the quadrotor using the Arduino Mega and the BNO055 9 DOF sensor. We propose Proportional Integral Derivative (PID), backstepping integrator, and model predictive control (MPC) to track a generated Lissajous curve for surveillance. Simulations in the Matlab-Simulink environment with 3D visualization of a developed quadrotor model using CAD software, with robustness and performance discussion, are provided. Our experimental work is developed with an extensive illustration of the hardware and algorithm design and by demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architectures. The results show promise in practical and in intelligent applications.

AB We present a holistically designed three layer control architecture capable of outperforming a professional driver racing the same car. Our approach focuses on the co-design of the motion planning and control layers, extracting the full potential of the connected system. First, a high-level planner computes an optimal trajectory around the track, then in real-time a mid-level nonlinear model predictive controller follows this path using the high-level information as guidance. Finally a high frequency, low-level controller tracks the states predicted by the mid-level controller. Tracking the predicted behavior has two advantages: it reduces the mismatch between the model used in the upper layers and the real car, and allows for a torque vectoring command to be optimized by the higher level motion planners. The tailored design of the low-level controller proved to be crucial for bridging the gap between planning and control, unlocking unseen performance in autonomous racing. The proposed approach was verified on a full size racecar, considerably improving over the state-of-the-art results achieved on the same vehicle. Finally, we also show that the proposed co-design approach outperforms a professional racecar driver.

AB This paper analyzes the link capacity between autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with random three-dimensional (3-D) trajectories. This is distinctively different from existing works typically under the assumption of either two-dimensional (2-D) or deterministic trajectories, and particularly interesting to applications such as surveillance and air combat. The key idea is that we geometrically derive the probability distributions of the UAV-to-UAV (U2U) distances which, by exploiting the Jensen's inequality, can be translated to the closed-form bounds for the capacity between UAVs, and between UAVs and ground stations. Another important aspect is that we extrapolate the idea to dense UAV networks, and analyze the impact of network densification, imperfect channel state information, and interference from ground transmitters on the capacity. Corroborated by simulations, our analysis shows that a U2U link with random 2-D trajectories is superior in terms of capacity due to its short average link distance. It is also revealed that a UAV-to-ground link can incur substantially lower capacity than a U2U link even in the case the 3-D coverage of the UAVs is the same, as the result of its longer average link length.

AB Accurately estimating driving styles is crucial to designing useful driver assistance systems and vehicle control systems for autonomous driving that match how people drive. This paper presents a novel way to identify driving style not in terms of the durations or frequencies of individual maneuver states, but rather the transition patterns between them to see how they are interrelated. Driving behavior in highway traffic was categorized into 12 maneuver states, based on which 144 (12 x 12) maneuver transition probabilities were obtained. A conditional likelihood maximization method was employed to extract typical maneuver transition patterns that could represent driving style strategies, from the 144 probabilities. Random forest algorithm was adopted to classify driving styles using the selected features. Results showed that transitions concerning five maneuver states - free driving, approaching, near following, constrained left and right lane changes - could be used to classify driving style reliably. Comparisons with traditional methods were presented and discussed in detail to show that transition probabilities between maneuvers were better at predicting, driving style than traditional maneuver frequencies in behavioral analysis.

AB This study addresses the problem of tracking acoustically a moving source in shallow water, which is challenged by multi-path sound propagation. A specific source of interest is an autonomous underwater vehicle with periodic sound transmissions. Given a simple horizontal linear receiving array, the authors develop a Bayesian tracking method based on measurements of signal arriving angle and difference of respective sonar transmission and receiving time intervals. To counter the multi-path effect and thus improve estimation accuracy of time differences, passive time reversal processing is exploited. Further, the unscented Kalman filter is adopted in tracking to handle nonlinearity in measurements. The proposed method is tested in simulations as well as an at-sea experiment, and the results validate the effectiveness of the developed approach.

AB Designing reliable flight control for an autonomous helicopter requires a high performance dynamics model. In this paper, a nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (NLARX) model is selected as the mathematical structure for identifying and controlling the flight of a small-scale helicopter. A neural network learning algorithm is combined with the NLARX model to identify the dynamic component of the rotorcraft unmanned aerial vehicle (RUAV). This identification process is based on the well-known gradient descent learning algorithm. As a case study, the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) model predictive control (MPC) is applied to control the pitch motion of the helicopter. Results of the neural network output model are closely match with the real flight data. The MPC also shows good performance under various conditions.

AB Recent work has highlighted the use of parvoviruses as potential vectors for tumour-cell-targeted gene therapy. The oncotropic properties of the prototype strain of minute virus of mice (MVMp) suggest that this virus might be a useful vehicle for introducing selectively therapeutic genes, e.g. lymphokine or suicide genes, into tumour cells and preferentially expressing them. But the low titre of recombinant virus stocks (10(5)-10(6) infectious units per mi) and their high level of contamination by cell proteins make it practically impossible to evaluate their efficacy in in vivo systems. A technique is described for producing cellular contaminant-free stocks of recombinant virus particles, with titres up to 5 x 10(8) IU/ml.

ID NONLINEAR OBSERVERS; STATE; ACCIDENTS; DESIGN
AB This paper addresses the lateral wind gust estimation and compensation problem for racecar models. A wind-sensorless solution, i.e. a solution not using direct wind measures, is proposed. More precisely, by modeling the wind disturbance as a fully unknown input signal, an input-state observer is derived using only information about the vehicle's longitudinal speed and lateral pose relative to the road. The observer is characterized by a simple structure, explicit closed-form, direct implementability on a micro-controller, and dead-beat property, i.e. it ensures the convergence of the estimation error in a finite time. Moreover, leveraging on the reconstructed wind data, a backstepping wind-compensation controller is also proposed, allowing asymptotic tracking of a path with desired curvature and providing the end-user with a free control parameter specifying the desired tracking speed. Formal proofs of the estimation error and tracking error convergence are given. Performance evaluation of the proposed solution is obtained in simulation by closing in the loop the full nonlinear model of a real racecar, the Robocar system, with the proposed estimation and control method. Both the estimator and the controller are shown to outperform existing solutions, even in the presence of noisy measurements.

AB Wireless charging for autonomous underwater vehicles has been widely explored recently by the merit of safety and convenience. However, due to the misalignment between charging coils in the horizontal and vertical directions, the system may not maintain constant current or constant voltage output. Therefore, this article proposes a mistuned inductive power transfer (IPT) system structure and corresponding design methods to improve misalignment tolerance. The proposed IPT system adopts seriesseries compensation and includes a variable inductor (VI) on the secondary side. A general design method based on the established mathematical model is proposed. The worst scenarios (i.e., the maximum value of misalignment) are used for the optimization of the system parameters. The control strategy for VI without any communication link to the primary side is established. Finally, a 1-kW IPT system for tolerance of k of 0.15-0.5 and output voltage of 74-150Vvariation is set up. The experimental results showthat the horizontal and vertical directionmisalignment ranges reach +/- 47% and +140%, respectively, and the maximum system efficiency exceeds 96% for full power output. The proposed system improves the freedom and stability of charging in the harsh underwater environment.

AB In some real-time Internet of Things (IoT) applications, the timeliness of sensor data is very important for the performance of a system. How to collect the data of sensor nodes (SNs) is a problem to be solved for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in a specified area, where different nodes have different timeliness priorities. To efficiently collect the data, a guided search deep reinforcement learning (GSDRL) algorithm is presented to help the UAV with different initial positions to independently complete the task of data collection and forwarding. First, the data collection process is modeled as a sequential decision problem for minimizing the average age of information (AoI) or maximizing the number of collected nodes according to specific environment. Then, the data collection strategy is optimized by the GSDRL algorithm. After training the network using the GSDRL algorithm, the UAV has the ability to perform autonomous navigation and decision-making to complete the complexity task more efficiently and rapidly. Simulation experiments show that the GSDRL algorithm has strong adaptability to adverse environments and obtains a good strategy for UAV data collection and forwarding.

AB Efficient task execution and optimized combat effectiveness can be achieved when a cluster of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) work collaboratively by assigning various tasks to each UAV reasonably. This paper suggests an algorithm for assigning tasks to a cluster of UAVs using an improved version of the Artificial Gorilla Troops Optimizer (GTO) that incorporates multiple strategies. The proposed algorithm adopts the Halton sequence to generate the initial population to ensure diversity. It uses an information sharing search strategy to enhance communication between the silverback gorilla and the population, effectively jumping out of the local optimal solution. In addition, the problem of inadequate solution accuracy caused by rapid convergence in the middle and later stages of iteration is improved using the golden sine strategy to coordinate GTO's global searching and local mining capabilities. Based on the experimental results, it has been determined that the proposed algorithm outperforms other swarm intelligence algorithms in terms of convergence value and rate across various test functions. Additionally, it has been found to achieve faster and more stable task assignment results.

ID RADAR
AB To enable next-generation connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), the future Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) network is expected to provide centimeter-accurate localization service while attaining low-latency transmissions in high-mobility environments. Nevertheless, these unprecedented requirements are far beyond the capabilities of 5G vehicular networks. Given the above evolution trend, a natural idea is thus to design a joint system architecture that combines both communications and sensing subsystems. To this end, research efforts toward integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) for the V2X network are well underway. It is our belief that ISAC should facilitate both sensing and communication via a single system in a spectrum-/energy-/cost-efficient way. Moreover, it can also improve the performance of both functionalities with mutual assistance, which is also essential to enable CAV's mission-critical services for 6G and beyond V2X. In this article, we first provide a brief historical overview of V2X and ISAC. In particular, we analyze the forces driving the usage of ISAC in V2X. Then we introduce three ISAC design schemes based on their underlying systems. We also survey state-of-the-art enabling technologies by reviewing recent developments of ISAC-assisted beamforming technologies in vehicular networks. Finally, we shed light on some potential challenges and research directions.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications have evolved to a wide range of fields in the last decade. One of the main challenges in autonomous tasks is the UAV stability during maneuvers. Thus, attitude and position control play a crucial role in stabilizing the vehicle in the desired orientation and path. Many control techniques have been developed for this. However, proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers are often used due their structure and efficiency. Despite PID's good performance, different requirements may be present at different mission stages. The main contribution of this research work is the development of a novel strategy based on a fuzzy-gain scheduling mechanism to adjust the PID controller to stabilize both position and altitude. This control strategy must be effective, simple, and robust to uncertainties and external disturbances. The Robot Operating System (ROS) integrates the proposed system and the flight control unit. The obtained results showed that the proposed approach was successfully applied to the trajectory tracking and revealed a good performance compared to conventional PID and in the presence of noises. In the tests, the position controller was only affected when the altitude error was higher, with an error of 2% lower.

AB The segmentation of citrus trees in a natural orchard environment is a key technology for achieving the fully autonomous operation of agricultural unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Therefore, a tree segmentation method based on monocular machine vision technology and a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm are proposed in this paper to segment citrus trees precisely under different brightness and weed coverage conditions. To reduce the sensitivity to environmental brightness, a selective illumination histogram equalization method was developed to compensate for the illumination, thereby improving the brightness contrast for the foreground without changing its hue and saturation. To accurately differentiate fruit trees from different weed coverage backgrounds, a chromatic aberration segmentation algorithm and the Otsu threshold method were combined to extract potential fruit tree regions. Then, 14 color features, five statistical texture features, and local binary pattern features of those regions were calculated to establish an SVM segmentation model. The proposed method was verified on a dataset with different brightness and weed coverage conditions, and the results show that the citrus tree segmentation accuracy reached 85.27% +/- 9.43%; thus, the proposed method achieved better performance than two similar methods.

AB In this letter, we consider state estimation and local mapping with a micro aerial vehicle inside a tunnel that can be modeled as a generalized cylinder, using a three-dimensional lidar and an inertial measurement unit. This axisymmetric environment poses unique challenges in terms of localization and mapping. The point cloud data returned by the sensor consists of indiscriminate partial cylindrical patches complicating data association. The proposed method reconstructs an egocentric local map through an optimization process on a nonlinear manifold, which is then fed into a constrained unscented Kalman filter. The proposed method easily adapts to different diameters, cross sections, and changes in center line curves. The proposed approach outperforms our previous contribution [T. Ozaslan, C. Loianno, J. Keller, C. J. Taylor, V. Kumar, J. M. Wozencraft, and T. Hood, "Autonomous navigation and mapping for inspection of penstocks and tunnels with MAVs," IEEE Robotics Automation Letter, vol. 2, no. 3, pp. 1740-1747, Jul. 2017] in terms of mapping quality and robustness to noncylindrical cross sections. Our motivation is to automate the labor intensive, dangerous, and the expensive inspection of penstocks with the least operator intervention. We present experimental results obtained in Center Hill Dam, TN, USA, to validate the proposed approach.

AB The navigation, guidance and control (NGC) system of Reusable Launch Vehicle - Technology Demonstrator (RLV-TD) is the most complex system ever flown in ISRO's launches. It includes a navigation system employing traditional inertial navigation system along with global positioning system aiding and radar altimeter, ceramic servo accelerometer package, angle of attack-based control, different control systems, including secondary injection thrust vector control, reaction control system and aero control surfaces. Closed loop simulations of integrated NGC system of RLV-TD are of utmost importance to ensure mission success by assessment of system performance in nominal and off-nominal flight conditions. Validation is achieved through progressive evaluations in different levels of integrated simulation, namely autonomous simulations, software in loop simulation, on-board processor in loop simulation, hardware in loop simulation and actuator in loop simulation using Iron Bird test facility. This article discusses the overall NGC system, challenges faced during the realization of the simulation test bed, including system design to validate the new on-board elements, commissioning of Iron Bird facility and validation through various phases of simulation. The outcome of these simulations played a crucial role in bringing about improvements and helping in the evolution of the on-board system to the final configuration, ensuring the success of the mission.

DE mobile charging robots; path planning; GWO; A* algorithm; parking lots
AB With the popularization of electric vehicles, early built parking lots cannot solve the charging problem of a large number of electric vehicles. Mobile charging robots have autonomous navigation and complete charging functions, which make up for this deficiency. However, there are static obstacles in the parking lot that are random and constantly changing their position, which requires a stable and fast iterative path planning method. The gray wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm is one of the optimization algorithms, which has the advantages of fast iteration speed and stability, but it has the drawback of easily falling into local optimization problems. This article first addresses this issue by improving the fitness function and position update of the GWO algorithm and then optimizing the convergence factor. Subsequently, the fitness function of the improved gray wolf optimization (IGWO) algorithm was further improved based on the minimum cost equation of the A* algorithm. The key coefficients AC1 and AC2 of two different fitness functions, Fitness1 and Fitness2, were discussed. The improved gray wolf optimization algorithm integrating A* algorithm (A*-IGWO) has improved the number of iterations and path length compared to the GWO algorithm in parking lots path planning problems.

AB In this paper, a distributed, autonomous, cooperative mission-planning (DACMP) approach was proposed to focus on the problem of the real-time cooperative searching and surveillance of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs) with threats in uncertain and highly dynamic environments. To deal with this problem, a time-varying probabilistic grid graph was designed to represent the perception of a target based on its a priori dynamics. A heuristic search strategy based on pyramidal maps was also proposed. Using map information at different scales makes it easier to integrate local and global information, thereby improving the search capability of UAVs, which has not been previously considered. Moreover, we proposed an adaptive distributed task assignment method for cooperative search and surveillance tasks by considering the UAV motion environment as a potential field and modeling the effects of uncertain maps and targets on candidate solutions through potential field values. The results highlight the advantages of search task execution efficiency. In addition, simulations of different scenarios show that the proposed approach can provide a feasible solution for multiple UAVs in different situations and is flexible and stable in time-sensitive environments.

AB With the development of intelligent transportation systems, most human objects can be accurately detected in normal road scenes. However, the detection accuracy usually decreases sharply when the pedestrians are merged into the background with very similar colors or textures. In this paper, a camouflaged object detection method is proposed to detect the pedestrians or vehicles from the highly similar background. Specifically, we design a guide-learning-based multi-scale detection network (GLNet) to distinguish the weak semantic distinction between the pedestrian and its similar background, and output an accurate segmentation map to the autonomous driving system. The proposed GLNet mainly consists of a backbone network for basic feature extraction, a guide-learning module (GLM) to generate the principal prediction map, and a multi-scale feature enhancement module (MFEM) for prediction map refinement. Based on the guide learning and coarse-to-fine strategy, the final prediction map can be obtained with the proposed GLNet which precisely describes the position and contour information of the pedestrians or vehicles. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, e.g., CHAMELEON, CAMO, COD10K, and NC4K, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GLNet compared with several existing state-of-the-art methods.

AB The resilience assessment for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms is an effective method of measuring the risk resistance of UAV swarms. Although preliminary studies have been performed on the resilience assessment for UAV swarms, these studies still have limitations that cannot be ignored, such as network homogeneity, unreasonable resilience process models, and stringent mission baselines. These limitations reduce the reference value of the evaluation results. Therefore, a new baseline-resilience assessment method for UAV swarms is proposed in this article. First, a topological model of a UAV swarm heterogeneous communication network is constructed by introducing the concept of heterogeneous graphs. Second, regarding the integrity of the resilience process, an innovative resilience process model is established. Third, a mission-oriented UAV swarm baseline-resilience assessment method is proposed based on the topological and resilience process models. Finally, the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed evaluation method are verified by simulations. The results show that the proposed evaluation method is more in line with actual situations than other evaluation methods and the obtained resilience value is more valuable for reference.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, are envisioned to support extensive applications in next-generation wireless networks in both civil and military fields. Empowering UAV networks' intelligence with artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML), techniques, is inevitable and appealing to enable the aforementioned applications. To solve the problems of traditional cloud-centric ML for UAV networks such as privacy concerns, unacceptable latency, and resource burden, a distributed ML technique, federated learning (FL), recently has been proposed to enable multiple UAVs to collaboratively train an ML model without letting out raw data. However, almost all existing FL paradigms are still centralized (i.e., a central entity is in charge of ML model aggregation and fusion over the whole network), which could result in the issue of a single point of failure and are inappropriate to UAV networks with both unreliable nodes and links. Thus motivated, in this article, we propose a novel architecture called Decentralized Federated Learning for UAV Networks (DFL-UN), which enables FL within UAV networks without a central entity. We also conduct a preliminary simulation study to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the DFLUN architecture. Finally, we discuss the main challenges and potential research directions in the DFL-UN.

AB Driver distraction and fatigue have become one of the leading causes of severe traffic accidents. Hence, driver inattention monitoring systems are crucial. Even with the growing development of advanced driver assistance systems and the introduction of third-level autonomous vehicles, this task is still trending and complex due to challenges such as the illumination change and the dynamic background. To reliably compare and validate driver inattention monitoring methods, a limited number of public datasets are available. In this paper, we put forward a public, well-structured and complete dataset, named Multiview, Multimodal and Multispectral Driver Action Dataset (3MDAD). The dataset is mainly composed of two sets: the first one recorded in daytime and the second one at nighttime. Each set consists of two synchronized data modalities, both from frontal and side views. More than 60 drivers are asked to execute 16 in-vehicle actions under a wide range of naturalistic driving settings. In contrast to other public datasets, 3MDAD presents multiple modalities, spectrums and views under different time and weather conditions. To highlight the utility of our dataset, we independently analyze the driver action recognition results adapted to each modality and those obtained of several combinations of modalities.

AB This study proposes a 3-D seafloor scanning method using sonar images obtained by an acoustic lens-based multibeam sonar (ALMS). ALMS is a forward-looking sonar and is generally used to implement real-time acoustic vision for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). ALMS is originally not a 3-D sonar, and elevation information is eliminated when the 3-D world is mapped to the 2-D sonar image. The proposed method provides a unique analysis of sonar image geometry for extracting the missing elevation information. Different from conventional 3-D reconstruction methods, the proposed method can be continuously executed regardless of the existence of any remarkable features in the sonar image, which means that the proposed method can scan the seafloor during a full-time AUV operation. Once the 3-D seafloor data are obtained, the height of the seafloor can be used for the detection of suspected objects. Therefore, the proposed method enables long-range seafloor object detection, triggering succeeding processes involving the AUV approaching the detected object, and the start of a detailed investigation at a close range.

AB The conventional initial alignment algorithms are invalid in the polar region. This is caused by the rapid convergence of the Earth meridians in the high-latitude areas. However, the initial alignment algorithms are important for the accurate navigation of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles. The polar transversal initial alignment algorithm is proposed to overcome this problem. In the polar transversal initial alignment algorithm, the transversal geographic frame is chosen as the navigation frame. The polar region in the conventional frames is equivalent to the equatorial region in the transversal frames. Therefore, the polar transversal initial can be effectively applied in the polar region. According to the complex environment in the polar region, a large misalignment angle is considered in this paper. Based on the large misalignment angle condition, the non-linear dynamics models are established. In addition, the simplified unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is chosen to realize the data fusion. Two comparison simulations and an experiment are performed to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. The simulation and experiment results indicate the validity of the proposed algorithm, especially when large misalignment angles occur.

ID ADAPTIVE DYNAMIC WALKING; QUADRUPED ROBOT; RESCUE; SEARCH
AB In recent years, a number operational unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) have been developed that can negotiate irregular terrain. They have a number of degrees-of-freedom (DOF) giving them enhanced mobility, e.g., the ability to climb stairs and over obstacles. However, operating them remotely is complicated because their controllers are similar to conventional control pads or joysticks used in computer games or toys. It is hard for the operator to achieve an intuitive and natural feel, thus mistakes are common. To intuitively control the locomotion of a UGV with many DOFs, a master-slave operation was implemented. A novel UGV called Kurogane, which consists of a typical crawler combined with a human-like torso section, was developed. The torso section is controlled via a wearable controller interface. In addition, the UGV is equipped with models of muscle viscoelasticity and stretch reflex, called the involuntary autonomous adaptation system, inspired by the adaptive compliance of animals. The proposed system can autonomously and flexibly react and adapt to irregular terrain in real time. Therefore, the operation of Kurogane is simple and does not require great skill or precision. Experimental results show that it performs well over a fixed step, stairs, and rough outdoor terrain. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID HOUGH TRANSFORM
AB Plane detection in 3-D space is a core function of the autonomous mobile robot. A representative technique for plane detection is the Hough transform method. The Hough transform is robust to noise and makes accurate plane detection possible. However, a common problem in methods based on the Hough transform is that too much time is required to calculate parameters, which adds computational cost and memory requirements for parameter voting to find the distribution of mixed multiple planes in the parameter space. Furthermore, real-time processing for sequential image sequences is challenging, because the whole process must be repetitively performed for the next detection. We extend the conventional self-organizing map by introducing a real-time clustering method and by detecting multiple planes through the creation, extinction, renewal, and merging of plane parameter data, which are input sequentially. The proposed method is also based on reliable plane detection through a planarity evaluation during data sampling. The results of experiments conducted under various conditions with an unmanned vehicle demonstrate that the proposed method is more accurate and faster than conventional methods.

AB Transportation is the backbone of the economy and urban development. Improving the efficiency, sustainability, resilience, and intelligence of transportation systems is critical and also challenging. The constantly changing traffic conditions, the uncertain influence of external factors (e.g. weather, accidents), and the interactions among multiple travel modes and multi-type flows result in the dynamic and stochastic natures of transportation systems. The planning, operation, and control of transportation systems require flexible and adaptable strategies in order to deal with uncertainty, non-linearity, variability, and high complexity. In this context, Reinforcement Learning (RL) that enables autonomous decision-makers to interact with the complex environment, learn from the experiences, and select optimal actions has been rapidly emerging as one of the most useful approaches for smart transportation applications. This paper conducts a bibliometric analysis to identify the development of RL-based methods for transportation applications, representative journals/conferences, and leading topics in recent 10 years. Then, this paper presents a comprehensive literature review on applications of RL in transportation based on specific topics. The potential future research directions of RL applications and developments are also discussed.

AB In cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network, a minimization problem on the weighted sum of time cost and expected outage duration is considered. Taking advantage of UAV's adjustable mobility, a UAV navigation approach is formulated to achieve the aforementioned optimization goal. Conventional offline optimization techniques suffer from inefficiency in accomplishing the formulated UAV navigation task due to the practical consideration of local building distribution and directional antenna radiation pattern. Alternatively, after mapping the navigation task into a Markov decision process (MDP), a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-aided solution is proposed to help the UAV find the optimal flying direction within each time slot, and thus the designed trajectory towards the destination can be generated. To help the DRL agent commit a better trade-off between sampling priority and diversity, a novel quantum-inspired experience replay (QiER) framework is proposed, via relating experienced transition's importance to its associated quantum bit (qubit) and applying Grover iteration based amplitude amplification technique. Compared to several representative DRL-related and non-learning baselines, the effectiveness and supremacy of the proposed DRL-QiER solution are demonstrated and validated in numerical results.

AB An extremely magmatic accretion could exist along an ultraslow-spreading ridge that has been approved and surveyed, but less attention has been paid to its associated hydrothermal system, as it is supposed to be similar to those of fast/medium-spreading ridges. Here using an autonomous underwater vehicle and a human-occupied vehicle, a systematic investigation was conducted on the hydrothermal system of an extremely magmatic ac-cretion segment along the Southwest Indian Ridge (5028 & PRIME; E). A collapsed chimney, microbial mat, and diffused fluid were observed in the old Duanqiao hydrothermal field (DQF), which was earlier a weakly active hydro-thermal area. Notably, evident hydrothermal anomalies, including oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), turbidity, and methane, were detected above the new DQF, which lies southwest of the old DQF. Based on this investigation, we concluded that ORP is one of the most effective parameters available to identify vent location by analyzing each type of detected hydrothermal anomaly and the near-bottom magnetic inversion can image the suspected hydrothermal fluid circulation pathways. In general, we believe that the new DQF is controlled by a magmatic chamber different from those found on fast/medium-spreading ridges, and could be a large hydro-thermal system.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are submersible vehicles that can carry out a wide range of tasks, depending on their design. The design of AUVs has a significant impact on their hydrodynamic performance. A streamlined AUV hull form can be divided into three main parts: the head, middle body, and tail. In this study, we investigated the effects of head form on resistance performance and flow characteristics for an AUV hull. Myring equations are used in the creation of the AUV hull profile, and the exponential parameter (n) is considered to diversify the head forms. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation software ANSYS Fluent is used to carry out the RANS simulations for the investigation. The analyses are carried out within a range of 0.3 m/s to 1.4 m/s flow velocities to consider the effect of the Reynolds number. The head forms that are most effective in terms of drag and have the greatest volume are evaluated and suggested. Essential design characteristics such as velocity-coloured streamlines, pressure and skin friction distribution, wake area and drag coefficients are shown and discussed. The findings can be used as a guideline to minimize resistance and enhance the design of AUV models.

ID TRAJECTORY-TRACKING; GUIDANCE; VEHICLES
AB The portable modular AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle), named ZFAUV, has the ability to move laterally. Its turning radius becomes smaller as the forward speed decreases. Based on this special maneuverability, a modified LOS (line of sight) path following strategy, integrating basic LOS and lateral movement, is proposed. The main idea of this strategy is to improve the path following performance through cross-track error and heading error. That is to say, the ZFAUV continues to move toward the current waypoint during a survey task. If ZFAUV deviates from the desired path due to disturbances from the wind, waves, current, or other uncertainties, it gradually returns to the desired path under lateral maneuverability. At the same time, in order to reduce overshoot after reaching the current waypoint, an arc transiting strategy and decelerating strategy (if necessary) are adopted. Through this strategy, the path following performance is greatly improved. Based on mathematical modeling, this strategy is simulated with a square path and a triangular path. The same paths are selected in lake experiments. The experimental results are in agreement with the simulation results, which demonstrate the validity of this strategy.

AB In order to monitor and manage vessels in channels effectively, identification and tracking are very necessary. This work developed a maritime unmanned aerial vehicle (Mar-UAV) system equipped with a high-resolution camera and an Automatic Identification System (AIS). A multi-feature and multi-level matching algorithm using the spatiotemporal characteristics of aerial images and AIS information was proposed to detect and identify field vessels. Specifically, multi-feature information, including position, scale, heading, speed, etc., are used to match between real-time image and AIS message. Additionally, the matching algorithm is divided into two levels, point matching and trajectory matching, for the accurate identification of surface vessels. Through such a matching algorithm, the Mar-UAV system is able to automatically identify the vessel's vision, which improves the autonomy of the UAV in maritime tasks. The multi-feature and multi-level matching algorithm has been employed for the developed Mar-UAV system, and some field experiments have been implemented in the Yangzi River. The results indicated that the proposed matching algorithm and the Mar-UAV system are very significant for achieving autonomous maritime supervision.

AB Software-defined vehicular sensor networks in agriculture, such as autonomous vehicle navigation based on wireless multi-sensor networks, can lead to more efficient precision agriculture. In SDN-based vehicle sensor networks, the data plane is simplified and becomes more efficient by introducing a centralized controller. However, in a wireless environment, the main controller node may leave the sensor network due to the dynamic topology change or the unstable wireless signal, leaving the rest of network devices without control, e.g., a sensor node as a switch may forward packets according to stale rules until the controller updates the flow table entries. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel SDN-based vehicular sensor networks architecture which can minimize the performance penalty of controller connection loss. We achieve this by designing a connection state detection and self-learning mechanism. We build prototypes based on extended Open vSwitch and Ryu. The experimental results show that the recovery time from controller connection loss is under 100 ms and it keeps rule updating in real time with a stable throughput. This architecture enhances the survivability and stability of SDN-based vehicular sensor networks in precision agriculture.

AB The problem of attitude stabilization of an unconventional tandem ducted fan aircraft in a hover configuration subject to low-order controller structure constraint is addressed. The novel vehicle is naturally unstable and exhibits cross-coupling among the longitudinal, lateral and heading motion on the aircraft, so the design of flight controllers is not straightforward as in the conventional fixed-wing aircraft case. Three independent controls mixing are constructed as control inputs. An accurate yet simple enough dynamics model is first presented based on the first principles and static experimental tests. To facilitate the practical implementation, direct design of low order controller within Linear Matrix Inequalities framework is adopted to construct an autonomous flight control law for the platform. Details of the static loop shaping controller design are presented, together with a comprehensive analysis of simulation tests. Military rotorcraft handling qualities specifications are utilized as a reference to evaluate the controller performance. Classic loop shaping and conventional PID are also applied to the same plant for comparison. The resulting static robust controller produces just three states with guaranteed robustness and achieves the top level performance in accordance with the military rotorcraft standard ADS-33D-PRF (Standard 2000).

AB Since fallen trees are a key factor in biodiversity and biogeochemical cycling, information about their spatial distribution is of use in determining species distribution and nutrient and carbon cycling in forest ecosystems. Ground-based surveys are both time consuming and labour intensive. Remote-sensing technology can reduce these costs. Here, we used high-spatial-resolution aerial photographs (0.5-1.0 cm per pixel) taken from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to survey fallen trees in a deciduous broadleaved forest in eastern Japan. In nine sub-plots we found a total of 44 fallen trees by ground survey. From the aerial photographs, we identified 80% to 90% of fallen trees that were >30 cm in diameter or >10 m in length, but missed many that were narrower or shorter. This failure may be due to the similarity of fallen trees to trunks and branches of standing trees or masking by standing trees. Views of the same point from different angles may improve the detection rate because they would provide more opportunity to detect fallen trees hidden by standing trees. Our results suggest that UAV surveys will make it possible to monitor the spatial and temporal variations in forest structure and function at lower cost.

AB Mission scenarios beyond line of sight or with limited ground control station access require capabilities for autonomous safe navigation and necessitate a continuous extension of existing and potentially outdated information about obstacles. The presented approach is a novel synthesis of techniques for 3D environment perception and global path planning. A locally bounded sensor fusion approach is used to extract sparse obstacles for global incremental path planning in an anytime fashion. During the flight, a stereo camera checks the field of view along the flight path ahead by analyzing depth images. A 3D occupancy grid is built incrementally. To reduce the high data rate and storage demands of grid-type maps, an approximated polygonal world model is created. For a compacted representation, it uses prisms and ground planes. This enables the system to constantly renew and update its knowledge about obstacles. An incremental heuristic path planner uses both a-priori information as well as incremental obstacle updates to assure a collision-free path at any time. Mapping results from flight tests show the functionality of onboard world modeling from real sensor data. Path planning feasibility is demonstrated within a simulation environment considering world model changes inside the vehicle's field of view.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) can be controlled in diverse ways. One of the most common is through artificial intelligence (AI), which comprises different methods, such as reinforcement learning (RL). The article aims to provide a comparison of three RL algorithms-DQN as the benchmark, SARSA as a same-family algorithm, and A2C as a different-structure one-to address the problem of a UAV navigating from departure point A to endpoint B while avoiding obstacles and, simultaneously, using the least possible time and flying the shortest distance. Under fixed premises, this investigation provides the results of the performances obtained for this activity. A neighborhood environment was selected because it is likely one of the most common areas of use for commercial drones. Taking DQN as the benchmark and not having previous knowledge of the behavior of SARSA or A2C in the employed environment, the comparison outcomes showed that DQN was the only one achieving the target. At the same time, SARSA and A2C did not. However, a deeper analysis of the results led to the conclusion that a fine-tuning of A2C could overcome the performance of DQN under certain conditions, demonstrating a greater speed at maximum finding with a more straightforward structure.

AB The increasing popularity and usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has brought about new challenges in airspace management. With the number of drones expected to grow even further in the coming years, there is an urgent need for an autonomous traffic management system (TMS) that can safely and effectively manage drone traffic in the airspace. It is critical that this TMS be built with principles of the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad. In this paper, a traffic management system for UAVs is presented that takes advantage of a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network. The TMS provides a decentralized and secure method to manage and deconflict drone flight paths, allowing for safe navigation in crowded airspaces. Through a series of simulated experiments, we demonstrated the system's capabilities in handling path creation, multiple conflict resolutions, and large numbers of drones. Simulated tests showed that the proposed system was able to handle deconfliction of 1000 drones inside of a one square kilometer, and returned calculated paths for drones in 60 to 2000 ms with up to 100 deconflictions. The Hyperledger Fabric powered traffic management system showcased the potential to leverage permissioned blockchain technology in improving drone traffic management.

AB Mesophotic coral reefs are estimated to represent up to 80% of the total areal coverage for coral reefs worldwide. Quantifying mesophotic coral reef community structure and function, at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and the ability to monitor these attributes repeatedly and accurately, is an ecological priority. Recent discussions on the relative merits of remotely operated vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles (ROVs and AUVs, respectively) versus the use of technical divers using quadrats or photoquadrats to obtain quantitative imagery undervalues the distinct and important complimentary roles that both approaches bring to the study of mesophotic coral reefs. However, all platforms must adhere to fundamental photogrammetry principles to accomplish the goal of accurate and repeatable surveys of coral reefs. Here we show that quantifying the projected surface area of sponge populations for a tropical coral reef on Puerto Rico using ROV imagery, not originally collected for ecological characterizations, requires specific screening guidelines to ensure the images are orthogonal and processed to obtain orthorectified images for the quantification of benthic communities. This is required to minimize multiple sources of error that could confound quantitative estimates of percent cover, biomass, and/or abundance of benthic taxa on shallow and mesophotic coral reefs using plot, or plotless, designs.

AB Automatic Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition (TSDR) provides drivers with critical information on traffic signs, and it constitutes an enabling condition for autonomous driving. Misclassifying even a single sign may constitute a severe hazard, which negatively impacts the environment, infrastructures, and human lives. Therefore, a reliable TSDR mechanism is essential to attain a safe circulation of road vehicles. Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) techniques that use Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been proposed, but no agreement on a preferred ML algorithm nor perfect classification capabilities were always achieved by any existing solutions. Consequently, our study employs ML-based classifiers to build a TSR system that analyzes a sliding window of frames sampled by sensors on a vehicle. Such TSR processes the most recent frame and past frames sampled by sensors through (i) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and (ii) Stacking Meta-Learners, which allow for efficiently combining base-learning classification episodes into a unified and improved meta-level classification. Experimental results by using publicly available datasets show that Stacking Meta-Learners dramatically reduce misclassifications of signs and achieved perfect classification on all three considered datasets. This shows the potential of our novel approach based on sliding windows to be used as an efficient solution for TSR.

AB The paper proposes a formal approach for describing and evaluating the datasets that are used in automotive applications for machine learning, testing, and validation purposes. Proper, that is, qualitative and quantitative characterization of the datasets can simplify the analysis, evaluation, and comparison of perception-based algorithms designed for highly automated vehicles. Such formalism is also needed to achieve compliance with the automotive industry safety standards that have been recently introduced. Characterization in the form of size or type of raw data, number of recognized and classified objects, and environmental parameters is not perfectly suitable for describing both the static and dynamic aspects of automotive datasets; therefore, another approach is required. In this paper, an efficient method based on an object tracking mechanism, grid representation of the sensor field of view, heatmap concept, and Wasserstein metric is proposed. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated by its ability to handle both the size, properties, and diversity of the dataset, including static and time-varying aspects. The presented description can also be used to compare different datasets and to define the amount of data to be collected.

ID LOIHI
AB Depth estimation is an important computer vision task, useful in particular for navigation in autonomous vehicles, or for object manipulation in robotics. Here, we propose to solve it using StereoSpike, an end-to-end neuromorphic approach, combining two event-based cameras and a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) with a modified U-Net-like encoder-decoder architecture. More specifically, we used the Multi Vehicle Stereo Event Camera Dataset (MVSEC). It provides a depth ground-truth, which was used to train StereoSpike in a supervised manner, using surrogate gradient descent. We propose a novel readout paradigm to obtain a dense analog prediction-the depth of each pixel- from the spikes of the decoder. We demonstrate that this architecture generalizes very well, even better than its non-spiking counterparts, leading to near state-of-the-art test accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that such a large-scale regression problem is solved by a fully spiking neural network. Finally, we show that very low firing rates (< 5%) can be obtained via regularization, with a minimal cost in accuracy. This means that StereoSpike could be efficiently implemented on neuromorphic chips, opening the door for low power and real time embedded systems.

AB The UK Government has endorsed the case for autonomous vehicle (AV) technology and its economic benefits in its industrial strategies since 2013. In late 2016 the Science and Technology Committee in the House of Lords (the legislature's upper chamber) conducted an Inquiry into the policy. We conduct a content analysis of the text corpus of the Inquiry. Drawing from theories of sociotechnical change we explore how it contributes to building a vision of a future AV world embedded in a national economic and technological project. The technology is framed as a solution to societal grand challenges and the Inquiry corpus is dominated by actors committed to the project. Alternative visions, including sceptical interpretations, are present in the corpus, but rare, reflecting the selection process for contributions to the Inquiry. Predominantly, the corpus represents the public as deficient: dangerous drivers, unaware of promised benefits and unduly anxious about the unfamiliar. Their views are marginal in this Parliamentary Inquiry's findings. AV technology is one of several possible means to pursue wider mobility policy goals of greater safety, affordability, access and sustainability. Our analysis suggests that the pursuit of an AV future risks becoming a goal in itself instead of a means to these broader societal goals.

AB Path planning is the essential aspect of autonomous flight system for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). An improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, named GBPSO, is proposed to enhance the performance of three-dimensional path planning for fixed-wing UAVs in this paper. In order to improve the convergence speed and the search ability of the particles, the competition strategy is introduced into the standard PSO to optimize the global best solution during the process of particle evolution. More specifically, according to a set of segment evaluation functions, the optimal path found by single waypoint selection way is adopted as one of the candidate global best paths. Meanwhile, based on the particle as an integrated individual, an optimal trajectory from the start point to the flight target is generated as another global best candidate path. Subsequently, the global best path is determined by considering the pre-specified elevation function values of two candidate paths. Finally, to verify the performance of the proposed method, GBPSO is compared with some existing path-planning methods in two simulation scenarios with different obstacles. The results demonstrate that GBPSO is more effective, robust and feasible for UAV path planning.

AB Enhancing the efficiency of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) collision avoidance can yield a significant impact, as it can result in safer navigation and lower energy consumption. This paper introduces a robust approach employing deep reinforcement learning theory to facilitate informed collision avoidance decisions within intricate maritime environments. The restrictions on USV maneuverability and international regulations for preventing collisions at sea are studied and quantified, particularly focusing on the shape and size changes of the ship's domain caused by USV speed. Based on the deep Q network, an improved methodology is designed, incorporating a noisy network, prioritized experience replay, dueling neural network architecture, and double Q learning, resulting in a highly efficient sampling, exploration, and learning process. To curtail computational expenses associated with USVs, a novel dynamic area restriction technique is proposed. Furthermore, an innovative USV state clipping method is introduced to mitigate training complexities. By utilizing the Unity platform, a virtual environment characterized by complexity and stochasticity is constructed for training and testing the collision avoidance of USVs This novel approach surpasses the performance of the pre-improvement algorithm across multiple collision avoidance effectiveness indicators and performance metrics.

AB In recent years, multiunmanned aerial vehicular systems (MUAVs) have become prevalent in divergent applications: agriculture, spectrum utilization, transportation, forest fire monitoring, and among others, due to their flexible, robust, and autonomous operational maneuver. Battery-powered multiunmanned aerial vehicles (MUAVs) systems possess limited computation and communication resources, significantly reducing their functional dimension by limiting mission time and range. To address this issue, we propose a federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL)-based intelligent and decentralized task offloading scheme for resource-constrained UAVs that can enhance the operational capability of the MUAV systems. Moreover, the proposed FDRL scheme can improve offloading policy quality while preserving data privacy in MUAV. However, such intelligent systems may fall prey to backdoor attacks that can intervene in the system's regular operation causing rapid degradation of its performance. We introduce a novel triggerless backdoor attack scheme on intelligent task offloading UAVs and analyze its impact to gauge the resiliency of the offloading policy in the presence of an adversary. Then, we propose lightweight agnostic defense mechanisms to combat such backdoors in multi-UAV settings. The extensive simulation results show that the proposed attack and defense strategies are practical and efficient.

AB A vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is essential for the autonomous vehicle industry, and with the advancement in VANET technology, security threats are increasing rapidly. Mitigation of these threats needs an intelligent security protocol that provides unbreakable security. In recent times, various three-factor authentication solutions for VANET were introduced that adopt the centralized Trusted Authority TA, which is responsible for assigning authentication parameters during vehicle registration, and the authentication process depends on these parameters. This article first explains the vulnerabilities of the recent three-factor (3F) authentication scheme presented by Xu et al. Our analysis proves that if an RSU is dishonest, it can easily bypass the TA and can create a session with OBU. Furthermore, this paper puts forward a new scheme that provides the 3F authentication for VANETs (TFPPASV) to resist RSU from bypassing the TA and to offer user privacy. The proposed scheme fulfills the security and performance requirements of the VANET. We use BAN-Logic analysis to perform a formal security analysis of the proposed scheme, in addition to the informal security feature discussion. Finally, we compare the security and performance of the proposed TFPPASV with some recent and related schemes.

AB Traffic sign classification plays a vital role in autonomous vehicles for its powerful capability in information representation. However, the low-quality data of traffic signs captured by in-vehicle cameras often inevitably bring inherent challenges to the one-shot classification task. Apart from the problem of data degradation, learning-based classification techniques of real traffic signs also come across the challenges of intra-class and inter-class data imbalance from the training data. To overcome the aforementioned problems, we propose an end-to-end degradation robust deep model, termed PcGAN, to classify traffic signs in a manner of few-shot learning. The proposed PcGAN models the joint distribution between the degraded traffic signal data and the corresponding prototypes from both degradation removal and generation perspectives by two alternating optimized modules, which ensures the generalization of the learned embedding of latent space for novel tasks. A multi-task loss function is designed to improve the robustness of PcGAN. Numerous experiments comprehensively demonstrate that the accuracy of our proposed PcGAN is improved by 5% compared with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in few-shot classification.

AB Collisions and groundings account for a great deal of fiscal losses and human risks in the statistics of marine accidents related to ocean going vessels. With highly automated vessels offering a high degree of situational awareness, algorithms can anticipate developments and suggest timely actions to avoid or deconflict critical events, in accordance to safe navigational practices and in compliance with the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). To avoid such accidents related to navigation, this article proposes a Short Horizon Planner (SHP) for decision support or automated route deviations, as a means to mitigate prevailing risks. The planner adopts a sampling-based planning framework that uses the concepts of cross-track error and speed loss during a steady turn, together with sampling spaces directly extracted from the electronic navigational chart to compute optimal and COLREGs compliant paths with the least deviation from the ship's nominal route. COLREGs compliance (rules 8, 13-17) is achieved through an elliptical-like representations of the given COLREGs, which rejects samples based on modified ship domains. High fidelity simulations show properties of the method and the information made available to human-or automated execution of route alterations.

AB Wireless communication and radars will play a crucial role for autonomous vehicles in the nearest future. However, the blockage caused by surrounding cars can degrade communication performance, while automotive radars are never aimed to operate in such conditions. Therefore, in this paper, the authors propose the concept of near-ground propagation, reducing the blockage effect in the road traffic conditions. Specifically, the radio waves may freely propagate under the blocking car's bottom if the antennas are placed as low as possible to the road. Based on the measured and modelled results presented in the paper, it may be claimed that near-ground communication and radar sensing are feasible and may combat even heavily obstructed cases. Nevertheless, some challenges associated with antenna locations were encountered. For example, it was discovered that antenna height at 0.5 m acts less effectively against blockage than at 0.3 m. Next, the 27 dB excess loss at the 0.5 m antenna height in the radar deployment is larger than 17 dB at 0.3 m. In its turn, the higher ground clearance of the blocking vehicle positively affects the near-ground performance. Additionally, the signal propagation at the grazing angle crucially reduces the relevant losses.

TI Model Predictive Control-Based Multirotor Three-Dimensional Motion

SO JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB This study proposes a collision-free motion planning framework for indoor autonomous flight of multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based on the convex model predictive control (MPC) approach under a three-dimensional point cloud environment. The suggested framework is divided into three steps: full reference path generation, piecewise flight corridor (PFC) creation, and MPC-based motion planning. The framework begins with reconstructing boundary surfaces that can encapsulate the given point cloud in order to generate a full reference path by applying Dijkstra and Voronoi diagram algorithms. Then PFC that represents locally convex and feasible flight corridor is generated using the current vehicle state, triangulized obstacle, and full reference path. In such a way, the entire problem breaks down into a series of discretized convex motion planning problems whose solution can be found by applying MPC iteratively until the UAV reaches its final destination. The constraints of the MPC are set up with the dynamics of the UAV, PFC, and the performance limitation of the platform. The framework is verified with simulation under a MATLAB environment. As a result, the UAV can find the control variable needed to reach the final destination with the suggested framework. Also, the computational time of the suggested framework is shorter than those of full reference path optimization methods.

TI Wall Deadlock Evasion Control Based on Rotation Radius Adjustment
SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Motion control; autonomous vehicle navigation; dynamics; wheeled robots
AB This letter describes a wall deadlock evasion method for tracked vehicles. Wall deadlock is a phenomenon where the robot cannot rotate to the commanded direction when it collides with a wall, because the motion is restricted by the wall. The key idea behind solving this problem involves an adjustment of the rotation radius to generate sufficient rotational moment. There are several approaches to generate a rotational moment; however, no previous solution has been established to address this problem by adjusting the rotation radius based on the dynamics of wall deadlock. In this letter, the authors propose a new wall deadlock evasion method based on the sufficient rotation radius estimation. Experimental results show that the robot can generate rotational motion that satisfies conditions expected by the model. The wall deadlock evasion method is implemented and shows improved performance in terms of reproducibility of motion compared with the different approach proposed in our previous work. Wall deadlock evasion provides more choices of motion such as being as close to the obstacles as possible and ensures that the robot can continue locomotion after such motion. By handling wall deadlock, the robots can utilize surrounding walls for motion in situations such as relative positioning or driving in fixed lanes.

ID VEHICLE; INFORMATION; SUPPORT; BRAKING
AB Accurate understanding of driver behaviour is crucial for future Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving. For user acceptance it is important that ADAS respect individual driving styles and adapt accordingly. Using data collected during a naturalistic driving study carried out at the University of Southampton, we assess existing models of driver acceleration and speed choice during car following and when cornering. We observe that existing models of driver behaviour that specify a preferred inter-vehicle spacing in car-following situations appear to be too prescriptive, with a wide range of acceptable spacings visible in the naturalistic data. Bounds on lateral acceleration during cornering from the literature are visible in the data, but appear to be influenced by the minimum cornering radii specified in design codes for UK roadway geometry. This analysis of existing driver models is used to suggest a small set of parameters that are sufficient to characterise driver behaviour in car-following and curve driving, which may be estimated in real-time by an ADAS to adapt to changing driver behaviour. Finally, we discuss applications to adaptive ADAS with the objectives of improving road safety and promoting eco-driving, and suggest directions for future research.

AB In this paper, a new method coined dynamic two-directional two-dimensional principal component analysis (D(2D)(2)PCA) was established, which has further developed the feature expression of the video image data collected by the optical vision system of unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV). The contributions are as follows: (1) D(2D)(2)PCA is also based on the dynamic characteristics of image data in addition to being relied on the static relationship among data; (2) An image covariance matrix that directly uses the sample image data in the dynamic time series augmented matrix is constructed, and the projection vector for image feature extraction is derived; (3) To test and performance estimation of D(2D)(2)PCA, a series of experiments were performed on the video image data collected by underwater optical vision system. Experimental results show that, compared with the traditional underwater target recognition method, D (2D)(2)PCA has more effective feature extraction ability and higher target recognition accuracy, which improves the autonomous underwater operation ability of UUV.

AB This paper presents the design, manufacturing and testing of a Dual Accelerometer Vector Sensor (DAVS). The device was built within the activities of theWiMUST project, supported under the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, which aims to improve the efficiency of the methodologies used to perform geophysical acoustic surveys at sea by the use of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). The DAVS has the potential to contribute to this aim in various ways, for example, owing to its spatial filtering capability, it may reduce the amount of post processing by discriminating the bottom from the surface reflections. Additionally, its compact size allows easier integration with AUVs and hence facilitates the vehicle manoeuvrability compared to the classical towed arrays. The present paper is focused on results related to acoustic wave azimuth estimation as an example of its spatial filtering capabilities. The DAVS device consists of two tri-axial accelerometers and one hydrophone moulded in one unit. Sensitivity and directionality of these three sensors were measured in a tank, whilst the direction estimation capabilities of the accelerometers paired with the hydrophone, forming a vector sensor, were evaluated on a Medusa Class AUV, which was sailing around a deployed sound source. Results of these measurements are presented in this paper.

We begin by giving our view of why this emerging technology will become increasingly prevalent and why it is important that lawyers and regulators play an important role in its development. We go on to address the key legal, regulatory and ethical issues in respect of specific types of robotics, including automated vehicles and healthcare robots. We also focus on the impact that robotics will have on core legal practice areas, including data protection, intellectual property, consumer protection and commercial contracting. Our objective is to identify the key legal and regulatory implications of robotics, and to start a dialogue about how our existing legal framework might need to adapt and change to meet the demands of the robotics age.

ID ATTITUDE ESTIMATION; AUTONOMOUS FLIGHT; NAVIGATION; DESIGN; FUSION
AB This paper presents a non-linear state observer-based integrated navigation scheme for estimating the attitude, position and velocity of micro aerial vehicles (MAV) operating in GPS-denied indoor environments, using the measurements from low-cost MEMS (micro electro-mechanical systems) inertial sensors and an RGB-D camera. A robust RGB-D visual odometry (VO) approach was developed to estimate the MAV's relative motion by extracting and matching features captured by the RGB-D camera from the environment. The state observer of the RGB-D visual-aided inertial navigation was then designed based on the invariant observer theory for systems possessing symmetries. The motion estimates from the RGB-D VO were fused with inertial and magnetic measurements from the onboard MEMS sensors via the state observer, providing the MAV with accurate estimates of its full six degree-of-freedom states. Implementations on a quadrotor MAV and indoor flight test results demonstrate that the resulting state observer is effective in estimating the MAV's states without relying on external navigation aids such as GPS. The properties of computational efficiency and simplicity in gain tuning make the proposed invariant observer-based navigation scheme appealing for actual MAV applications in indoor environments.

AB Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) provide warnings to drivers and, if applicable, intervene to mitigate a collision if one is imminent. Autonomous emergency brakes (AEB) and lane keep assistance (LKA) systems are mandated in several new vehicles, given their predicted injury and fatality reduction benefits. These predicted benefits are based on the assumption that roads are always entirely supportive of ADAS technologies. Little research, however, has been conducted regarding the preparedness of the road network to support these technologies in Australia, given its vastly expansive terrain and varying road quality. The objective of this study was to estimate what proportion of crashes that are sensitive to AEB and LKA, would not be mitigated due to unsupportive road infrastructure, and therefore, the lost benefits of the technologies due to inadequate road infrastructure. To do this, previously identified technology effectiveness estimates and a published methodology for identifying ADAS-supportive infrastructure availability was applied to an estimated AEB and LKA-sensitive crash subset (using crash data from Victoria, South Australia and Queensland, 2013-2018 inclusive). Findings demonstrate that while the road networks across the three states appeared largely supportive of AEB technology, the lack of delineation across arterial and sub-arterial (or equivalent) roads is likely to have serious implications on road safety, given 13-23% of all fatal and serious injury (FSI) crashes that occurred on these road classes were LKA-sensitive. Based on historical crash data, over 37 fatalities and 357 serious injuries may not be avoided annually across the three Australian states based on the lack of satisfactory road delineation on arterial and sub-arterial (or equivalent) roads alone. Further, almost 24% of fatalities in Victoria, 24% of fatalities in Queensland and 21% of fatalities in South Australia (that are AEB- or LKA-sensitive) are unlikely to be prevented, given existing road infrastructure. These figures are conservative estimates of the lost benefits of the technologies as they only consider fatal and serious injury crashes and do not include minor injury or property damage crashes, the benefits of pedestrian-sensitive AEB crashes in high-speed zones or AEB fitted to heavy vehicles. It is timely for road investments to be considered, prioritised and allocated, given the anticipated penetration of the new technologies into the fleet, to ensure that the road infrastructure is capable of supporting the upcoming fleet safety improvements.

AB Aiming at the consensus tracking control problem of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with state constraints, a new neural network (NN) and barrier Lyapunov function based finite-time command filtered backstepping control scheme is proposed. The finite-time command filter is utilized to filtering the virtual control signal, the error compensation signal is constructed to eliminate filtering error due to the use of filter, and the NN approximation technology is used to deal with the unknown nonlinear dynamics. The control scheme can guarantee that the consensus tracking errors of position states converge into the desired neighborhood of the origin in finite-time while not exceeding the predefined constraints. Finally, simulation studies prove the feasibility of proposed control algorithm. (C) 2021 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we develop new methods to assess safety risks of an integrated GNSS/LiDAR navigation system for highly automated vehicle (HAV) applications. LiDAR navigation requires feature extraction (FE) and data association (DA). In prior work, we established an FE and DA risk prediction algorithm assuming that the set of extracted features matched the set of mapped landmarks. This paper addresses these limiting assumptions by incorporating a Kalman filter innovation-based test to detect unwanted object (UO). UO include unmapped, moving, and wrongly excluded landmarks. An integrity risk bound is derived to account for the risk of not detecting UO. Direct simulations and preliminary testing help quantify the impact on integrity and continuity of UO monitoring in an example GNSS/LiDAR implementation.

ID MONTE-CARLO METHODS
AB In recent years, particle filtering has become a powerful tool for tracking signals and time-varying parameters of random dynamic systems. These methods require a mathematical representation of the dynamics of the system evolution, together with assumptions of probabilistic models. In this paper, we present a new class of particle filtering methods that do not assume explicit mathematical forms of the probability distributions of the noise in the system. As a consequence, the proposed techniques are simpler, more robust, and more flexible than standard particle filters. Apart from the theoretical development of specific methods in the new class, we provide computer simulation results that demonstrate the performance of the algorithms in the problem of autonomous positioning of a vehicle in a 2-dimensional space.

AB In this paper, formation tracking for a multi-AUV system (MAS) using an improved adaptive sliding-mode control method is studied in the three-dimensional (3-D) underwater environment. Firstly, the kinematics model and the dynamic model of the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are given as the six dimensions of freedom (6-DOF) considered. Then, control law based on the mathematical model of the AUVs is proposed based on the improved sliding-mode method. A second-order sliding-mode control method is adopted to eliminate the chatting phenomenon of the controller. Thirdly, considering the water flow in the underwater working environment of the AUVs, an adaptive module is added to the controller. With the adaptive approach, the finite disturbances caused by water flow could be handled with the controller. The proposed method achieves stability by substituting an adaptive continuous term for the switching term in the controller. At last, a robust sliding-mode controller with continuous model predictive control strategy for the multi-AUV system is developed to achieve leader-follower formation tracking under the presence of bounded flow disturbances, and simulations are implemented to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

DT Article
DE depth estimation; deep learning; unmanned vehicles; parallax
AB Estimating the distance to objects is crucial for autonomous vehicles, but cost, weight or power constraints sometimes prevent the use of dedicated depth sensors. In this case, the distance has to be estimated from on-board mounted RGB cameras, which is a complex task especially for environments such as natural outdoor landscapes. In this paper, we present a new depth estimation method suitable for use in such landscapes. First, we establish a bijective relationship between depth and the visual parallax of two consecutive frames and show how to exploit it to perform motion-invariant pixel-wise depth estimation. Then, we detail our architecture which is based on a pyramidal convolutional neural network where each level refines an input parallax map estimate by using two customized cost volumes. We use these cost volumes to leverage the visual spatio-temporal constraints imposed by motion and make the network robust for varied scenes. We benchmarked our approach both in test and generalization modes on public datasets featuring synthetic camera trajectories recorded in a wide variety of outdoor scenes. Results show that our network outperforms the state of the art on these datasets, while also performing well on a standard depth estimation benchmark.

ID ATTRIBUTE-BASED SIGNCRYPTION; SIGNATURES; ENCRYPTION; SCHEME
AB In recent years, the development of vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) has received much attention in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Unlike traditional ad-hoc networks, VANETs are emerging with unique characteristics that share similar technology with autonomous vehicles (AVs) and automated driving systems (ASDs). Communication between vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure unit, such as a roadside unit (RSU), must be secured, concise, and authentic. Hence, an access control system for the ad-hoc environment is required. We introduced a level-based controlled signcryption (LBS) scheme, which can be easily constructed and implemented into an access control system for VANETs environment. Our encrypted message has a short and constant size, which is better when compared with other attribute-based signcryption or encryption. Confidentiality, privacy, and authenticity are also provided in our scheme to ensure secure and authentic communication. Therefore, our scheme has addressed communication cost, scalability, security, and privacy issues in VANETs. This primitive can be applied to simplify attribute-based access control, as the only attribute required is an integer representing the security level. Our objective is to improve the quality and security of VANET communication. Moreover, an optional privacy mechanism in our scheme provides flexibility in controlling node privacy in VANETs.

AB The rapid accumulation of large-scale driving data represents an opportunity to improve our understanding of driving behavior patterns and driver traveling intentions. However, limited efforts have been devoted to understanding these patterns and the travel intentions behind them. This study proposes a new trajectory topic model (TTM) to explore latent driving patterns from driving trajectory data and to qualitatively analyze drivers' main traveling intentions. These trajectory data were collected from more than 150,000 commercial vehicles in Fujian Province, China. After data preprocessing, the TTM was then established to decompose trajectory data into various topics with corresponding probabilities, which were correlated to drivers' preferences. Several experiments conducted in Fuzhou City were performed to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of the TTM using a real trajectory dataset. The results show that the TTM could effectively mine users' driving behavior patterns with topic probability. The model would enable us to understand the context in which drivers travel and learn their individual preferences. It is also beneficial in that it can predict drivers' behaviors, analyze traffic patterns in an entire city, and even help autonomous vehicles to learn from drivers.

AB Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) has been widely applied in the autonomous navigation and positioning of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-denied environments. However, existing VIO filtering algorithms have the defects of low positioning accuracy and weak robustness, especially in complex and changeable environments. Therefore, a novel robust adaptive VIO algorithm is proposed here. First, the H infinity criterion is introduced into the popular cubature multistate constraint Kalman filter (CMSCKF), which improves the robustness of the VIO system. Second, this article designs a characterization method to judge the uncertainty degree of VIO based on the limited memory exponential weighting theory. Finally, inspired by the idea of the Institute of Geodesy and Geophysics (IGG) III model, we further put forward a three-stage robust adaptive H infinity filtering algorithm and test the performance with the numerical simulation and the publicly available real-world Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute (KITTI) dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has better filtering accuracy and robustness.

AB Radar detection and communication are two essential sub-tasks for the operation of next-generation autonomous vehicles (AVs). The forthcoming proliferation of faster 5G networks utilizing mmWave has raised concerns on interference with automotive radar sensors, which has led to a body of research on Joint Radar-Communication (JRC). This paper considers the problem of time-sharing for JRC, with the additional simultaneous objective of minimizing the average age of information (AoI) transmitted by a JRC-equipped AV. We first formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We then propose a more general multi-agent system, with an appropriate medium access control (MAC) protocol, which is formulated as a partially observed Markov game (POMG). To solve the POMG, we propose a multi-agent extension of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, along with algorithmic features to enhance learning from raw observations. Simulations are run with a range of environmental parameters to mimic variations in real-world operation. The results show that the chosen deep reinforcement learning methods allow the agents to obtain strong performance with minimal a priori knowledge about the environment.

AB Performing collaborative semantic mapping is a critical challenge for cooperative robots to enhance their comprehensive contextual understanding of the surroundings. This article bridges the gap between the advances in collaborative geometry mapping that relies on pure geometry information fusion, and single robot semantic mapping that focuses on integrating continuous raw sensor data. In this article, a novel hierarchical collaborative probabilistic semantic mapping framework is proposed, where the problem is formulated in a distributed setting. The key novelty of this work is the modeling of the hierarchical semantic map fusion framework and its mathematical derivation of its probability decomposition. At the single robot level, the semantic point cloud is obtained by combining information from heterogeneous sensors and used to generate local semantic maps. At the collaborative robots level, local maps are shared among robots for global semantic map fusion. Since the voxel correspondence is unknown between local maps, an expectation-maximization approach is proposed to estimate the hidden data association. Then, Bayesian rule is applied to perform semantic and occupancy probability update. Experimental results on the unmanned aerial vehicle and the unmanned ground vehicle platforms show the high quality of global semantic maps, demonstrating the accuracy and utility in practical missions.

AB Autonomous vehicles require reliable and resilient sensor suites and ongoing validation through fleet-wide data collection. This paper proposes a Smart Black Box (SBB) to augment traditional low-bandwidth data logging with value-driven high-bandwidth data capture. The SBB caches short-term histories of data as buffers through a deterministic Mealy machine based on data value and similarity. Compression quality for each frame is determined by optimizing the trade-off between value and storage cost. With finite storage, prioritized data recording discards low-value buffers to make room for new data. This paper formulates SBB compression decision making as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem with novel value metrics and filtering. The SBB has been evaluated on a traffic simulator which generates trajectories containing events of interest (EOIs) and corresponding first-person view videos. SBB compression efficiency is assessed by comparing storage requirements with different compression quality levels and event capture ratios. Performance is evaluated by comparing results with a traditional first-in-first-out (FIFO) recording scheme. Deep learning performance on images recorded at different compression levels is evaluated to illustrate the reproducibility of SBB recorded data.

AB Robotic solutions have garnered increased attention from the construction industry as an effective means of improving construction safety and productivity. However, in deploying such robots to real fields many safety concerns have remained untackled, particularly contact-driven accidents that can be potentially escalated by mobile robots. To address this issue, the authors developed a fully automated framework that enables predicting the proximity between mobile objects, leveraging a camera-mounted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), computer vision, and deep neural networks, and then conducted a field test to evaluate its validity. In the test, the framework showed a promising result: It achieved an average proximity error of 0.95 m in predicting 5.28 s future proximity between a worker and a truck. The major contribution of this study is in predicting the risk of impending collision in advance, thereby making proactive interventions possible. Computationally, the predictive functionality based on computer vision and deep neural network including convolutional neural network and generative adversarial network would allow robots to examine alternative multiple paths beforehand and enable providing advance alerts to workers. These proactive interventions would effectively reduce the chances of impending collisions between mobile robots and construction workers.

AB This paper presents a method of polynomial transition curve application for making agricultural aggregate movement paths during headland turn drives as well as within the field. Four types of agricultural aggregate paths in five different variant designs are discussed. Each path is composed of only two curves, making the so-called transition bi-curve. The curvature described by the linear function as well as the third, fifth, seventh, and ninth degree polynomials was designated. Moreover, a trajectory planning algorithm in which the movement proceeds along two transition curves composing the so-called bi-curve was proposed. The simulation was carried out applying the MATLAB program in which the 4th order Runge-Kutta method was used. The results were presented by means of figures showing the proposed paths and kinematic quantity courses in the displacement function. The obtained trajectories were compared regarding the size and kinematic quantities. The trajectories, whose curvature is described by the 3 degrees polynomial, were found to possess the smallest absolute values of maximal acceleration and jerk and to lack jerk discontinuity. The proposed solutions can be applied for planning trajectory of not only agriculture machines and aggregates but also autonomous vehicles or mobile robots.

AB We provide a complex software package allowing the user to deploy multiple ionizing radiation sources and detectors modeled after the Timepix miniature pixel detector. The software is provided to the community as open-source, and allows preliminary testing and method development even without a pixel detector or radiation sources. Our simulation model utilizes ray-tracing and Monte Carlo methods to resolve interactions of ionizing radiation with the detector, obstacles and the atmosphere. An open-source implementation is provided as a plugin for Gazebo, a simulator popular within the robotics community. The plugin is capable of simulating radiation sources with activities in the order of GBq1 in real-time with a conventional PC. We also provide a ROS interface, which allows full integration of the Timepix pixel detector into a robotic system. The credibility and the precision of the simulator plugin were confirmed via a real-world experiment with a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) equipped with a Timepix detector mapping the radiation intensity of an Am-241 sample. Finally, we present a method for cooperative localization of a source of ionizing radiation by a group of autonomous MAVs in an environment with obstacles.

AB Automated vehicle technology has recently become reliant on 3D LiDAR sensing for perception tasks such as mapping, localization and object detection. This has led to a rapid growth in the LiDAR manufacturing industry with several competing makers releasing new sensors regularly. With this increased variety of LiDARs, each with different properties such as number of laser emitters, resolution, field-of-view, and price tags, a more in-depth comparison of their characteristics and performance is required. This work compares 10 commonly used 3D LiDARs, establishing several metrics to assess their performance. Various outstanding issues with specific LiDARs were qualitatively identified. The accuracy and precision of individual LiDAR beams and accumulated point clouds are evaluated in a controlled environment at distances from 5 to 180 meters. Reflective targets were used to characterize intensity patterns and quantify the impact of surface reflectivity on accuracy and precision. A vehicle and pedestrian mannequin were also used as additional targets of interest. A thorough assessment of these LiDARs is given with their potential applicability for automated driving tasks. The data collected in these experiments and analysis tools are all shared openly.

AB We present a novel robotic front-end for autonomous aerial motion-capture (mocap) in outdoor environments. In previous work, we presented an approach for cooperative detection and tracking (CDT) of a subject using multiple micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs). However, it did not ensure optimal view-point configurations of the MAVs to minimize the uncertainty in the person & x0027;s cooperatively tracked 3D position estimate. In this article, we introduce an active approach for CDT. In contrast to cooperatively tracking only the 3D positions of the person, the MAVs can actively compute optimal local motion plans, resulting in optimal view-point configurations, which minimize the uncertainty in the tracked estimate. We achieve this by decoupling the goal of active tracking into a quadratic objective and non-convex constraints corresponding to angular configurations of the MAVs w.r.t. the person. We derive this decoupling using Gaussian observation model assumptions within the CDT algorithm. We preserve convexity in optimization by embedding all the non-convex constraints, including those for dynamic obstacle avoidance, as external control inputs in the MPC dynamics. Multiple real robot experiments and comparisons involving 3 MAVs in several challenging scenarios are presented.

AB The work presented in this paper presents a general method for formation shape specification and proves convergence for a class of parametrically defined formations with closed form, nearest-point solutions. In addition to a more general specification of formation shape, the method results in a system that is robust in the presence of a variable number of agents. Each agent observes the positions of its neighbors and independently constructs a formation curve about the center of its neighborhood. The attractive point on this formation curve is found by employing a local minimization with respect to the observed center of mass of an agent's neighborhood rather than a fixed global field. Given a common objective or goal state, this approach results in a general method to drive a time varying number of agents into a desired geometric configuration without specific individual locational or structural pre-assignment. The application of LaSalle's invariance principal to the system's Hamiltonian shows stability and convergence of the flock to the desired configuration. Simulation results verify convergence and robustness to instantaneous changes in the number of agents.

AB This paper presents a belt-conveyor based parallel storage system (PSS). Compared with the conventional AS/RS, it has advantages including more efficient utilisation of storage space, and faster storage and retrieval of products. The PSS consists of three components: the automated retrieval system (ARS), the automated storage system (ASS) and the compact storage rack (CSR). In the ARS, a vertical screw conveyor is used to facilitate the vertical movement of the unit loads, while a powered belt-conveyor is used for the horizontal dimension. Additionally, a powered conveyor system enables motion along the depth dimension, meaning each lane in the CSR is connected to several storage cells. Horizontal belt-conveyor and powered conveyor in the lane constitute cross-belt which causes the parallel process. On the other side of the rack, a unit load lift, a RGV lift, several rail-guided vehicles and a buffer rack constitute the ASS. Based on the system, we formulate separate travel-time models for ARS and ASS, under the assumption of randomised, uniformly distributed storage rack positions. Computer simulation with Matlab is used to validate the models, and optimise the automated storage system.

AB A new approach of frequency shifting by rotating kernel is proposed to improve the performance of a spatial filtering velocimeter, used to provide accurate velocity information for a vehicle self-contained navigation system. A linear CMOS image sensor was employed both as a spatiotemporal differential spatial filter and as a photodetector. The filtering operation was fully performed in FPGA and is realized by applying a rotating kernel to the pixel values of the image. Theoretical analysis showed this method could double the maximum measurable velocity. The power spectrum of the output signal was obtained by fast Fourier transform (FFT), and was corrected by a frequency spectrum correction algorithm, named energy centrobaric correction. This velocimeter was used to measure the moving velocities of a conveyor belt. Experimental results verified the method's ability of reducing the output signal frequency and standard uncertainty of velocity measurement. What is more, the undesired output introduced by frequency shifting to the power spectrum of the output signal was deeply investigated and a new method was proposed to eliminate the undesired component in output signals. This velocimeter aims at providing accurate velocity information for vehicle autonomous navigation system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes a dependent optimisation (DO) method for the dual-contra-rotating motor to improve the full-cycle efficiency and increase the space utilizstion rate of the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Particularly, using the DO not only improves the efficiency of the machine at low speed and high speed, but also reduces its total weight by 6.2%, which is beneficial to the heavy-buoyancy matching and range improvement of the AUV. Moreover, the dependent optimized machine can leave about 5.5 L more space for other AUV systems. Firstly, the geometric constraints and the load characteristics of the dual-contra-rotating motor are presented. Based on the analytical model of the electromagnetic field and electromagnetic performance, this paper compares two analytical optimization methods for the machine. One is the independent optimization, that is, the geometric association between the dual-contra-rotating motors and the AUV is not considered in the optimization process. The other is DO, which considers the geometric association in the optimization process. After verifying the electromagnetic performance and temperature field with the FEA method, the dual-contra-rotating motor prototype was developed. Finally, the consistency of the optimization results and the prototype is verified through experiments.

AB The development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) has expanded with the accelerated progress of IT, as well as with the needs of the autonomous vehicle (AV) implementation. The specifics and requirements of AV towards the infrastructure primarily relate to the condition and quality of traffic signs. For the independent participation of these vehicles in traffic, an impeccable traffic sign condition is required, which is often not the case in practice. Damaged, faded, obscured, or vandalized traffic signs can usually be seen in the road network, which can impede the movement of AV in traffic. In the existing literature, little or very little attention is focused on the problem of identifying and classifying damaged and especially vandalized traffic signs. In this paper, the mentioned problem is addressed, and the CNN model is proposed. This model has been tested on a specially designed novel and challenging database containing 6,000 real-time images of traffic signs in the road network of the Republic of Serbia. This model is invariant to different lighting and weather (nighttime and fog) conditions. In this case study, the model reached an overall accuracy of 99.17%, whereby all vandalized and damaged traffic signs are accurately identified and classified.

AB Recently developed technologies are changing mobility dramatically. Autonomous and interactive vehicles enable a coordination of the sat-nav devices of traveling vehicles aimed at assigning paths with the goal of eliminating congestion and, more in general, of reducing the total travel time in traffic networks. In this paper we tackle the problem of finding a traffic assignment that minimizes the total travel time on a network, while guaranteeing that the paths of users with the same origin and destination have similar path traversal times. While previous approaches have identified the eligible paths a priori, we propose two mixed integer nonlinear programming models, along with their mixed integer linear approximations, that identify paths that satisfy the desired level of fairness while minimizing the total travel time on the network. The two models differ for the unfairness measure adopted. Computational results show that the total travel time spent in the network is very close to the minimum possible, that is the one obtained by the system optimum solution, while guaranteeing to each user a very low level of experienced unfairness. A heuristic algorithm is also proposed which is shown to generate high quality solutions. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The IAEA held the IAEA Robotics Challenge 2017 (IRC2017) to protect workers during inspections of spent nuclear fuel and to improve work efficiency and accuracy rates. To this end, we developed an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) system called the spent fuel check vehicle (SCV). The SCV extracts and tracks the target through image processing, and it is necessary to find suitable parameters for the SNF storage environment in advance. This preliminary work takes time. It is also difficult to prepare the environment in which the work will proceed. In addition, if the preliminary work does not proceed as planned, the system will not move at the proper speed and will become unstable, with yawing and overshoot. To solve this problem, we developed a controller with a camera that can extract the depth at which the target is stored and allow distance-adaptive control. This controller is able to attenuate system instability factors such as yawing and overshoot better than existing controllers by continuously changing system operation parameters according to the depth. In addition, the time required for preliminary work during inspections can be shortened. (C) 2020 Korean Nuclear Society, Published by Elsevier Korea LLC.

AB Analysis of propulsive thrust and efficiency of a finite aspect ratio, twin-foil counter-phase wing-in-ground (WIG) effect propulsor configuration is made using a time-domain panel method. Comparisons were made for the effects of number of foils (single versus double), aspect ratio, variable distance between two foils with fixed heave amplitude-that is, influence of interaction, and heave amplitude with fixed distance. In addition to the apparent advantage of propulsor dynamics equilibrium due to the cancellation of the side and vertical forces, results show that each foil of the twin-foil configuration, when close to each other to generate the WIG effect, has substantially higher thrust contribution than the single-foil propulsor under moderate to heavy load conditions (reduced frequency greater than 0.5). Due to the interaction of foils on each other, increase of thrust also produced a higher efficiency over the whole range of reduced frequencies examined. Findings also include the tendency of the thrust and efficiency due to both the fixed heave amplitude with varied distance between foil equilibrium position and fixed distance with varied heave amplitude. Twin-foil counterphase oscillating propulsors show an aerodynamic and hydrodynamic advantage for micro air vehicles (MAV) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) over the single-foil configuration.

AB In the frame of the ESA/NASA cooperation on the X-38 project, different GNC-related contributions have been made by German industry and universities. First, the primary flight control software for the autonomous guidance and control of the X-38 parafoil descent and landing phase has been developed, integrated and successfully flown during the aerial drop test campaign conducted by NASA. In addition, a fault-tolerant computer similar to the one used onboard the ISS has been delivered to JSC. Together with an alternate re-entry GNC software using onboard flight path optimization for the guidance task and dynamic inversion methods for attitude control, this computer shall be flown as a flight experiment onboard the V201 space flight test vehicle. Finally, the German project team provided a real-time X-38 vehicle simulator, which was supposed to be used as an independent validation tool for the X-38 re-entry simulation and onboard software. This paper will focus on the European parafoil guidance and control software across the different phases of the X-38 mission. Flight test results from the X-38 aerial drop test campaigns will be presented and discussed. In addition, the flight experiment of the fault tolerant computer will be described briefly.

AB With the development of underwater technology and the increasing demand for ocean development, more and more intelligent equipment is being applied to underwater scientific missions. Specifically, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) clusters are being used for their flexibility and the advantages of carrying communication and detection units, often performing underwater tasks in formation. In order to locate AUVs with high precision, we introduce an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) with global positioning system (GPS) and propose a USV-AUV network. Furthermore, we propose an ultra-short baseline (USBL) acoustic cooperative location scheme with an orthogonal array, which is based on underwater communication with sonar. Based on the derivation of the Fisher information matrix formula under Cartesian parameters, we analyze the positioning accuracy of AUVs in different positions under the USBL positioning mode to derive the optimal array of the AUV formation. In addition, we propose a USV path planning scheme based on Dubins path planning functions to assist in locating the AUV formation. The simulation results verify that the proposed scheme can ensure the positioning accuracy of the AUV formation and help underwater research missions.

AB With the development of multi-beam Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, fast and accurate LiDAR-based localization has become a crucial issue in robotics and autonomous driving. However, balancing accu-racy and efficiency remains challenging in existing methods. In this paper, we propose a super-fast LiDAR global localization approach that can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy with superior efficiency. Our method leverages template descriptors to capture structural environments and approximates the vehicle's position via map candidate points. Additionally, we create an offline map database to evenly simulate vehicle orientations. We design a loss function to improve localization accuracy. We extensively evaluated the proposed method in public KITTI outdoor sequences and self-collected indoor datasets. The experimental results show that our approach can run at close to 100 frames per second (FPS) on a single-thread CPU, which is much faster than current SOTA methods. Our average absolute translation errors (ATEs) are 0.20m (indoor) and 0.44m (outdoor), and the average localization success rates are 93% (indoor) and 90% (outdoor). The average localization success rates can exceed 97% in large outdoor scenarios with fine-tuned parameters. The source code will be available in https://github.com/ShiPC-AI.

AB This paper uses the directed communication topology to investigate the finite-time error constraint containment control for multiple Ocean Bottom Flying Node (OBFN) systems with thruster faults. The OBFN is a benthic Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), which has been used to explore submarine resources. The model uncertainties, velocity error constraint, external disturbances, and thruster faults of OBFNs motivate the design of containment controller. Moreover, some followers could obtain the states of leader OBFNs. We designed the command filter and the input signal is a hyperbolic tangent function. The virtual velocity error command is generated to follow the velocity error. Then the novel velocity error constraint distributed control algorithm is developed. Furthermore, for the problem of input saturation, by designing a stable anti-saturation compensator, an improved containment algorithm is proposed. It is proved that both the proposed approaches can converge the containment errors towards zero through Lyapunov theory in finite time, which means the followers can reach the convex hull formed by leaders in finite time. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the two strategies.(c) 2023 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper studies the three-dimensional (3D) trajectory optimization problem for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided wireless communication. Existing works mainly rely on the kinematic equations for UAV's mobility modeling, while its dynamic equations are usually missing. As a result, the planned UAV trajectories are piece-wise line segments in general, which may be difficult to implement in practice. By leveraging the concept of state-space model, a control-based UAV trajectory design is proposed in this paper, which takes into account both of the UAV's kinematic equations and the dynamic equations. Consequently, smooth trajectories that are amenable to practical implementation can be obtained. Moreover, the UAV's controller design is achieved along with the trajectory optimization, where practical roll angle and pitch angle constraints are considered. Furthermore, a new energy consumption model is derived for quad-rotor UAVs, which is based on the voltage and current flows of the electric motors and thus captures both the consumed energy for motion and the energy conversion efficiency of the motors. Numerical results are provided to validate the derived energy consumption model and show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.

AB On a highway, the frequency of occurrence of irrelevant features, such as trees, varies a lot in different scenes. A limitation of the deep conventional neural networks used in end-to-end self-driving systems is that if the incoming images contain too much information, it makes it difficult for the network to extract only the subset of features required for decision making. Consequently, while existing end-to-end approaches may perform well in training scenes, they may not work correctly in other scenes. In this study, we developed a novel training method for an auto-encoder that equips it to ignore irrelevant features in input images while simultaneously retaining relevant features. Compared with feature extraction methods in existing end-to-end approaches, the proposed method reduces the labeling costs by only requiring image-level tags. The method was validated by training a convolutional neural network model to process the output of the encoder and produce a steering angle to control the vehicle. The entire end-to-end self-driving approach can ignore the influence of irrelevant features even though there are no such features when training the convolutional neural network.

AB Adjacent obstacles are difficult to be distinguished, and remote obstacle is easily detected as multiple targets. Besides, occluded obstacles are difficult to track, and tracking velocity of the obstacles in rapid acceleration or deceleration converges slowly in the urban environment. In view of this, an obstacle detection and tracking method based on multi-lidar is proposed. Firstly, based on the vehicle kinematics model, motion compensation is adopted to solve the space-time synchronization problem among lidars after road segmentation, and data level fusion is completed. Next, the obstacles are detected by combining adaptive voxel grid DBSCAN (AVG-DBSCAN) algorithm and Region Growing (RG) algorithm. Then, the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm and KD tree are adopted to improve the Evolutionary Hungarian algorithm for the fast association of obstacles. Finally, the occlusion rate and dynamic region selection are used to track obstacles accurately, based on the Kalman Filter of uniform acceleration model. The experimental results on the authors' extracted urban dataset show that the proposed method can effectively fuse multi-lidar data and outperforms other methods in obstacle detection and tracking. Its average accuracy for detection is 97.53% and its average accuracy for tracking is 95.1%. The average duration of the entire process is only 30 ms.

AB This letter proposes a Novel Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) for navigation and obstacle avoidance of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The proposed NMPC formulation allows for a fully parametric obstacle trajectory, while in this letter we apply a classification scheme to differentiate between different kinds of trajectories to predict future obstacle positions. The trajectory calculation is done from an initial condition, and fed to the NMPC as an additional input. The solver used is the nonlinear, non-convex solver Proximal Averaged Newton for Optimal Control (PANOC) and its associated software OpEn (Optimization Engine), in which we apply a penalty method to properly consider the obstacles and other constraints during navigation. The proposed NMPC scheme allows for real-time solutions using a sampling time of 50 ms and a two second prediction of both the obstacle trajectory and the NMPC problem, which implies that the scheme can be considered as a local path-planner. This letter will present the NMPC cost function and constraint formulation, as well as the methodology of dealing with the dynamic obstacles. We include multiple laboratory experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control architecture, and to show that the proposed method delivers fast and computationally stable solutions to the dynamic obstacle avoidance scenarios.

LA English
DT Article
AB The vision of automated driving is to increase both road safety and efficiency, while offering passengers a convenient travel experience. This requires that autonomous systems correctly estimate the current traffic scene and its likely evolution. In highway scenarios early recognition of cut-in maneuvers is essential for risk-aware maneuver planning. In this paper, a statistical approach is proposed, which advantageously utilizes a set of prototypical lane change trajectories to realize both early maneuver detection and uncertainty-aware trajectory prediction for traffic participants. Generation of prototype trajectories from real traffic data is accomplished by Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering. During clustering, the alignment of the cluster prototypes to each other is optimized and the cohesion of the resulting prototype is limited when two clusters merge. In the prediction stage, the similarity of observed vehicle motion and typical lane change patterns in the data base is evaluated to construct a set of significant features for maneuver classification via Boosted Decision Trees. The future trajectory is predicted combining typical lane change realizations in a mixture model. B-splines based trajectory adaptations guarantee continuity during transition from actually observed to predicted vehicle states. Quantitative evaluation results demonstrate the proposed concept's improved performance for both maneuver and trajectory prediction compared to a previously implemented reference approach.

TI Hardware prototype demonstration of a cognitive sub-Nyquist automotive
   radar
SO ELECTRONICS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB Automotive radar (AR) plays a key role in autonomous vehicles. A modern-day AR requires cognition to adapt to its dynamically changing environment. In an automotive environment, the number of ARs needed to operate simultaneously varies rapidly and these ARs should transceive without mutual interference. Most widely used AR systems use frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar due to their smaller bandwidth and cost compared with pulse Doppler radar (PDR). By using sub-Nyquist based techniques, such as Xampling, the authors show here that the targets could be estimated from low rate samples even with a PDR. In this study, they demonstrate a hardware prototype demonstrating the applicability of sub-Nyquist PDR as a cognitive AR. They consider a scenario where a number of ARs are mounted on a vehicle and need to look simultaneously into different directions without interfering with each other. The available bandwidth is divided into several non-overlapping subbands, which depend on the number of ARs required. Each AR is assigned a set of randomly spaced subbands for its transceiver to operate. Through simulations, they show that the ARs could detect targets simultaneously without interference. Furthermore, the noise robustness of their sub-Nyquist reconstruction method is better than the standard matched-filtering approach.

AB This paper summarizes the glider activities carried out in the last 5 years by the IMEDEA Department of Marine Technologies, Operational Oceanography and Sustainability (TMOOS). TMOOS has been operating gliders in the Western Mediterranean Sea since 2006 and has set-up electronic and maintenance laboratories in order to establish a key glider port in the area. Twenty-two glider missions have been performed to date and over 17000 hydrographic and biogeochemical profiles collected. TMOOS is using gliders for operational, technological and scientific objectives. Studies of path planning analysis and adaptive sampling for gliders in combination with other platforms have been undertaken and new methodologies have been developed to process data from gliders. Thus far, IMEDEA gliders have contributed to the better understanding of mesoscale processes in the upper ocean, including the coupling between the physical and biogeochemical process of the marine ecosystem and, in combination with remote sensing observations, high-resolution glider data has enabled advances in new methodologies to improve coastal altimetry. Gliders have also proved to be important platforms for the development of operational oceanography tools and useful vehicles on which to test and implement new sensors for ocean monitoring.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are an important component of next-generation wireless networks that can assist in high data rate communications and provide enhanced coverage.Their high mobility and aerial nature offer deployment flexibility and low-cost infrastructure support to existing cellular networks and provide many applications that rely on mobile wireless communications. However, security is a major challenge in UAV communications, and physical layer security (PLS) is an important technique to improve the reliability and security of data shared with the assistance of UAVs. Recently, the intelligent reflective surface (IRS) has emerged as a novel technology to extend and/or enhance wireless coverage by reconfiguring the propagation environment of communications. This article provides an overview of how the IRS can improve the PLS of UAV networks. We discuss different use cases of PLS for IRS-enhanced UAV communications and briefly review the recent advances in this area. Then, based on the recent advances, we also present a case study that utilizes alternate optimization to maximize the secrecy capacity for an IRS-enhanced UAV scenario in the presence of multiple Eves. Finally, we highlight several open issues and research challenges to realize PLS in IRS-enhanced UAV communications.

AB In Advanced Driver Assistance Systems(ADAS) and autonomous vehicles, lane detection is an important module. Most lane detection methods focused on detecting lanes from a single image and the results from unsatisfactory performance under extremely bad climatic changes and attain high accuracy is challenging. In this research work, a novel two-tier deep learning based lane detection framework is introduced for multi images at different weather conditions. In both the tiers, the Local Vector Pattern (LVP) based texture features are extracted and an Optimized Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is utilized to classify road and lane as well. The weight corresponding to the second convolutional layer of DCNN (both tiers) is fine-tuned by a novel technique called "Flight Straight of Moth Search (FS-MS) Algorithm" that is an enhanced version of the standard Moth search Algorithm, to create the detection more accurate (MS).With respect of particular metrics, the efficiency of the provided work is compared to that existing lane detecting models.Particularly, the computation time of the proposed model is 31.2%, 20.85%, 10.43%, and 4.53% higher than the existing MS + CNN, LA + CNN, GA + CNN, and PSO + CNN methods respectively.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a critical role for 5 G/B5G communications. In this paper, we investigate the physical layer security issue for ground transmissions with the help of a UAV. Specifically, we consider the scenario without direct transmissions and employ the UAV as a mobile relay to amplify and forward the confidential information. Meanwhile, the receiver transmits cooperative jamming attempting to disrupt eavesdropping. We investigate the UAV deployment and receiver jamming strategy jointly for the optimized secrecy rate, while considering the channel uncertainties. In particular, for the case of complete channel state information (CSI), the jamming power is obtained by bi-section search, and we propose a data-trained deep neural network (DNN) to approximate the optimal UAV deployment. Meanwhile, for the case with partial CSI, we design a deep Q network (DQN) to learn the optimal UAV deployment, due to the increased complexity to determine the jamming strategy with channel statistics. Simulation results demonstrate that both the learned DQN and trained DNN model effectively approximate the optimal deployment of the UAV. Moreover, compared with the baselines, our proposal significantly improves the security performance of legitimate transmissions.

DE Autonomous vehicles; image segmentation; laser
AB Real-time semantic segmentation of LiDAR data is crucial for autonomously driving vehicles and robots, which are usually equipped with an embedded platform and have limited computational resources. Approaches that operate directly on the point cloud use complex spatial aggregation operations, which are very expensive and difficult to deploy on embedded platforms. As an alternative, projection-based methods a re more efficient and can run on embedded hardware. However, current projection-based methods either have a low accuracy or require millions of parameters. In this letter, we therefore propose a projection-based method, called Multi-scale Interaction Network (MINet), which is very efficient and accurate. The network uses multiple paths with different scales and balances the computational resources between the scales. Additional dense interactions between the scales avoid redundant computations and make the network highly efficient. The proposed network outperforms point-based, image-based, and projection-based methods in terms of accuracy, number of parameters, and runtime. Moreover, the network processes more than 24 scans, captured by a high-resolution LiDAR sensor with 64 beams, per second on an embedded platform, which is higher than the framerate of the sensor. The network is therefore suitable for robotics applications.

AB This letter presents a self-contained system for robust deployment of autonomous aerial vehicles in environments without access to global navigation systems and with limited lighting conditions. The proposed system, application-tailored for documentation in dark areas of large historical monuments, uses a unique and reliable aerial platform with a multi-modal lightweight sensory setup to acquire data in human-restricted areas with adverse lighting conditions, especially in areas that are high above the ground. The introduced localization method relies on an easy-to-obtain 3-D point cloud of a historical building, while it copes with a lack of visible light by fusing active laser-based sensors. The approach does not rely on any external localization, or on a preset motion-capture system. This enables fast deployment in the interiors of investigated structures while being computationally undemanding enough to process data online, onboard an MAV equipped with ordinary processing resources. The reliability of the system is analyzed, is quantitatively evaluated on a set of aerial trajectories performed inside a real-world church, and is deployed onto the aerial platform in the position control feedback loop to demonstrate the reliability of the system in the safety-critical application of historical monuments documentation.

AB Apart from perception, one of the most fundamental aspects of an autonomous mobile robot is the ability to adequately and safely traverse the environment it operates in. This ability is called Navigation and is performed in a two- or three-dimensional fashion, except for cases where the robot is neither a ground vehicle nor articulated (e.g. robotics arms). The planning part of navigation comprises a global planner, suitable for generating a path from an initial to a target pose, and a local planner tasked with traversing the aforementioned path while dealing with environmental, sensorial and motion uncertainties. However, the task of selecting the optimal global and/or local planner combination is quite hard since no research provides insight on which is best regarding the domain and planner limitations. In this context, current work performs a comparative analysis on qualitative and quantitative aspects of the most common ROS-enabled global and local planners for robots operating in two-dimensional static environments, on the basis of mission-centered and planner-related metrics, optimality and traversability aspects, as well as non-measurable aspects, such as documentation quality, parameterisability, ease of use, etc.

AB A runtime system for implementation of image processing operations is presented. It is designed for working in a flexible and distributed environment related to the software architecture of a newly developed UAV system. The software architecture can be characterized at a coarse scale as a layered system, with a deliberative layer at the top, a reactive layer in the middle, and a processing layer at the bottom. At a finer scale each of the three levels is decomposed into sets of modules which communicate using CORBA, allowing system development and deployment on the UAV to be made in a highly flexible way. Image processing takes place in a dedicated module located in the process layer, and is the main focus of the paper. This module has been designed as a runtime system for data flow graphs, allowing various processing operations to be created online and on demand by the higher levels of the system. The runtime system is implemented in Java, which allows development and deployment to be made on a wide range of hardware/software configurations. Optimizations for particular hardware platforms have been made using Java's native interface.

AB Aerial access networks, comprising a hierarchical model of high-altitude platforms (HAPs) and multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are considered a promising technology to enhance the service experience of Internet of Things Devices (IoTD), especially in underserved areas where terrestrial base stations (TBSs) do not exist. In such scenarios, optimally orchestrating the limited computation, communication, and energy resources in both HAPs and UAVs is crucial toward for an efficient aerial networking infrastructure. Thus, in this study, we investigate and formulate the joint IoTDs association, partial offloading, and communication resource allocations (JAPORAs) decisions problem in heterogeneous Aerial Access IoT (AAIoT) networks to maximize service satisfaction for IoTDs, while minimizing their total energy consumption. In particular, the formulated problem is transformed into a multiagent Markov decision process (MAMDP) to deal with its nonconvexity and environmental dynamicity. To solve the problem, we propose a multiagent policy-gradient-based deep actor-critic algorithm, named MADDPG-JAPORA, with centralized training and decentralized execution. Our extensive numerical experiments demonstrated that MADDPG-JAPORA reliably converges and provides superior performance compared with other state-of-the-art schemes.

DT Article
DE LiDAR; camera; calibration; deep learning; accuracy
AB With the rapid growth of self-driving vehicles, automobiles demand diverse data from multiple sensors to perceive the surrounding environment. Calibrating preprocessing between multiple sensors is necessary to utilize the data effectively. In particular, the LiDAR-camera pair, a suitable complement with 2D-3D information for each other, has been widely used in autonomous vehicles. Most traditional calibration methods require specific calibration targets set up under complicated environmental conditions, which require expensive human manual work. In this study, we propose a deep neural network that does not require any specific targets and offline setup to find the six degrees of freedom (6 DoF) transformation between LiDAR and the camera. Unlike previous deep learning CNN-based methods, which use raw 3D point clouds and 2D images frame by frame, CalibBD utilizes Bi-LSTM for sequence data to extract temporal features between consecutive frames. It not only predicts the calibration parameters by minimizing both transformation and depth losses but also calibrates the camera parameters by using temporal loss to refine the calibration parameters. The proposed model achieves a steady performance under various deviations of mis-calibration parameters and achieved higher results in terms of accuracy than the state-of-the-art CNN-based method on the KITTI datasets.

AB The prediction of the health status and remaining useful life of lithium-ion batteries is very important for the safety of electric vehicles and other devices. However, due to the fact that battery residual capacity cannot be measured in real time, the estimation of battery health status is a great challenge for the management system of electric vehicles. At present, machine learning methods have been widely used in battery health state estimation. Based on the experimental data of NASA lithium-ion battery, this article proposes a model based on gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model framework and screens effective features from the original battery information indicators to achieve accurate evaluation of lithium-ion battery health state. In this work, many features are extracted from the original charge and discharge data of the battery, and two methods, correlation coefficient and decision tree, are used to screen initial feature, then variance inflation factor (VIF) is used for further screening, finally an efficient iterative method is used to obtain a combination of well-performing features. The validity of the residual capacity estimation method is proved by the study of NASA battery data set.

AB Uncertain dynamic obstacles, such as pedestrians or vehicles, pose a major challenge for optimal robot navigation with safety guarantees. Previous work on optimal motion planning has employed two main strategies to define a safe bound on an obstacle's space: using a polyhedron or a nonlinear differentiable surface. The former approach relies on disjunctive programming, which has a relatively high computational cost that grows exponentially with the number of obstacles. The latter approach needs to be linearized locally to find a tractable evaluation of the chance constraints, which dramatically reduces the remaining free space and leads to over-conservative trajectories or even unfeasibility. In this work, we present a hybrid approach that eludes the pitfalls of both strategies while maintaining the original safety guarantees. The key idea consists in obtaining a safe differentiable approximation for the disjunctive chance constraints bounding the obstacles. The resulting nonlinear optimization problem can be efficiently solved to meet fast real-time requirements with multiple obstacles. We validate our approach through mathematical proof, simulation and real experiments with an aerial robot using nonlinear model predictive control to avoid pedestrians.

AB Conventional underwater intervention tasks are performed by underwater vehicles equipped with rigid multi-link arms. However, the movements of conventional mechanical arms exert reactive force on the vehicle platform due to their enormous bulk. Additionally, they cannot be used for small object recovery. In this paper, an ionic conducting polymer film (ICPF) actuator-based crayfish-inspired microrobot is designed and developed as a son robot for object recovery, which is connected to the amphibious father robot by copper wires. The crayfish-like son robot is used as the mechanical arm of the father-son robot system, which can grasp the small object especially in restricted spaces. The crayfish-inspired son robot actuated by ten ICPF actuators can realize underwater basic motions. The father robot can emit the son robot for object recovery. A proximity sensor is mounted in front of the microrobot between the two ICPF hands to implement the autonomous grasping motion. And we designed a blue LED-based underwater optical communication system to realize the communication between the father robot and the son robot for microrobot recovery. We carried out the experiments to confirm the basic operations of the microrobot, evaluate the performance of the communication system, and verify the blue LED tracking mechanism for microrobot recovery.

ID NAVIGATION; VEHICLE
AB This paper presents an efficient method of multi-sensor estimation that can be used with asynchronous and synchronous sensors. A decentralized architecture is used for the fusion of information obtained from several asynchronous measurements. The issue of the synchronization of the information, which is critical in the proposed method, is addressed. The information form of the Kalman filter (information filter) is used as the main algorithm for estimation. The method is demonstrated with the implementation of a navigation system for an autonomous land vehicle. The integrity issue is also addressed with the implementation of multiple independent estimation loops. The proposed method allows for efficient fusion of information obtained from different measurements for covariance reduction, while providing the benefits of decentralized estimation architecture for integrity purposes. The resulting estimates are equivalent to an optimal centralized filter when the loops incorporate all the information available in the system. The information obtained from each measurement is then broadcast to the other loops after being synchronized. This information is used in an assimilation stage to achieve more accurate estimates. The assimilation frequency is also discussed considering the trade off of fault detectability and estimation covariance reduction. The performance of the navigation method is examined by comparing the resulting position estimates to those of independent navigation loops.

AB Many technologies have been developed for monitoring the ocean interior. Among them the monitoring approaches based on imaging devices are capable to disclose important data on species behaviour and spatio temporal variations of richness and evenness. In this context, the Argo programme (http://doi.org/10.17882/42182) is a valuable instrument for monitoring the deep sea at global scale in space and time. Argo floats equipped with imaging devices are candidate to become a new monitoring tool for studying macro- and mega-fauna in large areas and for extended time periods, potentially providing monitoring results never attained before. This work summarises the results obtained on the automated fish recognition task performed on the images acquired by the GUARD1 imaging device(1).

AB The reason for using sonar for mobile robot navigation comes from the ultrasonic sensing capabilities of bats which use echolocation to determine their prey position. During the project "Adaptive bio-mimetic sonar heads for autonomous vehicles" we intend to employ a new material to build up broadband ultrasonic transducers featuring good adaptation to air. In this specific case it is important to achieve accurate information about the magnitude and position of the peak pressure and intensity produced by the probe. The purpose of the simulation is to analyze the emitted beam pattern from 2D-array transducers in terms of the spatial impulse response that characterizes the three-dimensional extent of the ultrasonic field. Simulation results are provided for two different linear array element numbers to evaluate the effects on the beam profile.

AB The working scope and working time of small size unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are limited because of the limited battery capacity. In this work, inspired by aerial refueling for aircrafts, we propose a wireless power transmission (WPT) scheme by categorizing the UAVs into charging UAV (CUAV) and mission UAV (MUAV) for charging UAVs without interrupting the mission. In the proposed aerial refueling scheme, mission UAVs (MUAV) can be recharged by charging UAVs on the fly and operate in a perpetual manner. The feasibility of aerially wireless charging for small UAVs is firstly discussed and evaluated. Then we consider a practical application scenario of multiple MUAVs for collecting data from several points of interest, where the MUAVs are recharged by CUAVs. Accordingly, the issue of scheduling the flying path and charging process of each CUAV to minimize the mission time arises. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithms for scheduling both single and multiple CUAVs are proposed and deployed. Extensive simulation evaluations demonstrate that, by applying the proposed aerial refueling scheme, CUAVs can explore and optimize the scheduling strategies, thereby improving the system performance in terms of mission completion and charging efficiency.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been widely used in various fields, and their invasion of security and privacy has aroused social concern. Several detection and tracking systems for UAVs have been introduced in recent years, but most of them are based on radio frequency, radar, and other media. We assume that the field of computer vision is mature enough to detect and track invading UAVs. Thus we propose a visible light mode dataset called Dalian University of Technology Anti-UAV dataset, DUT Anti-UAV for short. It contains a detection dataset with a total of 10,000 images and a tracking dataset with 20 videos that include short-term and long-term sequences. All frames and images are manually annotated precisely. We use this dataset to train several existing detection algorithms and evaluate the algorithms' performance. Several tracking methods are also tested on our tracking dataset. Furthermore, we propose a clear and simple tracking algorithm combined with detection that inherits the detector's high precision. Extensive experiments show that the tracking performance is improved considerably after fusing detection, thus providing a new attempt at UAV tracking using our dataset. The datasets and results are publicly available at: https://github.com/wangdongdut/DUT-Anti-UAV.

AB The present study investigates the role of psychological factors on the choice of three controls (modes) in driving a vehicle, namely highly automated, partially automated, and manual control. Traditional driving habits, resistance to change, and behavioural beliefs were all assessed along with individual and socioeconomic variables. Using survey data (n = 595) of car users, a model was developed to predict the share of different driving controls and determine the effects of psychological variables. Results indicate that up to 55% of people prefer driving with highly automated control, and 30% prefer partially automated control. Behavioural beliefs (e.g., attitudes toward highly automated control) are not as critical to driving control as habits. People with stronger driving habits are less likely to use highly automated controls. A one-unit increase in worry could reduce driving in highly automated control by 5.5% and increase manual control by 4.5%, and those who welcome the new technologies are more likely to prefer highly automated control. Some practical policy solutions are also provided.

AB Urban air mobility (UAM) is a future air transportation system to solve the air pollution and movement efficiency problems of the traditional mobility system. In UAM environments, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are used to transport passengers and goods providing various convenient services such as package delivery, air bus, and air taxi. However, UAVs communicate with ground infrastructures through open channels that can be exposed to various security attacks. Therefore, a secure mutual authentication scheme is necessary for UAM environments. Moreover, a handover authentication is also necessary to ensure seamless communication when the service location is changed. In this paper, we design a secure and efficient handover authentication scheme for UAM environments considering various security vulnerabilities and efficiency using elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). We utilize informal security analysis, Real-or-Random (RoR), Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) to prove the security of the proposed scheme. Furthermore, we compare the computation and communication cost comparisons of the proposed scheme with the other related schemes. The results show that the proposed scheme is secure and efficient for UAM environments.

AB Recent technological developments have paved the way to the employment of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for monitoring and exploration activities of marine environments. Traditionally, in information gathering scenarios for monitoring purposes, AUVs follow predefined paths that are not efficient in terms of information content and energy consumption. Informative Path Planning (IPP) represents a valid alternative, defining the path that maximises the gathered information. This work proposes a Genetic Path Planner (GPP), which consists in an IPP strategy based on a Genetic Algorithm, with the aim of generating a path that simultaneously maximises the information gathered and the coverage of the inspected area. The proposed approach has been tested offline for monitoring and inspection applications of Posidonia Oceanica (PO) in three different geographical areas. The a priori knowledge about the presence of PO, in probabilistic terms, has been modelled utilising a Gaussian Process (GP), trained on real marine data. The GP estimate has then been exploited to retrieve an information content of each position in the areas of interest. A comparison with other two IPP approaches has been carried out to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm.

ID SCHEME; PROTOCOL
AB With significant advances in the development of autonomous cars and Internet of Things (IoT) in recent years, Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) have become a promising technology for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as well. However, the wireless nature of VANET communication makes it vulnerable to a plethora of attack vectors to otherwise secure vehicles. Authenticated message dissemination plays a key role to avert such security vulnerabilities. Many of the existing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) based schemes use Certificates for authentication. In such schemes, for authenticating an entity which presents its certificate, Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is used to check if the entity's certificate has been revoked. But, as the size of the CRL grows, using CRL for authentication can incur computation and storage overhead in VANETs. To overcome this limitation of CRL-based approach for authentication, in this paper, we propose a distributed, scalable, low-overhead, privacy-preserving authentication scheme for VANETs. The proposed scheme uses a Merkle Hash Tree (MHT) for authenticating Road Side Units (RSUs) and Modified Merkle Patricia Trie (MMPT) for authenticating vehicles. We also present an informal analysis as well as formal correctness proof of the proposed scheme. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE AUV; Nonlinear PD and PD plus controllers; Real-time experiments
AB This paper deals with a nonlinear controller based on saturation functions with variable parameters for set-point regulation and trajectory tracking control of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). In many cases, saturation functions with constant parameters are used to limit the input signals generated by a classical PD (Proportional-Derivative) controller to avoid damaging the actuators; however this abrupt bounded harms the performance of the controller. We, therefore, propose to replace the conventional saturation function, with constant parameters, by a saturation function with variable parameters to limit the signals of a PD controller, which is the base of the nonlinear PD with gravitational/ buoyancy compensation and the nonlinear PD + controllers that we propose in this paper. Consequently, the mathematical model is obtained, considering the featuring operation of the underwater vehicle LIRMIA 2, to do the stability analysis of the closed-loop system with the proposed nonlinear controllers using the Lyapunov arguments. The experimental results show the performance of an AUV (LIRMIA 2) for the depth control problems in the case of set-point regulation and trajectory tracking control.

AB Autonomous thermal soaring offers an opportunity to extend the flight duration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In this work, we introduce the informative soaring problem, where a gliding UAV performs an information gathering mission while simultaneously replenishing energy from known thermal energy sources. We pose this problem in a way that combines convex optimisation with graph search and present four path planning algorithms with complementary characteristics. Using a target-search task as a motivating example, finite-horizon and Monte Carlo tree search methods are shown to be appropriate for situations with little prior knowledge, but suffer from either myopic planning or high computation cost in more complex scenarios. These issues are addressed by two novel tree search algorithms based on creating clusters that associate high uncertainty regions with nearby thermals. The cluster subproblems are solved independently to generate local plans, which are then linked together. Numerical simulations show that these methods find high-quality nonmyopic plans quickly. The more promising cluster-based method, which uses dynamic programming to compute a total ordering over clusters, is demonstrated in hardware tests on a UAV. Fifteen-minute plans are generated in less than four seconds, facilitating online replanning when simulated thermals are added or removed in-flight.

AB In this paper, a distributed linear MPC approach to solve the trajectory planning problem for rotary-wing UAVs is proposed, where the objective of the UAV system is to form a communication network to multiple targets with given radio communication capacities. The approach explicitly incorporates constraints on radio communication path losses, computed by using SPLAT! that is able to take into account terrain models and antenna locations. In order to enhance the online optimization, at each time sample the terrain below each UAV and the communication path losses are approximated with linear functions of the spatial coordinates. This leads to linear MPC sub-problems, which are solved by using convex quadratic programming. An algorithm for automatic initialization and optimal reconfiguration of the communication topology in case of failures or severe radio path loss due to e.g. channel fading, is proposed. The communication network that is provided by the UAVs is considered to be a payload communication capacity that is normally independent of the command and control datalink used to control the UAVs. The performance of the distributed linear MPC trajectory planning and the reconfiguration algorithm is studied on two simulation cases with four UAVs and two targets.

AB This paper proposes a practical job grouping approach, which aims to enhance the time related performance metrics of container transfers in the Patrick AutoStrad container terminal, located in Brisbane, Australia. It first formulates a mathematical model of the automated container transfers in a relatively complex environment. Apart from the consideration on collision avoidance of a fleet of large vehicles in a confined area, it also deals with many other difficult practical challenges such as the presence of multiple levels of container stacking and sequencing, variable container orientations, and vehicular dynamics that require finite acceleration and deceleration times. The proposed job grouping approach aims to improve the makespan of the schedule for yard jobs, while reducing straddle carrier waiting time by grouping jobs using a guiding function. The performance of the current sequential job allocation method and the proposed job grouping approach are evaluated and compared statistically using a pooled t-test for 30 randomly generated yard configurations. The experimental results show that the job grouping approach can effectively improve the schedule makespan and reduce the total straddle carrier waiting time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Software rejuvenation, which was originally introduced to deal with performance degradation due to software aging, has recently been proposed as a mechanism to provide protection against run-time cyber attacks in cyber-physical systems (CPSs). Experiments have demonstrated that CPSs can be protected from attacks that corrupt run-time code and data by periodically restoring the run-time system with an uncorrupted image. Control theoretic and empirical methods have been developed to determine the timing and mode-switching conditions for CPS software rejuvenation (CPS SR) that will guarantee system safety. This article presents the requirements that need to be met by the run-time system to support CPS SR. It also presents an implementation and demonstration of the run-time system for the PX4 autopilot system for autonomous vehicles.

By using a Markovian approach, Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) are derived that incorporate relative information among the agents to detect stochastic faults and cyber-attacks and then resiliently control the system to reach a consensus. A mixed coding and Message Authentication approach is presented to detect data injection cyber-attacks on the communication links. By using the Bayesian inference, useful information regarding the cyber-attack, such as the probability of its occurrence, is derived. Simulation and two case study results corresponding to a team of multi-agent Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (UAVs) confirm and verify the effectiveness and capabilities of our proposed methodologies.

AB We identify a universal mathematical structure in microscopic deterministic traffic models (with identical drivers), and thus we show that all such existing models in the literature, including both the two-phase and three-phase models, can be understood as special cases of a master model by expansion around a set of well-defined ground states. This allows any two traffic models to be properly compared and identified. The three-phase models are characterized by the vanishing of leading orders of expansion within a certain density range, and as an example the popular intelligent driver model is shown to be equivalent to a generalized optimal velocity (OV) model. We also explore the diverse solutions of the generalized OV model that can be important both for understanding human driving behaviors and algorithms for autonomous driverless vehicles.

TI Performance improvement of in-flight alignment for autonomous vehicle
   under large initial heading error
SO IEE PROCEEDINGS-RADAR SONAR AND NAVIGATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper presents a new method of in-flight alignment (IFA) for a strapdown inertial navigation system (SDINS) aided by a super short baseline (SSBL) system under a large initial heading error. To handle the large heading error, a new attitude error model is introduced in which attitude errors are divided into heading and levelling errors using a newly defined horizontal frame. Some navigation error dynamic models are derived from the attitude error model for indirect feedback filtering of the IFA system. A Kalman filter with position measurements is designed to estimate navigation errors as an indirect feedback filter. Simulation results show that the newly developed model works effectively for coarse alignment of a large heading error. The proposed IFA method very quickly decreases the heading error from more than 40degrees to about 5degrees.

AB Many modern imaging sensors must obtain multiple looks or "views" of a target at different orientations to automatically classify it with high confidence. Therefore, when tasked with classifying many targets, a mobile sensor may need to travel a long distance to change its position and orientation relative to every target, resulting in costly and time-consuming operations. This article presents a novel and general approach, referred to as informative multiview planning (IMVP) that simultaneously determines the most informative sequence of views and the shortest path between them. The approach is demonstrated on an underwater multitarget classification problem in which a sidescan sonar installed on an unmanned underwater vehicle must classify all targets in minimum time. Simulation and experimental results show that IMVP can achieve the same, or better, classification performance in half the time of existing multiview path planning methods. Also, by determining the most informative views and the shortest path between them, IMVP significantly improves classification efficiency, classification confidence level, as well as performance robustness.

AB This paper presents a farm management information system targeting improvements in the ease of use and sustainability of robot farming systems. The system integrates the functionalities of field survey, path planning, monitoring, and controlling agricultural vehicles in real time. Firstly, a Grabcut-based semi-supervised field registration method is proposed for arable field detection from the orthoimage taken by the drone with an RGB camera. It partitions a complex field into simple geometric entities with simple user interaction. The average Mean Intersection over Union is about 0.95 when the field size ranges from 2.74 ha to 5.06 ha. In addition, a desktop software and a web application are developed as the entity of an FMIS. Compared to existing FMISs, this system provides more advanced features in robot farming, while providing simpler user interaction and better results. It allows clients to invoke web services and receive responses independent of programming language and platforms. Moreover, the system is compatible with other services, users, and devices following the open-source access protocol. We have evaluated the system by controlling 5 robot tractors with a 2 Hz communication frequency. The communication protocols will be publicly available to protentional users.

AB Underwater 3D laser scanners are an essential type of sensor used by unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) for operations such as navigation, inspection, and object recognition and manipulation. Scanners that acquire 3D data by sweeping a laser plane across the scene can provide very high lateral resolution. However, their data may suffer from rolling shutter effect if the change of pose of the robot with respect to the scanned target during the sweep is not negligible. In order to compensate for motion-related distortions without the need for point cloud postprocessing, the 6-DoF pose at which the scanner acquires each line needs to be accurately known. In the underwater domain, autonomous vehicles are often equipped with a high-end inertial navigation system (INS) that provides reliable navigation data. Nonetheless, the relative pose of the 3D scanner with respect to the inertial reference frame of the robot is not usually known a priori. Therefore, this paper uses an ego-motion-based calibration algorithm to calibrate the extrinsic parameters of the visual-inertial sensor pair. Simulations are performed to quantify how miscalibration affects motion-related distortion. The method is also evaluated experimentally in laboratory conditions.

AB Planning and scheduling in construction heavily depend on current information about the state of construction processes. However, the acquisition process for visual data requires human personnel to take photographs of construction objects. We propose using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for automated creation of images and point cloud data of particular construction objects. The method extracts locations of objects that require inspection from Four Dimensional Building Information Modelling (4D-BIM). With this information at hand viable flight missions around the known structures of the construction site are computed. During flight, the UAV uses stereo cameras to detect and avoid any obstacles that are not known to the model, for example moving humans or machinery. The combination of pre-computed waypoint missions and reactive avoidance ensures deterministic routing from takeoff to landing and operational safety for humans and machines. During flight, an additional software component compares the captured point cloud data with the model data, enabling automatic per-object completion checking or reconstruction. The prototype is developed in the Robot Operating System (ROS) and evaluated in Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) simulations for the sake of being executable on real UAVs.

AB The work presented in this paper relates to the conceptual definition, simulation, and performance analysis of a novel, 3-D graph theory-based routing algorithm. The proposed router is designed to provide path planning with deconfliction, i.e., collision avoidance with other moving objects, for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) applications in general and autonomous UAV missions in particular. Thus, novel ways for "sampling'' 3-D operating spaces containing hazard areas and other moving objects are presented. The router operates in a way that conforms to the commonly observed behavior of aircraft flying over relatively long periods of time at constant speed and barometric height. Thus, flying is restricted to a number of possible altitude bands, where changes in altitude and/or direction are restricted to values that ensure excessive airframe stress is avoided. The paper attaches considerable emphasis on algorithmic complexity reduction and develops a novel, adaptive, graph search scheme. The proposed router can also be used to support manned aircraft operation, both for pre-flight planning and during the mission as a pilot aid. Computer simulation results are indicative of a routing system which generates realistic flyable routes while algorithmic complexity is suppressed.

AB Direct tire-road contact friction estimation is essential for future autonomous cars and active safety systems. Friction estimation methods have been proposed earlier for driving conditions in the presence of a slip angle or slip ratio. However, the estimation of the friction from a freely-rolling tire is still an unsolved topic. Knowing the existing friction potential would be beneficial since vehicle control systems could be adjusted before any remarkable tire force has been produced. Since accelerometers are well-known and robust, and thus a promising sensor type for intelligent tires, this study uses three three-axis IEPE accelerometers on the inner liner of a tire to detect friction potential indicators on two equally smooth surfaces with different friction levels. The equal roughness was chosen for both surfaces in order to study the friction phenomena by neglecting the effect of surface texture on vibrations. The acceleration data before the contact is used to differentiate the two friction levels between the tire and the road. In addition, the contact lengths from the three accelerometers are used to validate the acceleration data. A method to differentiate the friction levels on the basis of the acceleration signal is also introduced.

AB A 12-V motor drive system using an onboard battery is promising in vehicle applications, e. g., to rotate an air pump to adjust its air delivery to the burner, thereby providing autonomous exhaust temperature control for the conventional diesel engine vehicle. The 12-V/1-kW motor drive system proposed in this paper consists of a series-resonant LLC MOSFET full-bridge converter, which provides high-efficiency power transfer by implementing zero voltage switching and boosts the dc bus to similar to 300 V, and an insulated-gate bipolar transistor inverter, which provides the high-side phase currents to a 1-kW/6000-r/min brushless dc motor (BLDC). This design secures the high efficiency, low cost, and low volume. Meanwhile, with the variable output voltage of this dc/dc converter, this paper realizes a commutation torque-ripple reduction method, which will minimize the mechanical vibration. Experimental results on this prototype system demonstrate that: 1) the LLC dc/dc part efficiency is 97.6% with 92% of the inverter efficiency; and 2) the motor commutation torque ripple is reduced close to zero.

AB Historically, vehicle safety reflects the current state of the art and new innovations will continue to make our cars even safer in the future. Since its invention, the car has enjoyed a unique, triumphal procession. Safety plays a central role in the development of a car model today. The number of accidents has also risen, in line with the growth in traffic. In addition to carelessness or distraction at the wheel, the most common causes of accidents are excessive speed, risky maneuvers and disregard of traffic rules. The introduction of the speed limit on rural roads and the obligation to wear seat belts, were particularly important positive milestones. Two different methods are also used to check the effect of the individual technical options and safety, in the event of accidents. First are the crash tests. Here, an accident situation is simulated in practice, under realistic conditions. The other solution is the simulation. The Finite Element Method, behind this term, lies the virtual calculation of various consequences of an accident, on the basis of mathematical differential equations. The degree of deformation of various components or the entire car, as a whole, is examined by calculation.

AB The development process of high fidelity SLAM systems depends on their validation upon reliable datasets. Towards this goal, we propose IBISCape, a simulated benchmark that includes data synchronization and acquisition APIs for telemetry from heterogeneous sensors: stereo-RGB/DVS, LiDAR, IMU, and GPS, along with the ground truth scene segmentation, depth maps and vehicle ego-motion. Our benchmark is built upon the CARLA simulator, whose back-end is the Unreal Engine rendering a high dynamic scenery simulating the real world. Moreover, we offer 43 datasets for Autonomous Ground Vehicles (AGVs) reliability assessment, including scenarios for scene understanding evaluation like accidents, along with a wide range of frame quality based on a dynamic weather simulation class integrated with our APIs. We also introduce the first calibration targets to CARLA maps to solve the unknown distortion parameters problem of CARLA simulated DVS and RGB cameras. Furthermore, we propose a novel pre-processing layer that eases the integration of DVS sensor events in any frame-based Visual-SLAM system. Finally, extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the latest state-of-the-art Visual/Visual-Inertial/LiDAR SLAM systems are performed on various IBISCape sequences collected in simulated large-scale dynamic environments.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is expected to bring transformative improvement to the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. However, due to shared spectrum resources, it is challenging to achieve a critical trade-off between these two integrated functionalities. To address this issue, we propose in this letter a new integrated periodic sensing and communication mechanism for the UAV-enable ISAC system. Specifically, the user achievable rate is maximized via jointly optimizing UAV trajectory, transmit precoder, and sensing start instant, subject to the sensing frequency and beam pattern gain constraints. Despite that this problem is highly non-convex and involves an infinite number of variables, we obtain the optimal transmit precoder and derive the optimal achievable rate in closed-form for any given UAV location to facilitate the UAV trajectory design. Furthermore, we first prove the structural symmetry between optimal solutions in different ISAC frames without location constraints and then propose a high-quality UAV trajectory and sensing optimization algorithm for the general location-constrained case. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed design and also unveil a more flexible trade-off in ISAC systems over benchmark schemes.

AB Objective To explore the ramifications of attribution errors (AEs), initially in the context of vehicle collisions and then to extend this understanding into the broader and diverse realms of all forms of human-machine interaction. Background This work focuses upon a particular topic that John Senders was examining at the time of his death. He was using the lens of attribution, and its associated errors, to seek to further understand and explore dyadic forms of driver collision. Method We evaluated the utility of the set of Senders' final observations on conjoint AE in two-vehicle collisions. We extended this evaluation to errors of attribution generally, as applicable to all human-human, human-technology, and prospectively technology-technology interactions. Results As with Senders and his many other contributions, we find evident value in this perspective on how humans react to each other and how they react to emerging forms of technology, such as autonomous systems. We illustrate this value through contemporary examples and prospective analyses. Applications The comprehension and mitigation of AEs can help improve all interactions between people, between intelligent machines and between humans and the machines they work with.

AB Extensive studies have been conducted on unmanned vehicle recently due to its bright prospect. However, few of them have studied the technology of driverless bus. In this paper, a path planning and navigation control system is designed for 12-m length driverless electric bus. The global path planning is adopted by the Dijkstra algorithm based on the analysis tool of ArcGIS. For local planning, a triple-layer finite-state machine is proposed to plan the driving maneuver, and it reduces computational complexity and improves driving effectiveness. Then, optimal trajectory is generated by a curve fitting technique based on path planning and driving maneuver, which takes full account of the safety and kinetics for driverless bus. In addition, we address the speed planning by expert rules to imitate an experienced driver. Finally, the trajectory tracking controller is devised by an adaptive rolling window. Moreover, a heading error compensation model and a self-adaptive strategy of controller parameters are set up to improve the control precision. Finally, simulation by TruckSim and scenes experiments verify the validity and practicability of our proposed path planning and navigation control system for driverless bus.

AB The objective of this study is twofold: to approximate a model of a blimp, and to use this model to develop a setup to track a target with the blimp that is outfitted with a wireless camera and radio-controlled propellers. This article presents a powerful method to track any moving or stationary target with an unmanned aerial vehicle by combining the advantages of the proportional derivative (PD) controller, continuously adaptive mean shift (Camshift) algorithm, and pulse width modulation (PWM) method. As a result, it is demonstrated that a decent approximation of blimp behavior is sufficient when using a mathematical model that contains saturation in velocity and actuation. Additionally, a code for the proposed algorithm is developed to capture every frame sample with a frame grabber as a sensor in real time. Once the previously chosen object is tracked, the coordinate data (location information) are transferred to the controller to apply required pulses to DC motors on the blimp. In this paper, the proposed controller is outlined in two steps. Initially, one calculates a PD controller that fulfills the specifications of the mathematical model without saturation. Secondly, PWM is utilized to address the impact of nonlinearities.

AB Machine learning is an appealing and useful approach to creating vehicle control algorithms, both for simulated and real vehicles. One common learning scenario that is often possible to apply is learning by imitation, in which the behavior of an exemplary driver provides training instances for a supervised learning algorithm. This article follows this approach in the domain of simulated car racing, using the TORCS simulator. In contrast to most prior work on imitation learning, a symbolic decision tree knowledge representation is adopted, which combines potentially high accuracy with human readability, an advantage that can be important in many applications. Decision trees are demonstrated to be capable of representing high quality control models, reaching the performance level of sophisticated pre-designed algorithms. This is achieved by enhancing the basic imitation learning scenario to include active retraining, automatically triggered on control failures. It is also demonstrated how better stability and generalization can be achieved by sacrificing human-readability and using decision tree model ensembles. The methodology for learning control models contributed by this article can be hopefully applied to solve real-world control tasks, as well as to develop video game bots.

ID CONTROL-SYSTEM
AB We describe the application of fuzzy logic to the control of a robot intended to navigate forest paths. Robots could improve the safety of forest operations by removing the operator from the vehicle and also reduce costs by automating these operations. The controller was organized into three modules, each of which was capable of providing a heading recommendation for the robot. Sensory information was provided by shaft encoders and three ultrasonic rangefinders. The controller required a set of sensory data acquired from one training run down the path. Two of the modules provided heading recommendations from the shaft encoder and ultrasonic rangefinder data, respectively. A third module arbitrated the recommendations of the first two modules and provided a final heading recommendation. Decisions made by the operator during the training run were used in the arbitration to weight the recommendations of the individual modules. It was observed that the combination of modules performed better than the individual modules alone. Despite the simplicity of the controller a test vehicle was able to consistently navigate 152 m (500 ft) down a forest path. It was concluded that the approach is feasible, and further development of the control algorithm is warranted.

AB In order to improve the capabilities of AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles) when operating in the Arctic, and under sea ice in particular, there are a number of recommendations that are essential for a successful operation. These recommendations not only deal with features of the AUV itself, but also with positioning under the ice, artificial intelligence for under-ice behaviour, the optimal sensor package for mapping the underside of sea ice, launch and recovery techniques and the operational scenario as a whole. We review these recommendations, and draw attention to a new technology which is central to improved AUV operation, the Stand-Alone USBL (Ultra-Short BaseLine, a method of underwater acoustic positioning) Positioning Buoy, which will enable insertion, tracking and retrieval of AUVs to be more rapid and secure, and enable in-mission low bandwidth communication. Both large and small AUVs have been used successfully to map the 3D structure of the ice underside, but always in an experimental context. The challenge now is to determine the best way forward to improve the quantity and quality of data gathering, and to turn the under-ice AUV into a reliable vehicle for routine use.

AB For use in autonomous micro air vehicles, visual sensors must not only be small, lightweight and insensitive to light variations; on-board autopilots also require fast and accurate optical flow measurements over a wide range of speeds. Using an auto-adaptive bio-inspired Michaelis-Menten Auto- adaptive Pixel (M(2)APix) analog silicon retina, in this article, we present comparative tests of two optical flow calculation algorithms operating under lighting conditions from 6 X 10(-7) to 1.6 X 10(-2) W.cm(-2) (i. e., from 0.2 to 12,000 lux for human vision). Contrast "time of travel" between two adjacent light-sensitive pixels was determined by thresholding and by cross- correlating the two pixels' signals, with measurement frequency up to 5 kHz for the 10 local motion sensors of the M2APix sensor. While both algorithms adequately measured optical flow between 25 degrees/s and 1000 degrees/s, thresholding gave rise to a lower precision, especially due to a larger number of outliers at higher speeds. Compared to thresholding, cross-correlation also allowed for a higher rate of optical flow output (99 Hz and 1195 Hz, respectively) but required substantially more computational resources.

AB This paper presents a simple concept which has not been, up to now, thoroughly explored in scientific research: the use of information coming from the network of Internet connected mobile devices (on vehicles) to regulate traffic light systems. Three large-scale changes are going to shape the future of transportation and could lead to the regulation of traffic signal system based on floating car data (FCD): (i) the implementation of Internet connected cars with global navigation satellite (GNSS) system receivers and the autonomous car revolution; (ii) the spreading of mobile cooperative Web 2.0 and the extension to connected vehicles; (iii) an increasing need for sustainability of transportation in terms of energy efficiency, traffic safety, and environmental issues. Up to now, the concept of floating car data (FCD) has only been extensively used to obtain traffic information and estimate traffic parameters. Traffic lights regulation based on FCD technology has not been fully researched since the implementation requires new ideas and algorithms. This paper intends to provide a seminal insight into the important issue of adaptive traffic light based on FCD by presenting ideas that can be useful to researchers and engineers in the long-term task of developing new algorithms and systems that may revolutionize the way traffic lights are regulated.

AB Increasing energy security and reliability concerns are intensifying the interest in microgrids. In this setting, design optimization is vital to achieve a reliable infrastructure without overbuilding. This paper considers the impact of frequency and voltage regulation on the optimal design of a conceptual, autonomous military microgrid. This microgrid comprises a solar panel and vehicles as power sources, with each vehicle incorporating a battery and generator. The power output and terminal voltage of these inverter-based sources must be regulated. The paper investigates the effects of battery DC voltage variations on a decentralized regulation scheme, and the resulting influence on optimal component sizing. To this end, controllers are first designed based on the typical assumption that the voltage on the DC side of each inverter is constant. The battery internal resistance is then considered and its impact on regulation performance is investigated. The results show that the battery internal resistance can affect the performance of both frequency and voltage regulation, and consequently must be taken into account in component sizing decisions. Thus, the paper identifies an important coupling between regulation and component sizing problems through battery characteristics, and highlights the need for a combined sizing and regulation framework for microgrid design.

TI Three-Dimensional Curvature-Constrained Trajectory Planning Based on
   In-Flight Waypoints
SO JOURNAL OF AIRCRAFT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper proposes an efficient algorithm with a novel procedure for trajectory planning of unmanned aerial vehicles in three-dimensional space. This work has been motivated by a challenge to develop a fast trajectory planning algorithm for autonomous unmanned aerial Vehicles through the midcourse waypoints. The waypoints that are defined as a preflight or in-flight procedure are described in a five-dimensional configuration: the position in three dimensions plus desired crossing heading and flight-path angles. For achieving the waypoints, the Dubins path is extended to three-dimensional applications by using the geometrical concepts. In addition, the trajectory planning algorithm is represented as a set of ordinary differential equations called optimal-constrained-trajectory kinematics by applying the differential geometry concepts. Optimal-constrained-trajectory kinematic is a closed-loop guidance law that generates the guidance commands based on the waypoint configuration and minimum turning radius and is solved in a real-time manner. The proposed algorithm includes an operational framework that leads to gradually generating the smooth three-dimensional trajectory, aimed at reaching the midcourse targets and final target so that they are smoothly connected to each other. Finally, the simulation results show the capability of the algorithm in dynamic trajectory planning in low computational burden.

ID MODEL
AB Predicting pedestrian crossing trajectories has become a primary task in aiding autonomous vehicles to assess risks in pedestrian-vehicle interactions. As agile participants with changeable behavior, pedestrians are often capable of choosing from multiple possible crossing trajectories. Current research lacks the ability to predict multimodal trajectories with interpretability, and it also struggles to capture low-probability trajectories effectively. Addressing this gap, this article proposes a multimodal trajectory prediction model that operates by first estimating potential motion trends to prompt the generation of corresponding trajectories. It encompasses three sequential stages. First, pedestrian motion characteristics are analyzed, and prior knowledge of pedestrian motion states is obtained using the Gaussian mixture clustering method. Second, a long short-term memory model is employed to predict future pedestrian motion states, utilizing the acquired prior knowledge as input. Finally, the predicted motion states are discretized into various potential motion patterns, which are then introduced as prompts to the Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer model for trajectory prediction. Experimental results on the Euro-PVI and BPI datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves cutting-edge performance in predicting pedestrian crossing trajectories. Notably, it significantly enhances the diversity, accuracy, and interpretability of pedestrian crossing trajectory predictions.

AB The future mobile communication system is expected to provide ubiquitous connectivity and unprecedented services over billions of devices. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which is prominent in its flexibility and low cost, emerges as a significant network entity to realize such ambitious targets. In this work, novel machine learning-based trajectory design and resource allocation schemes are presented for a multi-UAV communications system. In the considered system, the UAVs act as aerial Base Stations (BSs) and provide ubiquitous coverage. In particular, with the objective to maximize the system utility over all served users, a joint user association, power allocation and trajectory design problem is presented. To solve the problem caused by high dimensionality in state space, we first propose a machine learning-based strategic resource allocation algorithm which comprises of reinforcement learning and deep learning to design the optimal policy of all the UAVs. Then, we also present a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning scheme for distributed implementation without knowing a priori knowledge of the dynamic nature of networks. Extensive simulation studies are conducted and illustrated to evaluate the advantages of the proposed scheme.

AB Spectral congestion and modern consumer applications motivate radio technologies that efficiently cooperate with nearby users and provide several services simultaneously. We designed and implemented a joint positioning-communications system that simultaneously enables network communications, timing synchronization, and localization to a variety of airborne and ground-based platforms. This Communications and High-Precision Positioning (CHP2) system simultaneously performs communications and precise ranging (<10 cm) with a narrow band waveform (10 MHz) at a carrier frequency of 915 MHz (US ISM) or 783 MHz (EU Licensed). The ranging capability may be extended to estimate the relative position and orientation by leveraging the spatial diversity of the multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) platforms. CHP2 also digitally synchronizes distributed platforms with sub-nanosecond precision without support from external systems (GNSS, GPS, etc.). This performance is enabled by leveraging precise time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation techniques, a network synchronization algorithm, and the intrinsic cooperation in the joint processing chain that executes these tasks simultaneously. In this manuscript, we describe the CHP2 system architecture, hardware implementation, and in-lab and over-the-air experimental validation.

AB In this paper, finite-time trajectory tracking problem of the marine vessels (MVs) disturbed by highly coupled nonlinearities and unknown ocean current is solved by developing a barrier function-based adaptive fast non-singular terminal sliding mode control (BFAFNTSMC) method. Salient features are as follows: (1) The defined fast non-singular terminal sliding mode manifold (FNTSM) which introduces the finite-time ocean current observer (OCO) is proposed to guarantee the finite-time sliding motion for mismatched disturbance attenuation. (2) By devising a novel log-type barrier function adaptive sliding mode reaching law (BFARL) based on single switching logic, the synovial variable will converge to and maintain in a predefined neighborhood of zero in a finite time, without overestimating the control gain. (3) Finite-time convergence of trajectory tracking errors to the predefined neighborhood of zero can be guaranteed, independently of the boundaries of the lumped nonlinearities. The proposed method exhibits the satisfied properties of tracking performance as well as chattering alleviation. Simulation results and comparisons are further presented to illustrate remarkable effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB The paper presents an experimental study conducted to evaluate the feasibility of using accelerometers as an indirect means to estimate water depths on road surfaces. It makes use of the vibration of the vehicle's wheel arch due to water droplets projected by a tire rolling on a wet road surface. A trailer equipped with a wheel and towed by a van was used. The test setups to spread water on the road surface and before the test wheel, measure the water depth and visualize the water spray are described. The test program, conducted on a test track closed to the traffic, includes three surfaces and two speeds. Visualization of water flows by means of high-speed cameras makes it possible to choose a suitable location for the accelerometers. It turns out that signals provided by the accelerometers are affected by the trailer's movement; a filtering method has been successfully developed to remove noises. Results show a tight relationship between the mean amplitude of accelerometric signals and actual water depths. Discussions are made in terms of effects of the vehicle speed and the road surface texture. Perspectives for using the developed system to improve passenger safety under autonomous driving conditions are presented.

AB In the Internet-of-Things scenarios, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), as a popular aerial platform, is calling for ever-increasing computing support. This letter proposes a novel mobile edge computing (MEC) framework for UAV with the assistance of the reconfigurable intelligence surface (RIS), where a UAV offloads the computation tasks to ground access points (APs) with the assistance of an RIS, during which non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme is employed. We maximize the UAV's computation capacity by jointly optimizing the reflecting phase shift, communication and computation (2C) resource allocation, decoding order, and UAV's deployment. Specifically, we first derive the reflecting phase shift by invoking the concave-convex procedure (CCCP) method and the semidefinite relaxation technique. Next, we obtain the 2C resource allocation by using the CCCP method. The decoding order and the UAV's deployment are finally solved via proposing a grid search (GS) method. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) the computation capacity is greatly improved by the design of RIS; 2) NOMA scheme outperforms orthogonal multiple access scheme; 3) the proposed GS method achieves significant performance gains, as compared with the traditional convex approximation method.

AB Cooperative driving is an emerging area in the field of vehicular networks and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). It contributes to enhancing safety by reducing accidents as a consequence of rogue driving and overtaking. Thus, to accomplish the requirements of safety, real-time traffic traces are required for comprehensive analysis. However, the real traces are limited in availability and constraint to the environment they are collected from. On the other hand, a common practice is to use a single-lane traffic generation model to address collision modeling, which is limited by collision modeling of rear-end collisions. Therefore, to address these limitations in the literature, this paper proposes a multilane traffic generation (MLTG) model using microscopic modeling. Furthermore, to generate different multilane synthetic traffic traces, traffic flow behaviors and collision scenarios are replicated as use cases by incorporating the perception & human errors. The efficacy of the MLTG model is tested and analyzed by performing extensive simulations in MATLAB by considering varied scenarios such as straight road, merging, and diversion for single-lane and cross-lane collision modeling, respectively. The results show that the performance of the proposed MLTG model outperforms in terms of stability and scalability, compared to the existing state-of-the-art techniques.

AB Urban mobility is facing an increased long-term uncertainty and complexity generated by accelerated technological development. These challenges require radical advancement in planning processes and methods, which could enable breaking out of path dependencies and unlocking alternative, sustainable futures. In order to provide a landscape overview of foresight-focused methods used in the domain of urban mobility, we conduct a systematic literature review. An analytical framework for review is based on planning knowledge taxonomy, including dialectic between knowing how/what and knowing to what end and doing. Such framework formulation is aiming to assess methodological capacity for widening system boundary and holism (object-focus) as well as integration and imagination (process-focus). Results show that the overall trend of methodological development is emphasizing development in object or process-focus domain, but rarely both. In addition to this assessment, we conclude that methodological development should further reflect the moral and democratic dimension concerning public deliberation. Such development should aim to create spaces for shared discussion, reflection, and formation of alternative futures, while allowing spaces for agonistic contestation and conflicting opinions through radical, experimental, and experiential approaches.

AB Making rational decisions for sequential decision problems in complex environments has been challenging researchers in various fields for decades. Such problems consist of state transition dynamics, stochastic uncertainties, long-term utilities, and other factors that assemble high barriers including the curse of dimensionality. Recently, the state-of-the-art algorithms in reinforcement learning studies have been developed, providing a strong potential to efficiently break the barriers and make it possible to deal with complex and practical decision problems with decent performance. We propose a formulation of a velocity varying one-on-one quadrotor robot game problem in the three-dimensional space and an approximate dynamic programming approach using a projected policy iteration method for learning the utilities of game states and improving motion policies. In addition, a simulation-based iterative scheme is employed to overcome the curse of dimensionality. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed decision strategy can generate effective and efficient motion policies that can contend with the opponent quadrotor and gather advantaged status during the game. Flight experiments, which are conducted in the Networked Autonomous Vehicles (NAV) Lab at the Concordia University, have further validated the performance of the proposed decision strategy in the real-time environment.

AB State estimation for micro air vehicles (MAVs) often depends heavily on reliable global measurements such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). When global measurements are unavailable, additional sensors, such as cameras or laser scanners, are commonly used to provide measurements of the MAV's translation and rotation relative to a previously observed keyframe image or scan. With the use of only relative sensors, however, the global position and heading of the vehicle are unobservable and cannot be reliably reconstructed. Many existing approaches work with respect to a global reference frame, resulting in a loss of state observability. This article highlights that unobservability leads to inconsistency and a loss of optimality, which reduces estimation accuracy and robustness of the navigation solution. Relative navigation is presented as an alternative approach that maintains observability by always working with respect to a local coordinate frame. While still subject to global drift, relative navigation is shown through rigorous simulation and hardware validation to produce accurate and consistent state estimates when other approaches break down. By subtly restructuring the state estimation problem to a relative framework, many of the pitfalls prevalent in GPS-denied MAV navigation systems are inherently mitigated.

TI The development of a target-lock-on optical remote sensing system for
   unmanned aerial vehicles
SO AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in various military and civil applications is the subject of much current attention. With recent developments in personal computer technology, and the availability at affordable cost of peripherals, and electronic and optical sensors, UAVs for long endurance missions, with flight autonomy beyond the Visual range, have become an attractive challenge for Study ill universities and research institutes. This paper describes the development of a target-lock-on optical remote sensing system to be used as a payload in a university-class UAV. To accomplish autonomous way-point navigation for the conduct of optical sensing surveillance, a gimbaled-platforin with servo control and all Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) navigation system for UAV position and attitude measurements have been developed. The UAV also Utilises a Global Position System (GPS) receiver, a pressure altimeter, gyroscopes and an electric compass. A novel mathematical model is proposed to calculate the optimal parameters for orientating the CCD camera line of sight with a ground target, designated in real time from a ground control station. Both ground and flight test results have demonstrated the feasibility of the navigation control scheme and the UAV's ability to conduct ground target acquisition and image transmission.

AB Logistics tasks often require the precise maneuvering of truck-trailer systems to a target position. For example, the rear of the trailer must be steered to a docking position for unloading. Global path planning algorithms usually generate suboptimal solutions. In an additional planning step, these solutions can be used as initialization for a local optimizer. In this article, a model predictive controller is presented, which performs a local optimization for suboptimal reference trajectories. Allowing to deviate temporarily from the previously generated solution allows to eliminate redundant direction changes, to increase obstacle clearance, and in the end, to generate more efficient solutions. To provide numerical robustness, it is proposed to constrain the terminal state to the reference path of the global planner solution. Simulation results for a one-trailer system highlight the benefits of the optimized solution in a particularly tight planning scenario. The applicability of the generated solutions is demonstrated in an experimental model scale setup. Furthermore, the method allows to switch between trajectory optimization (TO) and trajectory tracking (TT) mode to adapt to different driving situations, which is demonstrated in multiple simulation examples for a two-trailer system.

AB Aerial communication is gradually taking an assertive role within common societal behaviors by means of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), high-altitude platforms (HAPs), and fixed-wing aircrafts (FWAs). Such devices can assist general operations in a diverse set of heterogeneous applications, such as video surveillance, remote delivery, and connectivity provisioning in crowded events and emergency scenarios. Given their increasingly higher technology penetration rate, telco operators started looking at the sky as a new potential direction to enable a three-dimensional (3D) communication paradigm. However, designing flying mobile stations involves addressing a daunting number of challenges, such as an excessive onboard control overhead, variable battery drain, and advanced antenna design. To this end, the newly born smart surfaces technology may come to help: reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) may be flexibly installed on board to control the terrestrial propagation environment from an elevated viewpoint by involving low-complex and battery-limited solutions. In this article, we focus on identifying the key optimization aspects to be considered when designing RIS-based aerial networks, and in particular the associated control architecture, by shedding light on novel use cases, corresponding requirements, and potential solutions.

AB Routing protocols do not respond quickly to environmental changes due to the high mobility of nodes in the Flying Ad Hoc Network (FANET), to obtain reliable transmission links. This paper proposes an adaptive link maintenance method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL-MLsA), which can dynamically adjust the time interval of broadcasting Hello packets. This method can cope with the highly dynamic network environment, and adapt to both active routing and table-driven routing protocols. The method considers the channel model of the signal and investigates the impact of UAV communication range on link maintenance. We can get an agent by perceiving the degree of changes in the number of neighbors in a dynamic environment. The optimal broadcast cycle was obtained to maximize the energy of the node to send and receive task data. We substituted the single-output network model with a competitive network to overcome the reward overestimation problem, which also improves the convergence speed of the algorithm. Simulation results showed that DRL-MLsA can reduce the communication overhead for link maintenance, while at the same time increase the throughput of the network and decrease the packet loss of transmission.

AB The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technique provides a potential solution to scalable wireless edge networks. This paper uses two UAVs, with accelerated motions and fixed altitudes, to realize a wireless edge network, where one UAV forwards downlink signals to user terminals (UTs) distributed over an area while the other one collects uplink data. The conditional average achievable rates, as well as their lower bounds, of both the uplink and downlink transmission are derived considering the active probability of UTs and the service queues of two UAVs. In addition, a problem aiming to maximize the energy efficiency of the whole system is formulated, which takes into account communication related energy and propulsion energy consumption. Then, we develop a novel multi-agent Q-learning (MA-QL) algorithm to maximize the energy efficiency, through optimizing the trajectory and transmit power of the UAVs. Finally, simulation results are conducted to verify our analysis and examine the impact of different parameters on the downlink and uplink achievable rates, UAV energy consumption, and system energy efficiency. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm achieves much higher energy efficiency than other benchmark schemes.

AB For Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), the intelligent video analysis is a key technology in intelligent autonomous control, real-time navigation and surveillance. However, poor UAV wireless links would degrade the quality of video communication, leading to difficulties in video analysis. To meet the challenges of packet-loss and limited bandwidth in adverse UAV channel environments, this paper proposes a parameter optimization mechanism for UAV intelligent video analysis. In the proposed method, an Optimal Strategy Library (OSL) is designed to optimize the parameters for video encoding and forward error correction. Adapted to the packet-loss rate and bandwidth in practical UAV wireless network, the proposed OSL can facilitate the encoding of video sequences and the recovery of degraded videos with optimal performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can keep intelligent video analysis working efficiently with adverse UAV wireless links, and is capable of maximizing the inference accuracy of Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) algorithms in various scenarios.

AB This paper deals with path generation of a mobile robot for an environment having slopes. In general, most of the path planning algorithms will take care of 2-dimensional or full 3-dimensional path planning whereas in the proposed method we are considering 2-dimensional environments along with slopes and travelable obstacles, which can be viewed as another layer of a 2-dimensional environment over the first one, and vehicle can manoeuvre over the obstacle rather than taking long road. For this purpose, A* algorithm is chosen for the path planning in this work, by considering its accuracy, efficiency and easiness in extending to Dynamic environment, D* algorithm. This can help mobile robot to conserve energy and reduce time taken to reach a goal. Algorithm presented here tries to find a path, in a 2D environment, with obstacle having slope, by travelling over them rather than going around. Ability to travel over an obstacle is basically based on the angle of the inclination, which can be estimated using sensor, like range finder, Lidar and others.

   using active front steer and individual wheel torque control
SO VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Collision avoidance; model predictive control; active front steering;
   torque vectoring
AB Collision avoidance is a crucial function for all ground vehicles, and using integrated chassis systems to support the driver presents a growing opportunity in active safety. With actuators such as in-wheel electric motors, active front steer and individual wheel brake control, there is an opportunity to develop integrated chassis systems that fully support the driver in safety critical situations. Here we consider the scenario of an impending frontal collision with a stationary or slower moving vehicle in the same driving lane. Traditionally, researchers have approached the required collision avoidance manoeuver as a hierarchical scheme, which separates the decision-making, path planning and path tracking. In this context, a key decision is whether to perform straight-line braking, or steer to change lanes, or indeed perform combined braking and steering. This paper approaches the collision avoidance directly from the perspective of constrained dynamic optimisation, using a single optimisation procedure to cover these aspects within a single online optimisation scheme of model predictive control (MPC). While the new approach is demonstrated in the context of a fully autonomous safety system, it is expected that the same approach can incorporate driver inputs as additional constraints, yielding a flexible and coherent driver assistance system.

AB The WITAS project addresses the design of an intelligent, autonomous UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), in our case a helicopter. Its dialogue-system subprojects address the design of a deliberative system for natural-language and graphical dialogue with that robotic UAV. This raises new issues both for dialogue and for reasoning in real time. The following topics have been particularly important for us in various stages of the work in these subprojects:
   - spatiotemporal reference in the dialogue, including reference to past events and to planned or expected, future events
   - mixed initiative in the dialogue architecture of a complex system consisting of both dialogue-related components (speech, grammar, etc) and others (simulation, event recognition, interface to robot) and more recently as well
   - identification of a dialogue manager that is no more complex than what is required by the application
   - uniform treatment of different types of events, including the robot's own actions, observed events, communication events, and dialogue-oriented deliberation events
   - a logic of time, action, and spatiotemporal phenomena that facilitates the above.
   This paper gives a brief overview of the WITAS project as a whole, and then addresses the approaches that have been used and that are presently being considered in the work on two generations of dialogue subsystems.

AB Considering the significant increase in transportation (R. Abe, 2019) demand in the last few decades and its consequences on society and the environment, the development of a sustainable transport system is vital. The relevance of public transport networks is expanding as present-day environmental, financial and resource pressures bear upon cities, providing the impetus for new sustainable and economical modes of mobility. Promoting public transport and introducing connectivity and automation are crucial for effectuating a sustainable transport system. Buses can improve the network performance, but curbside bus stops (CBS) elevate the side friction which cause substantial delays to other vehicles, urging imprudent forced lane changes and affecting safety. The introduction of connectivity and automation in buses may improve performance along with safety, and this study attempts to investigate the repercussions of connected automated buses (CABs) in a mixed fleet with connected automated vehicles (CAVs), through a microsimulation modelling exercise. Results indicate that CABs can reduce network-level travel time by 7.9%, 6.4%, 2.1%, 1.3%, 1.8%, 1.2% and 2.27% for 0%, 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90% and 100% CAV penetration, when compared to the network with Human-driven buses (HBs) with the same CAV penetration. Furthermore, CABs also improve the performance of link containing bus stops by reducing standstill times (timespan when buses have zero velocity on the bus stop link). Results exhibit that CABs can decrease standstill times by 12.5%, 13.3%, 12.6%, 15%, 12.9%, 16.7% and 19.9% for 0%, 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90% and 100% CAV penetration, when compared to the network with HBs with identical CAV penetration. Additionally, the number of lane changes in these links were reduced by 28.2% at 100% CAV penetration, indicating synchronous driving and reduced forced lane changes. The crash rate indicates that critical events involving automated vehicle entities and Manual Vehicles (MV) can increase as the MVs cannot adapt promptly to automated driving behaviour. This is supported by the non- parametric distribution of post-encroachment time (PET), time- to-collision (TTC) and relative speed (DeltaS), indicating that the conflict/collision typology's severity can increase at intermediate CAV penetrations, but plunge significantly at 100% penetration when compared to the current scenario. Lastly, the limitation of tools in flagging conflicts involving CAVs is discussed, and future scrutiny is proposed.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are attractive in some Internet of Things (IoT) applications, due to their flexible deployment and extended coverage. In this paper, we consider an UAV-assisted network where the UAV flies between the resource-limited sensor nodes (SNs) and collects their status updates. The UAV trajectory and SN scheduling are jointly optimized to minimize the Age of Synchronization (AoS). In contrast to the conventional Age of Information (AoI), AoS takes into account both the freshness and the content of the information, which makes AoS a more suitable design criterion for information collection in an energy-constrained wireless network. Since the formulated problem is challenging to solve due to its non convexity, we reformulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to obtain the optimal solution with various action and state spaces. Our simulation results show the fast convergence rate of the proposed DRL algorithm and demonstrate that our proposed scheme can improve the performance of the UAV-assisted network compared to AoI-based schemes.

ID CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK
AB The defect diagnosis of modern infrastructures is crucial to public safety. In this work, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptive crack recognition framework. To fulfill the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) task of cracks recognition in infrastructural inspections, we propose a robust UDA learning strategy termed Crack-DA to increase the generalization capacity of the model in unseen test circumstances. More specifically, we first propose leveraging the self-supervised depth information to help the learning of semantics. And then using the edge information to suppress nonedge background objects and noises. We also use the data augmentation-based consistency. More importantly, we use the disparity in depth to evaluate the domain gap in semantics and explicitly consider the domain gap in network optimization. A database consisting of 11 298 crack images with detailed pixel-level labels for network training in domain adaptations is established. Extensive experiments on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-captured highway cracks and real-site UAV inspections of building cracks demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed domain adaptive crack recognition approach.

AB To achieve autonomous navigation in complex marine environments, unmanned surface vehicles are equipped with a variety of sensors for sensing the surrounding environment and their own state. To address the issue of unsatisfactory multi-sensor information fusion in stochastic uncertain systems with unknown disturbances, an improved evidence theory multi-sensor data fusion method is proposed in this article. First, the affiliation function in fuzzy set theory is introduced as a support function to assign initial evidence for multi-sensor data, and the initial evidence is corrected according to the degree of data bias. Second, a divergence measure is employed to measure the degree of conflict and discrepancy among the evidence, and each piece of evidence is allocated proportional weight based on the conflict allocation principle. Finally, the evidence is synthesized through the evidence combination rule, and the data are weighted and summed to obtain the data fusion results. Since it is difficult to obtain dynamic information from multiple sensors carried by unmanned surface vehicles in practical applications, and considering that the proposed method has universal applicability, practical application experiments using previous research demonstrate that the proposed method has higher fusion accuracy than other existing data fusion methods.

ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE
AB Although broad reinforcement learning (BRL) provides a more intelligent autonomous decision-making method for the collision avoidance problem of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), the algorithm still has the problem of over-estimation and has difficulty converging quickly due to the sparse reward problem in a large area of sea. To overcome the dilemma, we propose a double broad reinforcement learning based on hindsight experience replay (DBRL-HER) for the collision avoidance system of USVs to improve the efficiency and accuracy of decision-making. The algorithm decouples the two steps of target action selection and target Q value calculation to form the double broad reinforcement learning method and then adopts hindsight experience replay to allow the agent to learn from the experience of failure in order to greatly improve the sample utilization efficiency. Through training in a grid environment, the collision avoidance success rate of the proposed algorithm was found to be 31.9 percentage points higher than that in the deep Q network (DQN) and 24.4 percentage points higher than that in BRL. A Unity 3D simulation platform with high fidelity was also designed to simulate the movement of USVs. An experiment on the platform fully verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB Modern technologies are penetrating all fields of human activity, including agriculture, where they significantly affect the quantity and quality of agricultural production. Precision agriculture can be characterised as an effort to improve the results of practical farming, achieving higher profits by exploiting the existing spatial unevenness of soil properties. We aim to evaluate precision agriculture technologies' practical use in agricultural enterprises in the Czech Republic. The research was based on a questionnaire survey in which 131 farms participated. We validated the hypothesis through a Chi-squared test on the frequency of occurrence of end-use technology. The results showed that precision farming technologies are used more in crop than livestock production. In particular, 58.02% of enterprises use intelligent weather stations, 89.31% use uncrewed vehicles, and 61.83% use navigation and optimisation systems for optimising journeys. These technologies are the most used and closely related to autonomous driving and robotics in agriculture. The results indicate how willing are agricultural enterprises to adopt new technologies. For policy makers, these findings show which precision farming technologies are already implemented. This can make it easier to direct funding towards grants and projects.

AB Position/force control of an Intervention Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (I-AUV) is essential to many underwater intervention tasks (e.g., marine equipment maintenance, underwater welding and so on), and is challenging due to unknown fluid disturbances and model uncertainties. This paper applies the Sliding Mode Impedance Control (SMIC) to the full contact intervention of an I-AUV, from non-contact phase to contact phase. Both computational simulations and practical experiments are conducted to investigate the performance of SMIC. In simulations, considering model uncertainties and detailed fluid disturbances, accurate position and force tracking can be achieved, with the position tracking errors within +/- 3 x 10(-3) m and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4 x 10(-2) N in tracking the desired contact force of 10N. For the purpose of experimental validation, the SMIC is implemented on an I-AUV developed in the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). The experimental results demonstrate the SMIC's good performance in the contact intervention of the I-AUV, with the position tracking errors within +/- 1.6x10(-2) m and a RMSE of 0.97N in maintaining the desired contact force of 10N.

AB In this study the location of vehicle to vehicle distance thresholds for self-reported subjective risk and comfort was researched. Participants were presented with ascending and descending time headway sequences in a driving simulator. This so called method of limits of ascending and descending stimuli (Gouy, Diels, Reed, Stevens, & Burnett, 2012) was refined to efficiently determine individual thresholds for stable time headways with a granularity of 0.1 s. Time headway thresholds were researched for 50, 100, and 150 km/h in a city, rural, and highway setting. Furthermore, thresholds for self-driving (level 0 automation: NHTSA, 2013) were compared with thresholds for the experience of subjective risk and comfort in assisted driving, similar to adaptive cruise control (level 1 automation). Results show that preferred individual time headways vary between subjects. Within subjects however, time headway thresholds do not significantly differ for different speeds. Furthermore we found that there was no significant difference between time headways of self-driving and distance-assisted driving. The relevance of these findings for the development of adaptive cruise control systems, autonomous driving and driver behavior modelling is discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MAP-MATCHING ALGORITHMS; PARTICLE FILTERS; NAVIGATION
AB Most navigation systems today rely on global navigation satellite systems (gnss), including in cars. With support from odometry and inertial sensors, this is a sufficiently accurate and robust solution, but there are future demands. Autonomous cars require higher accuracy and integrity. Using the car as a sensor probe for road conditions in cloud-based services also sets other kind of requirements. The concept of the Internet of Things requires stand-alone solutions without access to vehicle data. Our vision is a future with both invehicle localization algorithms and after-market products, where the position is computed with high accuracy in gnss-denied environments. We present a localization approach based on a prior that vehicles spend the most time on the road, with the odometer as the primary input. When wheel speeds are not available, we present an approach solely based on inertial sensors, which also can be used as a speedometer. The map information is included in a Bayesian setting using the particle filter (PF) rather than standard map matching. In extensive experiments, the performance without gnss is shown to have basically the same quality as utilizing a gnss sensor. Several topics are treated: virtual measurements, dead reckoning, inertial sensor information, indoor positioning, off-road driving, and multilevel - positioning.

AB A precise GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) localization is vital for autonomous road vehicles, especially in cluttered or urban environments where satellites are occluded, preventing accurate positioning. We propose to fuse GPS (Global Positioning System) data with fisheye stereovision to face this problem independently to additional data, possibly outdated, unavailable, and needing correlation with reality. Our stereoscope is sky-facing with 360 degrees x 180 degrees fisheye cameras to observe surrounding obstacles. We propose a 3D modelling and plane extraction through following steps: stereoscope self-calibration for decalibration robustness, stereo matching considering neighbours epipolar curves to compute 3D, and robust plane fitting based on generated cartography and Hough transform. We use these 3D data with GPS raw data to estimate NLOS (Non Line Of Sight) reflected signals pseudorange delay. We exploit extracted planes to build a visibility mask for NLOS detection. A simplified 3D canyon model allows to compute reflections pseudorange delays. In the end, GPS positioning is computed considering corrected pseudoranges. With experimentations on real fixed scenes, we show generated 3D models reaching metric accuracy and improvement of horizontal GPS positioning accuracy by more than 50%. The proposed procedure is effective, and the proposed NLOS detection outperforms CN0-based methods (Carrier-to-receiver Noise density).

DE GNSS; Cooperative positioning; EKF; CRAIM; Extended w test
AB Current cooperative positioning with global navigation satellite system (GNSS) for connected vehicle application mainly uses pseudorange measurements. However, the positioning accuracy offered cannot meet the requirements for lane-level positioning, collision avoidance and future automatic driving, which needs real-time positioning accuracy of better than 0.5 m. Furthermore, there is an apparent lack of research into the integrity issue for these new applications under emerging driverless vehicle applications. In order to overcome those problems, a new extended Kalman filter (EKF) and a multi-failure diagnosis algorithm are developed to process both GNSS pseudorange and carrier phase measurements. We first introduce a new closed-loop EKF with partial ambiguity resolution as feedback to address the low accuracy issue. Then a multi-failure diagnosis algorithm is proposed to improve integrity and reliability. The core of this new algorithm includes using Carrier phase-based Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring method for failure detection, and the double extended w test detectors to identify failure. A cooperative positioning experiment was carried out to validate the proposed method. The results show that the proposed closed-loop EKF can provide highly accurate positioning, and the multi-failure diagnosis method is effective in detecting and identifying failures for both code and carrier phase measurements.

ID UNDERWATER VEHICLES
AB A neural network based control system ''Self-Organizing Neural-net-Controller System: SONCS'' has been developed as an adaptive control system for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV's). In this paper, an on-line adaptation method ''Imaginary Training'' is proposed to improve the time-consuming adaptation process of the original SONGS. The Imaginary Training can be realized by a parallel structure which enables the SONGS to adjust the controller network independently of actual operation of the controlled object. The SONGS is divided into two separate parts: the Real-World Part where the controlled object is operated according to the objective, and the Imaginary-World Part where the Imaginary Training is carried out. In order to adjust the controller network by the Imaginary Training, it is necessary to introduce a forward model network which can generate simulated state variables without involving actual data. A neural network ''Identification Network'' which has a specific structure to simulate the behavior of dynamical systems is proposed as the forward model network. The effectiveness of the Imaginary Training is demonstrated by applying to the heading keeping control of an AUV ''Twin-Burger.'' It is shown that the SONGS adjusts the controller network through on-line processes in parallel with the actual operation.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Trajectory prediction is imperative in the operation of autonomous vehicles because it aids in understanding the surrounding environment through perception fusion of multiple sensors and high -accuracy localisation. Furthermore, the output of algorithms used for trajectory prediction is used in decision making and path planning. However, the accuracy of trajectory prediction is dependent on the perception system particularly when low-cost sensors are used or severe weather conditions are encountered. Data-dependent and task-dependent aleatoric uncertainty affects the trajectory prediction task. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a network for trajectory prediction that integrates the temporal pattern attention and the graph convolutional sequence encoding to address the data -dependent uncertainty caused by observation noise and machine-perceptual errors. Furthermore, an adaptive weight loss function was developed to address the training difficulties caused by loss -dominated tasks (task-dependent aleatoric uncertainty) in a trajectory prediction network. The results of our experiment indicate a 20% improvement in predictive performance over existing methods under a 5-s prediction horizon. Furthermore, an experiment comparing robustness to heteroscedastic uncertainty confirmed that the proposed method improves trajectory prediction robustness against observation noise and perceptual errors.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB Marine debris impacts negatively upon the marine environment and the survival of marine life because they are some difficult-to-degrade substances, and most of them will sink into the deep sea and continue to exist in the ocean. Autonomous underwater vehicles can clean up the deep-sea debris to some extent. However, the efficient detection method plays a critical role in the collection rate. This article establishes an efficient deep-sea debris detection method with high speed using deep learning methods. First, a real deep-sea debris detection dataset (3-D dataset) is established for further research. The dataset contains seven types of debris: cloth, fishing net and rope, glass, metal, natural debris, rubber, and plastic. Second, the one-stage deep-sea debris detection network ResNet50-YOLOV3 is proposed. In addition, eight advanced detection models are also involved in the detection process of deep-sea debris. Finally, the performance of ResNet50-YOLOV3 is verified by experiments. Furthermore, the applicability and effectiveness of ResNet50-YOLOV3 in deep-sea debris detection are proved by the experimental results.

AB The paper presents physical modeling, design, simulations, and experimentation on a novel Soft Underwater Artificial Skin (SUAS) used as tactile sensor. The SUAS functions as an electrostatic capacitive sensor, and it is composed of a hyperelastic membrane used as external cover and oil inside it used to compensate the marine pressure. Simulation has been performed studying and modeling the behavior of the external interface of the SUAS in contact with external concentrated loads in marine environment. Experiments on the external and internal components of the SUAS have been done using two different conductive layers in oil. A first prototype has been realized using a 3D printer. The results of the paper underline how the soft materials permit better adhesion of the conductive layer to the transducers of the SUAS obtaining higher capacitance. The results here presented confirmed the first hypotheses presented in a last work and opened new ways in the large-scale underwater tactile sensor design and development. The investigations are performed in collaboration with a national Italian project named MARIS, regarding the possible extension to the underwater field of the technologies developed within the European project ROBOSKIN.

AB When do states forge technological change in mature industries? This article challenges the emphasis on bureaucratic autonomy in explaining the ability of governments to promote technological change. We show that structural features of the bureaucracy alone are insufficient to account for variation in policy intervention, and argue that sectoral patterns of interest intermediation shape state capacity. Political coordination leads industry and government to broker technological transformations in consensus-driven negotiations. This prioritizes the interests of incumbent firms, likely resulting in regulatory capture and weak policy intervention. Political competition among interest groups and state agencies, by contrast, allows policy-makers to organize coalitions of technology challengers, likely leading to strong policy intervention. We examine this argument in the case of electric vehicle policy in Germany and the United States. Germany failed to disrupt its auto sector to transition to electric vehicles, while the United States adopted comprehensive policies for the manufacturing and commercialization of electric cars against incumbent opposition. Counter to conventional wisdom, our findings suggest that states can effectively engage in sectoral intervention to drive technological change in the absence of autonomous bureaucracies.

AB An intelligent scheme to integrate inertial navigation system/global positioning system (GPS) is proposed using a constructive neural network (CNN) to overcome the limitations of current schemes, namely Kalman filtering (KF). The proposed CNN technique does not require prior knowledge or empirical trials to implement the proposed architecture since it is able to construct its architecture "on the fly," based on the complexity of the vehicle dynamic variations. The proposed scheme is implemented and tested using Micro-electro-mechanical systems inertial measurement unit data collected in a land-vehicle environment. The performance of the proposed scheme is then compared with the multi-layer feed-forward neural networks (MFNN) and KF- based schemes in terms of positioning accuracy during GPS signal outages. The results are then analyzed and discussed in terms of positioning accuracy and learning time. The preliminary results presented in this article indicate that the positioning accuracy were improved by more than 55% when the MFNN and CNN-based schemes were implemented. In addition, the proposed CNN was able to construct the topology by itself autonomously on the fly and achieve similar prediction performance with less hidden neurons compared to MFNN-based schemes.

AB This paper presents the design of an adaptive input-output feedback linearizing dorsal fin control system for the yaw plane control of low-speed bio-robotic autonomous underwater vehicles (BAUVs). The control forces are generated by cambering two dorsal fins mounted in the vertical plane on either side of the vehicle. The BAUV model includes nonlinear hydrodynamics, and it is assumed that its hydrodynamic coefficients as well as the physical parameters are not known. For the purpose of design, a linear combination of the yaw angle tracking error and its derivative and integral is chosen as the controlled output variable. An adaptive input-output feedback linearizing control law is derived for the trajectory control of the yaw angle. Unlike indirect adaptive control, here the controller gains are directly tuned. The stability of the zero dynamics is examined. Simulation results are presented for tracking exponential and sinusoidal yaw angle trajectories and for turning maneuvers, and it is shown that the adaptive control system accomplishes precise yaw angle control of the BAUV using dorsal fins in spite of the nonlinearity and large uncertainties in the system parameters.

AB In recent years, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for wireless communications has been shown promising in a plethora of different applications. Their flexible deployment and mobility make them key enablers for the next generation of networks, provided that system design is properly addressed. In this article, we analyze a beyond-5G network where a UAV, acting as an unmanned aerial base station (UAB), is employed to collect data from reduced capability user equipments (UEs), deployed in an urban area. Specifically, we study a cluster-based scenario, where UEs are deployed following a Thomas cluster process, and the UAB flies over cluster centers according to the traveling salesman problem solution. Through the use of a stochastic approach, we mathematically devise the system performance accounting for uplink transmission protocol constraints, random access procedure, finite number of radio resources available, and coverage issues during the UAB flight. The mathematical model, validated via comparison with simulations, allows to optimize some system parameters, like the UAB speed, the number of UEs per cluster, and the number of radio resources to be used for the access and for data transmissions.

AB Considering that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with the advantages of flexible deployment and high maneuverability have the limited energy to provide long-term seamless coverage, a cooperative recharging-transmission strategy is studied in this paper for the powered UAV-aided terahertz (THz) downlink networks, where a UAV-to-user THz sub-band association scheme is proposed for the THz frequency transmission to eliminate interference. Based on this, the minimum requirements of the wireless charging window and THz-transmitting window are derived. A minimization problem of minimum timeslot requirement is formulated to jointly optimize UAV placement and UAV-to-user THz sub-band association. The optimization problem is non-convex, and we propose an alternating optimization solution via iteratively solving placement subproblem and association subproblem. Specifically, we resort to the coalescent method of interior point and gradient descent algorithms to optimize UAV placement. The UAV-to-user THz sub-band association is solved as a knapsack problem by the transformation of association matrix. Simulation results validate the solution and demonstrate that the proposed strategy can achieve quasi-optimal performance compared with other contrasting strategies.

AB In this article, we present an optimization-based framework for multicopter trajectory planning subject to geometrical configuration constraints and user-defined dynamic constraints. The basis of the framework is a novel trajectory representation built upon our novel optimality conditions for unconstrained control effort minimization. We design linear-complexity operations on this representation to conduct spatial-temporal deformation under various planning requirements. Smooth maps are utilized to exactly eliminate geometrical constraints in a lightweight fashion. A variety of state-input constraints are supported by the decoupling of dense constraint evaluation from sparse parameterization and the backward differentiation of flatness map. As a result, this framework transforms a generally constrained multicopter planning problem into an unconstrained optimization that can be solved reliably and efficiently. Our framework bridges the gaps among solution quality, planning efficiency, and constraint fidelity for a multicopter with limited resources and maneuvering capability. Its generality and robustness are both demonstrated by applications to different flight tasks. Extensive simulations and benchmarks are also conducted to show its capability of generating high-quality solutions while retaining the computation speed against other specialized methods by orders of magnitude.

AB Driving control in the car-following (CF) driving behavior has two aspects. First, in what measure an approximation distance is taken as a safe distance guaranteeing the safety of the follower drivers. Second, how to control the follower's vehicle velocities based on the stimulus of the leading vehicle. In this context, to resolve the driving control problem in the CF driving behavior, a bilevel optimization is presented in this paper, based on the behaviors of the follower and leader drivers. Bearing in mind that mathematics has contributed to the imitation of human behaviors, they are now reaching a level of complexity requiring the entry on the scene of a new player, which is artificial intelligence. Thus, in this paper; we used the fuzzy logic theory for modeling a follower driver with a nonnormative behavior. To validate our model, we used a data set from the program of the US Federal Highway Administration. Therefore, according to the experimental results, there is homogeneity between the actual and the simulated travel trajectories in terms of deviation. Besides, the driver's behavior adopted (normative or nonnormative) is reflected in his reactions to the various components of the road.

AB Nowadays, robots equipped with a single camera, such as micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), are easily found at affordable costs. They can be used in different tasks, including the building of 3D environment maps. For building such maps, monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods are employed, which usually generate sparse or semi-dense representations that are ill-suited for navigation tasks. We propose a new 3D exploration approach that uses a monocular camera as the only source of information. Our approach transforms a point cloud generated by monocular SLAM into local volumetric maps. These maps are built using the lines-of-sight between points and keyframes, allowing the MAV to navigate safely through the environment. Goal poses are dynamically defined to guide the MAV to explore the environment while avoiding obstacles. Besides that, the proposed approach seeks to determine properly when the environment was entirely explored, preventing that MAV stops before cover all the environment or flies more that is needed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated in experiments in two different indoor environments, and show that it is possible to explore an environment using only a MAV equipped with a single monocular camera.

DT Article
DE Aerial robotics; autonomous vehicle navigation; motion and path planning
AB There is extensive literature on using convex optimization to derive piece-wise polynomial trajectories for controlling differential flat systems with applications to three-dimensional flight for Micro Aerial Vehicles. In this work, we propose a method to formulate trajectory generation as a quadratic program (QP) using the concept of a Safe Flight Corridor (SFC). The SFC is a collection of convex overlapping polyhedra that models free space and provides a connected path from the robot to the goal position. We derive an efficient convex decomposition method that builds the SFC from a piece-wise linear skeleton obtained using a fast graph search technique. The SFC provides a set of linear inequality constraints in the QP allowing real-time motion planning. Because the range and field of view of the robot's sensors are limited, we develop a framework of Receding Horizon Planning, which plans trajectories within a finite footprint in the local map, continuously updating the trajectory through a re-planning process. The re-planning process takes between 50 to 300 ms for a large and cluttered map. We show the feasibility of our approach, its completeness and performance, with applications to high-speed flight in both simulated and physical experiments using quadrotors.

AB Although the use of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has great potential for fast autonomous exploration, it has received far too little attention. In this article, we present a RApid Collaborative ExploRation (RACER) approach using a fleet of decentralized UAVs. To effectively dispatch the UAVs, a pairwise interaction based on an online hgrid space decomposition is used. It ensures that all UAVs simultaneously explore distinct regions, using only asynchronous and limited communication. Furthermore, we optimize the coverage paths of unknown space and balance the workloads partitioned to each UAV with a capacitated vehicle routing problem formulation. Given the task allocation, each UAV constantly updates the coverage path and incrementally extracts crucial information to support the exploration planning. A hierarchical planner finds exploration paths, refines local viewpoints, and generates minimum-time trajectories in sequence to explore the unknown space agilely and safely. The proposed approach is evaluated extensively, showing high exploration efficiency, scalability, and robustness to limited communication. Furthermore, for the first time, we achieve fully decentralized collaborative exploration with multiple UAVs in the real world. We will release our implementation as an open-source package.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted communications have been considered as a solution of aerial networking in future wireless networks due to its low-cost, high-mobility, and swift features. This paper considers a UAV-assisted downlink transmission, where UAVs are deployed as aerial base stations to serve ground users. To maximize the average transmission rate among the ground users, this paper formulates a joint optimization problem of UAV trajectory design and channel selection, which is NP-hard and non-convex. To solve the problem, we propose a multi-agent deep Q-network (MADQN) scheme. Specifically, the agents that the UAVs act as perform actions from their observations distributively and share the same reward. To tackle the tasks where the experience is insufficient, we propose a multi-agent meta reinforcement learning algorithm to fast adapt to the new tasks. By pretraining the tasks with similar distribution, the learning model can acquire general knowledge. Simulation results have indicated the MADQN scheme can achieve higher throughput than fixed allocation. Furthermore, our proposed multiagent meta reinforcement learning algorithm learns the new tasks much faster compared with the MADQN scheme.

AB Supporting reliable and seamless wireless connectivity for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has recently become a critical requirement to enable various different use cases of UAVs. Due to their widespread deployment footprint, cellular networks can support beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) communications for UAVs. In this paper, we consider cellular connected UAVs (C-UAVs) that are served by massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) links to extend coverage range, while also improving physical layer security and authentication. We consider Rician channel and propose a novel linear precoder design for transmitting data and artificial noise (AN). We derive the closed-form expression of the ergodic secrecy rate of C-UAVs for both conventional and proposed precoder designs. In addition, we obtain the optimal power splitting factor that divides the power between data and AN by asymptotic analysis. Then, we apply the proposed precoder design in the fingerprint embedding authentication framework, where the goal is to minimize the probability of detection of the authentication tag at an eavesdropper. In simulation results, we show the superiority of the proposed precoder in both secrecy rate and the authentication probability considering moderate and large number of antenna massive MIMO scenarios.

AB In the last decade, there has been growing interest in Vehicular Ad Hoc NETworks (VANETs). Today car manufacturers have already started to equip vehicles with sophisticated sensors that can provide many assistive features such as front collision avoidance, automatic lane tracking, partial autonomous driving, suggestive lane changing, and so on. Such technological advancements are enabling the adoption of VANETs not only to provide safer and more comfortable driving experience but also provide many other useful services to the driver as well as passengers of a vehicle. However, privacy, authentication and secure message dissemination are some of the main issues that need to be thoroughly addressed and solved for the widespread adoption/deployment of VANETs. Given the importance of these issues, researchers have spent a lot of effort in these areas over the last decade. We present an overview of the following issues that arise in VANETs: privacy, authentication, and secure message dissemination. Then we present a comprehensive review of various solutions proposed in the last 10 years which address these issues. Our survey sheds light on some open issues that need to be addressed in the future. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

DT Article
AB Crossing points are not always 100% visible for drivers due to different factors (e.g., poor road maintenance, occlusion of vertical signs, and adverse weather conditions). USA estimated in 2015 the number of traffic accidents involving pedestrians and vehicles in 70,000 of whom 5,376 resulted in deceased people. To contribute in this field, this paper presents the design, implementation, and testing of a smart prototype system applied to pedestrian crossings-not regulated by semaphores-which try to reduce the accident rate on roads. The hardware and software system consists of a set of autonomous, intelligent, and wireless low-cost devices that generate a visual warning barrier perceived by drivers from a suitable distance when pedestrians traverse a crosswalk. In this way, drivers can reduce the speed of their vehicles and stop safely. The system's intelligence is carried out by a fuzzy controller that performs sensory fusion at both low level and high level with various types of sensors from local and neighboring devices. The tests conducted have determined an average success of 94.64% and a precision of 100%, thus corresponding with a very good test according to a ROC analysis. As a result, the system proposed has been patented and extended to international PCT.

AB The field of biomimetics seeks to distill biological principles from nature and implement them in engineering systems in an effort to improve various performance metrics. In this paper, a biology-based approach is used to address the problem of radiated propulsor noise in underwater vehicles using active control. This approach is one of "tail articulation" of a stator blade, which is carried out using a suitable strategy that effectively alters the flow field impinging on a rotor downstream and in turn changes the radiated noise characteristics of the rotor blades. A reduced-order two-dimensional noise model is developed by characterizing the impact of the articulation as a point circulation input, which is then used to develop an active control strategy. An experimental investigation of such a control strategy is also carried out in this paper using a simple benchtop open-channel water tunnel at Re = 4000 and stepper motor controlled articulation. Tail articulations using sinusoidal and transient motion were able to reduce the wake deficit behind the stator by as much as 40-60%. The implications of the proposed method for reducing blade tonal noise in autonomous underwater vehicles are briefly discussed at the end of the paper.

AB This paper reports the development and application of an interval max-plus fault-tolerant control to a seat assembly system. Such systems will undergo a profound change because novel seats for autonomous driving contain expanded safety systems and are more voluminous and heavy. Automated guided vehicles are a promising means of transportation in these systems, but they require dedicated and advanced control systems. This rises new challenges because such an assembly system can dispose both shared resources and redundant elements. This paper presents a fault-tolerant control framework, which allows dealing with systems containing shared resources as well as redundancies. It also overcomes the problem of uncertainties and constraints, which are inevitable in industrial reality.

AB The U.S. Department of Transportation's (USDOT) Smart City Challenge was very effective at starting a national dialogue about how cities can leverage the inevitable boom in the Internet of Things (IoT) and advanced information technologies to address our transportation challenges. Although USDOT's challenge focused primarily on transportation, the "Smart City" also addresses other issues that impact the community such as climate change, healthcare, education, energy, water, wastewater, public safety, and inclusive infrastructure. Seventy-eight cities (including Tampa, FL, USA, where the author worked on the city's Smart City Challenge proposal) presented bold, innovative concepts including connected/autonomous vehicles, multimodal transportation apps, smart parking, automated transit bus platooning, fleet electrification, all kinds of sensors, and even high- tech gondolas. The City of Columbus, OH, USA ultimately won the challenge, but other cities are continuing their work to bring these proposals to fruition.

AB A new guidance scheme for the problem of low-thrust transfer between inclined orbits is developed within the framework of optimal control theory. The objective of the guidance scheme is to provide the appropriate thrust steering program that will transfer the vehicle from inclined low earth orbits to high earth orbits. The presented guidance scheme is determined using Pontryagin's principle such that three desired performance measures are minimized and boundary conditions for this unspecified final time problem are satisfied. One of the novelties of this work is changing the independent variable from time to thrust angle and considering properties of autonomous system equations to reduce to one where an exact analytical solution is obtained. Finally, three performance measure results are compared and the best policy is proposed.

AB Next-generation autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) will be required to robustly identify underwater targets for tasks such as inspection, localization, and docking. Given their often unstructured operating environments, vision offers enormous potential in underwater navigation over more traditional methods; however, reliable target segmentation often plagues these systems. This paper addresses robust vision-based target recognition by presenting a novel scale and rotationally invariant target design and recognition routine based on self-similar landmarks that enables robust target pose estimation with respect to a single camera. These algorithms are applied to an AUV with controllers developed for vision-based docking with the target. Experimental results show that the system performs exceptionally on limited processing power and demonstrates how the combined vision and controller system enables robust target identification and docking in a variety of operating conditions.

AB This paper investigates the joint optimization of the three-dimensional (3D) position deployment of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and the access UAVs selection of ground machine type devices (MTDs). Cache-enabled UAVs are deployed over the Internet of Things (IoT) networks to provide flexible and reliable delivery services for ground devices. Since each MTD has different data demands and the ultimate goal of communication is to provide personalized services for MTDs, we propose an air-ground collaborative deployment strategy focusing on optimizing users' satisfaction. In the proposed strategy, the hierarchical game model is proposed. Specifically, the 3D position deployment of multiple UAVs is at the upper layer and the access UAV selection of ground MTDs is at the lower. Since there is no central controller and the users are autonomous, we structure a local interaction game to achieve global optimization for the network satisfaction problem. We design a hierarchical deployment access based log-linear learning (HDALL) algorithm to achieve the desirable solution. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of air-ground collaborative deployment strategy as well as HDALL algorithm.

AB This article concentrates on ground vision guided autonomous landing of a fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) within Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) denied environments. Cascaded deep learning models are developed and employed into image detection and its accuracy promoting for UAV autolanding, respectively. Firstly, we design a target bounding box detection network BboxLocate-Net to extract its image coordinate of the flying object. Secondly, the detected coordinate is fused into spatial localization with an extended Kalman filter estimator. Thirdly, a point regression network PointRefine-Net is developed for promoting detection accuracy once the flying vehicle?s motion continuity is checked unacceptable. The proposed approach definitely accomplishes the closed-loop mutual inspection of spatial positioning and image detection, and automatically improves the inaccurate coordinates within a certain range. Experimental results demonstrate and verify that our method outperforms the previous works in terms of accuracy, robustness and real-time criterions. Specifically, the newly developed BboxLocate-Net attaches over 500 fps, almost five times the published state-of-the-art in this field, with comparable localization accuracy. ? 2020 Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

AB In the research of multi-robot systems, multi-AUV (multiple autonomous underwater vehicles) cooperative target hunting is a hot issue. In order to improve the target hunting efficiency of multi-AUV, a multi-AUV hunting algorithm based on dynamic prediction for the trajectory of the moving target is proposed in this article. Firstly, with moving of the target, sample points are updated dynamically to predict the possible position of a target in a short period time by using the fitting of a polynomial, and the safe domain of the moving target, which is a denied area for the hunting AUVs, is built to avoid the target's escape when it detects AUVs. Secondly, the method of negotiation is adopted to allocate appropriate desired hunting points for each AUV. Finally, the AUVs arrive at desired hunting points rapidly through deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to achieve hunting the moving target. The simulations show that hunting AUVs can surround the moving target of which the trajectory is unknown rapidly and accurately by the algorithm in the 3D environment with complex obstacles and results obtained is satisfactory.

AB When Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) of different sizes sail in narrow water areas, their hydrodynamic performance is affected to varying degrees by boundaries. In this study, circulating water tank experiments and CFD simulations were conducted on three different-size ellipsoidal AUVs. The objective was to observe the in-fluence of size on the hydrodynamics of AUVs moving at different speeds and different angles of attack in an open channel. Subsequently, a separate analysis was performed on the big size model under different sailing speeds to observe how the hydrodynamics are influenced by the boundaries of the open channel as the Froude number varies. Finally, a separate analysis was conducted to investigate the hydrodynamic effects of the open channel's free surface, bottom wall, and sidewalls on the model. It was found that the free surface has a bigger impact on an AUV's hydrodynamic performance than a solid wall. The findings show that the free surface has no effect on an AUV with a depth larger than 3.1D (AUV height D), and that hydrodynamic coefficients tend to be constant for W/B = 2.7 (channel width W, model width B) and higher.

AB Communication among the ships can provide additional information that assists ships in negotiating and collaborating with others to take effective actions. This article provides a review on ship collision avoidance methods proposed during the last decade from the perspectives of communication and cooperation. Two innovatively indices are defined, i.e., the communication index and the cooperation index. The overview of the existing research shows that collision risks are the most often exchanged information, while weak cooperation based on predefined protocols or rules, like COLREGs, is the majority. Competition and high-level cooperation are rarely studied in the past, but these topics have attracted increasing attention. Moreover, the analysis of the two indices reveals that communication is the premise of cooperation. Higher level cooperation requires detailed information, which means higher communication requirements. The main challenges for future research are identified, including cooperation among heterogeneous ships considering various autonomous levels and cooperation levels, the stability of the communication network and the reliability of the exchanged information, methods for obtaining the required information, and quantitative interpretations of COLREGs and seamanship.

DT Article
DE object detection; edge computing; adaptive pre-processing; underwater
AB Recent studies on underwater object detection have progressed with the development of deep-learning methods. Generally, the model performance increase is accompanied by an increase in computation. However, a significant fraction of remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operate in environments with limited power and computation resources, making large models inapplicable. In this paper, we propose a fast and compact object detector-namely, the Underwater Light-weight Object detector (ULO)-for several marine products, such as scallops, starfish, echinus, and holothurians. ULO achieves comparable results to YOLO-v3 with less than 7% of its computation. ULO is modified based on the YOLO Nano architecture, and some modern architectures are used to optimize it, such as the Ghost module and decoupled head design in detection. We propose an adaptive pre-processing module for the image degradation problem that is common in underwater images. The module is lightweight and simple to use, and ablation experiments verify its effectiveness. Moreover, ULO Tiny, a lite version of ULO, is proposed to achieve further computation reduction. Furthermore, we optimize the annotations of the URPC2019 dataset, and the modified annotations are more accurate in localization and classification. The refined annotations are available to the public for research use.

AB In order to better explore the ocean, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have been widely applied to facilitate the information collection. However, considering the extremely large-scale deployment of sensor nodes in the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT), a homogeneous AUV-enabled information collection system cannot support timely and reliable information collection considering the time-varying underwater environment as well as AUV's energy and mobility constraints. In this article, we propose a multi-AUV-assisted heterogeneous underwater information collection scheme for the sake of optimizing the peak Age of Information (AoI). Moreover, the limited service M/G/1 vacation queueing model is utilized to model the process of information exchange, where the optimal upper limit of the number of AUVs served in the queueing system as well the steady-state distribution of the queue length are derived. A low-complexity adaptive algorithm for adjusting the upper limit of the queuing length is also proposed. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme and algorithm, which outperform traditional methods in terms of the peak AoI.

AB Unsupervised machine learning algorithms (clustering, genetic, and principal component analysis) automate Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) missions as well as the creation and refinement of iterative 3D photogrammetric models with a next best view (NBV) approach. The novel approach uses Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to achieve convergence to a specified orthomosaic resolution by identifying edges in the point cloud and planning cameras that "view" the holes identified by edges without requiring an initial model. This iterative UAV photogrammetric method successfully runs in various Microsoft AirSim environments. Simulated ground sampling distance (GSD) of models reaches as low as3.4cm per pixel, and generally, successive iterations improve resolution. Besides analogous application in simulated environments, a field study of a retired municipal water tank illustrates the practical application and advantages of automated UAV iterative inspection of infrastructure using 63% fewer photographs than a comparable manual flight with analogous density point clouds obtaining a GSD of less than 3 cm per pixel. Each iteration qualitatively increases resolution according to a logarithmic regression, reduces holes in models, and adds details to model edges.

AB We describe a 60-GHz channel sounder with phased-array antennas and 1-GHz bandwidth. It estimates the angle of departure (AoD)/angle of arrival (AoA) of channel multipath components (MPCs) by sweeping the antenna space of the transmitter/receiver through 5.6 degrees electronically steerable beams. The associated 26.1-dBi gain and resultant 36-dBm EIRP of the beams enable sounding up to hundreds of meters. Both ends integrate multiple arrays to extend the +/- 45 degrees field of view (FoV) of the individual arrays to an omnidirectional view; the additional advantage of integrating multiple arrays is to quicken the channel sweep period to just 262 mu s, corresponding to a maximum closing velocity of 33 km/h for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) scenarios. The receiver is mounted on a mobile robot whose navigational system enables rapid, autonomous, and untethered data collection. Over-the-air (OTA) methods to characterize the array beams patterns, calibrate the system impulse response, and compensate for clock drift are proposed such that properties of the MPCs can be extracted with high fidelity through super-resolution techniques. To substantiate the latter, we compare estimated properties against ground-truth values from extensive field measurements. The mean absolute error in angle was reported as 2.87 degrees.

AB The paper introduces an innovative way of exploiting aerial robotics or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the communication field which adds up a wider angle of applications to the already vast use of this new technology. Since IEEE 802 Wi-Fi technology is popular and widely used nowadays (in smartphones, laptops, access points, smart TVs etc.), performance reducing interference caused by having any two or more close-by 2.4 GHz networks on the same channel can occur especially in highly dense populated urban areas. We design an aerial robot (UAV) with a powerful Wi-Fi receiver along with high gain antennas and some other equipment enabling it to operate as a so called Passive sniffer, listening to all Wi-Fi traffic in range and extracting network information along with GPS coordinates and illustrate the results on Geographical maps using Wi-Fi Triangulation Techniques. Having such capabilities on an autonomous aerial robot enables geographical packet analysis and the observation of widespread traffic, plus the ability to analyse and graph the areas with coverage and locate the highly crowded areas with higher interference. Therefore finding solutions to mitigate this undesirable performance degrading interference.

AB Flight performances of unmanned helicopters can be affected by wind gusts especially when they are carrying out aggressive mission. In this study, robust position control problem under aggressive manoeuvres is investigated in the presence of time-varying wind disturbances for a lab helicopter. A robust controller is designed in two steps: first, a nominal static linear feedback controller is applied to obtain desired tracking for the nominal system; then, a robust compensator is introduced to restrain the influences of parameter uncertainties, non-linear uncertainties and external wind disturbances. It is proven that the position tracking errors of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed to converge to a neighbourhood of the origin with designated boundary. Experimental results on the 3-degrees of freedom helicopter confirm the effectiveness of this method.

AB Accurately understanding traffic surroundings is crucial for various autonomous and assisted driving scenarios. The visual perception system must capture the entire scene, including vehicle positions, road conditions, and lane configurations. While existing methods co-train models for these tasks simultaneously, they overlook the topological relationships among roads, lanes, and traffic objects in images. In this paper, we propose leveraging inherent structural relations among these tasks to enhance precise panoptic driving perception. We introduce a cross-task relation mining (CRM) method to achieve this goal. Self-attention mechanisms are used to blend key spatial features within each task, and cross-attention facilitates essential information exchange between tasks, resulting in a more comprehensive scene interpretation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in complex traffic scenarios.

Firstly, the mechanical structure of the dual-arm system is briefly introduced, wherein each 4-DOF manipulator has an additional grasping function. In addition, the kinematics model of the manipulator is derived by using the improved D-H method. Secondly, the working space of the underwater dual-arm system is analyzed, which is obtained by using Monte Carlo method. The cubic polynomial interpolation and the five polynomial interpolation trajectory planning methods are compared in the joint space. Finally, with the help of the Robotics Toolbox software, the numerical test is conducted to verify the functions of the underwater dual-arm manipulator system.

In this control system, the controller based on ADRC technique is the main controller. The robust trajectory tracking problem of the quadrotor is solved based on the attitude decoupling control. ADRC attitude decoupling controllers are used to eliminate the effect of the state coupling and uncertainties caused by internal and external disturbances. This control system also contains an avoidance obstacle approach whose trajectories can be obtained through two kinds of potential field with rotation vectors, quadrotor can choose a smoother trajectory from them to avoid the obstacle. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been verified in simulations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Voice acquisition and recognition are important, because sound is the most convenient and efficient media to realize seamless and hands-free human-machine interaction. Many applications, such as smart phones, humanoid robots, smart home, autonomous vehicles, and Internet of Things, demand for high-quality voice acquisition, especially in a noisy environment. In this report, we show that the evanescent portion of human voice can be amplified by setting an acoustic metamaterial in front of a microphone; thus, the signal to noise ratio can be enhanced remarkably. Such an effect is demonstrated through a double negative acoustic metamaterial slab with simultaneous negative density and bulk modulus induced by coexisting and coupled Helmholtz and Fabry-Perot resonances. This work provides a passive and physical means, rather than the traditional active and algorithmic method, to improve the quality of voice sound acquisition.

AB Obtaining the position of ego-vehicle is a crucial prerequisite for automatic control and path planning in the field of autonomous driving. Most existing positioning systems rely on GPS, RTK, or wireless signals, which are arduous to provide effective localization under weak signal conditions. This paper proposes a real-time positioning system based on the detection of the parking numbers as they are unique positioning marks in the parking lot scene. It does not only can help with the positioning with open area, but also run independently under isolation environment. The result tested on both public datasets and self-collected dataset show that the system outperforms others in both performances and applies in practice. In addition, the code and dataset will release later.

AB This work presents and compares several cooperative navigation solutions for formations of autonomous underwater vehicles, equipped with depth sensors and capable of taking bearing measurements to their neighbors under a certain measurement topology. Two approaches based on the extended Kalman filter are described, one centralized and the other decentralized, which has the advantage of requiring much less communication and computational complexity with minimal degradation of the produced estimates. Additionally, four other Kalman filter implementations, based on systems with linear dynamics using artificial measurements, are also described, one centralized and the remaining ones decentralized. The performance of these algorithms, under both acyclical and cyclical measurement topologies, is compared using Monte Carlo simulations, whereby both the mean error and root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of the computed navigation estimates are presented.

AB This article provides a comprehensive overview on cooperative control methods for waterborne transport. We first proposed a hierarchical architecture of cooperation in the waterborne transport systems. Three layers of cooperation are identified according to the range of communication and cooperation, i.e., the individual layer, the local layer, and the network layer. The individual layer is the basis layer where a controller controls the dynamics of an individual vessel. The local layer considers the vessel-to-vessel (V2V) and vessel-to-infrastructure (V2I) interactions. The network layer considers not only V2V and V2I interactions but also the interdependence of the interconnected infrastructures, i. e., infrastructure-to-infrastructure interactions. Existing research for cooperation at each layer is reviewed, and the main research gaps are provided.

DE Point cloud; multiple-object tracking; end-to-end; autonomous vehicles
AB Recent machine learning-based multi-object tracking (MOT) frameworks are becoming popular for 3-D point clouds. Most traditional tracking approaches use filters (e.g., Kalman filter or particle filter) to predict object locations in a time sequence, however, they are vulnerable to extreme motion conditions, such as sudden braking and turning. In this letter, we propose PointTrackNet, an end-to-end 3-D object detection and tracking network, to generate foreground masks, 3-D bounding boxes, and point-wise tracking association displacements for each detected object. The network merely takes as input two adjacent point-cloud frames. Experimental results on the KITTI tracking dataset show competitive results over the state-of-the-arts, especially in the irregularly and rapidly changing scenarios.

AB Curve tracking is a challenging and central problem in robotics. In this note, we study adaptive control and parameter estimation for two dimensional robotic curve tracking with unknown control gains. We build adaptive controllers that stabilize equilibria corresponding to a fixed constant distance to the curve and zero bearing. The significance of our work is in (a) our ability to identify the unknown control gain, (b) our proof of input-to-state stability with respect to actuator errors, and (c) the optimality of our disturbance bounds for maintaining robust forward invariance of a nested class of hexagons that fill the state space, under actuator disturbances and the unknown control gain. We demonstrate our work in simulations. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We call bi-steerable car a vehicle showing this kind of kinematics. Endowed with autonomy capacities, the bi-steerable car ought to combine suitably and safely a set of abilities: simultaneous localisation and environment modelling, motion planning and motion execution amidst moderately dynamic obstacles. In this paper we address the integration of these four essential autonomy abilities into a single application. Specifically, we aim at reactive execution of planned motion. We address the fusion of controls issued from the control law and the obstacle avoidance module using probabilistic techniques. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) have been recently applied in the field of mobile edge computing (MEC) to improve the data exchange environment by proactively changing the wireless channels through maneuverable location deployment and intelligent signals reflection, respectively. Nevertheless, they may suffer from inherent limitations, e.g., UAV's low endurance and RIS's finite coverage, which limit their wider applications. UAV-mounted RIS (U-RIS), as a promising integrated approach, can combine the advantages of UAV and RIS to break the limit. Inspired by this, we consider a novel U-RIS assisted MEC system, where a U-RIS is deployed to assist the communication between the ground users and an MEC server. The joint UAV trajectory, RIS passive beamforming and MEC resource allocation design is developed to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the system. To tackle the intractable non-convex problem, we divide it into two subproblems and solve them iteratively based on successive convex approximation (SCA) and the Dinkelbach method. Finally we obtain a high-performance suboptimal solution. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the energy efficiency of the MEC system.

AB An efficient clamshell-shaped inlet cover configuration based on a shockwave interference methodology is proposed, which has the advantage of an autonomous opening using the aerodynamic force and moment. A preliminary design method for the inlet cover is introduced and used to produce cover models of two different lengths, with contributions similar to those of cowlings, rocket fairings, shrouds, or false ogives. The clamshell-shaped inlet cover features a practical design with a wide range of applications, including utilization in air-breathing hypersonic vehicles under specific constraints. In this investigation, aerodynamic numerical simulations were conducted to evaluate the extent to which the objectives and design principles are achieved for two typical ballistic separation states. The results show that both configurations can prevent an excessive accumulation of shockwaves in the nose cone area. In addition, the inlet cover generates negative lift, which results in the generation of an opening moment. The calculated heat flux at the leading edge of the clamshell-shaped inlet cover is approximately 13 MW/m(2), which is within the limit of the composite material but slightly higher than that of the stagnation point of the nose cone.

AB Object detection has always attracted a lot of attention in computer vision due to its practical applications, i.e., robotics engineering, autonomous vehicles, and surveillance systems. Recently deep learning approaches have successfully improved the performance of object detection by a significant amount. However, there exist many challenging objects in the images that state-of-the-art approaches still fail to detect. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach that intentionally learns to detect the unseen (missing) objects. In particular, we utilize a dual-level of deep networks to efficiently detect difficult objects in images. The extensive experiments on three benchmarking datasets, PASCAL VOC, KITTI, and MS-COCO, show the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

ID BEAM
AB Interrogating an object with a light beam and analyzing the scattered light can reveal kinematic information about the object, which is vital for applications ranging from autonomous vehicles to gesture recognition and virtual reality. We show that by analyzing the change in the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of a tilted light beam eclipsed by a moving object, lateral motion of the object can be detected in an arbitrary direction using a single light beam and without object image reconstruction. We observe OAM spectral asymmetry that corresponds to the lateral motion direction along an arbitrary axis perpendicular to the plane containing the light beam and OAM measurement axes. These findings extend OAM-based remote sensing to detection of non-rotational qualities of objects and may also have extensions to other electromagnetic wave regimes, including radio and sound.

AB Motivated by the 2013 International UAV Innovation Grand Prix, we design and implement a real-time vision system for an unmanned helicopter autonomously transferring cargoes between two platforms. In the competition, four cargoes are initially placed inside four circles on one platform, respectively. They are required to be transferred one by one into the four circles on the other platform. This paper presents the core algorithms of the proposed vision system on ellipse detection, ellipse tracking, and single-circle-based position estimation. Experiments and the great success of our team in the competition have verified the efficiency, accuracy, and robustness of the algorithms. Our team was ranked first in the final round competition.

AB New guidance policies for the problem of low-thrust transfer between inclined orbits are developed within the framework of optimal control theory. The objectives of this guidance schemes are to provide appropriate thrust steering programmes that will transfer the vehicle from inclined low earth orbits to high earth orbits. The presented guidance schemes are determined by using optimal control theory such that two optimal performance measures are minimized. In this work, the independent variable is changed from time to thrust angle and some properties of autonomous system equations are considered to obtain the exact closed form solutions. Three states are considered, orbital inclination, velocity, and ascending node, to establish this dynamic system. Finally, two performances are investigated for new class of electrical propulsion plane change manoeuvres.

AB The goal of the activity On-ground Validation of Debris Removal Technologies, OECD, has been to investigate and mature the complex couplings between the different control systems (GNC including image processing and robotics) for autonomous rigid capture between an active chaser vehicle and a cooperative/non-cooperative target, and derive the required algorithms and perform a HW-in-the-loop end-to-end demonstration. The prototyped solution is tested in the most realistic conditions obtainable on ground, including also the dynamics of the system as well as the relative visual based navigation system. The on-ground validation and integration is performed taking advantage of the GMV platform-art (c) dynamic test facility located in Madrid, Spain, with the addition of the hardware provided by the partners: robotic system from CBK (Poland) and visual system from TSD (Italy).

AB This work discusses an innovative approach to imaging which can improve the robustness of existing active-range measurement methods and potentially enhance their use in a variety of outdoor applications. By merging a proven modulation technique from the domain of spread-spectrum communications with the bleeding-edge CMOS sensor technology, the prototype of the modulated range sensor is designed and evaluated. A suitable set of application-specific spreading codes is proposed, evaluated and tested on the prototype. Experimental results show that the introduced modulation technique significantly reduces the impacts of environmental factors such as sunlight and external light sources, as well as mutual interference of identical devices. The proposed approach can be considered as a promising basis for a new generation of robust and cost-efficient range-sensing solutions for automotive applications, autonomous vehicles or robots.

AB The contribution of this paper is a technique that in certain circumstances allows one to avoid the removal of dynamic shadows in the visible spectrum making use of images in the infrared spectrum. This technique emerged from a real problem concerning the autonomous navigation of a vehicle in a wind farm. In this environment, the dynamic shadows cast by the wind turbines' blades make it necessary to include a shadows removal stage in the preprocessing of the visible spectrum images in order to avoid the shadows being misclassified as obstacles. In the thermal images, dynamic shadows completely disappear, something that does not always occur in the visible spectrum, even when the preprocessing is executed. Thus, a fusion on thermal and visible bands is performed.

AB The partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) provides a principled general framework for robot planning under uncertainty. Leveraging the idea of Monte Carlo sampling, recent POMDP planning algorithms have scaled up to various challenging robotic tasks, including, real-time online planning for autonomous vehicles. To further improve online planning performance, this paper presents IS-DESPOT, which introduces importance sampling to DESPOT, a state-of-the-art sampling-based POMDP algorithm for planning under uncertainty. Importance sampling improves DESPOT's performance when there are critical, but rare events, which are difficult to sample. We prove that IS-DESPOT retains the theoretical guarantee of DESPOT. We demonstrate empirically that importance sampling significantly improves the performance of online POMDP planning for suitable tasks. We also present a general method for learning the importance sampling distribution.

ID 3D BAROCLINIC CIRCULATION; PLUME-SHELF SYSTEMS; CROSS-SCALE MODEL; OCEAN
AB We propose a novel method for constructing a pseudo-synoptic view of estuarine features from nonsynoptic observations captured by mobile platforms. The model-aided Lagrangian interpretation (MALI) method is based on relocating observations to a common reference moment in time along three-dimensional Lagrangian trajectories derived from a numerical model of estuarine circulation. The method relies on the model skill to capture large-scale circulation features, and on high-resolution in situ observations to characterize small-scale hydrographic structure. We demonstrate our technique by applying MALI to autonomous underwater vehicle observations in the Columbia River estuary, with the aid of a validated unstructured-grid finite-element numerical simulation. The method can be readily adapted to a broader range of environments, observational platforms, and model-data combinations.

DT Article
AB This paper examines various ways in which changes in ground reflectivity enhanced by using polarization diversity in millimeter-wave imaging radar can be used as an aid to guidance and navigation. The paper introduces the concept of a polarization scattering matrix and shows how the returns from a linearly polarized mirror scanned radar and an autonomous ground vehicle together can be exploited to provide novel ground images made at all polarizations. The paper introduces a number of polarization-sensitive calibration reflectors, including a novel modified Bruderhedral, which are used to quantify the polarization vector. It is shown that changes in the ground reflectivity of the radar images, as a function of polarization, can be used to classify the terrain in ways beyond that which can be achieved using static reflectivity contrast alone.

AB A novel variable field-of-view machine vision method was developed allowing an agricultural robot to navigate between rows in cornfields. The machine vision hardware consisted of a camera with pitch and yaw motion control. Guidance lines were detected using an image-processing algorithm, employing morphological features in a far, near and lateral field of view, and the robot was guided along these lines using fuzzy logic control.
   The method was tested while the vehicle successfully traveled through a distance of 30 m towards the end of a crop row in three replications. To evaluate the guidance performance, RTK-GPS data were collected, showing a maximum guidance error of 15.8 mm and stable navigational behavior. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This article considers the problem of directing a family of underactuated ships to formation tracking a set of closed orbits and achieve attitude synchronization. It shows that our previous concentric compression design can be extended to deal with a general kind of non-convex, closed curves and the coordinated motion of underactuated ships. The condition of nonzero total linear speed of each ship is ensured by a potential function. Under the bidirectional communication topology, asymptotical stabilization is proved with the help of the invariance-like theorem and the extension of Barbalat's lemma. Theoretical results are proved by the numerical examples. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This letter studies a UAV-assisted communication design where a rotary-wing UAV is launched to provide continuous coverage to mobile nodes. We aim to maximize the service time duration of the UAV by optimizing its three-dimensional (3D) trajectory while simultaneously ensuring adequate coverage to mobile nodes. Considering the limited energy available with the UAV, we frame an equivalent energy consumption minimization problem. Though the formulated problem is non-convex, it is shown that it is pseudoconvex under horizontal and vertical UAV coordinates. Based on this observation, we use alternating optimization to solve the problem. Numerical results provide trajectory insight and compare the service duration to the mobile nodes with different schemes.

AB This study aims to solve the problem of sparse reward and local convergence when using a reinforcement learning algorithm as the controller of an AUV. Based on the generative adversarial imitation (GAIL) algorithm combined with a multi-agent, a multi-agent GAIL (MAG) algorithm is proposed. The GAIL enables the AUV to directly learn from expert demonstrations, overcoming the difficulty of slow initial training of the network. Parallel training of multi-agents reduces the high correlation between samples to avoid local convergence. In addition, a reward function is designed to help training. Finally, the results show that in the unity simulation platform test, the proposed algorithm has a strong optimal decision-making ability in the tracking process.

AB Laser-based range measurement systems are important in many application areas, including autonomous vehicles, robotics, manufacturing, formation flying of satellites, and basic science. Coherent laser ranging systems using dual-frequency combs provide an unprecedented combination of long range, high precision, and fast update rate. We report dual-comb distance measurement using chip-based soliton microcombs. A single pump laser was used to generate dual-frequency combs within a single microresonator as counterpropagating solitons. We demonstrated time-of-flight measurement with 200-nanometer precision at an averaging time of 500 milliseconds within a range ambiguity of 16 millimeters. Measurements at distances up to 25 meters with much lower precision were also performed. Our chip-based source is an important step toward miniature dual-comb laser ranging systems that are suitable for photonic integration.

AB Consideration was given to the problem of control of the longitudinal motion of the amphibious aeroplane descending with prescribed velocity, altitude, and pitch angle under incomplete measurements and exogenous disturbances. Decomposition methods of designing the system for tracking the output variables with stabilization of the tracking errors invariantly in asymptotics to the exogenous disturbances were developed within the framework of the block approach. The problem of acquiring current information about the unmeasurable internal and exogenous variables was solved comprehensively using the state observers in sliding modes which are constructed on the basis of the control plant model with closed local bonds represented in terms of the tracking errors. Realization of this approach does without a detailed dynamic control plant model and its extension by the autonomous dynamic models of the exogenous actions, which simplifies substantially the controller structure.

AB A biplane quadrotor (hybrid vehicle) benefits from rotary-wing and fixed-wing structures. We design a dual observer-based autonomous trajectory tracking controller for the biplane quadrotor. Extended state observer (ESO) is designed for the state estimation, and based on this estimation, a Backstepping controller (BSC), Integral Terminal Sliding Mode Controller (ITSMC), and Hybrid Controller (HC) that is a combination of ITSMC + BSC are designed for the trajectory tracking. Further, a Nonlinear disturbance observer (DO) is designed and combined with ESO based controller to estimate external disturbances. In this simulation study, These ESO-based controllers with and without DO are applied for trajectory tracking, and results are evaluated. An ESO-based Adaptive Backstepping Controller (ABSC) and Adaptive Hybrid controller (AHC) with DO are designed, and performance is evaluated to handle the mass change during the flight despite wind gusts. Simulation results reveal the effectiveness of ESO-based HC with DO compared to ESO-based BSC and ITSMC with DO. Furthermore, an ESO-based AHC with DO is more efficient than an ESO-based ABSC with DO.

AB Localization of ground mobile robots in orchards is a complex problem which is yet to be fully addressed. The typical localization approaches are not adjusted to the characteristics of the orchard environment, especially the homogeneous scenery. To alleviate these difficulties, we propose to use top-view images of the orchard acquired in real-time. The top-view observation of the orchard provides a unique signature of every tree formed by the shape of its canopy. This practically changes the homogeneity premise in orchards and paves the way for addressing the kidnapped robot problem. Using computer vision techniques, we build a virtual canopies laser scan around the ground robot which is generated from low-altitude top-view video streams. We apply Monte Carlo Localization on this virtual scan to localize the robot against a high-altitude top-view snapshot image which is used as a map. The suggested approach is examined in numerous offline experiments conducted on data acquired in real orchards and is compared against a typical simulated approach which relies on ground-level trunk observations. The canopy-based approach demonstrated better performance in all measures, including convergence to centimeter-level accuracy.

AB Road detection is a crucial research topic in computer vision, especially in the framework of autonomous driving and driver assistance. Moreover, it is an invaluable step for other tasks such as collision warning, vehicle detection, and pedestrian detection. Nevertheless, road detection remains challenging due to the presence of continuously changing backgrounds, varying illumination (shadows and highlights), variability of road appearance (size, shape, and color), and differently shaped objects (lane markings, vehicles, and pedestrians). In this paper, we propose an algorithm fusing appearance and prior cues for road detection. Firstly, input images are preprocessed by simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC), morphological processing, and illuminant invariant transformation to get superpixels and remove lane markings, shadows, and highlights. Then, we design a novel seed superpixels selection method and model appearance cues using the Gaussian mixture model with the selected seed superpixels. Next, we propose to construct a road geometric prior model offline, which can provide statistical descriptions and relevant information to infer the location of the road surface. Finally, a Bayesian framework is used to fuse appearance and prior cues. Experiments are carried out on the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute (KITTI) road benchmark where the proposed algorithm shows compelling performance and achieves state-of-the-art results among the model-based methods.

TI Passive Sensor Evaluation for Unmanned Ground Vehicle Mud Detection
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

DT Article
ID SOIL-MOISTURE
AB Detecting mud hazards is a significant challenge to unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) autonomous off-road navigation. A military UGV stuck in a body of mud during a mission may need to be sacrificed or rescued, both unattractive options. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is currently developing a daytime mud detection capability under the U.S. Army Research Laboratory Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliances program using UGV-mounted sensors. To perform robust mud detection under all conditions, we expect that multiple sensors will be necessary. A passive mud detection solution is desirable to meet future combat system requirements. To characterize the advantages and disadvantages of candidate passive sensors, outdoor data collections have been performed on wet and dry soil using visible, multispectral (including near-infrared), shortwave infrared, midwave infrared, long-wave infrared, polarization, and stereo sensors. In this paper, we examine the cues for mud detection that each of these sensors provide, along with their deficiencies, and we illustrate localizing detected mud in a world model that can used by a UGV to plan safe paths. We mostly limit our examination to mud detection during the daytime under ideal conditions: isolated wet soil surrounded by dry soil during nominal weather, i.e., no precipitation, calm wind, and near-average temperatures.

AB Within the present industrial society, some of the greatest challenges of humanity are related to achieving a sustainable industrial metabolism, which integrates technical activity and ecological systems. Electric traction drive systems using induction motors fed by variable voltage variable frequency (VVVF) inverters have provided high performance for urban electric trains. Moreover, power converter technology based on advanced techniques in control electronics and efficient anti-slip systems allows optimum traction characteristics and minimum energy consumption. For underground electric trains, however, it is also important to assess the environmental impact of braking. From the viewpoint of exergy and environment, the braking regime, particularly electric braking, is a special aspect of non-autonomous vehicles using electric traction. As electric drive systems are used with VVVF inverters and traction induction motors, these machines with appropriate controls can realize both traction and electric braking regimes for electric traction vehicles. Concerns regarding mechanical braking are associated with unrecovered energy and material utilization. Also, for underground electric trains during mechanical braking, the abnormal but frequent situation involving the unequal charge of the traction induction motors is a concern. These aspects of underground electric trains are analysed in this article so as to assist in improving performance.

AB Software-intensive systems in most domains, from autonomous vehicles to health, are becoming predominantly parallel to efficiently manage large amount of data in short (even real-) time. There is an incredibly rich literature on languages for parallel computing, thus it is difficult for researchers and practitioners, even experienced in this very field, to get a grasp on them. With this work we provide a comprehensive, structured, and detailed snapshot of documented research on those languages to identify trends, technical characteristics, open challenges, and research directions. In this article, we report on planning, execution, and results of our systematic peer-reviewed as well as grey literature review, which aimed at providing such a snapshot by analysing 225 studies.

AB Due to the increasing demand for autonomous driving, cyber-attacks detection nowadays receives significant attention. Among several different types of attacks, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks can consume resources and cause the system under attack to stop responding, which can be considered a time delay model affecting the response of the attacked system. To detect the possible DoS attacks in Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control platoon model, an adaptive observer design is proposed in this paper, where the time delay caused by DoS attacks can be fast and accurately estimated. To highlight the performance of the proposed adaptive observer, numerical simulations are applied and the performance is compared against the sliding mode observer in terms of the DoS attack time delay estimation convergence and accuracy.

AB This paper addresses the cooperative control problem of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAV) systems. First, a new distributed consensus algorithm for second-order nonlinear multi-agent systems (MAS) is formulated under the leader-following approach. The algorithm provides smooth input signals to the agents' control channels, which avoids the chattering effect generated by the conventional sliding mode-based control protocols. Second, a new formation control scheme is developed by integrating smooth distributed consensus control protocols into the geometric pattern model to achieve three-dimensional formation tracking. The Lyapunov theory is used to prove the stability and convergence of both distributed consensus and formation controllers. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated through simulation results.

AB Prediction of the likely evolution of traffic scenes is a challenging task because of high uncertainties from sensing technology and the dynamic environment. It leads to failure of motion planning for intelligent agents like autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a fluid-inspired model to estimate collision risk in road scenes. Multi-object states are detected and tracked, and then a stable fluid model is adopted to construct the risk field. Objects' state spaces are used as the boundary conditions in the simulation of advection and diffusion processes. We have evaluated our approach on the public KITTI dataset; our model can provide predictions in the cases of misdetection and tracking error caused by occlusion. It proves a promising approach for collision risk assessment in road scenes.

This approach is definitely suitable for landing within the global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-denied environments. As for applications, the deployed guidance system makes full use of the ground computing resource and feedbacks the aircraft's real-time localization to its on-board autopilot. Under such circumstances, a separate long baseline stereo architecture is proposed to possess an extendable baseline and wide-angle field of view (FOV) against the traditional fixed baseline schemes. Furthermore, accuracy evaluation of the new type of architecture is conducted by theoretical modeling and computational analysis. Dataset-driven experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed approach.

AB This paper presents a variable resolution framework for autonomously searching stationary targets in a bounded area. Theoretical formulations are also described for using a probabilistic quadtree data structure, which incorporates imperfect Bayesian (false positive and false negative) detections and informs the searcher's route based on optimizing information gain. Live-fly field experimentation results using a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle validate the proposed methodologies and demonstrate an integrated system with autonomous control and embedded object detection for probabilistic search in realistic operational settings. Lessons learned from these field trials include characterization of altitude-dependent detection performance, and we also present a benchmark data set of outdoor aerial imagery for search and detection applications.

AB Driven by the success of machine learning algorithms for recognizing and identifying objects, there are significant efforts to exploit convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in edge devices. The growing adoption of CNNs in safety-critical embedded systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles) increases the demand for safe and reliable models. In this sense, this brief investigates the soft error reliability of two CNN inference models considering single event upsets (SEUs) occurring in register files, RAM, and Flash memory sections. The results show that the incidence of SEUs in flash memory sections tend to lead to more critical faults than those resulting from the occurrence of bit-flips in RAM sections and register files.

AB Understanding and modeling human driver behavior is crucial for advanced vehicle development. However, unique driving styles, inconsistent behavior, and complex decision processes render it a challenging task, and existing approaches often lack variability or robustness. To approach this problem, we propose Probabilistic Modeling of Driver behavior, a modular framework which splits the task of driver behavior modeling into multiple modules. A global target trajectory distribution is learned with Probabilistic Movement Primitives, clothoids are utilized for local path generation, and the corresponding choice of actions is performed by a neural network. Experiments in a simulated car racing setting show considerable advantages in imitation accuracy and robustness compared to other imitation learning algorithms. The modular architecture of the proposed framework facilitates straightforward extensibility in driving line adaptation and sequencing of multiple movement primitives for future research.

AB The design, control, and implementation of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for collecting hydrological information from plateau rivers and lakes are presented in this paper. The hardware and software structures of the control system were previously described. A novel sliding mode controller (SMC) with combinational reaching law of vertical hovering motion is proposed to improve the robustness and stability. The S-plane control, a nonlinear controller with little parameters, is used in the horizontal motion. Besides, the navigation strategy based on the dead-reckoning algorithm, a path tracking based on the light-of-sight (LOS) algorithm, and a control allocation strategy considering saturation are present. Finally, experiments were performed in a tank and in a river in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to prove the feasibility and reliability of the AUV system.

AB An ad hoc distributed dynamic data-driven simulation is a collection of autonomous online simulations brought together to model an operational system. They offer the potential of increased accuracy, responsiveness, and robustness compared to centralized approaches. They differ from conventional distributed simulations in that they are created bottom-up rather than top-down. They combine concepts from conventional distributed simulations and replicated trials, raising new issues in data management and synchronization. In this article, the ad hoc simulation approach and an optimistic synchronization algorithm are proposed. A prototype coupling in-vehicle transportation simulation is evaluated and shown to yield results comparable to a traditional replicated experiment for the tested scenarios. Experiences applying this concept to a commercial transportation simulator in an emergency scenario are described.

A flying agent (aircraft-type quadcopter) has been designed and developed for steering control along a planned trajectory. A novel control scheme is developed using MATLAB/Simulink to ensure the right balance among pitch, roll and yaw of the flying agent wings. The proposed control scheme utilises a PID controller which regulates the error dynamics to stabilise the navigation. Various trajectories have been generated and verified through simulation studies as well as tested in a real model. The real-time experiments verify the manoeuvrability of the controller, which also checks the compatibility with hardware interfaces.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB Automatic scene understanding from multimodal data is a key task in the design of fully autonomous vehicles. The theory of belief functions has proved effective for fusing information from several sensors at the superpixel level. Here, we propose a novel framework, called evidential grammars, which extends stochastic grammars by replacing probabilities by belief functions. This framework allows us to fuse local information with prior and contextual information, also modeled as belief functions. The use of belief functions in a compositional model is shown to allow for better representation of the uncertainty on the priors and for greater flexibility of the model. The relevance of our approach is demonstrated on multi-modal traffic scene data from the KITTI benchmark suite. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a high-availability data collection scheme based on multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) (HAMA) is proposed to improve the performance of the sensor network and guarantee the high availability of the data collection service. Multi-AUVs move in the network and their trajectory is predefined. The nodes near the trajectory of an AUV directly send their data to the AUV while the others transmit data to nodes that are closer to the trajectory. Malfunction discovery and repair mechanisms are applied to ensure that the network operates appropriately when an AUV fails to communicate with the nodes while collecting data. Compared with existing methods, the proposed HAMA method increases the packet delivery ratio and the network lifetime.

AB This paper presents a new approach to the problem of tracking objects in sequences of forward-looking sonar images. Unlike previous work, navigational data are taken as inputs to the state model of the Kalman filter used for tracking fixed obstacles. This model allows a robust prediction of their apparent motion in relation to the position of the sonar. A complete framework is presented where detection and data association issues are also discussed. An assessment of the proposed method has been carried out on real data from two different systems. Moreover, whereas the state model was first derived for a ground obstacle, a modified state model is proposed to estimate the altitude of the obstacle in relation to the sonar position using a number of successive pings.

AB The Segway Human Transport (HT) is a one person dynamically self-balancing transportation vehicle. The Segway Robot Mobility Platform (RMP) is a modification of the HT capable of being commanded by a computer for autonomous operation. With these platforms, we propose a new domain for human-robot coordination through a competitive game: Segway Soccer. The players include robots (RMPs) and humans (riding HTs). The rules of the game are a combination of soccer and Ultimate Frisbee rules. In this paper, we provide three contributions. First, we describe our proposed Segway Soccer domain. Second, we examine the capabilities and limitations of the Segway and the mechanical systems necessary to create a robot Segway Soccer Player. Third, we provide a detailed analysis of several ball manipulation/kicking systems and the implementation results of the CM-RMP pneumatic ball manipulation system.

AB The direction and eternal theme of the automotive industry's sustainable development is protection of the environment, energy efficiency, and safety. Especially the traffic accidents, the world's energy shortages and the increasingly deteriorating environment are particularly important today. Especially in current era, because of the dual pressures of energy and the environment, various forms of electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming the focus of global automotive industry. This paper presents a significant method of road recognition method. The key control is to have the option to precisely recognize the ideal slip rate and current street surface attachment coefficient to control the wheel slip. By utilizing the Burckhardt strategy, the slant change of the bend could sort out the ideal slip rate and pinnacle attachment coefficient of street surface distinguishing proof examination is generally utilized in steadiness control of EV. On road tests, the road conditions are very complicated. It is necessary to take identify methods with strong robustness. Therefore, it is an important method to use fuzzy technique with good robustness to recognize optimal slip rate (OSR). The fuzzy road recognition algorithm could identify the friction co- efficient and the OSR superiorly.

AB The paper presents an analytical model for travel time evaluation in double-deep, triple-deep, quadruple-deep and fivefold-deep tier-captive shuttle-based storage and retrieval system (SBS/RS). Under the assumption of the deepest location rule for the storage process and the nearest neighbour rule for the retrieval process, the expressions for single-command and dual-command cycle times of the shuttle vehicle and elevator are developed, from which the SBS/RS performance can be estimated. The model based on the probability theory enables the evaluation of all individual times that make up the cycle times and assessment of the average number of totes relocated during a retrieval process. Special attention is devoted to the modelling of the relocation of totes which block access to the requested tote during the retrieval process. The validity of the analytical model is examined via the developed simulation model. The given case study shows that the proposed analytical travel time model results match the results of the simulation model. The presented modelling strategy could be applied to bigger system racking depths following the same modelling logic.

AB The edge computing paradigm has opened new opportunities for IoT devices, which can be used in novel applications involving heavy processing of data. Typical and common examples of IoT devices are the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which are deployed for surveillance and environmental monitoring and are attracting increasing attention because of their ease deployment. However, their limited capacity, e.g., battery, forces the design of an edge-assisted solution, where heavy tasks are offloaded to the edge cloud. To solve the problem of task offloading from UAV to the closest edge computation, many proposals have appeared, mainly based on a Reinforcement Learning (RL) formulation. While these solutions successfully learn how to reduce task completion time in the UAV context, some limitations appear when these models are applied in real scenarios, given the memory-hungry nature of RL. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective formalization that still enables a learning process, but reduces the required information and the training time. Our evaluation results confirm our hypothesis, showing a marked improvement when compared to other RL-based strategies and deep learning-based solutions.

AB In this work, we have successfully developed a data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) inverse problem solution for traffic collision reconstruction. In specific, we have developed and implemented a machine learning computational algorithm and built a deep neural network to determine and identify the initial impact conditions of car crash based on its final material damage state and permanently deformed structure configuration (wreckage). In this work, we have demonstrated that the developed machine learning algorithm as an inverse problem solver can accurately identify initial collision conditions in an inverse manner, which are practically unique if we use permanent plastic deformation as the forensic data signatures. In other words, we think that the massive plastic energy dissipation process and the related big data will make final structure damage state insensitive to the initial car collision conditions. Thus, it provides an inverse solution for car crash forensic analysis by reconstructing the initial failure load parameters and conditions based on the permanent plastic deformation distribution of cars. This approach has general significance in solving the inverse problem for engineering failure analysis and vehicle crashworthiness analysis, which provides a key contribution for the unmanned autonomous vehicle and the related technology.

AB Vehicle detection and classification is an important task for street surveillance and scene perception for robot navigation or autonomous vehicles. This research work focuses on traffic detection for real time applications using three components. The first component includes designing convolutional feature map based classifier based on multimodal optical flow features. The second component is to utilize an effective adaptive learning rate technique to deal with saddle points; and to propose an average covariance matrix based pre-conditioning approach. The third component is to separately train multimodal model using blur data which caters blur effect of real time data. Extensive experimental results with different learning rates, architectures are reported using benchmark datasets such as Apollo, KITTI, Cityscapes, Berkeley, Caltech, PASCAL VOC and self created. Experimental results demonstrate that in comparison to fully connected network based classifier, Network on Convolutional (NoC) feature map classifier provided approximately 10% hike in classification accuracy without data per-processing, and almost 18% improvement with pre-processed data. The blur model enhances accuracy by almost 15% on blurred data as compared to normal RGB data. Moreover, multimodal features provide 12% and 2% higher accuracy while using standard classifiers and NoC classifiers respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID FAILURE-DETECTION; SYSTEM-IDENTIFICATION; VALIDATION
AB Reliability is a critical issue in navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) since there is no human pilot that can react to any abnormal situation. Due to size and cost limitations, redundant sensor schemes and aeronautical-grade navigation sensors used in large aircrafts cannot be installed in small UAVs. Therefore, other approaches like analytical redundancy should be used to detect faults in navigation sensors and increase reliability. This paper presents a sensor fault detection and diagnosis system for small autonomous helicopters based on analytical redundancy. Fault detection is accomplished by evaluating any significant change in the behaviour of the vehicle with respect to the fault-free behaviour, which is estimated by using an observer. The observer is obtained from input-output experimental data with the Observer/Kalman Filter Identification (OKID) method. The OKID method is able to identify the system and an observer with properties similar to a Kalman filter, directly from input-output experimental data. Results are similar to the Kalman filter, but, with the proposed method, there is no need to estimate neither system matrices nor sensor and process noise covariance matrices. The system has been tested with real helicopter flight data, and the results compared with other methods.

AB In this paper, we propose a global navigation function applied to model predictive control (MPC) for autonomous mobile robots, with application to warehouse automation. The approach considers static and dynamic obstacles and generates smooth, collision-free trajectories. The navigation function is based on a potential field derived from an E* graph search algorithm on a discrete occupancy grid and by bicubic interpolation. It has convergent behavior from anywhere to the target and is computed in advance to increase computational efficiency. The novel optimization strategy used in MPC combines a discrete set of velocity candidates with randomly perturbed candidates from particle swarm optimization. Adaptive horizon length is used to improve performance. The efficiency of the proposed approaches is validated using simulations and experimental results.

AB Automatic sea-surface object detection and tracking for safe autonomous underwater vehicle and submarine surfacing is a critical issue in relation to the accidents reported in the last decades. Here, we propose an efficient tool to detect and track sea-surface obstacles by processing forward-looking sonar images. The proposed method can detect either still or moving objects with and without wake. For each image sequence, a sequential procedure is proposed to detect various obstacle signatures. Then, target positions and velocities are estimated in Cartesian coordinates using the debiased converted measurement Kalman filter and the joint probabilistic data association filter. Detection and tracking stages exchange information in order to reduce the number of false alarms. Promising results are obtained using real data collected at sea with various objects and scenarios.

AB An artificial hair cell sensor is the current technology based on a biological inspiration and is widely used in underwater applications including the glider, robotic and autonomous surface vehicle. These papers discuss a few strategies in relation to the principles of sensing, fabrication, performance, and preliminary measurement data. The MEMS flow sensor is generally needed to replace existing commercial sensors that are inadequate for some applications. Material also provides some advantages to the hair cell sensor. Some materials such as Polydimethylsilaxone and Polyurethane have been investigated. The sensing element is reviewed including the doped piezoresistors, strain gauge and force sensitive resistors. Performance and result of each design will be presented briefly. Finally, the importance and the need for modeling, simulation and experiments will be reviewed based on the latest achievements on that particular research area.

DT Article
AB A space mission consists of more than just a spacecraft and scientific instruments. It also includes a ground system to support communications, command and telemetry processing and archiving, a mission operations team, and a launch vehicle. Before launch, all of these elements must be tested together in an integrated fashion. The Mission System Engineer is the chief architect of this system, is responsible for all technical aspects of the entire system, and directs trade studies to determine the partitioning of functions among subsystems and elements of the entire system. The TIMED mission and system were designed around a concept of low-cost mission operations. This concept was realized through the creation of a highly autonomous spacecraft, instrument operations that are decoupled from spacecraft operations, and payload (instrument) operations centers that are geographically distributed and connected through the Internet.

ID LENS
AB A broad range of imaging and sensing technologies in the infrared require large field-of-view (FoV) operation. To achieve this, traditional refractive systems often employ multiple elements to compensate for aberrations, which leads to excess size, weight, and cost. For many applications, including night vision eye-wear, air-borne surveillance, and autonomous navigation for unmanned aerial vehicles, size and weight are highly constrained. Sub-wavelength diffractive optics, also known as meta-optics, can dramatically reduce the size, weight, and cost of these imaging systems, as meta-optics are significantly thinner and lighter than traditional refractive lenses. Here, we demonstrate 80 degrees FoV thermal imaging in the long-wavelength infrared regime (8-12 & mu;m) using an all-silicon meta-optic with an entrance aperture and lens focal length of 1 cm. & COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group

AB Self-driving cars currently face a lot of technological problems that need to be solved before the cars can be widely used. However, they also face ethical problems, among which the question of crash-optimization algorithms is most prominently discussed. Reviewing current debates about whether we should use the ethics of the Trolley Dilemma as a guide towards designing self-driving cars will provide us with insights about what exactly ethical research does. It will result in the view that although we need the ethics of the Trolley Dilemma as important input for self-driving cars, the route towards simply implementing it into automated cars is blocked.

SO SCIENCE

DT Article
ID HEARING; BEHAVIOR
AB Some flying animals use active sensing to perceive and avoid obstacles. Nocturnal mosquitoes exhibit a behavioral response to divert away from surfaces when vision is unavailable, indicating a short-range, mechanosensory collision-avoidance mechanism. We suggest that this behavior is mediated by perceiving modulations of their self-induced airflow patterns as they enter a ground or wall effect. We used computational fluid dynamics simulations of low-altitude and near-wall flights based on in vivo high-speed kinematic measurements to quantify changes in the self-generated pressure and velocity cues at the sensitive mechanosensory antennae. We validated the principle that encoding aerodynamic information can enable collision avoidance by developing a quadcopter with a sensory system inspired by the mosquito. Such low-power sensing systems have major potential for future use in safer rotorcraft control systems.

AB In this paper, we look into the dynamic motion planning and control of an unmanned aerial vehicle, namely, the quadrotor, governed by its dynamical equations. It is shown for the first time that the Direct or the Second Method of Lyapunov is an effective tool to derive a set of continuous nonlinear control laws that not only provide smooth trajectories from a designated initial position to a designated target, but also continuously minimise the roll and pitch of the quadrotor en route to its targets. The latter successfully addresses the challenging problem of a quadrotor autonomously transporting valuable and fragile payloads safely to the designated target. Computer simulations are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control laws.

We are interested to realize a comparative analysis of such methodologies in order to know what controller has a better performance when they are used to the autonomous flight (altitude, yaw and roll) of a fixed-wing UAV. The designed controllers are: Backstepping, Sliding Mode control (SMC), Backstepping with Sliding Mode control, Backstepping with two Sliding Mode control, and Backstepping with high order Sliding Mode (HOSM) control. Simulation results are obtained in order to analyze the controllers performance. We finally present an experimental result, in open-loop, with the purpose of validate the magnitude of the control signals obtained in the simulations.

AB The Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) is one of three science instruments on the Spitzer Space Telescope. The IRS comprises four separate spectrograph modules covering the wavelength range from 5.3 to 38 mum with spectral resolutions, R = lambda/Deltalambda approximate to 90 and 600, and it was optimized to take full advantage of the very low background in the space environment. The IRS is performing at or better than the prelaunch predictions. An autonomous target acquisition capability enables the IRS to locate the mid-infrared centroid of a source, providing the information so that the spacecraft can accurately offset that centroid to a selected slit. This feature is particularly useful when taking spectra of sources with poorly known coordinates. An automated data-reduction pipeline has been developed at the Spitzer Science Center.

AB In this paper, a nonlinear controller for tracking a desired trajectory for an underactuated hovercraft is considered. It is a modification of a method known from the literature. However, the control algorithm considered here has two important features that differ from the mentioned control strategy. First, it concerns the case when the center of mass does not coincide with the geometric center, which results in additional forces and moments of force. The lack of symmetry causes the original trajectory tracking method not to take this fact into account, while the proposed approach is a generalization of the known concept. Here, a diagonalization of the inertia matrix has been applied, by means of a velocity transformation, which made it possible to reduce the symmetric matrix to a diagonal form. Secondly, the transformed quasi-velocity equations of motion allow some insight into the dynamics of the vehicle as it moves, which was not shown in the source work. The offered approach was verified by numerical tests for a hovercraft model with three DOF and for two desired trajectories. The method can be useful in preliminary simulation studies at the controller selection stage without experimental validation.

AB Employing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) characterized by low cost, high maneuverability, and on-demand deployment as aerial base stations (BSs) of Internet of Things (IoT) can guarantee communication performance in the absence of terrestrial BSs. However, the limited energy budget of UAV constrains its development. In this paper, a dual-UAV-assisted IoT using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is proposed to improve IoT capacity. To reduce energy consumption of the UAVs while ensuring a certain throughput, a joint resource optimization problem of communication scheduling, transmit power and motion parameters of UAVs is formulated to maximize energy efficiency of UAVs. To solve the proposed non-convex optimization problem, we present an alternating iterative optimization algorithm to alternately optimize three sub-problems: communication scheduling optimization, UAV transmit power optimization and UAV motion parameters optimization, each of which can be converted into convex optimization and solved using Lagrange multiplier method, subgradient descent method and successive convex approximation (SCA). The numerical results show that optimizing UAV motion parameters can effectively improve energy efficiency of UAVs, and the proposed dual-NOMA-UAV assisted IoT can achieve higher energy efficiency than the orthogonal multiple access (OMA)-UAV assisted IoT.

AB The adoption of abundant millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum offers higher capacity for short-range connectivity in various Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-centric communications scenarios. In contrast to the conventional cellular paradigm, where the coordination of connected nodes is highly centralized, the distributed deployments, such as those operating over unlicensed frequency bands, maintain robust interactions in the absence of central control. These agile decentralized systems are being naturally created by dynamic UAV swarms that form a temporary 3D structure without reliance on remote management or pre-established network infrastructures. While much effort has been invested in the performance assessment of distributed, directional, and 3D systems individually, a combination of these three angles allows capturing more realistic UAV swarm scenarios and produces a novel research perspective. This work addresses one of the fundamental challenges in mmWave-based 3D networks- directional deafness- which is known to adversely affect the overall system performance. Particularly, we develop a mathematical framework by taking into account the peculiarities of 3D directional and distributed deployments. We provide a holistic analytical assessment of directional deafness and propose several powerful approximations that capture realistic antenna patterns.

AB Pedestrian fatalities and injuries most likely occur in vehicle-pedestrian crashes. Meanwhile, engineers have tried to reduce the problems by developing a pedestrian detection function in Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles. However, the system is still not perfect. A remaining problem in pedestrian detection is the performance reduction at nighttime, although pedestrian detection should work well regardless of lighting conditions. This study presents an evaluation of pedestrian detection performance in different lighting conditions, then proposes to adopt multispectral image and deep neural network to improve the detection accuracy. In the evaluation, different image sources including RGB, thermal, and multispectral format are compared for the performance of the pedestrian detection. In addition, the optimizations of the architecture of the deep neural network are performed to achieve high accuracy and short processing time in the pedestrian detection task. The result implies that using multispectral images is the best solution for pedestrian detection at different lighting conditions. The proposed deep neural network accomplishes a 6.9% improvement in pedestrian detection accuracy compared to the baseline method. Moreover, the optimization for processing time indicates that it is possible to reduce 22.76% processing time by only sacrificing 2% detection accuracy.

ID OPPORTUNISTIC SPECTRUM ACCESS; VEHICLE
AB As a result of rapid development in electronics and communication technology, large-scale unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are harnessed for various promising applications in a coordinated manner. Although it poses numerous advantages, resource management among various domains in large-scale UAV communication networks is the key challenge to be solved urgently. Specifically, due to the inherent requirements and future development trend, distributed resource management is suitable. In this article, we investigate the resource management problem for large-scale UAV communication networks from game-theoretic perspective which are exactly coincident with the distributed and autonomous manner. By exploring the inherent features, the distinctive challenges are discussed. Then, we explore several gametheoretic models that not only combat the challenges but also have broad application prospects. We provide the basics of each game-theoretic model and discuss the potential applications for resource management in large-scale UAV communication networks. Specifically, mean-field game, graphical game, Stackelberg game, coalition game and potential game are included. After that, we propose two innovative case studies to highlight the feasibility of such novel game-theoretic models. Finally, we give some future research directions to shed light on future opportunities and applications.

DE Robotic weed control; unmanned ground vehicles; specialty crops
AB Specialty crop herbicides are not a target for herbicide discovery programs, and many of these crops do not have access to relevant herbicides. High-value fruit and vegetable crops represent high potential liability in the case of herbicide-induced crop damage and low acres for revenue. Labour shortages and higher manual weeding costs are an issue for both conventional and organic specialty crop growers. Robotic weeders are promising new weed control tools for specialty crops because they are cheaper to develop and, with fewer environmental and human health risks, are less regulated than herbicides. However, many of the robotic weeders are too expensive for small growers to use. In the future, greater investment into robotic weeders for small-scale growers will be important. The Clearpath robotics platform Husky may provide a cheap and autonomous way to control weeds in small diversified specialty crop farms. Being able to work autonomously in multiple soil moisture environments is the driving factor behind optimizing the Husky platform for weed control. Research has been conducted to evaluate the impact of soil moisture and mechanical actuator on mobility and weed control. Though weed control was not conunercially acceptable in these studies, future optimizations to the Husky robotics platform can achieve commercial success.

AB Control over water usage for irrigation purposes is a key factor in order to achieve the sustainability in agriculture. The irrigation of urban lawns represents a high percentage of the urban water usage. The use of information and communication technology (ICT) offers the possibility of monitoring the grass state in order to adjust the irrigation regime. In this paper, we propose an Arduino-based system with a camera set on a drone. The drone flies along the garden taking pictures of the grass. Those pictures are processed with a rule-based algorithm that classifies them according to the grass quality. Pictures can be tagged in three categories: high coverage, low coverage, or very low coverage. After designing our algorithm, twelve pictures are used to verify its correct operation. The results show a 100% hit rate. To analyze the suitability of using drones to perform this task, we carried out a comparative study for gardens with different sizes, where the drone and a similar system mounted on a small autonomous vehicle have been used. The results show that, for gardens bigger than 1000 m(2), the use of drone is needed due to the time consumed by the vehicle to cover the entire surface. Finally, we show the results of sending the image information after processing it in different manners.

   Heterogeneous Platforms
AB Sensor networks are being used to implement different types of sophisticated emerging applications, such as those aimed at supporting ambient intelligence and surveillance systems. This usage is enhanced by employing sensors with different characteristics in terms of sensing, computing and mobility capabilities, working cooperatively in the network. However, the design and deployment of these heterogeneous systems present several issues that have to be handled in order to meet the user expectations. The main problems are related to the nodes' interoperability and the overall resource allocation, both inter and intra nodes. The first problem requires a common platform that abstracts the nodes' heterogeneity and provides a smooth communication, while the second is handled by cooperation mechanisms supported by the platform. Moreover, as the nodes are supposed to be heterogeneous, a customizable platform is required to support both resource rich and poorer nodes. This paper analyses surveillance systems based on a heterogeneous sensor network, which is composed by low-end ground sensor nodes and autonomous aerial robots, i.e. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), carrying different kinds of sensors. The approach proposed in this work tackles the two above mentioned problems by using a customizable hardware platform and a middleware to support interoperability. Experimental results are also provided.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies are actively used for purposes of cyber defense. With the passage of time and with decreasing complexity in implementing AI-based solutions, the usage of AI-based technologies for offensive purposes has begun to appear in the world. These attacks vary from tampering with medical images using adversarial machine learning for false identification of cancer to the generation of adversarial traffic signals for influencing the safety of autonomous vehicles. In this research, we investigated recent cyberattacks that utilize AI-based techniques and identified various mitigation strategies that are helpful in handling such attacks. Further, we identified existing methods and techniques that are used in executing AI based cyberattacks and what probable future scenarios will be plausible to control such attacks by identifying existing trends in AI-based cyberattacks.

AB The Deepwater Horizon blowout is the largest offshore oil spill in history. We present results from a subsurface hydrocarbon survey using an autonomous underwater vehicle and a ship-cabled sampler. Our findings indicate the presence of a continuous plume of oil, more than 35 kilometers in length, at approximately 1100 meters depth that persisted for months without substantial biodegradation. Samples collected from within the plume reveal monoaromatic petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations in excess of 50 micrograms per liter. These data indicate that monoaromatic input to this plume was at least 5500 kilograms per day, which is more than double the total source rate of all natural seeps of the monoaromatic petroleum hydrocarbons in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Dissolved oxygen concentrations suggest that microbial respiration rates within the plume were not appreciably more than 1 micromolar oxygen per day.

AB A mobile robot requires the perception of its local environment for position estimation. Ultrasonic range data provide a robust description of the local environment for navigation. This article presents an ultrasonic sensor localization system for autonomous mobile robot navigation in an indoor semi-structured environment. The proposed algorithm is based upon an iterative non-linear filter, which utilizes matches between observed geometric beacons and an a-priori map of beacon locations, to correct the position and orientation of the vehicle. A non-linear filter based on a genetic algorithm as an emerging optimization method to search for optimal positions is described. The resulting self-localization module has been integrated successfully in a more complex navigation system. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in real world applications.

AB This paper describes the Semi-Online Neural-Q-leaming (SONQL) algorithm designed for real-time learning of reactive robot behaviors. The Q-function is generalized by a multilayer neural network allowing the use of continuous states. The algorithm uses a database of the most recent learning samples to accelerate and improve the convergence. Each SONQL algorithm represents an independent, reactive and adaptive state-action mapping, which implements the function of a robot behavior for one degree of freedom (DOF). The generalization capability of the SONQL algorithm was demonstrated by computer simulation with the '' mountain-car '' benchmark. The SONQL was also investigated by experiment on a mobile robot for a target-following task. Experimental results show that the SONQL is promising for online robot learning. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, a method for detecting real-time images that include counterlight produced by the sun, is proposed. It involves applying a multistep analysis of the size, location, and distribution of bright areas in the image. In general, images containing counterlight have a symmetrically high brightness value at a specific location spread over an extremely large region. In addition, the distribution and change in brightness in that specific region have a symmetrically large difference compared with other regions. Through a multistep analysis of these symmetrical features, it is determined whether counterlight is included in the image. The proposed method presents a processing time of approximately 0.7 s and a detection accuracy of 88%, suggesting that the approach can be applied to a safe driving support system for autonomous vehicles.

AB This article puts forth a new indicator of emerging technological topics as a tool for addressing challenges inherent in the evaluation of interdisciplinary research. We present this indicator and test its relationship with interdisciplinary and atypical research combinations. We perform this test by using metadata of scientific publications in three domains with different interdisciplinarity challenges: Nano-Enabled Drug Delivery, Synthetic Biology, and Autonomous Vehicles. Our analysis supports the connection between technological emergence and interdisciplinarity and atypicality in knowledge combinations.

AB Fully automated electrically powered stacker cranes are the most common transportation devices used in automated high bay warehouses. When high throughputs are attained, the amount of the electric energy used is high. Taking this into account, together with relatively high rack configuration the energy saving by employing the regeneration of potential energy during the lowering of the stored goods seems to be a promising choice. In the paper real life data for deployment of four stacker cranes in high bay warehouse of bigger dairy is introduced and analysed. The cranes' working cycles are determined and their energy consumption is estimated. Finally, the probable energy and costs savings are determined taking into account the regenerated energy for crane operations and lower energy consumption for refrigeration purposes.

SO MARINE TECHNOLOGY AND SNAME NEWS

DT Article
AB This paper describes a procedure for the design of marine propellers where more realistic representation of the slipstream shape by the trailing vortex system is taken into account. The slipstream shape behind the propeller is allowed to deform and to align with the direction of local velocity, which is obtained by the sum of the inflow velocity and induced velocities due to the trailing vortices. In classical lifting line approaches, that deformation is neglected. Applications for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and a fishing vessel are carried out to demonstrate propeller design and the effect of the slipstream contraction. Furthermore, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis based on the finite volume method and experimental validation of the method are carried out for the propellers. CFD analysis and experimental results are compared with the results obtained from present method.

ID METHANE
AB NEREUS (novel, efficient, rapid evaluation of underwater spectra) is a self-contained underwater mass-spectrometer system capable of continuous measurements of gases and vapors dissolved in the water column. Rapid in-situ measurement minimizes or eliminates artefacts that are often a problem when collecting and storing samples for analysis of volatile constituents, and provides higher spatial and temporal resolution of chemical patterns than is possible with conventional techniques. NEREUS is designed to operate either independently on a mooring or winch line, or aboard an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), such as the Sea Grant Odyssey class submersible. Underwater mass spectrometers such as NEREUS have many important applications to practical problems, such as pollution monitoring, as well as to fundamental Earth systems research.

DE Digital forensics; Dashcam; Investigation guidelines
AB Dashboard cameras ("dashcams") have become an important in-car accessory used to record audio and visual footage of car journeys. Dashcams appear more often in digital investigations and will become more prevalent with the growth of autonomous vehicles. The audio/video footage produced by dashcams contain important items of evidence, including the routes followed by the motor vehicle, video footage of the road ahead, the road behind and the cabin, as well as audio footage of conversations within the car. However, there exist no tools or guidelines on how these devices should be investigated, this could lead to cases of miscarriage of justice. This paper provides an overview of the key features of forensic interest within a dashcam device, followed by guidance on how to respond at a crime scene which involves a dashcam device and in particular how to preserve the evidence found therein. This is followed by with guidelines on how to acquire the evidence in a dashcam device, the problems and challenges involved in the examination and analysis of dashcams, before finishing with a discussion around the reporting and presentation of dashcam evidence.

AB Semantic scene segmentation has primarily been addressed by forming high-level visual representations of single images. The problem of semantic segmentation in dynamic scenes has begun to receive attention with the video object segmentation and tracking problem. While there has been some recent work attempt to use deep learning models on the video level, what is not known is how the temporal dynamics information is contributing to the full scene segmentation. Moreover, most existing datasets only provide full scene annotation on non-consecutive images to ensure the variability of scenes, making it even harder to explore novel methods on video-level modeling. To address the above issues, our work takes steps to explore the behavior of modern spatiotemporal modeling approaches by: 1) constructing the MIT DriveSeg dataset, a large-scale video driving scene segmentation dataset, densely annotated for pixel-level semantic classes with 5000 consecutive video frames, and 2) proposing a joint-learning framework that reveals the contribution of temporal dynamics information in regard to different semantic classes in the driving scene. This work is intended to help assess current methods and support further exploration of the value of temporal dynamics information in video-level scene segmentation.

AB Smart mobility is an imperative facet of smart cities, and the transition of conventional automotive systems to connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is envisioned as one of the emerging technologies on urban roads. The existing AV mobility environment is perhaps centered around road users and infrastructure, but it does not support future CAV implementation due to its proximity with distinct modules nested in the cyber layer. Therefore, this paper conceptualizes a more sustainable CAV-enabled mobility framework that accommodates all cyber-based entities. Further, the key to a thriving autonomous system relies on accurate decision making in real-time, but cyberattacks on these entities can disrupt decision-making capabilities, leading to complicated CAV accidents. Due to the incompetence of the existing accident investigation frameworks to comprehend and handle these accidents, this paper proposes a 5Ws and 1H-based investigation approach to deal with cyberattack-related accidents. Further, this paper develops STRIDE threat modeling to analyze potential threats endured by the cyber-physical system (CPS) of a CAV ecosystem. Also, a stochastic anomaly detection system is proposed to identify the anomalies, abnormal activities, and unusual operations of the automated driving system (ADS) functions during a crash analysis.

AB This paper proposed an improved incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM) which combines flexible re-linearization threshold with error learning model to improve the efficiency and accuracy of navigation for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The flexible threshold of the proposed method, which can avoid periodic re-linearization of iSAM, is controlled by adaptive threshold. Through the use of flexible re-linearization, the proposed method can reduce the running time and carry out re-linearization timely. Simultaneously, for the first time, the proposed method takes advantages of the fast training time of hidden-layer neural networks and Gaussian Process Regression which is more suitable for non-linearity to get error learning model for iSAM. The proposed method can achieve better accuracy with only a rough model and can be easily transplanted to other systems without cumbersome calculations of the precise model. Our algorithm has been demonstrated by a range of simulated and real datasets, especially in practical application it outperforms current available iSAM algorithms in efficiency and accuracy. The RMSE of proposed method increases by 21.7% and efficiency also has been improved by 56% than iSAM2 in practical application for AUV.

ID NET-RECOVERY; MPC
AB To be able to recover a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on a small space like a boat deck or a glade in the forest, a steep and precise descent is needed. One way to reduce the speed of the UAV during landing is by performing a deep-stall landing manoeuvre, where the lift of the UAV is decreased until it is unable to keep the UAV level, at the same time as the drag is increased to minimize the speed of the UAV. However, this manoeuvre is highly nonlinear and non-trivial to perform with high precision. To solve this, an on-line nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) is implemented to guide the UAV in the landing phase, receiving inputs from the autopilot and guiding the UAV using pitch and throttle references. The UAV is guided along a custom path to a predefined deep-stall landing start point and performs a guided deep-stall. The simulation results show that the NMPC guides the UAV in a deep-stall landing with good precision and low speed, and that the results depend on a correct prediction model for the controller.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are an emerging technology with the potential to revolutionize commercial industries and the public domain outside of the military. UAVs would be able to speed up rescue and recovery operations from natural disasters and can be used for autonomous delivery systems (e.g., Amazon Prime Air). An increase in the number of active UAV systems in dense urban areas is attributed to an influx of UAV hobbyists and commercial multi-UAV systems. As airspace for UAV flight becomes more limited, it is important to monitor and manage many UAV systems using modern collision avoidance techniques. In this paper, we propose a cloud-based web application that provides real-time flight monitoring and management for UAVs. For each connected UAV, detailed UAV sensor readings from the accelerometer, GPS sensor, ultrasonic sensor and visual position cameras are provided along with status reports from the smaller internal components of UAVs (i.e., motor and battery). The dynamic map overlay visualizes active flight paths and current UAV locations, allowing the user to monitor all aircrafts easily. Our system detects and prevents potential collisions by automatically adjusting UAV flight paths and then alerting users to the change. We develop our proposed system and demonstrate its feasibility and performances through simulation.

AB Intersection management is one of the most challenging problems within the transport system. Traffic light-based methods have been efficient but are not able to deal with the growing mobility and social challenges. On the other hand, the advancements of automation and communications have enabled cooperative intersection management, where road users, infrastructure, and traffic control centers are able to communicate and coordinate the traffic safely and efficiently. Major techniques and solutions for cooperative intersections are surveyed in this paper for both signalized and nonsignalized intersections, whereas focuses are put on the latter. Cooperative methods, including time slots and space reservation, trajectory planning, and virtual traffic lights, are discussed in detail. Vehicle collision warning and avoidance methods are discussed to deal with uncertainties. Concerning vulnerable road users, pedestrian collision avoidance methods are discussed. In addition, an introduction to major projects related to cooperative intersection management is presented. A further discussion of the presented works is given with highlights of future research topics. This paper serves as a comprehensive survey of the field, aiming at stimulating new methods and accelerating the advancement of automated and cooperative intersections.

ID WIRELESS LOCALIZATION; NETWORKS
AB Optimal placement of sensors or landmarks for the localization of an autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) based on range measurements is considered. The optimization relies on the Fisher information matrix (FIM). A closed-form expression of the FIM determinant is obtained for 2-D and 3-D spaces, considering heterogeneous sensors and distance-dependent ranging errors. Analytical bounds on the FIM determinant are derived, and several optimal landmark placement expressions for specific scenarios using two groups of landmarks are given. A minimax formulation for the optimal landmark placement is proposed and iteratively solved using exponential smoothing. There are several key features integrated into the proposed approach. These include 1) averaging of the cost function over elementary regions of the AGV search space to include the effect of the whole search space, 2) using a projected gradient search to stay within the boundaries of the landmark search space, and 3) searching on a convex space for placing the landmarks. Convergence issues of the proposed algorithm are discussed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed optimal landmark placement enables accurate AGV localization over significantly large volume or area of the search space compared with the case when landmarks are randomly placed.

ID SYSTEM-DESIGN; CAPABILITY; IMPACT
AB A novel stand-alone charging station (CS) powered by a combination of solar and wind energy in presence of a fuel cell (FC) system is designed and constructed for charging plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The built CS is high-efficient due to putting to practical use a proposed novel variable step-size maximum power point tracking (MPPT) scheme applied to both photovoltaic (PV) and wind parts of the CS. The main defect of a stand-alone CS is its necessity to battery banks which not only are expensive but also provide short lifetime due to a considerable number of daily charge and discharge imposed to them in a CS. This problem has been solved in this study by utilizing a FC system as supporting power source playing two roles. First, whenever PV and wind power production is less than charge demand, the FC system produces extra electric energy required. Second, whenever PV and wind power production is more than charge demand, the electrolyzer of the FC system produces hydrogen by absorbing extra electric power available in the system. Thus, the FC system acts as a high-capacity storage device in continuously regulating charging power to instant charge demand. The CS has been built, and experimental measurements obtained from its realistic operation are presented that prove the novelty and contributions of the constructed CS compared to those available as:
   For the first time, it uses a FC system with permanent lifetime and a total cost of about $21000 as the storage device of the CS instead of an associated 6.5 kWh Li-ion battery bank providing a short lifetime of about 500 days and a total cost of about $70000 per 30 years.
   It is high-efficient due to using a proposed novel variable step-size MPPT scheme with the efficiency and tracking time of, respectively, 99.6% and 12 ms applied to both PV and wind parts of the CS that high efficiently converts solar and wind energy into electric power.
   It is stand-alone, completely autonomous and 100% renewable energy based resulting in unavailability of any harmful environmental impact and the possibility of installing the CS in remote areas where there is no grid.
   The total construction cost of the built CS is about $99500 with a payback period of only 16 months.

AB A multifunctional motile microtrap is developed that is capable of autonomously attracting, trapping, and destroying pathogens by controlled chemoattractant and therapeutic agent release. The onion-inspired multi-layer structure contains a magnesium engine core and inner chemoattractant and therapeutic layers. Upon chemical propulsion, the magnesium core is depleted, resulting in a hollow structure that exposes the inner layers and serves as structural trap. The sequential dissolution and autonomous release of the chemoattractant and killing agents result in long-range chemotactic attraction, trapping, and destruction of motile pathogens. The dissolved chemoattractant (l-serine) significantly increases the accumulation and capture of motile pathogens (E. coli) within the microtrap structure, while the internal release of silver ions (Ag+) leads to lysis of the pathogen accumulated within the microtrap cavity.

AB Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, and BeiDou, are vital for safety-critical applications such as civilian aviation and autonomous vehicles. These applications demand very accurate positioning, especially in scenarios in which multipath components are present. In this paper, we propose a semi-algebraic framework for approximate Canonical Polyadic Decomposition via simultaneous matrix diagonalization (SECSI) with Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) low-rank approximation for time-delay estimation for antenna array based GNSS receivers. The HOSVD-SECSI based approach outperforms all the state-of-the-art tensor-based algorithms for time-delay estimation, mainly, for scenarios with highly correlated or coherent signals and in case of more than two multipath components.

AB Walking-robot technology has already achieved an important stage of development, as demonstrated in a few real applications. However, walking robots still need further improvement if they are to compete with traditional vehicles. A potential improvement could be made through optimization at design time. A better distribution of the legs around a robot's body can help decrease actuator size in the design procedure and reduce power consumption during walking as well, which is of vital importance in autonomous robots. This paper, thus, presents a method focused on the distribution of legs around the body to decrease maximum foot forces against the ground, which play heavily in determining robot shape and actuator size. Some experiments have been performed with the SILO6 walking robot to validate the theoretical results.

   STRATEGIES; MODEL; RELOCATION; FRAMEWORK; PLATFORM; DESIGN
AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to operate on mobility-on-demand (MoD) platforms because AV technology enables flexible self-relocation and systemoptimal coordination. Unlike the existing studies, which focus on MoD with pure AV fleet or conventional vehicles (CVs) fleet, we aim to optimize the real-time fleet management of an MoD system with a mixed autonomy of CVs and AVs. We consider a realistic case that heterogeneous boundedly rational drivers may determine and learn their relocation strategies to improve their own compensation. In contrast, AVs are fully compliant with the platform's operational decisions. To achieve a high level of service provided by a mixed fleet, we propose that the platform prioritizes human drivers in the matching decisions when on-demand requests arrive and dynamically determines the AV relocation tasks and the optimal commission fee to influence drivers' behavior. However, it is challenging to make efficient real-time fleet management decisions when spatiotemporal uncertainty in demand and complex interactions among human drivers and operators are anticipated and considered in the operator's decision making. To tackle the challenges, we develop a two-sided multiagent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach in which the operator acts as a supervisor agent on one side and makes centralized decisions on the mixed fleet, and each CV driver acts as an individual agent on the other side and learns to make decentralized decisions noncooperatively. We establish a two-sided multiagent advantage actor-critic algorithm to simultaneously train different agents on the two sides. For the first time, a scalable algorithm is developed here for mixed fleet management. Furthermore, we formulate a two-head policy network to enable the supervisor agent to efficiently make multitask decisions based on one policy network, which greatly reduces the computational time. The two-sided multiagent DRL approach is demonstrated using a case study in New York City using real taxi trip data. Results show that our algorithm can make high-quality decisions quickly and outperform benchmark policies. The efficiency of the two-head policy network is demonstrated by comparing it with the case using two separate policy networks. Our fleet management strategy makes both the platform and the drivers better off, especially in scenarios with high demand volume.

AB High acoustic seafloor-backscatter signals characterize hundreds of patches of methane-derived authigenic carbonates and chemosynthetic communities associated with hydrocarbon seepage on the Nile Deep Sea Fan (NDSF) in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. During a high-resolution ship-based multibeam survey covering a similar to 225 km(2) large seafloor area in the Central Province of the NDSF we identified 163 high-backscatter patches at water depths between 1500 and 1800 m, and investigated the source, composition, turnover, flux and fate of emitted hydrocarbons. Systematic Parasound single beam echosounder surveys of the water column showed hydroacoustic anomalies (flares), indicative of gas bubble streams, above 8% of the high-backscatter patches. In echosounder records flares disappeared in the water column close to the upper limit of the gas hydrate stability zone located at about 1350 m water depth due to decomposition of gas hydrate skins and subsequent gas dissolution. Visual inspection of three high-backscatter patches demonstrated that sediment cementation has led to the formation of continuous flat pavements of authigenic carbonates typically 100 to 300 m in diameter. Volume estimates, considering results from high-resolution autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-based multibeam mapping, were used to calculate the amount of carbonate-bound carbon stored in these slabs. Additionally, the flux of methane bubbles emitted at one high-backscatter patch was estimated (0.23 to 23 x 10(6) mol a(-1)) by combined AUV flare mapping with visual observations by remotely operated vehicle (Roy). Another highbackscatter patch characterized by single carbonate pieces, which were widely distributed and interspaced with sediments inhabited by thiotrophic, chemosynthetic organisms, was investigated using in situ measurements with a benthic chamber and ex situ sediment core incubation and allowed for estimates of the methane consumption (0.1 to 1 x 10(6) mol a(-1)) and dissolved methane flux (2 to 48 x 10(6) mol a(-1)). Our comparison of dissolved and gaseous methane fluxes as well as methane-derived carbonate reservoirs demonstrates the need for quantitative assessment of these different methane escape routes and their interaction with the geo-, bio-, and hydrosphere at cold seeps.

AB Massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) with narrow beam enhances the confidentiality of communication between base station and users, but also increases the difficulty for legal eavesdropping. In this letter, we study the passive eavesdropping scheme in the massive MIMO-OFDM systems by utilizing mobility of the monitor. Our objective is to maximize the average eavesdropping rate under the constraints of energy supply, moving direction and speed by jointly optimizing the receiving beamformers and moving trajectory. Due to the unknown environment knowledge and location of suspicious user, we propose the solution based on concatenated deep Q-network (DQN) to obtain the optimal solution. Simulation results verify the validity of the proposed method.

AB For the breakdown problem of multi-autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) formation caused by leader failure, a novel self-competition leader-follower method is proposed in this paper, which is based on an improvement of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and a principle of energy consumption distribution. By comparing the energy consumption function values of different AUVs, the one with the minimum function value will be selected as the swarm leader when the previously chosen leader is broken. By using the improved PSO algorithm, the problem of formation tracking and formation keeping can be solved. In the end, the effectiveness of the proposed method is proved by simulations, and the fault tolerance of the method is analysed.

AB This paper focuses on the problem of secure attitude estimation for autonomous vehicles. Rased on the established AHRS measuring model and the attack model, we have decomposed the optimal Kalman estimate into a linear combination of local state estimates. We then propose a convex optimization-based approach, instead of the weighted sum approach, to combine the local estimate into a more secure estimate. It is shown that the proposed secure estimator coincides with the Kalman estimator with certain probability when there is no attack, and can he stable when p elements of the model state are compromised. Simulations have been conducted to validate the proposed secure filter under single and multiple measurement attacks.

ID DYNAMICAL-SYSTEM; OPTIMIZATION
AB This paper addresses the source seeking problems for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with the estimated gradients. The AUV is embedded with multiple sensors, which are only able to detect the signal strengths of the source with unknown distribution. To resolve this challenge, a sensor configuration is explicitly designed as a semicircle to estimate gradients of the signal field. Then, a controller is obtained via the estimated gradients to drive the AUV to approach the source. Moreover, an upper bound for the localization error is provided in terms of the radius of the semicircle and the signal distribution. Finally, the authors include a simulation example by applying the strategy to a Remote Environmental Monitoring UnitS (REMUS) for seeking the deepest point of a region of seabed in the South China Sea.

AB Local obstacle avoidance is a principle capability for mobile robots in unknown or partially known environment. A series of velocity space methods including the curvature velocity method (CVM), the lane curvature method (LCM) and the beam curvature method (BCM) formulate the local obstacle avoidance problem as one of constrained optimization in the velocity space by taking the physical constraints of the environment and the dynamics of the vehicle into account. We present a new local obstacle avoidance approach that combines the prediction model of collision with the improved BCM. Not only does this method inherit the quickness of BCM and the safety of LCM, but also the proposed prediction based BCM (PBCM) can be used to avoid moving obstacles in dynamic environments.

AB We propose a concurrent single-pixel imaging, object location, and classification scheme based on deep learning (SP-ILC). We used multitask learning, developed a new loss function, and created a dataset suitable for this project. The dataset consists of scenes that contain different numbers of possibly overlapping objects of various sizes. The results we obtained show that SP-ILC runs concurrent processes to locate objects in a scene with a high degree of precision in order to produce high quality single-pixel images of the objects, and to accurately classify objects, all with a low sampling rate. SP-ILC has potential for effective use in remote sensing, medical diagnosis and treatment, security, and autonomous vehicle control.

AB This paper describes a framework for controlling a heterogeneous wireless robotic network consisting of aerial and ground vehicles. By use of the term heterogeneous, we imply the synergy of multiple robotic platforms characterized by different dynamics and specialized sensing capabilities. Two main scenarios concerning wireless communications are presented: 1) a decentralized connectivity strategy in which a mesh of ground mobile routers swarms in a cluttered environment maintaining communication constraints based on spring-mass virtual physics, potential functions, and routing optimization and 2) an autonomous communications relay in GPS-denied environments via antenna diversity and extremum-seeking SNR optimization. For both scenarios, we validate the proposed methodologies by numerical simulations and experiments. One important feature of our test bed is that it can be used for both indoor and outdoor operations.

AB When employing autonomous wheeled robots, it is desirable to use navigation approaches that always prevent collisions. In this paper, we consider the problem of navigating multiple vehicles through an unknown static environment with limited sensing and communication capabilities available. We propose a decentralized, cooperative, reactive, model predictive control based collision avoidance scheme that plans short range paths in the currently sensed part of the environment, and show that it is able to prevent collisions from occurring. An auxiliary controller is employed to follow previously planned paths whenever the main path planning system fails to update the path. Simulations and real-world testing in various scenarios confirm the methods validity. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB During the operation of the L3 automated driving system, since there is no need to supervise the vehicle at all times, the driver is often disengaged from the driving task and engages in a variety of non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs). When the autonomous driving system (ADS) encounters an unexpected situation and issues a takeover request (TOR), whether the driver can recover the situation awareness (SA) in time is the key to ensure the safety of the takeover. In this study, the theory of attention resource allocation is introduced to more accurately model the dynamic process of the SA recovery. Moreover, the attention allocation model is further developed, and the affecting factors of attention allocation are quantified. An experiment with 90 participants using driving simulator was conducted for different road scenarios to verify the proposed SA model. The model proposed in this study can accurately predict the SA value of the driver under different road scenarios and the time required for the driver to recover to the maximum SA value, which provides a reference for the scientific design of dynamic takeover lead time. The results also show that as the radius of curvature of the road decreased, the level of SA recovery would become progressively worse.

AB A cyber-physical system-of-systems (CPSoS) can be defined as a system-of-systems (SoS), composed of several operable and autonomous constituent systems (CSs) that are themselves cyber-physical systems (CPSs). A main challenge in integrating CPSoS to function as a single integrated system is the autonomy of its components, which may result in undesirable, unsecure, or even unsafe situations. In this paper, we advocate that in order to facilitate the integration of CPSs within the overall context of their CPSoS, we may need to adjust their level of autonomy in a way that enables them to perform their activities and avoid undesirable, unsecure , and unsafe situations. Reducing such situations surely contributes to the dependability of the CPSoS. In particular, we propose a novel model-based approach for modeling and analyzing the autonomy levels of CPSs based on their awareness concerning their operational environment as well as their capability to react in a timely, secure, and safe manner while performing their activities. The model is further described in a UML profile and applied to represent activities for autonomous driving scenarios. Using a driving simulator, we implement such models on a target vehicle, and we show the resulting safety improvement, especially in terms of reduced collisions.

AB The neural network policies are widely explored in the autonomous driving field, thanks to their capability of handling complicated driving tasks. However, the practical deployment of such policies is slowed down due to their lack of robustness against modeling gap and external disturbances. In our prior work, we proposed a planner-controller architecture and applied a disturbance-observer-based (DOB) robust tracking controller to reject the disturbances and achieved zero-shot policy transfer. In this paper, we present our latest progress on improving the policy transfer performance under this framework. Concretely, we applied adaptive DOB, so as to more accurately model the inverse system dynamics and increase the cut-off frequency of the Q-filter in the DOB. A closed-loop reference path smoothing algorithm is introduced to alleviate the step disturbance input imposed by the reference trajectory re-planning. On the neural network control policy side, we applied the parallel attribute networks, a hierarchical modular policy network to dynamically handle various driving tasks. We have carried out various simulations and experiments to validate the capability of our proposed method to achieve sim-to-sim and sim-to-real policy transfer. The proposed method achieves the most outstanding performance among a series of baseline control schemes.

AB With much research has been conducted into trajectory planning for quadrotors, planning with spatial and temporal optimal trajectories in real-time is still challenging. In this letter, we propose a framework for large-scale waypoint-based polynomial trajectory generation, with highlights on its superior computational efficiency and simultaneous spatial-temporal optimality. Exploiting the implicitly decoupled structure of the problem, we conduct alternating minimization between boundary conditions and time durations of trajectory pieces. Algebraic convenience of both sub-problems is leveraged to escape poor local minima and achieve the lowest time consumption. Theoretical analysis for the global/local convergence rate of our method is provided. Moreover, based on polynomial theory, an extremely fast feasibility checker is designed for various kinds of constraints. By incorporating it into our alternating structure, a constrained minimization algorithm is constructed to optimize trajectories on the premise of feasibility. Benchmark evaluation shows that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art waypoint-based methods regarding efficiency, optimality, and scalability. The algorithm can be incorporated in a high-level waypoint planner, which can rapidly search over a three-dimensional space for aggressive autonomous flights. The capability of our algorithm is experimentally demonstrated by quadrotor fast flights in a limited space with dense obstacles. We release our implementation as an open-source ros-package.(1)

AB Maintenance of ship hull involves routine tasks during dry-docking that includes inspection, paint stripping, and re-painting. Among those, paint stripping is always seen as harmful for human operators and a time-consuming task. To reduce human risk, cost, and environmental cleanliness, the shipping maintenance industries started using robotic solutions. However, most of such robotic systems cannot operate fully autonomous since it requires human in the loop to monitor the cleaning efficiency. To this end, a novel autonomous self-evaluating hull cleaning robot called Hornbill is presented in this paper. The proposed robot is capable of navigating autonomously on the hull surface and perform water jet blasting to strip off the paint coating. The robot is also enabled with a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) based self-evaluating scheme that benchmarks cleaning efficiency. We evaluated the proposed robots performance by conducting experimental trials on a metal plate under three different paint coatings. While performing the paint stripping task in every experimental trial, the self-evaluating scheme would generate the heat map that depicts the plates cleanliness. The results indicate that the proposed self-evaluating system could successfully generate high accurate cleanliness heat maps in all considered scenarios, which simplifies the checkup process for paint inspectors.

AB This paper investigates the leader-follower formation problem of multiple underactuated autonomous surface vessels in the presence of model uncertainties and environmental disturbances. Specially, the formation is defined in the body-fixed coordinates of the leader vessel and velocities of the leader are unavailable to followers. A novel robust adaptive formation control scheme based on the minimal learning parameter (MLP) algorithm and the disturbance observer (DOB) is presented. To address related formation configurations and unknown velocities of the leader, adaptive programming of the virtual vessel is introduced. By the neural networks (NNs) technique, the DOB is constructed and the formation controller is developed with different MLP-based adaptive laws. Under the proposed controller, it is shown that the desired formation can be achieved only with the position and yaw angle of the leader. And formation errors are guaranteed to be semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded. Compared with existing results, the NNs-based DOB can compensate disturbances effectively with less model information. Meanwhile, the formation controller and the DOB can share the same set of NNs with smaller computational effort, where only two parameters need to be learned online for each of them. Simulations and comparison results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of theoretical results.

AB West Mata is a submarine volcano located in the SW Pacific Ocean between Fiji and Samoa in the NE Lau Basin. West Mata was discovered to be actively erupting at its summit in September 2008 and May 2009. Water-column chemistry and hydrophone data suggest it was probably continuously active until early 2011. Subsequent repeated bathymetric surveys of West Mata have shown that it changed to a style of frequent but intermittent eruptions away from the summit since then. We present new data from ship-based bathymetric surveys, high-resolution bathymetry from an autonomous underwater vehicle, and observations from remotely operated vehicle dives that document four additional eruptions between 2012 and 2018. Three of those eruptions occurred between September 2012 and March 2016; one near the summit on the upper ENE rift, a second on the NE flank away from any rift zone, and a third at the NE base of the volcano. The latter intruded a sill into a basin with thick sediments, uplifted them, and then extruded lava onto the seafloor around them. The most recent of the four eruptions occurred between March 2016 and November 2017 along the middle ENE rift zone and produced pillow lava flows with a shingled morphology and tephra as well as clastic debris that mantled the SE slope. ROV dive observations show that the shallower recent eruptions at West Mata include a substantial pyroclastic component, based on thick (> 1 m) tephra deposits near eruptive vents. The deepest eruption sites lack these near-vent tephra deposits, suggesting that pyroclastic activity is minimal below similar to 2500 mbsl. The multibeam sonar re-surveys constrain the timing, thickness, area, morphology, and volume of the new eruptions. The cumulative erupted volume since 1996 suggests that eruptions at West Mata are volume-predictable with an average eruption rate of 7.8 x 10(6) m(3)/yr. This relatively low magma supply rate and the high frequency of eruptions (every 1-2 years) suggests that the magma reservoir at West Mata is relatively small. With its frequent activity, West Mata continues to be an ideal natural laboratory for the study of submarine volcanic eruptions.

AB Autonomous unmanned vehicles equipped with sensors are rapidly becoming the de facto means of achieving situational awareness - the ability to make sense of, and predict what is happening in an environment. Particularly in environments that are subject to continuous change, the use of such teams to maintain accurate and up-to-date situational awareness is a challenging problem. To perform well, the vehicles need to patrol their environment continuously and in a coordinated manner.
   To address this challenge, we develop a near-optimal multi-agent algorithm for continuously patrolling such environments. We first define a general class of multi-agent information gathering problems in which vehicles are represented by information gathering agents autonomous entities that direct their activity towards collecting information with the aim of providing accurate and up-to-date situational awareness. These agents move on a graph, while taking measurements with the aim of maximising the cumulative discounted observation value over time. Here, observation value is an abstract measure of reward, which encodes the properties of the agents' sensors, and the spatial and temporal properties of the measured phenomena. Concrete instantiations of this class of problems include monitoring environmental phenomena (temperature, pressure, etc.), disaster response, and patrolling environments to prevent intrusions from (non-strategic) attackers.
   In more detail, we derive a single-agent divide and conquer algorithm to compute a continuous patrol (an infinitely long path in the graph) that yields a near-optimal amount of observation value. This algorithm recursively decomposes the graph, until high-quality paths in the resulting components can be computed outright by a greedy algorithm. It then constructs a patrol by concatenating these paths using dynamic programming. For multiple agents, the algorithm sequentially computes patrols for each agent in a greedy fashion, in order to maximise its marginal contribution to the team. Moreover, to achieve robustness, we develop algorithms for repairing patrols when one or more agents fail or the graph changes.
   For both the single- and the multi-agent case, we give theoretical guarantees (lower bounds on the solution quality and an upper bound on the computational complexity in the size of the graph and the number agents) on the performance of the algorithms. We benchmark the single- and multi-agent algorithm against the state of the art and demonstrate that it typically performs 35% and 33% better in terms of average and minimum solution quality respectively.

AB This letter proposes a structured CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition-aided (SCPD) pilot decontamination (PDC) scheme for UAV communication in cell-free massive MIMO systems. We design a two-stage pilot transmission scheme and intentionally generate pilot contamination for pilot decontamination. At first, we formulate the received signals as a second-order tensor. Then we turn the PDC problem into a joint channel parameter estimation problem. By exploiting the Vandermonde structure of the factor matrix, we propose a SCPD-aided scheme for channel estimation, which only leverages standard linear algebra and avoids numerous iterations. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SCPD scheme in terms of accuracy and complexity.

AB To simulate the firing pattern of biological Grid cells (GCs), an efficient computational model based on back-propagation neural network (BPNN), which allows for the generation of regular hexagonal grids, is described. For each GC, it is associated with the output of a learned BPNN. The firing characteristics of GCs can be controlled by the adjustment factors (AFs) flexibly. During the vehicle's space exploration, GCs can exhibit hexagonal firing patterns with different characteristics according to the settings of the AFs. Simulation results validate the proposed model's accuracy as they are in agreement with GCs' biological experimental electroencephalogram results. Meanwhile, the application of the three-layer BPNN can greatly reduce the computational complexity, which lay a foundation for its application in realistic bio-inspired autonomous navigation systems.

AB This paper presents a global localization system for an indoor autonomous vehicle equipped with odometry sensors and a radio-frequency identification (RFID) reader to interrogate tags located on the ceiling of the environment. The RFID reader can measure the phase of the signals coming from responding tags. This phase has non-univocal dependence on the distance robot tag, but in the considered frequency, it is really sensitive to a change in the position of the robot. For this reason, a multihypothesis Kalman filtering approach provides a really satisfactory performance even in the case that a very small density of tags is used: In the experimental tests, an average position estimation error of about 4 cm is achieved using only two tags for an area of about 5 m(2).

AB In this paper, finite-time position consensus and collision avoidance problems are investigated for multi-AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle) systems. First, based on the homogeneous control method, finite-time position consensus algorithms are proposed for both leaderless and leader follower multi-AUV systems without considering collisions between the AUVs. Specifically, in the leader follower case, a novel distributed finite-time observer is developed for the followers to estimate the leader's velocity. Second, by constructing collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance functions, modified consensus algorithms containing corresponding gradient terms are presented for multi-AUV systems of both cases, which guarantee collision avoidance, connectivity maintenance, velocity matching, and consensus boundedness. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB It has been hypothesized that at sufficiently high levels of oceanic salinity turbulence it should be possible to observe acoustic backscattering. However, there have been limited in situ measurements to confirm this hypothesis. Using an autonomous underwater vehicle equipped with upward and downward looking 1.2 MHz acoustic Doppler current profilers and with turbulence and fine scale sensors, measurements were performed in a region of intense turbulence and a strong salinity gradient. The approach taken was to correlate variations in the backscattered acoustic intensity, I, with a theoretical acoustic backscattering cross section per volume for salinity turbulence, sigma(s), to obtain an estimated scattering cross section per volume, sigma(e). Results indicated that of order 50% of the observed region was characterized by salinity turbulence induced backscattering. (C) 2011 Acoustical Society of America. [DOI: 10.1121/1.3605666]

TI A Star Pattern Recognition Algorithm Based on the Radial
   Companion-Circumferential Feature
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB Attitude measurement is an important core technology of vehicle flight. It is of great significance to ensure the vehicle's accurate orbit entry and orbit change, high-performance flight, reliable ground communication, high-precision ground observation, and successful completion of various space missions. Star sensor is the core component to realize an autonomous attitude measurement of the vehicle. Autonomous star map recognition is a key technology in star sensor technology, and it is also the focus and difficulty of research. When the star sensor enters the initial attitude acquisition mode, according to the algorithm, the star sensor can quickly obtain the initial attitude and enter the normal working mode. This paper proposes a star pattern recognition algorithm based on the radial companion-circumferential feature with a noise compensation code to address the low recognition rate caused by position noise in the process of constructing star patterns in the traditional star pattern recognition algorithm based on the radial feature. In order to solve the problem of slow matching search speed, a maximum matching number algorithm has been innovatively adopted, which can improve the search efficiency in the process of star pattern recognition. Thus, the capacity of the star pattern recognition feature library is effectively reduced, and the stability and recognition rate of the improved star pattern recognition algorithm are further improved. The improved star pattern recognition algorithm first establishes radial and circumferential feature vectors based on the bit vector, then adds the noise compensation code according to the companion star position error, then modifies the radial and circumferential feature vectors, and finally calculates the minimum similarity difference between the feature vector of the star pattern observed by the star sensor and the feature vector of the navigation star in the feature library to obtain the unique star pattern recognition result. The identification star database adopts the maximum matching number algorithm, which can improve the search efficiency, reduce the amount of redundant matching, and shorten the matching time. The simulation results show that even in the presence of star position and magnitude noise, the improved star pattern recognition algorithm with radial companion-circumferential feature maintains a high recognition rate of more than 97 percent, demonstrating that the algorithm's robustness is superior to other algorithms. The revised method described in this work outperforms the classic triangle algorithm and the radial feature star pattern recognition algorithm without compensation code in terms of algorithm robustness, recognition success rate, and recognition time.

AB The unmanned aerial vehicles can have complicated dynamics and kinematics that governs the flight of such multirotor devices. PID type controllers are one of the most popular approaches with Raspberry Pi 3 platform for stability of the flight. However, in dynamic environment they are limited in performance and response times. The autonomous tuning of the controller parameters according to the state of the environment with assistance of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system is a well known approach. This paper provides implementation details and feasibility of such a controller with Raspberry Pi 3 platform for use in geological wireless sensing environments. The proposed neuro-fuzzy controller is developed for a Raspberry Pi 3 platform and tested on a physical quadrotor drone and compared to the conventional PID controller during flight.

AB The collaborative combat of manned/unmanned aerial vehicles (MAVs/UAVs) is a popular topic in combat application research. It maximizes the autonomous combat capability of UAVs and the control capability of MAVs. Furthermore, it improves the comprehensive combat effectiveness. The quantitative description of intercommunication in different aircrafts along with the evaluation of the collaborative combat capability is an emphasis in military research. This paper analyzes the collaborative combat process. Node and edge models are established in the MAV/UAV collaborative network. The intercommunication and combat behaviors among combat entities are analyzed. Based on the information entropy, the effect of capability uncertainties on the collaborative combat is described quantitatively. An evaluation method of the MAV/UAV collaborative combat capability is proposed. Finally, an example is given to demonstrate the proposed model and evaluation method that prove its feasibility and effectiveness.

AB Our research aims to generate robust, dense 3-D depth maps for robotics, especially autonomous driving applications. Since cameras output 2-D images and active sensors such as LiDAR or radar produce sparse depth measurements, dense depth maps need to be estimated. Recent methods based on visual transformer networks have outperformed conventional deep learning approaches in various computer vision tasks, including depth prediction, but have focused on the use of a single camera image. This article explores the potential of visual transformers applied to the fusion of monocular images, semantic segmentation, and projected sparse radar reflections for robust monocular depth estimation. The addition of a semantic segmentation branch is used to add object-level understanding and is investigated in a supervised and unsupervised manner. We evaluate our new depth estimation approach on the nuScenes dataset where it outperforms existing state-of-the-art camera-radar depth estimation methods. We show that models can benefit from an additional segmentation branch during the training process by transfer learning even without running segmentation at inference. Further studies are needed to investigate the usage of 4-D-imaging radars and enhanced ground-truth generation in more detail. The related code is available as open-source software under https://github.com/TUMFTM/CamRaDepth.

AB Stranded beach litter is a ubiquitous issue. Manual monitoring and retrieval can be cost and labour intensive. Therefore, automatic litter monitoring and retrieval is an essential mitigation strategy. In this paper, we present important foundational blocks that can be expanded into an autonomous monitoring-and-retrieval pipeline based on drone surveys and object detection using deep learning. Drone footage collected on the islands of Malta and Gozo in Sicily (Italy) and the Red Sea coast was combined with publicly available litter datasets and used to train an object detection algorithm (YOLOv5) to detect litter objects in footage recorded during drone surveys. Across all classes of litter objects, the 50%-95% mean average precision (mAP50-95) was 0.252, with the performance on single well-represented classes reaching up to 0.674. We also present an approach to geolocate objects detected by the algorithm, assigning latitude and longitude coordinates to each detection. In combination with beach morphology information derived from digital elevation models (DEMs) for path finding and identifying inaccessible areas for an autonomous litter retrieval robot, this research provides important building blocks for an automated monitoring-and-retrieval pipeline.

AB Autonomous flight with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) nowadays depends on the availability and reliability of Global Navigation Satellites Systems (GNSS). In cluttered outdoor scenarios, such as narrow gorges, or near tall artificial structures, such as bridges or dams, reduced sky visibility and multipath effects compromise the quality and the trustworthiness of the GNSS position fixes, making autonomous, or even manual, flight difficult and dangerous. To overcome this problem, cooperative navigation has been proposed: a second UAV flies away from any occluding objects and in line of sight from the first and provides the latter with positioning information, removing the need for full and reliable GNSS coverage in the area of interest. In this work we use high-power light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to signalize the second drone and we present a computer vision pipeline that allows to track the second drone in real-time from a distance up to 100 m and to compute its relative position with decimeter accuracy. This is based on an extension to the classical iterative algorithm for the Perspective-n-Points problem in which the photometric error is minimized according to a image formation model. This extension allow to substantially increase the accuracy of point-feature measurements in image space (up to 0.05 pixels), which directly translates into higher positioning accuracy with respect to conventional methods.

AB 3D neural networks are widely used in real-world applications (e.g., AR/VR headsets, self-driving cars). They are required to be fast and accurate; however, limited hardware resources on edge devices make these requirements rather challenging. Previous work processes 3D data using either voxel-based or point-based neural networks, but both types of 3D models are not hardware-efficient due to the large memory footprint and random memory access. In this paper, we study 3D deep learning from the efficiency perspective. We first systematically analyze the bottlenecks of previous 3D methods. We then combine the best from point-based and voxel-based models together and propose a novel hardware-efficient 3D primitive, Point-Voxel Convolution (PVConv). We further enhance this primitive with the sparse convolution to make it more effective in processing large (outdoor) scenes. Based on our designed 3D primitive, we introduce 3D Neural Architecture Search (3D-NAS) to explore the best 3D network architecture given a resource constraint. We evaluate our proposed method on six representative benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 1.8-23.7x measured speedup. Furthermore, our method has been deployed to the autonomous racing vehicle of MIT Driverless, achieving larger detection range, higher accuracy and lower latency.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Traffic signs recognition (TSR) is a crucial sub-domain of computer vision, particularly relevant to autonomous vehicles and autonomous driver-assistance systems (ADAS). TSR systems can further augment efforts in many other applications, such as highway asset maintenance and management. Despite the relative success of detectors with hand-crafted features in Europe, most, if not all, non-deep-learning based systems are not scalable to accurately recognize a large subset of traffic signs in the United States. The recent works in the domain of object detection using machine learning have shown the necessity of deep neural networks (DNNs) in TSR, whereby a DNN can learn features automatically without hand-crafting them. Due to the lack of datasets in the U.S. and the inefficient use of traditional methods for traffic sign recognition (TSR) in the U.S., we created the Automotive Repository of Traffic Signs (ARTS), a new dataset for traffic signs recognition in the U.S. ARTS covers a wide range of sign-types, including Regulatory, Guide, Warning, and Temporary signs as defined in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). It also features geospatial data to localize signs using their GPS coordinates. Benchmarks are presented to assess the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning based detectors.

Designing CNNs for sparse and irregularly spaced input data is still an open research problem with numerous applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and surveillance. In this paper, we propose an algebraically-constrained normalized convolution layer for CNNs with highly sparse input that has a smaller number of network parameters compared to related work. We propose novel strategies for determining the confidence from the convolution operation and propagating it to consecutive layers. We also propose an objective function that simultaneously minimizes the data error while maximizing the output confidence. To integrate structural information, we also investigate fusion strategies to combine depth and RGB information in our normalized convolution network framework. In addition, we introduce the use of output confidence as an auxiliary information to improve the results. The capabilities of our normalized convolution network framework are demonstrated for the problem of scene depth completion. Comprehensive experiments are performed on the KITTI-Depth and the NYU-Depth-v2 datasets. The results clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance while requiring only about 1-5 percent of the number of parameters compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

AB The non-transparency of a centralised power system creates security issues in energy trading, and the inability of prosumers to participate in energy trading arose. Blockchain can be applied in distributed generation (DG) with its immutability, security, decentralised, transparency, anonymity, transactional data, and automation features to resolve the mentioned concerns. The applications of DG, such as renewable energy sources (RES), battery electric vehicles (BEVs), solar energy, microgrid and other new electrical components, require the need decen-tralised energy management with secured data ledger transactional record and peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. The research gaps and limitations are stated to point out the potential future prospect and recom-mendations. Overall, the blockchain is beneficial to be implemented in DG in terms of security enhancement, P2P energy trading, immutable transactional records and transparent transactions. As compared to the centralised system, the decentralised blockchain enables the scalability, privacy, autonomous trading, anonymity, legitimate auditing and low latency of DG operations. This study serves as a guide to accelerating the adoption of block -chain technology in the emerging DG. The research outcome of this review is a wider perspective of blockchain applicability and versatility in the DG sector in terms of decentralisation of grid operation, P2P energy trading and energy optimisation. The review also highlights the limitations and clarifies technical issues concerning the implementations of blockchain in the DG sector, the current applications and development trends and possible future recommendations for the blockchain in advancing the DG sector.

AB Cellular systems are facing the ever-increasing demand for vehicular communication aimed at applications such as advanced driving assistance and ultimately fully autonomous driving. Cellular Vehicle to Anything (C-V2X) has become more applicable with the release of the first sets of 5G (5(th) Generation) system specifications. The highly capable 5G systems will therefore support even a larger number of moving objects. This study aims to present a sophisticated clustering mechanism that enables cellular systems to accommodate a massive number of moving Machine Type Communication (MTC) objects with a minimum set of connections while maintaining system scalability. Specifically, we proposed Normalized Multi Dimension-Affinity Propagation Clustering (NMDP-APC) scheme and applied it for Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) clustering. For VANET clustering formation, our study employed Machine Learning (ML) to determine the granularity, i.e., the size and span of clusters desirable for use in dynamic motion environments. The study achieved a sufficient level of prediction accuracy with fewer training data through a learned prediction function based on the selected key criteria. This paper also proposes a system sequence designed with a series of procedures fully compliant with C-V2X systems. We demonstrated substantial simulations and numerical experiments with theoretical analysis, specifically applying soft-margin-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The simulation results confirmed that the granularity parameter we applied fairly controls the size of VANET clusters although vehicles are in motion and that the prediction performance has been adjusted through controlling of key SVM parameters.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB The turning function is a tool in image processing that measures the difference between two polygonal shapes. We propose a localization algorithm for the optimal pose estimation of autonomous mobile robots using the scan-matching method based on the turning function algorithm. There are several methodologies aimed at moving the robots in the right way and carrying out their missions well, which involves the integration of localization and control. In the proposed method, the localization problem is implemented in the form of an optimization problem. Afterwards, the turning function algorithm and the simplex method are applied to estimate the localization and orientation of the robot. The proposed algorithm first receives the polygons extracted from two sensors' data and then allocates a histogram to each sensor scan. This algorithm attempts to maximize the similarity of the two histograms by converting them to a unified coordinate system. In this way, the estimate of the difference between the two situations is calculated. In more detail, the main objective of this study is to provide an algorithm aimed at reducing errors in the localization and orientation of mobile robots. The simulation results indicate the great performance of this algorithm. Experimental results on simulated and real datasets show that the proposed algorithms achieve better results in terms of both position and orientation metrics.

AB A profound concern dwelling on developing practical control algorithms for autonomous cars is to guarantee robustness and resilience in harsh driving situations. Extraneous environmental factors coupled with structured and unstructured uncertainties have always posed concerns about the proposed algorithms' effectiveness. This paper presents an improved control algorithm based on a robust adaptive neural network trained with integral sliding mode (NN-ISMC) with the capacity for state estimation and auxiliary control inputs. Additionally, the paper considers the contribution of active front steering (AFS) integrated with direct yaw moment control (DYC) to employ during critical driving scenarios. Moreover, a super-twisting ESO disturbance observer (STESO-DO) was developed to estimate disturbances imposed on the car during an emergency maneuver, such as double-lane change, in terms of successive strong gusts of crosswind. Additional uncertainties were introduced to the system to evaluate the algorithm's robustness, such as the tire cornering stiffness and traveling speed. The performance of the designed framework was further assessed against two documented comparable methods in the literature using high-fidelity MATLAB/Simulink-CarSim co-simulations. The findings from various driving conditions and speeds indicate that the proposed controller successfully stabilizes the handling dynamics and thus enhances the path-tracking performance compared to the previously reported methods.

AB In this article, the problem of an online autonomous aerial inspection, specifically for discontinuous and distributed objects is presented. The proposed approach imposes view culling and photogrammetric constraints based on a geometrically modeled three-dimensional view pyramid, a view cone to filter surfaces by desired observation angle, a framework-integrated passive collision-avoidance scheme with the object under inspection, and a dynamically enveloping bounding-box region to map the visited surfaces. Furthermore, the proposed inspect-explore framework is validated for the case of an unknown environment with no prior knowledge of the object model under inspection. The overall inspection scheme is based on the novel First-Look approach, enabling the UAV to progressively adapt its inspection path to match the profile of the structure autonomously. The implemented exploration strategy imposes a tiered policy enabling the UAV to search, identify and navigate towards the structure for inspection. The presented work utilizes a unified architecture of the aforementioned inspect-explore framework to improve situational awareness in a previously unknown environment by enabling the UAV to explore its surrounding space and identify structures to execute closer inspection tasks. Extended simulations to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed inspect-explore framework are presented with multiple structure scenarios.

AB In order to study the lateral dynamics stability of the levitation module of low- and medium-speed maglev train, the motion equation is simplified by reasonable assumptions, and the simplest lateral dynamics model is established under the premise of retaining the lateral dynamic characteristics of the levitation module. The model can be characterized by a non-autonomous differential equation with periodic coefficients, which can be transformed into a damped Mathieu equation under certain conditions, with its stability equivalent to that of its Poincare mapping. The stability of the system can be determined by whether the largest modulus of the eigenvalues of the mapped coefficient matrix is > 1. Then, the sensitivity frequency of the vertical electromagnetic force is obtained by calculating the stability domain of the equation in the parameter space. When the variation frequency of the vertical electromagnetic force is approximately equivalent to the sensitivity frequency, the lateral dynamics model is more likely to be unstable. Besides, the variation amplitude and variation frequency of the vertical electromagnetic force, and other factors such as vehicle load and system damping will also change the stability of the lateral dynamics model. However, due to the uncontrollability of these factors, it is necessary to install a lateral damper for the levitation module to improve the lateral stability.

AB Vehicular communications have developed rapidly contributing to the success of intelligent transportation systems. In VANET, continuous connectivity is a huge challenge caused by the extremely dynamic network topology and the highly variable number of mobile nodes. Moreover, message dissemination efficiency is a serious issue in traffic effectiveness and road safety. The heterogeneous vehicular network, which integrates cellular networks with DSRC, has been suggested and attracted significant attention recently. VANET-cellular integration offers many potential benefits, for instance, high data rates, low latency, and extended communication range. Due to the heterogeneous wireless access, a seamless handover decision is required to guarantee QoS of communications and to maintain continuous connectivity between the vehicles. On the other hand, VANET heterogeneous wireless networks integration will significantly help autonomous cars to be functional in reality. This paper surveys and reviews some related studies in the literature that deals with VANET heterogeneous wireless networks communications in term of vertical handover, data dissemination and collection, gateway selection and other issues. The comparison between different works is based on parameters like bandwidth, delay, throughput, and packet loss. Finally, we outline open issues that help to identify the future research directions of VANET in the heterogeneous environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID DESIGN
AB This paper reports the design and testing of an embedded system for a low-cost small scaled helicopter (Benzin Acrobatic from Vario (TM) with a 1.8 m diameter rotor). The sensors under consideration are an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a GPS, a magnetometer, a barometer and on-off switches serving as take-off and landing detector. Along with one PC board and one micro-controller, they represent a total cost below USD 3000. By contrast to other experiments reported in the literature, the presented work do not rely on any accurate IMU or GPS systems which costs are, separately, largely above the mentioned amount of USD 3000. To compensate the weaknesses of this low cost equipment, efforts focus on designing a robust, dependable and sufficiently embedded system, which exploits an accurate flight dynamics model. This improves the prediction capabilities of an embedded extended Kalman filter that serves for data fusion. The main contribution of this paper is to detail, at the light of a successful reported autonomous hovering flight, the hardware, software architectures and the derivation of the model along with its calibration. Numerous implementation details are presented and the relevance of some modeling hypothesis is discussed. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A 12.5 m S Band ground station was installed at Chilton in 1980. It was used as the prime ground station for the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) and later for command and control of the UK Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer Explorer mission (AMPTE). More recently, it has been brought back into use for the low cost and more autonomous operations with the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) satellite and is being prepared for the UK Space Technology Research Vehicle (STRV) and two polar orbiter missions. This paper reviews, after 18 months of operations, the performance achieved in supporting ACE with the autonomous systems put in place at Chilton as well as, the cost effectiveness.
   Maintenance of an ageing antenna has been a challenge and is discussed. More automatic systems are planned for STRV including prototyping work on the new CCSDS standards for Space Link Extension services which should allow interoperability between the STRV Control Centre and the two UK antennas at Chilton and West Freugh. The advent of polar orbiting operations will increase the need for multi-satellite operations (i.e. ACE, STRV, Moroccosat and Badr-B will be operating together) and the need for contention resolution and rapid switching between the missions. New equipment standards and web-based systems play a key role in the achievements reported. (C) 2002 International Astronautical Federation. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Object detection from waterborne imagery is an essential aspect in maritime traffic management, navigation safety and coastal security. Building efficient autonomous systems, which can take decisions in critical situations, requires an integration of complex object detectors in real time. Object detectors trained on generic datasets often give unsatisfactory results in complex scenarios like the maritime environment, since only a fraction of their images contain maritime vessels. Publicly available domain-specific datasets are scarce, and they are limited in the number of images and annotations. Compared to object detection in applications such as autonomous vehicles, maritime vessel detection is considerably reduced in computer vision research. This creates a deficit in exhaustive benchmarking studies for maritime detection datasets. To bridge this gap, we relabel the ABOships dataset and benchmark a state-of-the-art center-based detector, Centernet, on the newly relabeled dataset, ABOships-PLUS. We explore its performance under different feature extractors, and investigate the effect of object size and inter-class variation on detection accuracy. The reported benchmarking illustrates that the ABOships-PLUS dataset is adequate to use in supervised domain adaptation. The experimental results show that Centernet with DLA (Deep Layer Aggregation) as a feature extractor achieved the highest accuracy in detecting maritime objects overall (with mean average precision 74.4%).

AB Ship motion planning constitutes the most critical part in the autonomous navigation systems of marine autonomous surface ships (MASS). Weather and ocean conditions can significantly affect their navigation, but there are relatively few studies on the influence of wind and current on motion planning. This study investigates the motion planning problem for USV, wherein the goal is to obtain an optimal path under the interference of the navigation environment (wind and current), and control the USV in order to avoid obstacles and arrive at its destination without collision. In this process, the influences of search efficiency, navigation safety and energy consumption on motion planning are taken into consideration. Firstly, the navigation environment is constructed by integrating information, including the electronic navigational chart, wind and current field. Based on the environmental interference factors, the three-degree-of-freedom kinematic model of USVs is created, and the multi-objective optimization and complex constraints are reasonably expressed to establish the corresponding optimization model. A multi-objective optimization algorithm based on HA* is proposed after considering the constraints of motion and dynamic and optimization objectives. Simulation verifies the effectiveness of the algorithm, where an efficient, safe and economical path is obtained and is more in line with the needs of practical application.</p>

AB Steering control for an autonomous underwater glider (AUG) is very challenging due to its changing dynamic characteristics such as payload and shape. A good choice to solve this problem is online system identification via in-field trials to capture current dynamic characteristics for control law reconfiguration. Hence, an online polynomial estimator is designed to update the yaw dynamic model of the AUG, and an adaptive model predictive control (MPC) controller is used to calculate the optimal control command based on updated estimated parameters. The MPC controller uses a quadratic program (QP) to compute the optimal control command based on a user-defined cost function. The cost function has two terms, focusing on output reference tracking and move suppression of input, respectively. Move-suppression performance can, at some level, represent energy-saving performance of the MPC controller. Users can balance these two competitive control performances by tuning weights. We have compared the control performance using the second-order polynomial model to that using the fifth-order polynomial model, and found that the former cannot capture the main characteristics of yaw dynamics and may result in vibration during the flight. Both processor-in-loop (PIL) simulations and in-lake tests are presented to validate our steering control performance.

AB Autonomous driving systems rely on a comprehensive understanding of the surrounding environment, and trees, as important roadside features, have a significant impact on vehicle positioning and safety analysis. Existing methods use mobile LiDAR systems (MLS) to collect environmental information and automatically generate tree inventories based on dense point clouds, providing accurate geometric parameters. However, the use of MLS systems requires expensive survey-grade laser scanners and high-precision GNSS/IMU systems, which limits their large-scale deployment and results in poor real-time performance. Although LiDAR-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques have been widely applied in the navigation field, to the best of my knowledge, there has been no research conducted on simultaneous real-time localization and roadside tree inventory. This paper proposes an innovative approach that uses LiDAR technology to achieve vehicle positioning and a roadside tree inventory. Firstly, a front-end odometry based on an error-state Kalman filter (ESKF) and a back-end optimization framework based on factor graphs are employed. The updated poses from the back-end are used for establishing point-to-plane residual constraints for the front-end in the local map. Secondly, a two-stage approach is adopted to minimize global mapping errors, refining accumulated mapping errors through GNSS-assisted registration to enhance system robustness. Additionally, a method is proposed for creating a tree inventory that extracts line features from real-time LiDAR point cloud data and projects them onto a global map, providing an initial estimation of possible tree locations for further tree detection. This method uses shared feature extraction results and data pre-processing results from SLAM to reduce the computational load of simultaneous vehicle positioning and roadside tree inventory. Compared to methods that directly search for trees in the global map, this approach benefits from fast perception of the initial tree position, meeting real-time requirements. Finally, our system is extensively evaluated on real datasets covering various road scenarios, including urban and suburban areas. The evaluation metrics are divided into two parts: the positioning accuracy of the vehicle during operation and the detection accuracy of trees. The results demonstrate centimeter-level positioning accuracy and real-time automatic creation of a roadside tree inventory.

ID TRACKING
AB Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) are increasingly used to perform numerous tasks connected with measurements in inland waters and seas. One of such target applications is hydrography, where traditional (manned) bathymetric measurements are increasingly often realized by unmanned surface vehicles. This pertains especially to restricted or hardly navigable waters, in which execution of hydrographic surveys with the use of USVs requires precise maneuvering. Bathymetric measurements should be realized in a way that makes it possible to determine the waterbody's depth as precisely as possible, and this requires high-precision in navigating along planned sounding profiles. This paper presents research that aimed to determine the accuracy of unmanned surface vehicle steering in autonomous mode (with a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller) along planned hydrographic profiles. During the measurements, a high-precision Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Real Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning system based on a GNSS reference station network (positioning accuracy: 1-2 cm, p = 0.95) and a magnetic compass with the stability of course maintenance of 1 degrees-3 degrees Root Mean Square (RMS) were used. For the purpose of evaluating the accuracy of the vessel's path following along sounding profiles, the cross track error (XTE) measure, i.e., the distance between an USV's position and the hydrographic profile, calculated transversely to the course, was proposed. The tests were compared with earlier measurements taken by other unmanned surface vehicles, which followed the exact same profiles with the use of much simpler and low-cost multi-GNSS receiver (positioning accuracy: 2-2.5 m or better, p = 0.50), supported with a Fluxgate magnetic compass with a high course measurement accuracy of 0.3 degrees (p = 0.50 at 30 m/s). The research has shown that despite the considerable difference in the positioning accuracy of both devices and incomparably different costs of both solutions, the authors proved that the use of the GNSS RTK positioning system, as opposed to a multi-GNSS system supported with a Fluxgate magnetic compass, influences the precision of USV following sounding profiles to an insignificant extent.

ID ONLINE ESTIMATION
AB The navigation systems of autonomous aircraft rely on the readings provided by a suite of onboard sensors to estimate the aircraft state. In the case of fixed wing vehicles, the sensor suite is usually composed by triads of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers, a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver, and an air data system (Pitot tube, air vanes, thermometer, and barometer), and it is often complemented by one or more digital cameras. An accurate representation of the behavior and error sources of each of these sensors, together with the images generated by the cameras, is indispensable for the design, development, and testing of inertial, visual, or visual-inertial navigation algorithms. This article presents realistic and customizable models for each of these sensors; a ready-to-use C++ implementation is released as open-source code so non-experts in the field can easily generate realistic results. The pseudo-random models provide a time-stamped series of the errors generated by each sensor based on performance values and operating frequencies obtainable from the sensor's data sheets. If in addition, the simulated true pose (position plus attitude) of the aircraft is provided, the camera model generates realistic images of the Earth's surface that resemble those taken with a real camera from the same pose.

AB The high-precision navigation and positioning ability of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) is the key factor to reflect its degree of automation. Visual navigation based on image matching has become one of the important research fields for UAV to realize autonomous navigation, because of its low cost, strong anti-jamming ability, and good location result. However, the visual quality of images captured by UAV will be seriously affected by some factors, such as weak illumination conditions or insufficient performance of its sensors. Resolving a series of degradation of low-light images can improve the visual quality and enhance the performance of UAV visual navigation. In this paper, we propose a novel fully convolutional network based on the Retinex theory to solve the degradations of low-light images captured by UAV, which can improve the visual quality of the images and visual matching performance effectively. At the same time, a visual navigation system is designed based on the proposed network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing methods by a large margin both quantitatively and qualitatively, and effectively improves the performance of the image matching algorithms. The visual navigation system can successfully realize the self-localization of UAV under different illumination conditions. Moreover, we also prove that our method is also effective in other practical tasks (e.g. autonomous driving).

AB The close observation of orbiting objects with Cubesats can efficiently support a wide range of applications, such as the inspection of defunct satellites for preparing active debris removal missions, or the inspection of operative spacecraft (International Space Station, telecom satellites) for maintenance purposes. Future applications can involve inspection of deep space objects, for example the cis-lunar human-tended station, that will constitute the Gateway for future exploration missions. From the ISS mission, it has been understood that an inhabited outpost in space needs heavy maintenance for keeping it in operations with the required capabilities and safety level over a long-duration mission. Inspection from outside the station is required for investigation on detected anomalies or for preventing failures, for structural measurements, and in general for monitoring the station configuration. Small space (semi)autonomous drones, such as CubeSats, can be deployed from transportation vehicles or from the station, and used in several phases of the mission, flying in the vicinity of the space habitat. The study presented in this paper investigates the feasibility of operating multi-purpose small inspectors in proximity of the future Lunar Orbiting Platform. The study focuses on the inspection/surveillance mission, for which a concept of operations and architecture have been developed and analysed. In particular, the possibility to have 3D vision and multispectral payloads has been investigated, to enhance inspection capabilities with respect to current state-of-the-art technology.

AB The accuracy and performance of deep neural network models become important issues as the applications of deep learning increase. For example, the navigation system of autonomous self-driving vehicles requires very accurate deep learning models. If a self-driving car fails to detect a pedestrian in bad weather, the result can be devastating. If we can increase the model accuracy by increasing the training data, the probability of avoiding such scenarios increases significantly. However, the problem of privacy for consumers and lack of enthusiasm for sharing their personal data, e.g., the recordings of their self-driving car, is an obstacle for using this valuable data. In Blockchain technology, many entities which cannot trust each other in normal conditions can join together to achieve a mutual goal. In this paper, a secure decentralized peer-to-peer framework for training the deep neural network models based on the distributed ledger technology in Blockchain ecosystem is proposed. The proposed framework anonymizes the identity of data providers and therefore can be used as an incentive for consumers to share their private data for training deep learning models. The proposed framework uses the Stellar Blockchain infrastructure for secure decentralized training of the deep models. A deep learning coin is proposed for Blockchain compensation.

AB It is well-known that switched reluctance motor, as a non-linear load, is a source of current ripples which reduces the life time of proton exchange membrane fuel cells and significantly affects their performances. In this work, optimal operations of autonomous stacked proton membrane fuel cells serving a switched reluctance motor are anticipated. Overall model comprising proton exchange membrane fuel cells stack and switched reluctance motor along with necessary interface and control elements are implemented using MATLAB/SIMULINK. Three key objectives are adopted to be optimized either individually or simultaneously such as: i) proton exchange membrane fuel cells stack efficiency, ii) torque per ampere ratio, and iii) torque smoothness factor. Six decision controlling parameters e.g. fuel cells' temperature, air flow rate, air pressure, fuel pressure, and turn on/off angles of switched reluctance motor represent the search space of dragonfly algorithm. Numerical results indicate that the proposed dragonfly algorithm-based method is capable of increasing proton exchange membrane fuel cells stack energy saving, and reducing of hydrogen consumption, ripples in switched reluctance motor torque and current of proton exchange membrane fuel cells stack. Finally, results generated by the dragonfly algorithm are appraised compared to those obtained by genetic algorithm which signifies its value. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Self-driving vehicles and autonomous ground robots require a reliable and accurate method to analyze the traversability of the surrounding environment for safe navigation. This paper proposes and evaluates a real-time machine learning-based traversability analysis method that combines geometric features with a pyramid-polar space representation based on SVM classifiers. In particular, we show that by fusing geometric features with information stemming from coarser pyramid levels that account for a broader space portion, as well as integrating important implementation details, allows for a noticeable boost in performance and reliability. The main goal of this work is to demonstrate that traversability analysis is possible with effective results and in real-time even on cheaper hardware than expensive GPUs, e.g. CPU-only PCs. The proposed approach has been compared with state-of-the-art deep learning approaches on publicly available datasets of outdoor driving scenarios, running such algorithms both on GPU and CPU to compare runtimes. Our method can be fully executed on CPU and achieves results close to the best-in-class methods, runs faster, and requires fewer and less expensive hardware resources, consuming less than 30% electrical power with respect to deep learning models on embedded processing units. We release with this paper the open-source implementation of our method.

AB Mitigation of threats posed to marine mammals by human activities can be greatly improved with a better understanding of animal occurrence in real time. Recent advancements have enabled low-power passive acoustic systems to be integrated into long-endurance autonomous platforms for persistent near real-time monitoring of marine mammals via the sounds they produce. Here, the integration of a passive acoustic instrument capable of real-time detection and classification of low-frequency (LF) tonal sounds with a Liquid Robotics wave glider is reported. The goal of the integration was to enable monitoring of LF calls produced by baleen whales over periods of several months. Mechanical noises produced by the platform were significantly reduced by lubricating moving parts with polytetrafluoroethylene, incorporating rubber and springs to decelerate moving parts and shock mounting hydrophones. Flow noise was reduced with the development of a 21-element hydrophone array. Surface noise produced by breaking waves was not mitigated despite experimentation with baffles. Compared to a well-characterized moored passive acoustic monitoring buoy, the system greatly underestimated the occurrence of sei, fin, and North Atlantic right whales during a 37-d deployment, and therefore is not suitable in its current configuration for use in scientific or management applications for these species at this time.

AB We have developed a tailless, two-winged flapping drone with a full span length of 180 mm and a total weight of 20.5 g. The developed flapping drone is characterized by three biomimetic techniques: an anisotropic vein pattern reinforcing the wing surfaces, an elastic flapping mechanism, and gravity center position control in the abdomen. On the basis of experimental and numerical results, the flapping wings are reinforced by a vein pattern made of an anisotropic carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminate to passively provide appropriate aeroelastic deformation and positively utilize snap-though buckling on the wing surface at stroke reversals to provide a fast feathering rotation. The flapping wing kinematics are provided by a novel flapping mechanism with an energy recovery system using the elasticity of the mechanical system. Unlike other previously developed flapping robots, feedback control to stabilize the pitch and roll angles of the drone's body is conducted using a technique of gravity center position control, where the tail angles of the body are changed similarly to the abdominal movements of insects in flight. The developed flapping drone has succeeded in an autonomous hovering flight for more than 30 s and a vertical take-off under a wireless condition with the gravity center position control.

AB In vivo chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) can serve as a reasonable estimator of in situ phytoplankton biomass with the benefits of efficiently and affordably extending the global chlorophyll (Chl) data set in time and space to remote oceanic regions where routine sampling by other vessels is uncommon. However, in vivo Chlf measurements require correction for known, spurious biases relative to other measures of Chl concentration, including satellite ocean color retrievals. Spurious biases affecting in vivo Chit; measurements include biofouling, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence, calibration offsets, and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). A more evenly distributed global sampling of in vivo ChlF would provide additional confidence in estimates of uncertainty for satellite ocean color retrievals. A Saildrone semi-autonomous, ocean-going, solar- and wind-powered surface drone recently measured a variety of ocean and atmospheric parameters, including ChlF, during a 60-day deployment in mid-2018 in the California Current region. Correcting the Saildrone ChlF data for known biases, including deriving an NPQ-correction, greatly improved the agreement between the drone measurements and satellite ocean color retrievals from MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS-SNPP, highlighting that once these considerations are made, Saildrone semi-autonomous surface vehicles are a valuable, emerging data source for ocean and ecosystem monitoring.

AB In the autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) docking process, the bow wave generated by the receiver has a strong effect on the drogue, which affects the docking success rate greatly. Thus, a deep learning based trajectory optimization method which aims to decrease the bow wave effect on the drogue is proposed in this paper. There are mainly three parts in the proposed trajectory optimization method. Firstly, a precise bow wave model based on deep learning is presented to estimate the bow wave effect on the drogue. Furthermore, due to the dynamic characteristic of the drogue, a simple and practical drogue motion prediction model under multiple disturbances is carried out to provide a precise prediction of the drogue position at the next time. Moreover, considering the strict attitude constraints requirements in the AAR docking process, a novel reference observer is designed to estimate the receiver attitude from the optimized trajectory under wind perturbations. Then, the proposed trajectory optimization method could not only diminish the bow wave effect on the drogue largely but also satisfy the attitude constraints of the receiver. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by the simulations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB In the future, mobile robots may be able to assist rescue crews in search and rescue missions that take place in the dangerous environments that result from natural or man-made disasters. In 2006, we launched a research project to develop mobile robots that can rapidly collect information in the initial stages of a disaster. One of our important objectives is three-dimensional (3D) mapping, which can be a very useful tool for assisting rescue crews in strategizing rescue missions. To realize this 3D mapping, we identified five issues that we needed to address: (1) autonomous traversal of uneven terrain, (2) development of a system for the continuous acquisition of 3D data of the environment, (3) coverage path planning, (4) centralization of map data obtained by multiple robots, and (5) fusion of map data obtained by multiple robots. We solved each problem through our joint research. Each research institute in our group took charge of solving one of the above issues according to its area of expertise. We integrated these solutions to perform 3D mapping using our tracked vehicle, Kenaf. To validate our integrated autonomous 3D mapping system, we participated in RoboCupRescue 2009 and demonstrated our system using multiple robots on the RoboCupRescue field. In this paper, we introduce our mapping system and report the mapping results obtained at the RoboCupRescue event. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB As AI Systems become increasingly autonomous, they are expected to engage in decision-making processes that have moral implications. In this research we integrate theoretical and empirical lines of thought to address the matters of moral reasoning and moral uncertainty in AI Systems. We reconceptualize the metanormative framework for decision-making under moral uncertainty and we operationalize it through a latent class choice model. The core idea being that moral heterogeneity in society can be codified in terms of a small number of classes with distinct moral preferences and that this codification can be used to express moral uncertainty of an AI. Choice analysis allows for the identification of classes and their moral preferences based on observed choice data. Our reformulation of the metanormative framework is theory-rooted and practical in the sense that it avoids runtime issues in real time applications. To illustrate our approach we conceptualize a society in which AI Systems are in charge of making policy choices. While one of the systems uses a baseline morally certain model, the other uses a morally uncertain model. We highlight cases in which the AI Systems disagree about the policy to be chosen, thus illustrating the need to capture moral uncertainty in AI systems.

AB In the near future, the communication between autonomous cars will produce a network of sensors that will allow us to know the state of the roads in real time. Lidar technology, upon which most autonomous cars are based, allows the acquisition of 3D geometric information of the environment. The objective of this work is to use point clouds acquired by Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) to segment the main elements of road environment (road surface, ditches, guardrails, fences, embankments, and borders) through the use of PointNet. Previously, the point cloud was automatically divided into sections in order for semantic segmentation to be scalable to different case studies, regardless of their shape or length. An overall accuracy of 92.5% has been obtained, but with large variations between classes. Elements with a greater number of points have been segmented more effectively than the other elements. In comparison with other point-by-point extraction and ANN-based classification techniques, the same success rates have been obtained for road surfaces and fences, and better results have been obtained for guardrails. Semantic segmentation with PointNet is suitable when segmenting the scene as a whole, however, if certain classes have more interest, there are other alternatives that do not need a high training cost.

AB Autonomous racing has increasingly become a research subject as it provides insights into dynamic, high-speed situations. One crucial aspect of handling these situations, especially in the presence of dynamic obstacles, is the generation of a collision-free trajectory that represents a safe behavior and is also competitive in the case of racing. We propose a local planning approach that generates such trajectories for a racing car on an oval race track by searching a spatiotemporal graph. A considerable challenge of search-based methods in a spatiotemporal domain is the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, we propose how a previously presented graph structure that is based on intervals instead of discrete values can be searched more efficiently without losing optimality by using a uniform-cost search strategy. We extend the search method to make it anytime-capable so that it can provide a suboptimal trajectory even if the search has to be terminated early. The graph-based planning approach allows us to apply a flexible cost function so that our approach can operate fully autonomously on an oval race track, including the pit lane. We present a cost function for oval racing and explain how the terms contribute to the desired behaviors. This is supported by results with a full-scale prototype.

AB Warehouses are becoming increasingly robotized. Autonomous rack-climbing robots have recently been introduced in e-commerce fulfillment centers. The robots not only retrieve loads from any level in a rack but also, roam the warehouse and bring the loads to order picking stations without using conveyors or lifts. This paper models and analyzes this system under both single and dual commands with different robot assignment (dedicated versus shared) and storage location assignment (class-based and random) policies. We study these policies in the presence of robot congestion. We evaluate the impact of two blocking protocols, a wait-outside-aisle policy and a block-and-recirculate policy, on the order throughput time. The system is modeled using semiopen queuing networks (SOQNs) for the different operating policies. The analytical models are validated using simulation. We also use this model to compare this system with a shuttle-based system. The results show that (1) the choice of the wait-outside-aisle policy or the block-and-recirculate policy mainly depends on the number of the robots in the system and the throughput requirement and that (2) the dedicated robot assignment policy can be an attractive policy, especially for a large system.

AB Know thy star, know thy planet, ... especially in the ultraviolet (UV). Over the past decade, that motto has grown from mere wish to necessity in the M dwarf regime, given that the intense and highly variable UV radiation from these stars is suspected of strongly impacting their planets' habitability and atmospheric loss. This has led to the development of the Star-Planet Activity Research CubeSat (SPARCS), a NASA-funded 6U CubeSat observatory fully devoted to the photometric monitoring of the UV flaring of M dwarfs hosting potentially habitable planets. The SPARCS science imaging system uses a 9-cm telescope that feeds two delta- doped UV-optimized CCDs through a dichroic beam splitter, enabling simultaneous monitoring of a target field in the near-UV and far-UV. A dedicated onboard payload processor manages science observations and performs near-real-time image processing to sustain an autonomous dynamic exposure control algorithm needed to mitigate pixel saturation during flaring events. The mission is currently halfway into its development phase. We present an overview of the mission's science drivers and its expected contribution to our understanding of star-planet interactions. We also present the expected performance of the autonomous dynamic exposure control algorithm, a first-of-its-kind onboard a space-based stellar astrophysics observatory.

AB This article proposes an autonomous docking control for nonholonomic constrained mobile robots and applies it to an intelligent mobility device or wheelchair for assisting the user in approaching resting furniture such as a chair or a bed. We defined a virtual landmark inferred from the target docking destination. Then, we solve the problem of keeping the targeted volume inside the field of view (FOV) of a tracking camera and docking to the virtual landmark through a novel definition that enables to control for the desired end pose. In this article, we proposed a nonlinear feedback controller to perform the docking with the depth camera's FOV as a constraint.Then, a numerical method is proposed to find the feasible space of initial states where convergence could be guaranteed. Finally, the entire system was embedded for real-time operation on a standing wheelchair with the virtual landmark estimation by three-dimensional object tracking with an RGB-D camera and we validated the effectiveness in simulation and experimental evaluations. The results show the guaranteed convergence for the feasible space depending on the virtual landmark location. In the implementation, the robot converges to the virtual landmark while respecting the FOV constraints.

AB Recognizing human actions, reliably inferring their meaning and being able to potentially exchange mutual social information are core challenges for autonomous systems when they directly share the same space with humans. Intelligent transport systems in particular face this challenge, as interactions with people are often required. The development and testing of technical perception solutions is done mostly on standard vision benchmark datasets for which manual labelling of sensory ground truth has been a tedious but necessary task. Furthermore, rarely occurring human activities are underrepresented in these datasets, leading to algorithms not recognizing such activities. For this purpose, we introduce a modular simulation framework, which offers to train and validate algorithms on various human-centred scenarios. We describe the usage of simulation data to train a state-of-the-art human pose estimation algorithm to recognize unusual human activities in urban areas. Since the recognition of human actions can be an important component of intelligent transport systems, we investigated how simulations can be applied for his purpose. Laboratory experiments show that we can train a recurrent neural network with only simulated data based on motion capture data and 3D avatars, which achieves an almost perfect performance in the classification of those human actions on real data.

AB Due to the increasing demands of onboard sensor and autonomous processing, one of the principal needs and challenges for future spacecraft is onboard computing. Space computers must provide high performance and reliability (which are often at odds), using limited resources (power, size, weight, and cost), in an extremely harsh environment (due to radiation, temperature, vacuum, and vibration). As spacecraft shrink in size, while assuming a growing role for science and defense missions, the challenges for space computing become particularly acute. For example, processing capabilities on CubeSats (smaller class of SmallSats) have been extremely limited to date, often featuring microcontrollers with performance and reliability barely sufficient to operate the vehicle let alone support various sensor and autonomous applications. This article surveys the challenges and opportunities of onboard computers for small satellites (SmallSats) and focuses upon new concepts, methods, and technologies that are revolutionizing their capabilities, in terms of two guiding themes: hybrid computing and reconfigurable computing. These innovations are of particular need and value to CubeSats and other SmallSats. With new technologies, such as CHREC Space Processor (CSP), we demonstrate how system designers can exploit hybrid and reconfigurable computing on SmallSats to harness these advantages for a variety of purposes, and we highlight several recent missions by NASA and industry that feature these principles and technologies.

   light detection and rangings (LiDAR)
AB Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) limitations in adverse weather (e.g., rain, fog, and snow) prevent adopting high-level autonomous vehicles in all weather conditions. Furthermore, collecting and annotating these sparse point clouds in adverse weather is often cumbersome, inefficient, and expensive. In this article, we propose a data-driven approach to statistically model the performance of a popular near-infrared (NIR) time-of-flight (ToF) LiDAR in fog, with noisy point clouds collected in a well-controlled artificial fog chamber. Given manually defined visibility describing the levels of fog, our models can directly forecast a probability distribution of a laser's noisy range measurement. Moreover, the real road data collected in clear weather is utilized to produce auto-labeled noisy point clouds using a LiDAR performance simulator, which is then used to train a semantic segmentation network to recognize point cloud noise in the real world in adverse weather. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results verify the applicability of our LiDAR performance models in fog and show how our Sim2Real strategy of the denoising algorithm can be applied to noisy point clouds under various weather conditions. The developed robot operating system (ROS) packages are publicly available at: https://github.com/cavayangtao/lanoise_pp.

AB In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have rapidly developed, but the illegal use of UAVs by civilians has resulted in disorder and security risks and has increasingly triggered the community concern and worry. Therefore, the monitoring and recycling of UAVs in key regions are of great significance. This paper presents novel panoramic UAV surveillance and autonomous recycling system that is based on the unique structure-free fisheye camera array and has the capability of real-time UAV detection, 3D localization, tracking, and recycling capacity over a very wide field of view. The main characteristics of this paper include the following: 1) constructing a structure-free camera-array-based panoramic UAV surveillance and recycling system; 2) designing a robust dynamic near-infrared laser-source-based self-calibration algorithm for large-scale arbitrary layout of the camera array; and 3) presenting a set of UAV detection, 3D localization, tracking, and autonomous recycling algorithms based on a fish-eye camera array. The system has been tested in various challenging scenarios, including multiple UAVs with significant appearance and scale changes and even poor weather conditions. The extensive experimental results analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively, and the analysis of the time performance demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed system. In addition, we successfully conduct a recycling and landing experiment with the Parrot Beobop.

AB Autonomous navigation systems for mobile robots have been successfully deployed for a wide range of planar ground-based tasks. However, very few counterparts of previous planar navigation systems were developed for 3-D motion, which is needed for both unmanned aerial and underwater vehicles. A novel fuzzy behavioral scheme for navigating an unmanned helicopter in cluttered 3-D spaces is developed. The 3-D navigation problem is decomposed into several identical 2-D navigation subproblems, each of which is solved by using preference-based fuzzy behaviors. Due to the shortcomings of vector summation during the fusion of the 2-D subproblems, instead of directly outputting steering subdirections by their own defuzzification processes, the intermediate preferences of the subproblems are fused to create a 3-D solution region, representing degrees of preference for the robot movement. A new defuzzification algorithm that steers the robot by finding the centroid of a 3-D convex region of maximum volume in the 3-D solution region is developed. A fuzzy speed-control system is also developed to ensure efficient and safe navigation. Substantial simulations have been carried out to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can smoothly and effectively guide an unmanned helicopter through unknown and cluttered urban and forest environments.

DE Maritime autonomous surface ship; 3D LiDAR; Multi-object tracking;
   Environment perception
AB Reliable object tracking is a key ingredient for maritime autonomous surface ship (MASS), which can perceive surrounding objects and predict their motion state. Existing tracking algorithms mainly rely on visual sensor, and their application background is predominantly concentrated in the field of unmanned vehicles. In this paper, a scheme of directly processing LiDAR point cloud is proposed to achieve accurate and stable multi-object tracking in nearshore scenario. Firstly, based on the point cloud clustering results, an object position and volume esti-mation method is investigated. Then, the geometric distribution and 3D shape descriptors are conceived to construct the time-varying affinity matrix. The data association results are forwarded into a Kalman Filter based tracker life management mechanism. Finally, the remaining scattered points and unqualified trackers are composed into a point set, which is then modeled by convex polygons. The real-world experiment results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed maritime perception framework in tracking objects and mapping the ambience in a bustling lake. Compared with annotated ground-truth, the average multi-object tracking precision and ac-curacy is 0.69 m and 85%, respectively. And the average computational frequency achieves 29Hz. The proposed scheme successfully applies LiDAR to the field of sea surface object tracking, which provides a practical and meaningful reference for the application of LiDAR in MASS.

AB The conventional device authentication of wireless networks usually relies on a security server and centralized process, leading to long latency and risk of single-point of failure. While these challenges might be mitigated by collaborative authentication schemes, their performance remains limited by the rigidity of data collection and aggregated result. They also tend to ignore attacker localization in the collaborative authentication process. To overcome these challenges, a novel collaborative authentication scheme is proposed, where multiple edge devices act as cooperative peers to assist the service provider in distributively authenticating its users by estimating their received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and mobility trajectory (TRA). More explicitly, a distributed learning-based collaborative authentication algorithm is conceived, where the cooperative peers update their authentication models locally, thus the network congestion and response time remain low. Moreover, a situation-aware secure group update algorithm is proposed for autonomously refreshing the set of cooperative peers in the dynamic environment. We also develop an algorithm for localizing a malicious user by the cooperative peers once it is identified. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is eminently suitable for both indoor and outdoor communication scenarios, and outperforms some existing benchmark schemes.

AB This study intends to address the platoon formation control problem of a team of N electrically driven underactuated autonomous car-like mobile robots. A platoon controller is proposed by using the relative distance and angle between each two successive robots in the platoon. A high-gain observer is also used to leave out velocity sensors to reduce the cost of the implementation/maintenance and the weight of the robots. Then, the dynamic surface control method is used to prevent complexity of the controller design. Next, by utilizing the prescribed performance bound method, predetermined desired transient and steady-state behavior of the tracking formation errors, robots connectivity preservation, and their collision avoidance are guaranteed as well as singularity avoidance. Adaptive neural networks and adaptive robust controllers are used to improve the tracking performance in the presence of parametric and nonparametric uncertainties, unmodeled dynamics, actuator saturation nonlinearity, and unwanted external disturbances including exogenous forces and torques, friction, and vibration. The Lyapunov direct method proves that all signals of the closed-loop control system are uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, simulation results are demonstrated to show the superiority of the proposed convoy tracking system.

AB The accuracy of trajectory tracking and stable operation with heavy load are the main challenges of parallel mechanism for wheel-legged robots, especially in complex road conditions. To guarantee the tracking performance in an uncertain environment, the disturbances, including the internal-robot friction and external-robot and environment interaction forces, should be considered in the robot's dynamical system. In this article, a neural fuzzy-based model predictive tracking scheme (NFMPC) for reliable tracking control is proposed to the developed four wheel-legged robot, and the fuzzy neural network approximation is applied to estimate the unknown physical interaction and external dynamics of the robot system. Meanwhile, the advanced parallel mechanism of the four wheel-legged robot (BIT-NAZA) is introduced. Finally, co-simulation and experiment results using the BIT-NAZA robot derived from the proposed hybrid control strategy indicate that the methodology can achieve satisfactory tracking performance in terms of accuracy and stability. This research can provide theoretical and engineering guidance for lateral stability of intelligent robots under unknown disturbances and uncertain nonlinearities, and facilitate the control performance of the wheel-legged robot in a practical system.

AB For many applications such as environmental monitoring in the aftermath of a natural disaster and mountain search-and-rescue, swarms of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to provide a highly versatile and often relatively inexpensive sensing platform. Their ability to operate as an 'eye-in-the-sky', processing and relaying real-time colour imagery and other sensor readings facilitate the removal of humans from situations which may be considered dull, dangerous or dirty. However, as with manned aircraft they are likely to encounter errors, the most serious of which may require the UAV to land as quickly and safely as possible. Within this paper we therefore present novel work on autonomously identifying Safe Landing Zones (SLZs) which can be utilised upon occurrence of a safety critical event. Safe Landing Zones are detected and subsequently assigned a safety score either solely using multichannel aerial imagery or, whenever practicable by fusing knowledge in the form of Ordnance Survey (OS) map data with such imagery. Given the real-time nature of the problem we subsequently model two SLZ detection options one of which utilises knowledge enabling the UAV to choose an optimal, viable solution. Results are presented based on colour aerial imagery captured during manned flight demonstrating practical potential in the methods discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The behavior-based approach to autonomous robotics has been quite successful at designing systems capable of simple reactive behaviors that are flexibly activated. Progress towards larger behavioral complexity and towards the equivalent of cognitive abilities has been hampered, however, by the very absence of representations in this approach. Also, a need for a theoretically analyzable general architecture for system integration has been recognized. We propose an architecture based on dynamic neural fields which aims to deal with both of these shortcomings. Sensory processing, representation, planning, and control are all addressed in the same terms by defining adequate levels of description. At each level a dynamic neural field with strong internal interactions is capable of generating behavior or its representation. Levels are mutually coupled by specifying for each other adequate representations.
   We demonstrate the architecture by solving the standard problem of target acquisition and obstacle avoidance for a vehicle moving in two dimensions. The limited viewing angle of a visual sensor is used to demonstrate in exemplary fashion the properties of subsymbolic memory as implemented by the dynamic fields. We show how representation alleviates the problem of spurious states in potential field approaches. Also, we demonstrate how memory enhances the system's capability to escape from closed-in situations (e.g., canyon boxes), and, more, generally, endows the system with cognitive features.

AB Groundwater discharge into the sea occurs along many coastlines around the world in different geological settings and constitutes an important component of global water and matter budget. Estimates of how much water flows into the sea worldwide vary widely and are largely based on onshore studies and hydrological or hydrogeological modeling. In this study, we propose an approach to quantify a deep submarine groundwater outflow from the seafloor by using autonomously measured ocean surface data, i.e., 222Rn as groundwater tracer, in combination with numerical modeling of plume transport. The model and field data suggest that groundwater outflows from a water depth of similar to 100 m can reach the sea surface implying that several cubic meters per second of freshwater are discharged into the sea. We postulate an extreme rainfall event 6 months earlier as the likely trigger for the groundwater discharge. This study shows that measurements at the sea surface, which are much easier to conduct than discharge measurements at the seafloor, can be used not only to localize submarine groundwater discharges but, in combination with plume modeling, also to estimate the magnitude of the release flow rate.

TI Three-bead steering microswimmers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
ID LOW-REYNOLDS-NUMBER
AB The self-propelled microswimmers have recently attracted considerable attention as model systems for biological cell migration as well as artificial micromachines. A simple and well-studied microswimmer model consists of three identical spherical beads joined by two springs in a linear fashion with active oscillatory forces being applied on the beads to generate self-propulsion. We have extended this linear microswimmer configuration to a triangular geometry where the three beads are connected by three identical springs in an equilateral triangular manner. The active forces acting on each spring can lead to autonomous steering motion; i.e., allowing the swimmer to move along arbitrary paths. We explore the microswimmer dynamics analytically and pinpoint its rich character depending on the nature of the active forces. The microswimmers can translate along a straight trajectory, rotate at a fixed location, as well as perform a simultaneous translation and rotation resulting in complex curved trajectories. The sinusoidal active forces on the three springs of the microswimmer contain naturally four operating parameters which are more than required for the steering motion. We identify the minimal operating parameters which are essential for the motion of the microswimmer along any given arbitrary trajectory. Therefore, along with providing insights into the mechanics of the complex motion of the natural and artificial microswimmers, the triangular three-bead microswimmer can be utilized as a model for targeted drug delivery systems and autonomous underwater vehicles where intricate trajectories are involved.

AB The integrated navigation method based on Inertial Navigation System (INS) and star sensor is a fully autonomous navigation technology. The algorithm employs navigation information from a star sensor as a benchmark to perform periodic recalibration of INS divergent position error. However, when Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) floats to the surface of the ocean, it displays a rocking motion, due to waves and other factors. This motion results in the star map acquired by star sensor appears trailing phenomenon. Thus, the navigation information obtained from star sensor cannot be used as benchmark information. To solve this problem, an integrated navigation method based on INS and star sensor using the Adaptive Differential Evolution Back Propagation Neural Network (ADE-BPNN) to predict carrier attitude is proposed in this paper. The ADE-BPNN time series forecasting technology enables the use of data describing the integrated navigation attitude over a period of time to predict the attitude of the carrier when a star map appears the trailing phenomenon. The effectiveness of this approach was demonstrated by simulation and experimental study. The results show that this approach can estimate the navigation errors of star sensor and INS. Therefore, the INS/star sensor integrated navigation accuracy is improved.

AB Autonomous networks of sensor platforms can be designed to interact in dynamic and noisy environments to determine the occurrence of specified transient events that define the dynamic process of interest. For example, a sensor network may be used for battlefield surveillance with the purpose of detecting, identifying, and tracking enemy activity. When the number of nodes is large, human oversight and control of low-level operations is not feasible. Coordination and self-organization of multiple autonomous nodes is necessary to maintain connectivity and sensor coverage and to combine information for better understanding the dynamics of the environment. Resource conservation requires adaptive clustering in the vicinity of the event. This paper presents methods for dynamic distributed signal processing using an ad hoc mobile network of microsensors to detect, identify, and track targets in noisy environments. They seamlessly integrate data from fixed and mobile platforms and dynamically organize platforms into clusters to process local data along the trajectory of the targets. Local analysis of sensor data is used to determine a set of target attribute values and classify the target. Sensor data from a field test in the Marine base at Twentynine Palms, Calif, was analyzed using the techniques described in this paper. The results were compared to "ground truth" data obtained from GPS receivers on the vehicles.

AB Object detection is a fundamental function of many intelligent autonomous systems such as service robots or autonomous vehicles. State-of-the-art 3D object detection methods are deep learning methods which require large amounts of annotated data for successful training. Acquiring and labeling real-world data is an expensive and time-consuming task. An alternative is to train object detectors using synthetically generated images. Since modern object detectors trained on synthetic data still do not achieve similar results to those trained on real data, generating realistic synthetic data is still an open issue. We address the problem of object detection in indoor environments based on 3D point clouds acquired by 3D cameras. We provide a detailed insight into the importance of five factors involved in generating synthetic data: camera noise, presence of background objects, positioning of objects, scene context, and object sizes. To investigate the importance of these factors, we have developed a fully modular method for generating realistic synthetic single-view point clouds for training object detectors. Our method can generate large amounts of customizable data in a short time. An interesting finding is that pre-training with our data and fine-tuning with real data improves the performance of 3D object detectors, enabling one of them to achieve state-of-the-art results on one of the benchmarks without the use of RGB data.

AB Autonomous landing of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in crowded scenarios is crucial for successful deployment of UAVs in populated areas, particularly in emergency landing situations where the highest priority is to avoid hurting people. In this work, a new visual-based algorithm for identifying Safe Landing Zones (SLZ) in crowded scenarios is proposed, considering a camera mounted on a UAV, where the people in the scene move with unknown dynamics. To do so, a density map is generated for each image frame using a Deep Neural Network, from where a binary occupancy map is obtained aiming to overestimate the people's location for security reasons. Then, the occupancy map is projected to the head's plane, and the SLZ candidates are obtained as circular regions with a minimum security radius, within the head's plane. Finally, to keep track of the SLZ candidates, a multiple instance tracking algorithm is implemented using Kalman Filters along with the Hungarian algorithm for data association. Several scenarios were studied to prove the validity of the proposed strategy, including public datasets and real uncontrolled scenarios with people moving in public squares, taken from a UAV in flight. The study showed promising results in the search of preventing the UAV from hurting people during emergency landing.

AB Intelligent driver assistance systems are becoming increasingly popular in modern passenger vehicles. A crucial component of intelligent vehicles is the ability to detect vulnerable road users (VRUs) for an early and safe response. However, standard imaging sensors perform poorly in conditions of strong illumination contrast, such as approaching a tunnel or at night, due to their dynamic range limitations. In this paper, we focus on the use of high-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging sensors in vehicle perception systems and the subsequent need for tone mapping of the acquired data into a standard 8-bit representation. To our knowledge, no previous studies have evaluated the impact of tone mapping on object detection performance. We investigate the potential for optimizing HDR tone mapping to achieve a natural image appearance while facilitating object detection of state-of-the-art detectors designed for standard dynamic range (SDR) images. Our proposed approach relies on a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) that tone maps HDR video frames into a standard 8-bit representation. We introduce a novel training approach called detection-informed tone mapping (DI-TM) and evaluate its performance with respect to its effectiveness and robustness in various scene conditions, as well as its performance relative to an existing state-of-the-art tone mapping method. The results show that the proposed DI-TM method achieves the best results in terms of detection performance metrics in challenging dynamic range conditions, while both methods perform well in typical, non-challenging conditions. In challenging conditions, our method improves the detection F2 score by 13%. Compared to SDR images, the increase in F2 score is 49%.

AB This paper investigates user scheduling and trajectory optimization for a network supported by an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The IRS is powered via the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) technique. The IRS boosts users uplink signals to improve the network longevity and energy efficiency. It simultaneously harvests energy with a non-linear energy harvesting circuit and reflects the incident signals by controlling its reflection coefficients and phase shifts. The trajectory of the UAV impacts the efficiency of these operations. We minimize the maximum energy consumption of all users by joint optimization of user scheduling, UAV trajectory/velocity, and IRS phase shifts/reflection coefficients while guaranteeing each user minimum required data rate and harvested energy of the IRS. We first derive a closed-form solution for the IRS phase shifts and then address the non-convexity of the critical problem. Finally, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to optimize the remaining variables iteratively. We demonstrate the gains over several benchmarks. For instance, with a 50-element IRS, min-max energy consumption can be as low as 0.0404 (Joule), a 7.13% improvement over the No IRS case (achieving 0.0435 (Joule)). We also show that IRS-UAV without EH performs best at the cost of circuit power consumption of the IRS (a 20% improvement over the No IRS case).

AB As complex autonomous systems become increasingly ubiquitous, their deployment and integration into our daily lives will become a significant endeavor. Human-machine trust relationship is now acknowledged as one of the primary aspects that characterize a successful integration. In the context of human-machine interaction (HMI), proper use of machines and autonomous systems depends both on the human and machine counterparts. On one hand, it depends on how well the human relies on the machine regarding the situation or task at hand based on willingness and experience. On the other hand, it depends on how well the machine carries out the task and how well it conveys important information on how the job is done. Furthermore, proper calibration of trust for effective HMI requires the factors affecting trust to be properly accounted for and their relative importance to be rightly quantified. In this article, the functional understanding of human-machine trust is viewed from two perspectives-human-centric and machine- centric. The human aspect of the discussion outlines factors, scales, and approaches, which are available to measure and calibrate human trust. The discussion on the machine aspect spans trustworthy artificial intelligence, built-in machine assurances, and ethical frameworks of trustworthy machines.

AB In order to maintain the submarine equipment, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is usually assigned to track the submarine cables or pipes. The capabilities of navigation and control are critical to track the target accurately. Ultra-short baseline (USBL) is essential equipment for AUV, which uses sound waves for positioning. Unfortunately, due to the low frequency of USBL, it inevitably limits the frequency of control and ultimately affects the tracking effect. In order to improve the aforementioned issue and achieve better tracking tasks, intelligent collaborative navigation and control (CNaC) was herein proposed in this article. First, we proposed nonlinear state reconstruction neural network navigation, which used the neural networks to reconstruct the state between two adjacent USBL valid values online. Combined with the valid USBL and reconstructed states, the online process model generated by neural networks are applied to give the estimate position for AUV. At last, intelligent CNaC use the estimated position and valid USBL as inputs to control AUV to achieve tracking tasks. This strategy makes the control frequency free from the limitation of the USBL frequency. The proposed intelligent CNaC is demonstrated by simulation and real experiments. Compared to mechanically combining the traditional navigation and control algorithm, the tracking accuracy of intelligent CNaC improves by 81.96%.

AB Using the Korean In-Depth Accident Study (KIDAS) database, this study estimated the safety benefits of autonomous emergency braking systems (AEBS). We analyze crash severity using an ordered probit model to identify contributing factors based on the KIDAS database as well as the statistical relationship between collision speed and crush extent. We estimate the change in injury severity after AEBS installation using the results of both analyses. From the results, we identify that adolescence, fastened seatbelts, and crush extent are statistically significantly correlated with the dependent variable, injury severity score. Analysis of the relationship between crush extent and collision speed reveals that the explanatory power of the exponential model is higher than that of the linear model, while evaluating the effect of AEBS using the two relationships shows that it had a maximum injury reduction effect of 25% when the injuries were not minor. Results showing the effectiveness of installing an AEBS are presented, and a method to evaluate the potential safety benefits obtained from the analyses conducted in this study is proposed. The methods used in this study could be useful in promoting the rapid propagation of in-vehicle safety measures and developing relevant policies.

AB Some planktonic patches have markedly higher concentrations of organisms compared to ambient conditions and are <5 m in thickness (i.e. thin layers). Conventional net sampling techniques are unable to resolve this vertical microstructure, while optical imaging systems can measure it for limited durations. Zooglider, an autonomous zooplankton-sensing glider, uses a low-power optical imaging system (Zoocam) to resolve mesozooplankton at a vertical scale of 5 cm while making concurrent physical and acoustic measurements (Zonar). In March 2017, Zooglider was compared with traditional nets (MOCNESS) and ship-based acoustics (Simrad EK80). Zoocam recorded significantly higher vertically integrated abundances of smaller copepods and appendicularians, and larger gelatinous predators and mineralized protists, but similar abundances of chaetognaths, euphausiids, and nauplii. Differences in concentrations and size-frequency distributions are attributable to net extrusion and preservation artifacts, suggesting advantages of in situ imaging of organisms by Zooglider. Zoocam detected much higher local concentrations of copepods and appendicularians (53 000 and 29 000 animals m(-3), respectively) than were resolvable by nets. The EK80 and Zonar at 200 kHz agreed in relative magnitude and distribution of acoustic backscatter. The profiling capability of Zooglider allows for deeper high-frequency acoustic sampling than conventional ship-based acoustics.

ID MOTION UNCERTAINTY; COLLISION
AB We consider the problem of computing a minimum uncertainty path for an autonomous vehicle from a start to a destination location in the presence intermittent sensing, modeled as a stochastic process, in addition to process and measurement noise. We introduce the use of a novel bound on the maximum eigenvalue of the estimation error covariance matrix as the cost function for belief space planning. Our main contributions are three-fold. We first derive an analytic bound on the performance of a state estimator under sensor misdetection (intermittency) occurring stochastically over time. Second, we use this bound as a proxy for the expected maximum eigenvalue evolution in a sample-based path planning algorithm to produce a path that trades off accuracy and robustness. This extends the recent body of work on planning under uncertainty to include the fact that sensors may not provide any measurement owing to misdetection. Computational results demonstrate the benefit of the approach and comparisons are made with the state of the art in path planning in belief space. Third, and finally, we establish theoretically that the proposed algorithm possesses the optimal substructure property, i.e. the algorithm returns an optimal path relative to the bound treated as a proxy for the expected maximum eigenvalue evolution.

TI Object-level complete coverage path planning for excavators in earthwork

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB Autonomous excavators are gradually gaining attention because they can reduce the waste of human resources and improve the efficiency. This study proposed a complete coverage path planning algorithm for autonomous excavators based on the Rotating Calipers Path Planning (RCPP) algorithm, which called the Excavator-Rotating Calipers Path Planning (E-RCPP) algorithm. This study uses boustrophedon cellular decomposition (BCD) to decompose the construction area to obtain the convex and non-convex sub-areas without obstacles, and describes a non-decomposition principle to determine whether to decompose non-convex areas that are difficult to plan. To obtain the optimal path, an adaptive spacing adjustment model which is used to adjust the spacing between parallel paths is designed. To improve the coverage rate at the corner, this study proposed a novel boundary corner turning method. The algorithm's cost function considers the path length, the number of turns, the coverage rate and the overlap rate. The Digital Orthophoto Map (DOM) of the construction area is created by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and cropped into three polygonal areas, the 2D top-views of the them are used for simulation experiments to verify the performance of E-RCPP algorithm, the results show that the E-RCPP algorithm has better performance when applied to the complete coverage path planning for excavator compared with the traditional RCPP algorithm.

AB This study presents an adaptive nonlinear information fusion preview control (NIFPC) method for trajectory tracking of autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) subject to system uncertainty, measurement noise, and unknown input saturations. The NIFPC is developed based on the nonlinear information fusion estimation methodology, in which the system's future reference trajectory information, noise information, performance index requirements, and system dynamic model are all transformed into information equations related to control input, and then the current control action is obtained by fusing these previewed future information via the nonlinear information fusion optimal estimation. In order to avoid the unknown input saturation constraints, a fuzzy asymmetric saturated approximator (FASA) is designed and integrated into the controller, where the fuzzy logic system (FLS) is used to adaptively adjust the key boundary parameters of the approximator. As a result, the negative effects caused by system uncertainty and measurement noise can be effectively suppressed, while the completely unknown input saturation constraints in the system actuator are guaranteed not to be violated. The convergence of the tracking errors of the closed-loop system is guaranteed via Lyapunov stability theory. Numerical simulation results have been provided to demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the proposed control scheme.

AB The increasing complexity of urban environments introduces additional uncertainty to the deployment of the autonomous vehicular network. A novel road infrastructure cooperative detection model using Joint Communication and Sensing (JCS) technology is proposed in this article to simultaneously achieve high-efficient communication and obstacle detection for urban autonomous vehicles. To suppress the performance fluctuation caused by shadowing and obstruction to the JCS signals, we first derive the statistic of road obstacles from the Geographic Information System (GIS). Then, the analysis of JCS channel characteristics and shadowing factors are presented using Line-of-Sight and Non-Line-of-Sight (LoS and NLoS) channel models under the complex urban scenario. A stochastic geometry approach is applied to analyze the interference factors and the probability distribution of successful JCS detection and communication. Simulations have been made to verify the cooperative detection model by probability analysis based on LoS and NLoS channels, and the numerical results demonstrate several different optimization methods for the deployment of JCS road infrastructures. Finally, we simulated and analyzed a deployment optimization method for JCS road infrastructures that complied with the standard of urban traffic-spot structure placement.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; SAFETY; VALIDATION; GENERATION; DESIGN
AB Scenario-based approaches have been receiving a huge amount of attention in research and engineering of automated driving systems. Due to the complexity and uncertainty of the driving environment, and the complexity of the driving task itself, the number of possible driving scenarios that an Automated Driving System or Advanced Driving-Assistance System may encounter is virtually infinite. Therefore it is essential to be able to reason about the identification of scenarios and in particular critical ones that may impose unacceptable risk if not considered. Critical scenarios are particularly important to support design, verification and validation efforts, and as a basis for a safety case. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic mapping study in the context of autonomous driving. The main contributions are: (i) introducing a comprehensive taxonomy for critical scenario identification methods; (ii) giving an overview of the state-of-the-art research based on the taxonomy encompassing 86 papers between 2017 and 2020; and (iii) identifying open issues and directions for further research. The provided taxonomy comprises three main perspectives encompassing the problem definition (the why), the solution (the methods to derive scenarios), and the assessment of the established scenarios. In addition, we discuss open research issues considering the perspectives of coverage, practicability, and scenario space explosion.

AB Collisions at sea are frequently caused by human-related factors, such as; manoeuvre timing mistakes, risk assessment failures and deficiencies in strategies for collision avoidance. These factors reveal the importance of the automation systems in providing safety of navigation. Thus, a decision support system was developed in this study that can be a reference to the ship operators in the implementation of the collision avoidance action, in case of an encounter situation involving risk of collision. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were conducted in the study. In the qualitative research process, the variable constraints in the mathematical model and the inputs of the scenarios implemented in experiments were determined based on the findings obtained from experts' interviews. In the quantitative research process, the problem-solution was reached with the developed algorithm (ColAv_GA), which is formed based on the Genetic Algorithm and Fuzzy Logic. The developed algorithm was validated in a virtual environment using a bridge simulator, and in a real environment with an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), with satisfactory results. The output of this research is expected to contribute to the safety of navigation. The developed algorithm can be used as a collision avoidance sub-module for autonomous ships and ASV.

AB Recently, HD maps have become important parts of autonomous driving, from localization to perception and path planning. For the practical application of HD maps, it is significant to regularly update environmental changes in HD maps. Conventional approaches require expensive mobile mapping systems and considerable manual work by experts, making it difficult to achieve frequent map updates. In this paper, we show how frequent and automatic updates of lane marking in HD maps are made possible with enormous crowdsourced data. Crowdsourced data is acquired from onboard low-cost sensing devices installed on many city buses and taxis in Seoul, South Korea. A large amount of crowdsourced data is daily accumulated on the server. The quality of sensor measurement is not very high due to the limited performance of low-cost devices. Therefore, the technical challenge is to overcome the uncertainty of the crowdsourced data. Appropriately filtering out a large amount of low-quality data is a significant problem. The proposed HD map update strategy comprises several processing steps including pose correction, observation assignment, observation clustering, and landmark classification. The proposed HD map update strategy is experimentally verified using crowdsourced data. If the changed environments are successfully extracted, then precisely updated HD maps are generated.

ID VISION
AB Visual object tracking for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is extensively used in civil and military applications, such as intelligent transportation, disaster rescue, and military reconnaissance. However, when a UAV encounters haze weather, its tracking performance deteriorates greatly because of problems, such as blurring and quality degradation of the collected images. Most trackers are designed to operate in good weather conditions, and this greatly limits the robustness of UAV tracking in haze weather. To solve this problem, this article proposes an adaptive dehazing Siamese network, which consists of an adaptive dehazing module, a dynamic template update branch, and feature extraction and bounding box prediction subnetworks. The dehazing module yields haze-free images and preserves the edge information of the object, so that the tracker can extract the object features with better characterization. Subsequently, to mitigate the risk of tracking drift caused by the changing appearance of the object, the dynamic template update branch dynamically selects more reliable template images during tracking. In addition, to solve the problem of insufficient UAV object tracking testing datasets in haze scenes, a haze testing dataset for UAV video object tracking is obtained through artificial synthesis and data collection in real-world haze scenes. Furthermore, experiments are conducted on haze testing datasets, namely, UAV123-AH, UAV20L-AH, UAVDT-AH, DTB70-AH, and UAVhaze; the results verified that the proposed tracker yields more competitive performance and more robustness in haze scenes compared with the existing algorithms.

AB The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) accelerometer is a sensor that measures the acceleration of the UAV by detecting the components of gravity along the three axes. The use of self-powered technology in UAV accelerometers will become inevitable. This article proposes an asymmetric electrode arc triboelectric nanogenerator (ASA-TENG) based on the single-electrode mode. It is a potential self-powered acceleration sensor that is installed on the UAV to detect the acceleration in the cruise state. It is characterized by a simple structure, low quality, high sensitivity, large detection range, low cost, and environmental friendliness. Two ASA-TENG structures are stacked into a cross along the ${x}$ -axis and ${y}$ -axis to detect the components of actual acceleration along the two axes to detect the acceleration of random directions. Finally, the actual acceleration is obtained through the principle of acceleration synthesis, which can accurately detect the direction of acceleration. The ASA-TENG acceleration sensor can detect accelerations in the range of 0.1-40 m/s2. It exhibits a high sensitivity, and its response time has a good fitting relationship with acceleration ( ${R}$ 2 = 0.997). In addition, the voltage signal amplitude generated by the ASA-TENG sensor shows negligible fluctuations after 6 h of continuous operation. Comparison experiments with commercial acceleration sensor show a maximum relative error of only 2.9%. Therefore, the ASA-TENG acceleration sensors can be potentially used under cruise conditions of UAV as it presents numerous advantages.

AB It is critical for intelligent vehicles to be capable of monitoring the health and well-being of the drivers they transport on a continuous basis. This is especially true in the case of autonomous vehicles. To address the issue, an automatic system is developed for driver's real emotion recognizer (DRER) using deep learning. The emotional values of drivers in indoor vehicles are symmetrically mapped to image design in order to investigate the characteristics of abstract expressions, expression design principles, and an experimental evaluation is conducted based on existing research on the design of driver facial expressions for intelligent products. By substituting a custom-created CNN features learning block with the base 11 layers CNN model in this paper for the development of an improved faster R-CNN face detector that detects the driver's face at a high frame per second (FPS). Transfer learning is performed in the NasNet large CNN model in order to recognize the driver's various emotions. Additionally, a custom driver emotion recognition image dataset is being developed as part of this research task. The proposed model, which is a combination of an improved faster R-CNN and transfer learning in NasNet-Large CNN architecture for DER based on facial images, enables greater accuracy than previously possible for DER based on facial images. The proposed model outperforms some recently updated state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy. The proposed model achieved the following accuracy on various benchmark datasets: JAFFE 98.48%, CK+ 99.73%, FER-2013 99.95%, AffectNet 95.28%, and 99.15% on a custom-developed dataset.

AB Sensor technologies have been innovated and enhanced rapidly for highly automated vehicle and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in automotive industry; however, in order to adopt sensors into mass production vehicle in near future, various requirements should be satisfied such as cost, durability, and maintainance without any loss of overall performance of the sensors. In this sense, a 3D flash lidar is one of primising range sensors because of no moving parts, compact package, and precise measure for distance by using a laser. In spite of the several advantages, the 3D flash lidar is not commonly used in automotive industry because it is quite expensive for adoption and it is manufactured with only general purpose currently; therefore, the cost reduction and optimal design to satisfy various purposes of ADAS or autonomous driving should be accomplished. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for design factor optimization of the 3D flash lidar based on a geometrical model by using structural similarity between the 3D flash lidar and 2D digital camera. In particular, focal length and area of a receiver (focal plane array and read-out integrated circuit) which directly affect on sensor performance (field of view and maximum detection range) are optimized as the design factors. From the optimization results in simulation, we show that optimal design factors according to various purposes required in ADAS could be easily determined and the sensor performances could be evaluated before manufacturing. It will reduce temporal and economic burdens for design and manufacturing in development process.

AB How to make a controller robust and stable to reject the disturbance of uncertainty is an inevitable challenge. Aiming at addressing the lateral control problem for an autonomous road sweeper, a heading-error-based first order linear active disturbance rejective controller (HFO-LADRC) is proposed in this paper. To eliminate the lateral error and the heading error at the same time, a new model, called the heading-error-based model, is proposed for lateral motion, and the Lyapunov function was employed to explore the convergence ability of the heading error and lateral error. Since the heading-error-based model is first order, the ADRC is designed as first order and linear, and each module of the HFO-LADRC has been devised in detail. To ensure solution accuracy, the fourth order Runge-Kutta method was adopted as the differential system solver, and a typical ring scenario and a double lane-changing scenario were designed referencing the standard. Considering the obvious influence, wheelbase uncertainty, steering ratio uncertainty and Gaussian white noise disturbance were taken into account for the tests. The results illustrate that, in the case of both wheelbase uncertainty and steer ratio uncertainty, the HFO-LADRC has strong robustness and stability compared with a typical pure pursuit controller and classical SO-LADRC.

AB In this article, simultaneous longitudinal and lateral flight control systems design for both passive and active morphing tactical unmanned aerial vehicles (TUAVs) is first time applied for autonomous flight performance maximization in the literature. For this purpose longitudinal and lateral dynamics modelling of TUAVs produced in Erciyes University, Faculty of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Model Aircraft Laboratory are considered in order to obtain simulation environments. Our produced TUAV is called as ZANKA-III which has weight of 50 kg, range of around 3000 km, endurance of around 28 hour, and ceiling altitude of around 12500 m. Von-Karman turbulence modelling is used in order to model atmospheric turbulence during flight in both longitudinal and lateral simulation environments. A stochastic optimization method called as simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (i.e. SPSA) is also first time applied in order to obtain optimum dimensions of morphing parameters (i.e. extension ratios of wingspan and tailspan, assembly positions of wing and tailplane to fuselage) and optimum magnitudes of longitudinal and lateral controllers' gains (i.e. P, I and D gains) while minimizing cost index capturing terms about both longitudinal and lateral autonomous flight performances and there exists lower and upper constraints on all optimization variables in the literature.

AB Osteopathic pre-registration education aims to produce competent autonomous practitioners who are capable of dealing with and mastering the uncertainty of clinical practice. The students' preparedness for clinical practice is typically assessed using high fidelity long case exams, i.e., clinical competence assessments using real patients in a real clinical setting. In this paper, we critically review relevant literature concerning the validity, reliability and underpinning educational theory of the Script Concordance Test (SCT), and describe the development, implementation and initial critical evaluation of this assessment toot in the osteopathy programme at Oxford Brookes University. The SCT is an assessment tool aimed at assessing clinical reasoning in the context of uncertainty, which is being increasingly used as an assessment strategy in the field of medical education. Despite its limitations, we believe that the SCT is a useful addition to assessing clinical reasoning in osteopathy, particularly in situations of clinical uncertainty. It has the potential to effectively assess the students' diagnostic reasoning, evaluation of risk and patient safety, and ethical aspects of osteopathic care. Critically, it provides an important vehicle to assess the students' preparedness for autonomous clinical practice using a standardised format. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the emergence of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), understanding the impact of such technological advances on traffic flow is vital to prepare for the popularity of CAVs. It has been well documented in the literature that the connectivity feature of CAVs will further benefit the traffic flow by enhancing stability and improving capacity in comparison to automated vehicles (AVs). However, there is little analytical and quantitative evidence to support this statement. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap and reveal the potential of connectivity for CAVs in promoting stability and capacity. First, we use a general feedback control structure to model the longitudinal dynamic of AVs. A feedforward link is added to the general structure of AVs to represent the connectivity feature of CAVs. Then, the performance of AVs and CAVs in attenuating disturbance is compared. Moreover, the time headway boundary to maintain string stability is defined and used for capacity analysis. The analytical and numerical results show that (1) the string stable region is enlarged and the potential to attenuate disturbance is promoted with proper tuning of the feedforward gain; (2) the employable time headway is reduced by introducing the communication link. This paper presents a unified framework and a practical procedure for demonstrating the benefit of connectivity on CAVs. The findings in this paper can be served as an analytical foundation and extended with other elaborate models to further understand the benefit of connectivity for CAVs.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB As a promising technology, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-enabled information gathering has received intensive interest in both academia and industry in recent years. However, the familiar paradigm, namely, data collection can hardly fulfill the active and real-time information gathering demands of many thriving smart applications, such as smart grid, where the UAV needs to serve as an intelligent aerial entity, gathering and analysing the information of surroundings actively and timely. To this aim, this article studies the paradigm data acquisition, where the UAV dynamically gathers information by on-board sensors. We consider a general mission scenario where a UAV acquires data in real time, which needs to be timely processed with the assistance of a mobile edge computing server. To address the real-time characteristics, we construct a novel theoretical data acquisition rate model, based on which the real-time processing quality of requirement (QoR) is defined. We respectively minimize the UAV energy consumption and mission completion time, under the constraints including real-time processing QoR and UAV mobility, by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, resources allocation, and time duration. To tackle these highly complex problems, we propose efficient algorithms by means of successive convex approximation and block coordinates descent techniques, where a closed-form solution for the UAV transmission and computation resources allocation is rigorously derived. Moreover, we consider a practical multi-location trajectory optimization where the UAV needs to traverse multiple target locations or areas in addition to the initial and final locations. The simulation results demonstrate the significant system performance gains brought by the proposed design and the effectiveness of the algorithms.

AB Recently, the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) under the umbrella of the Internet of Things (IoT) in smart cities and emerging communities have become the focus of the academic and industrial science community. On this basis, UAVs have been used in many military and commercial systems as emergency transport and air support during natural disasters and epidemics. In such previous scenarios, boosting wireless signals in remote or isolated areas would need a mobile signal booster placed on UAVs, and, at the same time, the data would be secured by a secure decentralized database. This paper contributes to investigating the possibility of using a wireless repeater placed on a UAV as a mobile booster for weak wireless signals in isolated or rural areas in emergency situations and that the transmitted information is protected from external interference and manipulation. The working mechanism is as follows: one of the UAVs detect a human presence in a predetermined area with the thermal camera and then directs the UAVs to the location to enhance the weak signal and protect the transmitted data. The methodology of localization and clusterization of the UAVs is represented by a swarm intelligence localization (SIL) optimization algorithm. At the same time, the information sent by UAV is protected by blockchain technology as a decentralization database. According to realistic studies and analyses of UAVs localization and clusterization, the proposed idea can improve the amplitude of the wireless signals in far regions. In comparison, this database technique is difficult to attack. The research ultimately supports emergency transport networks, blockchain, and IoT services.

AB Real-time control solutions for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted great interest in recent years. Most existing control methods use Wi-Fi technology. While Wi-Fi is inexpensive and easy to use, it has only a limited transmission range. Thus, 4G/5G cellular networks have been proposed as an alternative enabling technology. This study focuses on the problem of improving the appropriateness of the control commands sent by the ground control station (GCS) to the UAV over the control and nonpayload communication (CNPC) link of the UAV through the cellular network. To satisfy the low-latency requirement of the CNPC link, multiaccess edge computing (MEC) technology is leveraged to collocate the GCS and base station. The effectiveness of the proposed edge-based approach is demonstrated by conducting experiments on two LTE platforms with different MEC deployment methods. An edge-enabled UAV control solution is proposed in which each end-to-end control delay in the UAV-GCS system is estimated based on the preceding delay such that the location of the UAV at the moment it receives the control command from the GCS can be predicted in advance and taken into consideration by the GCS when formulating an appropriate control decision. To this end, an analytical modeling method is proposed for estimating the expected error range of each control delay based on a bimodal distribution approximation of the empirical control delays observed at the UAV. Finally, an event-driven simulator is developed to confirm the accuracy of the analytical predictions of the control delay based on the expected error between consecutive delays.

AB Given the high levels of congestion that many commuters in the United States experience, the urban air mobility community has been exploring the potential of using a new class of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for commuters. To date, only a few studies have been conducted that compare how potential air taxi demand across cities varies. This study calculates a measure of air taxi demand for commuters for the 40 most populous combined statistical areas (CSAs) in the U.S. by using: (1) cell phone data to identify regular commuters in cities, (2) census data to associate household income characteristics with commuters, and (3) a mode choice model calibrated from a stated preference survey to predict the number of commuters that would use an air taxi. Air taxi commuter demand is concentrated in a handful of CSAs; the CSAs for New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., generate 33 percent of the overall air taxi demand. Results are sensitive to location of existing vertiports, existing ground infrastructure and congestion levels on competing modes, and current commute patterns. A resultant set of online maps of potential air taxi routes allows readers to visualize how air taxi commuter routes differ across CSAs. Results will be of value both to aircraft manufacturers seeking to design air taxi vehicles to serve different cities as well as city planners for identifying where investments in port infrastructure may be needed to support a commuter air taxi service.

In this paper, we develop a novel method for choosing the best-suited technology for a specific survey region, and it is applied on Kastela Bay as an application example. The example shows the step-by-step process of identifying appropriate technology.
   Hydrographic survey or seabed mapping plays an important role in achieving better maritime safety, especially in coastal waters. Due to advances in survey technologies, it becomes important to choose well-suited technology for a specific area. Moreover, various technologies have various ranges of equipment and manufacturers, as well as characteristics. Therefore, in this paper, a novel method of a hydrographic survey, i.e., identifying the appropriate technology, has been developed. The method is based on a reduced elimination matrix, decision tree supervised learning, and multicriteria decision methods. The available technologies were: remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), light detection and ranging (LIDAR), autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB), and multibeam echosounder (MBES), and they are applied as a case study of Kastela Bay. Results show, considering the specifics of the survey area, that UAV is the best-suited technology to be used for a hydrographic survey. However, some other technologies, such as SDB come close and can be considered an alternative for hydrographic surveys.

AB In recent times, with the incremental demand for fully autonomous systems, research interests are observed in learning machine-based intelligent, self-organizing, and evolving controllers. In this paper, a new evolving and self-organizing controller, namely generic-controller (G-controller), is proposed. The G-controller works in a fully online mode with minor expert domain knowledge. It is developed by incorporating the sliding mode control (SMC) theory with an advanced incremental learning machine, namely generic evolving neuro-fuzzy inference system. The controller starts operating from scratch with an empty set of fuzzy rule, and therefore, no offline training is required. To cope with the changing dynamic characteristics of the plant, the controller can add or prune the rules on demand. Control law and adaptation laws for the consequent parameters are derived from the SMC algorithm to establish a stable closed-loop system, where the stability of the G-controller is guaranteed by using the Lyapunov function. The uniform asymptotic convergence of tracking error to zero is witnessed through the implication of an auxiliary robustifying control term. In addition, the implementation of the multivariate Gaussian function helps the controller to handle the nonaxis parallel data from the plant and consequently, enhances the robustness against uncertainties and environmental perturbations. Finally, the controller's performance has been evaluated by observing the tracking performance in controlling simulated plants of unmanned aerial vehicle, namely bio-inspired flapping wing micro air vehicle and hexacopter for a variety of trajectories.

AB This paper describes a system for reacquiring features of interest in a shallow-water ocean environment, using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with low-cost sonar and navigation sensors. In performing mine countermeasures, it is critical to enable AUVs to navigate accurately to previously mapped objects of interest in the water column or on the seabed, for further assessment or remediation. An important aspect of the overall system design is to keep the size and cost of the reacquisition vehicle as low as possible, as it may potentially be destroyed in the reacquisition mission. This low-cost requirement prevents the use of sophisticated AUV navigation sensors, such as a Doppler velocity log (DVL) or an inertial navigation system (INS). Our system instead uses the Proviewer 900-kHz imaging sonar from Blueview Technologies, which produces forward-looking sonar (FLS) images at ranges up to 40 m at approximately 4 Hz. In large volumes, it is hoped that this sensor can be manufactured at low cost. Our approach uses a novel simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm that detects and tracks features in the FLS images to renavigate to a previously mapped target. This feature-based navigation (FBN) system incorporates a number of recent advances in pose graph optimization algorithms for SLAM. The system has undergone extensive field testing over a period of more than four years, demonstrating the potential for the use of this new approach for feature reacquisition. In this report, we review the methodologies and components of the FBN system, describe the system's technological features, review the performance of the system in a series of extensive in-water field tests, and highlight issues for future research.

AB A hybrid model-based and data-driven framework is proposed in this paper for autonomous coastline surveillance using an unmanned aerial vehicle. The proposed approach comprises three individual neural network-assisted modules that work together to estimate the state of the target (i.e., shoreline) to contribute to its identification and tracking. The shoreline is first detected through image segmentation using a Convolutional Neural Network. The part of the segmented image that includes the detected shoreline is then fed into a CNN real-time optical flow estimator. The position of pixels belonging to the detected shoreline, as well as the initial approximation of the shoreline motion, are incorporated into a neural network-aided Extended Kalman Filter that learns from data and can provide on-line motion estimation of the shoreline (i.e., position and velocity in the presence of waves) using the system and measurement models with partial knowledge. Finally, the estimated feedback is provided to a Partitioned Visual Servo tracking controller for autonomous multirotor navigation along the coast, ensuring that the latter will always remain inside the onboard camera field of view. A series of outdoor comparative studies using an octocopter flying along the shoreline in various weather and beach settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested architecture.

AB Variable speed limit (VSL) control is a flexible way to improve traffic conditions, increase safety, and reduce emissions. There is an emerging trend of using reinforcement learning methods for VSL control. Currently, deep learning is enabling reinforcement learning to develop autonomous control agents for problems that were previously intractable. In this paper, a more effective deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model is developed for differential variable speed limit (DVSL) control, in which dynamic and distinct speed limits among lanes can be imposed. The proposed DRL model uses a novel actor-critic architecture to learn a large number of discrete speed limits in a continuous action space. Different reward signals, such as total travel time, bottleneck speed, emergency braking, and vehicular emissions are used to train the DVSL controller, and a comparison between these reward signals is conducted. The proposed DRL-based DVSL controllers are tested on a freeway with a simulated recurrent bottleneck. The simulation results show that the DRL based DVSL control strategy is able to improve the safety, efficiency and environmentfriendliness of the freeway. In order to verify whether the controller generalizes to real world implementation, we also evaluate the generalization of the controllers on environments with different driving behavior attributes. and the robustness of the DRL agent is observed from the results.

AB The reliability of a navigation system is crucial for navigation purposes, especially in areas where stringent performance is required, such as civil aviation or intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). Therefore, integrity monitoring is an inseparable part of safety-critical navigation applications. The receiver autonomous integrity monitor (RAIM) has been used with the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) to provide integrity monitoring within avionics itself, such as in civil aviation for lateral navigation (LNAV) or the non-precision approach (NPA). However, standard RAIM may not meet the stricter aviation availability and integrity requirements for certain operations, e.g., precision approach flight phases, and also is not sufficient for on-ground vehicle integrity monitoring of several specific ITS applications. One possible way to more clearly distinguish anomalies in observed GNSS signals is to take advantage of time-delayed neural networks (TDNNs) to estimate useful information about the faulty characteristics, rather than simply using RAIM alone. Based on the performance evaluation, it was determined that this method can reliably detect flaws in navigation satellites significantly faster than RAIM alone, and it was confirmed that TDNN-based integrity monitoring using RAIM is an encouraging alternative to improve the integrity assurance level of RAIM in terms of GNSS anomaly detection.

AB We are witnessing the clash of two industries and the remaking of in-car market order, as the world of digital knowledge recently made a significant move toward the automotive industry. Mobile operating system providers are battling between each other to take over the in-vehicle entertainment and information systems, while car makers either line up behind their technology or try to keep control over the in-car experience. What is at stake is the map content and location-based services, two key enabling technologies of self-driving cars and future automotive safety systems. These content-based augmented geographic information systems (GIS) as well as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) require an accurate, robust, and reliable estimation of road scene attributes. Accurate localization of the vehicle is a challenging and critical task that natural GPS or classical filter (EKF) cannot reach. This paper proposes a new approach allowing us to give a first answer to the issue of accurate lateral positioning. The proposed approach is based on the fusion of 4 types of data: a GPS, a set of INS/odometer sensors, a road marking detection, and an accurate road marking map. The lateral road markings detection is done with the processing of two lateral cameras and provides an assessment of the lateral distance between the vehicle and the road borders. These information coupled with an accurate digital map of the road markings provide an efficient and reliable way to dramatically improve the localization obtained from only classical way (GPS/INS/Odometer). Moreover, the use of the road marking detection can be done only when the confidence is sufficiently high (punctual use). In fact, the vision processing and the map data can be used punctually only in order to update the classical localization algorithm. The temporary lack of vision data does not affect the quality of lateral positioning. In order to evaluate and validate this approach, a real test scenario was performed on Satory's test track with real embedded sensors. It shows that the lateral estimation of the ego-vehicle positioning is performed with a sub-decimeter accuracy, high enough to be used in autonomous lane keeping, and land-based mobile mapping.

AB Autonomous robots are expected to perform a wide range of sophisticated tasks in complex, unknown environments. However, available onboard computing capabilities and algorithms represent a considerable obstacle to reaching higher levels of autonomy, especially as robots get smaller and the end of Moore's law approaches. Here, we argue that inspiration from insect intelligence is a promising alternative to classic methods in robotics for the artificial intelligence (AI) needed for the autonomy of small, mobile robots. The advantage of insect intelligence stems from its resource efficiency (or parsimony) especially in terms of power and mass. First, we discuss the main aspects of insect intelligence underlying this parsimony: embodiment, sensory-motor coordination, and swarming. Then, we take stock of where insect-inspired AI stands as an alternative to other approaches to important robotic tasks such as navigation and identify open challenges on the road to its more widespread adoption. Last, we reflect on the types of processors that are suitable for implementing insect-inspired AI, from more traditional ones such as microcontrollers and field-programmable gate arrays to unconventional neuromorphic processors. We argue that even for neuromorphic processors, one should not simply apply existing AI algorithms but exploit insights from natural insect intelligence to get maximally efficient AI for robot autonomy.

AB Routine cleaning the pavement is an essential requirement to maintain a sustainable environment for social life. The different width and type of pavements raise the challenges for autonomous vehicles with fixed shape to operate effectively. In this paper, we introduce the vision based reconfiguration of self-reconfigurable pavement sweeping robot called Panthera, which can adjust its frame width to ease the cleaning tasks to become friendly with different pavement geometry. The expansion and compression operations of the Panthera width are implemented by rotating one high torque motor connecting with the lead screw rod to change the opening angle of linkage hinges. The Panthera cleaning and locomotion operations are synchronized with changing the robot width according to the output of detected pavement width. To this end, the segmented pavement leveraged on the masked based deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is used as input for the proposed closed-loop feedback control method, enabling the robot to adjust the requirement of changing the width during locomotion accurately. The proposed PID scheme takes into account the robot kinematic design with the flexibility of width changing modes. The experiments were carried out in real environments demonstrated the autonomous reconfiguration robot width with various locomotion scenarios on pavements of varying width.

AB This paper introduces novel insights to improve the state-of-the-art line-based unsupervised observation and abstraction models of man-made environments. The increasing use of autonomous UAVs inside buildings and around human-made structures demands new accurate and comprehensive representation of their operation environments. Most of the 3D scene abstraction methods use invariant feature point matching, nevertheless some sparse 3D point clouds do not concisely represent the structure of the environment. The presented approach is based on observation and representation models using the straight line segments. The goal of the work is a complete method based on the matching of lines, that provides a complementary approach to state-of-the-art methods when facing 3D scene representation of poor texture environments for future autonomous UAV. Oppositely to other recently published methods obtaining 3D line abstractions, the proposed method features 3D segment abstraction in the absence of a previously generated point based reconstruction. Another advantage is the ability to group the resulting 3D lines according to different planes, for exploiting coplanar line intersections. These intersections are used like feature points in the reconstruction process. It has been proved that this method exclusively based on lines can obtain spatial information in the adverse situations when a SIFT-like SfM pipeline fails to generate a dense point cloud.

AB This article presents a differential-flatness-based approach to trajectory planning and tracking for helicopters and demonstrates this strategy for time-optimal autonomous helicopter shipboard landing. For planning and outer-loop tracking control, helicopter dynamics are captured by a simplified nonlinear model that is shown to be differentially flat, which enables the transformation of the original nonlinear system dynamics into an equivalent linear form with endogenous nonlinear constraints. For time-optimal trajectory planning, this equivalent model is used to construct a computationally efficient optimization problem for free end-time end-state problems, where the decision space is that of the trajectories of the flat outputs and their derivatives. While the attitude dynamics are stabilized by an inner-loop controller, for tracking the planned trajectory, a flatness-based outer-loop control law is designed to stabilize the unstable zero dynamics. Furthermore, analytical guarantees that relate inner-loop tracking error to outer-loop robust stability and tracking performance are derived. Simulations are performed on a high-fidelity numerical UH-60 helicopter model underground effect and ship airwake disturbances, together with ship motion profiles collected from a naval environment to validate the proposed approach for realistic landing scenarios.

AB In Industry 4.0, the innovative concept of a smart warehouse is defined as a progressive development in logistics and operations management. Numerous advanced techniques are recommended for integration, including wearable devices, communication, loading/unloading, optimization, robotics, and automated transportation, among others. Currently, the growing demand for swift cargo distribution, cost-effective labour utilization, and enhanced productivity stands as an urgent topic for both enterprises and scholars. This paper presents an EtherCAT-based model of automated guided vehicle (AGV)-manipulation introduced within the Unity platform for smart warehouse management. The working environment selected for this model is a cross-docking warehouse with a chessboard layout. Initially, theoretical computations pertaining to mechanical design are established to provide accurate parameters. Subsequently, the structure of the TwinCAT Human-Machine Interface Server and the configuration within the Unity environment are outlined. Following that, the software architecture, encompassing data exchange and a set of motion commands, is meticulously explained. To validate the proposed approach, several laboratory tests are conducted under identical conditions. This research offers several contributions: firstly, it introduces the innovative use of real-time technology to represent AGV systems; secondly, it elucidates the potential connection between virtual reality and the physical model; and thirdly, it employs fluid motion techniques to illustrate and visualize driving performance. These findings hold significant promise not only for the advancement of smart warehouse management but also for the broader landscape of digital trade.
   These works present the emerging technologies (motion control, digital twin, autonomous vehicle) into smart mobility platform. Owing to our development, several applications in warehouse management could be reached such as online training, virtual-reality interaction, supervision and monitoring, driven control.image

AB Due to the flexible mobility and agility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to be deployed as aerial base stations (BSs) in future air-ground-integrated wireless networks, providing temporary and controllable coverage and additional computation capabilities for ground Internet of Things (IoT) devices with or without infrastructure support. Meanwhile, with the breakthrough of artificial intelligence (AI), more and more AI applications relying on AI methods such as deep neural networks (DNNs) are expected to be applied in various fields, such as smart homes, smart factories, and smart cities, to improve our lifestyles and efficiency dramatically. However, AI applications are generally computation intensive, latency sensitive, and energy consuming, making resource-constrained IoT devices unable to benefit from AI anytime and anywhere. In this article, we study mobile-edge computing (MEC) for AI applications in air-ground-integrated wireless networks. Our goal is to minimize the service latency while ensuring the learning accuracy requirements and energy consumption. To achieve that, we take DNN as the typical AI application and formulate an optimization problem that optimizes the DNN model decision, computation and communication resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control, subject to the energy consumption, latency, computation, and communication resource constraints. Considering the formulated problem is nonconvex, we decompose it into multiple convex subproblems and then alternately solve them till they converge to the desired solution. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the system performance for AI applications.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless power transfer (WPT) systems offer significant advantages in coverage and deployment flexibility, but suffer from endurance limitations due to the limited onboard energy. This article proposes to improve the energy efficiency of UAV-enabled WPT systems with multiple ground sensors by utilizing reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Specifically, the total energy consumption of the UAV is minimized, while meeting the energy requirement of each sensor. First, we consider a fly-hover-broadcast (FHB) protocol, in which the UAV radiates radio-frequency (RF) signals only at several hovering locations. The energy minimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the UAV's trajectory, hovering time, and the RIS's reflection coefficients. To solve this complex nonconvex problem, we propose an efficient algorithm. Specifically, the successive convex approximation (SCA) framework is adopted to jointly optimize the UAV's trajectory and hovering time, in which a minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm that maximizes the minimum charged energy of all sensors is provided to update the reflection coefficients. Then, we investigate the general scenario in which the RF signals are radiated during the flight, aiming to minimize the total energy consumption of the UAV by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory, flight time, and the RIS's reflection coefficients. By applying the path discretization (PD) protocol, the optimization problem is formulated with a finite number of variables. A high-quality solution for this more challenging problem is obtained. Finally, our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the benefits of RIS in energy saving.

Furthermore, to better integrate with reality, it conducts an extensive market survey of 581 C-UAS systems from 282 manufacturers in 39 countries around the world based on literature and practice, making them a statistical analysis from four aspects. On this basis, it classifies and summarizes the most advanced weapon systems according to different technologies. Finally, it put forward several prominent and bottleneck problems faced in the current research from three aspects of confrontation, maturity, and law. Correspondingly, it prospects several future development directions and proposes several constructive suggestions from technology and tactic.

TI Efficient Position Change Algorithms for Prolonging Driving Range of a
   Truck Platoon

   vehicle; cooperative automated driving
AB Cooperative automated driving technology has emerged as a potential way to increase the efficiency of transportation systems and enhance traffic safety by allowing vehicles to exchange relevant information via wireless communication. Truck platooning utilizes this technology and achieves synchronized braking and acceleration, controlling two or more trucks simultaneously. This synchronized control makes driving with a very short inter-vehicle distance among trucks possible and reduces aerodynamic drag. This provides significant fuel consumption reduction, both in leading and trailing trucks, and achieves fuel-saving improvement. However, the static positioning sacrifices trucks in the front since they consume more fuel energy because of more air resistance than the rears. To solve this in-equivalent fuel consumption reduction benefit, this paper presents several heuristic algorithms to balance fuel consumption reduction and prolong the driving ranges by exploiting position changes among trucks in a platoon. Furthermore, the proposed algorithms try to reduce the number of position changes as much as possible to prevent any fuel waste caused by the unnecessary position change operations. In this manner, each truck in the platoon is likely to share a similar fuel consumption reduction with fewer position change counts, thus addressing the challenge of in-equivalent fuel savings distribution and obtaining optimal fuel efficiency. Our extensive simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can prolong the total distance by approximately 3% increased in two-truck platooning and even higher in six-trucks platooning of approximately 8%. Moreover, our proposed algorithms can decrease the position change count and ensure that trucks only switch to position arrangement once with no duplicate. Therefore, truck platooning obtains the maximum driving range with fewer position change counts, thus achieving efficient fuel saving.

AB Automated Vehicles (AVs) are expected to allow their users to engage in a broad range of non-driving activities while travelling, such as working, sleeping, playing games. The impact of this possibility on the satisfaction with travel and on travel demand has been extensively discussed in the literature. However, it has been hardly recognised that the availability of on-board activities influences the (time-geographic) constraints of daily activities and may alter the selection, location, and sequencing of other activities in the day. This hampers correct representation of travel behaviour in activity-based models aiming to predict the effects of AVs on mobility and environment (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions). To help fill this gap, we gathered and analysed qualitative data from focus groups, in which 27 commuters discussed their expectations concerning on-board activities and daily schedules in the AV-era. Among the core insights are the following three. First, it is useful to separate in modelling the satisfaction with travel and the potential for on-board activities during travel: they have different determinants and different consequences for activity schedules and individual travel demand. Second, on-board activities may be classified in 4 quadrants according to their novelty and priority level: this classification is helpful in understanding the potential re-arrangements of daily activities. Third, performing new activities during travel may lead to complex re-arrangements of daily activity patterns; the re-arrangements may ease or also increase time pressure. These, and other reported insights may facilitate more realistic representation of activity-travel behaviour in future travel behaviour models.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are autonomous fliers, which can play different roles in modern day applications. In one of the important role, UAVs can act as aerial data forwarding nodes for communication range enhancement in remote areas. UAVs form a web of drones, which can be geo-distributed across a large area to serve various applications. However, the two major contradicting challenges with respect to multi-UAV networks are channel congestion and flight time enhancement. The use of effective data transmission techniques to handle congestion can lead to higher battery dissipation, which in turn end up in the reduction in flight time. However, it is utmost necessity to provide an effective framework, which can provide a viable solution for handling congestion in multi-UAV networks while enhancing the flight time of UAVs. To handle these issues, software-defined network (SDN)-enabled opportunistic offloading and charging scheme (SOOCS) in multi-UAV ecosystem is designed in this paper. In this scheme, an opportunistic offloading scheme is proposed, which uses an SDN-based control model to handle congestion issues. Apart from this, an opportunistic energy-charging scheme is designed, wherein the UAVS can either replenish their batteries using solar plates or they can wirelessly charge energy from charging points deployed at various geo-distributed locations. The proposed scheme is evaluated using a simulation-based study over the realistic deployment of charging points in Chandigarh City, India. The results obtained show the superiority of SOOCS over other variants of its category in terms of end-to-end delay, throughput, and hand-over latency.

AB The virtual track train (VTT) is a new urban public transportation system that adopts all-axle steering and distributed drive. The Super autonomous Rail rapid Transit (SRT), as one of them, adopts a four-module six-axle structure. In response to its crucial problem, its path tracking, this article proposes a reconfigurable dynamic modeling method, which has two parts: a multi-body dynamics model with generalized forces at each module's center of gravity (CG) as the input, and the CG generalized force model, which expresses the CG generalized forces generated by the wheel control inputs. Then, a path-tracking strategy is proposed based on the improved MPC and hierarchical framework. Firstly, the CG generalized forces of each module required for path tracking were calculated, and then the CG generalized force redistribution was performed and the "virtual axle" method was proposed. Finally, the wheel state of each module was allocated. This strategy reduces the complexity of each layer of the controller and it solves the problem of insufficient actuators in the middle two modules of the SRT. Finally, through a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) real-time simulation and comparison with different control strategies, the control strategy's effectiveness, adaptability, and robustness were verified.

AB Autonomous robots that operate in the field can enhance their security and efficiency by accurate terrain classification, which can be realized by means of robot-terrain interaction-generated vibration signals. In this paper, we explore the vibration-based terrain classification (VTC), in particular for a wheeled robot with shock absorbers. Because the vibration sensors are usually mounted on the main body of the robot, the vibration signals are dampened significantly, which results in the vibration signals collected on different terrains being more difficult to discriminate. Hence, the existing VTC methods applied to a robot with shock absorbers may degrade. The contributions are two-fold: (1) Several experiments are conducted to exhibit the performance of the existing feature-engineering and feature-learning classification methods; and (2) According to the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, we propose a one-dimensional convolutional LSTM (1DCL)-based VTC method to learn both spatial and temporal characteristics of the dampened vibration signals. The experiment results demonstrate that: (1) The feature-engineering methods, which are efficient in VTC of the robot without shock absorbers, are not so accurate in our project; meanwhile, the feature-learning methods are better choices; and (2) The 1DCL-based VTC method outperforms the conventional methods with an accuracy of 80.18%, which exceeds the second method (LSTM) by 8.23%.

AB With the rising numbers of elderly and disabled people, the demand for welfare services using a robotic system and not involving human effort is likewise increasing. This study deals with a mobile robot system combined with a body weight support (BWS) system for gait rehabilitation. The BWS system was designed via the kinematic analysis of the robot's body-lifting characteristics and of the walking guide system that controls the total rehabilitation system integrated in the mobile robot. This mobile platform is operated by utilizing the autonomous guided vehicle driving algorithm. Especially, the method that integrates geometric path tracking and obstacle avoidance for a non-holonomic mobile robot was applied so that the system can be operated in an area where the elderly users are expected to be situated, such as in a public hospital or a rehabilitation centre. The mobile robot follows the path by moving through the turning radius supplied by the pure-pursuit method, one of the existing geometric path-tracking methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified through real experiments that were conducted for path tracking with static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. Finally, through electromyography signal measurement of the subject, the performance of the proposed system in a real operation condition was evaluated.

AB Although GPS is commonly used for the autonomous flying of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), researchers mainly focus on image-based localization methods due to their tremendous advantages when it comes to GPS-denied environments. In this study, we study the problem of image-based geo-localization between UAV and satellite (known as cross-view geo-localization), which is an essential step towards image-based localization. In cross-view geo-localization, extracting fine-grained features containing contextual information from images is challenging due to the large gap in visual representations between different views. Existing methods in this field often use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as feature extractors. However, CNNs have some limitations in receptive fields, which leads to the loss of fine-grained information. Some researchers have implemented Transformer-based networks to overcome these circumstances. However, these approaches only focused on understanding the meaning of each pixel based on their attention and only partially utilized tokens that are produced from Transformer blocks. Therefore, different from these works, we proposed a Vision Transformer-based network that takes advantage of local tokens, especially the classification token. Through experiments, our proposed model has significantly outperformed existing state-of-the-art models, which gave promising capabilities for developing this method in the future.

AB A sustainable approach towards smart waste management means reduced impact on the health of the workers, lower greenhouse gas emissions and low operational costs. Incorporating fleets of the robot MARBLE (Mobile Autonomous RoBot for Litter Emptying) effectuates these requirements for autonomously emptying the dustbins on the streets of Berlin. The dedicated waypoints for the route formulation are the global positions of the dustbins, and the garbage emptying position from the robots after reaching the maximum compressed-garbage storage capacity. In this paper, we provide a cost function efficient solution for providing global routes to the robots. The cost function includes operational energy expenditure. After conducting numerous experiments with varying algorithm parameter values, the specific weightage of route permutation operators and the initial temperature for a simulated annealing method with nearest neighbour approach was narrowed down as a well-performing set. This set was used in three different operation scenarios. The results of the cost function on the basis of the chosen parameters show an improvement of average 28% for two different exemplary datasets, and 30% improvement for an implementation in an actual existing park in Berlin for operation scenarios as compared to results from a nearest neighbour heuristic.

AB The low efficiency of photovoltaic cells limits the energy absorption of high-altitude long-endurance (HALE) solar-powered unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs), which dramatically weakens the capacity for long-endurance missions. Therefore, finding a method to extend the flight duration with finite solar energy drives extensive research. The present work introduces a method that applies a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to generate an energy-optimized flight strategy for HALE solar-powered aircraft. The neural network controller is designed to realize autonomous flight navigation by giving commands of thrust, attack angle, and bank angle. A mission area with a radius of 5 km is assumed to test the RL controller performance. The simulation results show that the RL controller leads to a 28 % increase in the battery SoC after a 24-hour flight, which indicates that a controller based on the RL framework might be a potential method for solving the solar-powered UAV trajectory planning problem. Aiming to explore the applicability of the RL controller, a sustained flight test is implemented. The results show that a 39-day endurance flight is achieved by the RL controller, which is 50% higher than the base case with a steady flight trajectory.

AB This study aims to address the questions of how driving risk evolves during car-following processes and what factors contribute to the underlying evolution patterns. An empirical study is conducted using real world car-following data collected in the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study (SH-NDS). The evolution of the driving risk induced by the dynamic coupling between the leading and following vehicles during the car-following process is characterized by how an instantaneous crash-risk measure -rear crash risk index (RCRI) -changes by time. A spectral clustering analysis is first conducted to classify the driving risk evolution of the observed car-following maneuvers, showing the existence of five distinctive risk evolution patterns in the car-following processes. In order to investi-gate the relationship between the identified driving risk evolution clusters and their con-tributing factors, a regression analysis employing a random parameter multinomial logit model with heterogeneity in means and variances is followed, revealing several significant contributing factors to the car-following risk evolution patterns, such as congestion level, driver's ability to maintain stable headways, and vehicle deceleration. This study has pro-vided important insights into driving risk from the new perspective of risk evolution pat-terns, which is expected to have significant implications for the future development of advanced traffic management and traveler information systems (ATMS/ATIS) strategies, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV).

AB Dispatching flexible unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data from distributed Internet-of-Things devices (IoTDs) is expected to be a promising technology to support time-critical applications. However, in urban environments, the communication links between the UAV and IoTDs are prone to be frequently blocked by buildings, which severely impairs the freshness of information collected by the UAV. Thus, how to overcome urban building blockages and ensure fresh data collection is quite important but neglected in existing works. In this paper, for keeping the information fresh, we propose to utilize the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to assist the UAV in mitigating signal propagation impairments caused by building blockages. The formulated optimization problem is minimizing the age of information (AoI) of all IoTDs by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, IoTD scheduling and discrete phase shifts of the RIS. It is a mixed-integer non-convex problem as well as lacking the complete channel state information (CSI), thus using conventional optimization methods is intractable. To address this issue, we present an effective and robust deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based scheme called "SAC-AO-RIS," where a soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm with recent-prioritized experience replay is designed for learning highly stable policies of UAV trajectory and IoTD scheduling, and an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is leveraged for solving RIS phase shifts. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed scheme compared with other baseline approaches.

AB We study the data collection problem in an Internet of Things (IoT) network where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is utilized to aggregate data from a set of IoT devices. We formulate the scheduling and path planning problems for the UAV. The goal of the scheduling problem is to find the sequence of nodes that the UAV will visit to complete the data collection task in the shortest possible time, ensuring that it does not run out of energy during its mission. We express this problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear problem and propose an efficient algorithm to solve the aforementioned NP-hard problem in polynomial time. Path planning problem aims to find a collision-free path for the UAV. While the state-of-the-art schemes have focused on solving the path planning problem in static environments, we study the problem in a dynamic environment with moving obstacles. We develop an algorithm that works on both static and dynamic environments. Our method combines deep reinforcement learning (RL) with graph-based global path planning algorithms to find a collision-free path for the UAV. One important advantage of our RL-based method over the existing studies is its map independency, which allows us to transform the agent's learning from one environment to another. Via simulation studies, we show that our method is significantly effective in improving the safety of the path planning algorithms in dynamic environments.

AB Future communication systems have become the most commonly categorized as Mobile Ad hoc Networks and Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET). A VANET aims to protect vehicle drivers by initiating autonomous contact with nearby vehicles. Each vehicle operates as an intelligent mobile node in the ad-hoc network characterized by high mobility and complex networks. In VANET, malicious attacks impact cybersecurity, and such security attacks need to be detected and prevented. In VANET, any node can be determined as a router with the other nodes; a malicious node can interpret and modify the connection to the internet, thereby disrupting the network activity. VANETs are vulnerable to various security attacks such as blackhole attacks, Wormhole attacks, Denial-of-Service attacks, etc. This paper provides a novel cryptographic approach incorporated in AODV protocol to identify and eliminate the common attack strategy, called the blackhole attack in VANET, known as Secure AODV protocol (SAODV). This strategy store modifies the RREQ and RREP packets and stores the results in a lookup table. Any changes in these received packets and lookup tables imply that the intruder modifies the packet. The result analysis shows that the proposed approach is efficient in terms of various performance metrics, such as a higher packet delivery ratio of 95%, higher throughput of 87%, higher blackhole attack detection ratio of 98% compared to the existing approaches. It is inferred from the result that the proposed SAODV has a lower end-to-end delay of 75%, a lower collision rate of 71%, and a lower normalized routing load of 89%. Because of its better performance, the proposed SAODV approach will significantly impact the security application Intelligent Transport System.

AB The power system network is complex and diverse in nature because of the random and irregular existence of renewable sources, various types of varying and constant loads. Under these circumstances, the stabilization of DC link voltage and obtaining reduced power fluctuations are the main control aspect of DC microgrid (MG) system. This paper explores a Kalman filter (KF) based voltage-current control algorithm for the battery unit to control the medium voltage direct current (MVDC) bus voltage accurately with trivial oscillations as compared to the traditional VI algorithm. The stability and monitoring of DC microgrids are greatly influenced by gathering sufficient and precise information. Since installing several sensors on DC MGs is costly and increases DC MG ripple. In this work, an extended Kalman filter (KF) is used to estimate the current of the lead-acid battery. Hence the current represents an important factor in guaranteeing safe operations. Where the Kalman Filter, which improves the estimation efficiency, to reach a good performance in the current prediction. By updating the proposed approach provides smooth and noise-less operation from the measured DC voltage. The control strategy established for electric vehicle (EV) in this paper is to improve the overall charging ability of the EV only if the system's total power is greater than the load level by means of the current loop management technique. The feasibility of the designed MG system with the established battery management mechanism and the Escape Ford EV performance is studied using MATLAB/Simulink platform.

AB This paper presents a study investigating the potential market of ridesourcing services, with a focus on the attitudinal and preferential differences between Millennials and Generation Xers. Data obtained from a stated preference survey were utilized, where the respondents were asked to choose between a conventional mode (private vehicle driver, transit, or private vehicle passenger) and ridesourcing modes (exclusive ride and shared ride). Error component nested logit models were developed for Generation Xers and Millennials, respectively. Latent attitudes derived through factor analysis were incorporated into models. A wide range of attitudinal indicators, including general mobility attitudes, perceived benefits and concerns of shared mobility services, reasons for or against owning a car, reasons for ridings Autonomous Vehicles (AV), and the most desired AV features were considered to extract latent attitudes. Model results indicated distinct mode choice behavior between Millennials and Generation Xers. For Generation Xers, the choice to switch to ridesourcing was highly dependent on the perceived time and cost benefits of shared mobility. On the other hand, Millennials' choices were more likely to be influenced by their attitudes or desire toward technology, on-demand services, and driving stress relief. Interestingly, the joy of driving showed a negative impact on Millennials' use of shared-ride services only. The findings from this study provide a more in-depth understanding of the distinct behavior of Generation Xers and Millennials toward shared mobility services, which could help develop strategies and policies to focus more effectively on the needs and concerns of individuals based on their characteristics and attitudes and help promote sustainable transportation system.

AB In the aftermath of a large-scale emergency, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can play a key role as mobile communication systems supporting rescue operations on the ground. At the same time, the deployment of autonomous UAV swarms still poses severe challenges in terms of distributed mobility, swarm connectivity and mesh networking. To this purpose, we propose $\mathsf {ELAPSE}$ (aErial LocAl Positioning System for Emergency), a novel, distributed framework for aerial mesh deployment that supports discovery and multi-hop connectivity among rescue personnel and emergency requesters. $\mathsf {ELAPSE}$ integrates components of swarm mobility, positioning and Quality-of-Service (QoS) support, while targeting UAV devices at different levels of hardware complexity. Three contributions are provided in this study. First, we present a novel, bio-inspired swarm mobility algorithm which natively addresses QoS-based aerial mesh connectivity, coverage of the ground nodes and UAV collision avoidance through the abstraction of virtual springs. Second, we investigates its implementation when geo-location capabilities are not available: to this aim, we propose local-based and cooperative-based techniques through which each UAV can estimate the position of its neighbours, and hence correctly adjust its direction and speed. Third, we analyze the feasibility of the $\mathsf {ELAPSE}$ framework through a twofold evaluation: i.e. a large-scale OMNeT simulation showing the effectiveness of the distributed mesh formation and localization techniques, and a small-case ground robotic testbed demonstrating the impact of QoS mechanisms on the system operations.

AB Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are being widely adopted in the last few years. This type of network enables the utilization of a large diversity of distributed applications, such as road and traffic alerts, autonomous driving capabilities and video distribution. Video applications can be considered one of the most demanding services because it needs a steady and continuous flow of information. This presents a set of challenges to VANETs considering their scarce network resources due to the vehicle movement and time-varying wireless channels. Considering the above mentioned issues, an adaptive quality of experience (QoE)-driven mechanism is needed to provide live transmission capabilities to video-equipped vehicles. This mechanism has to overcome the challenges to grant a high-qua lity video transmission without adding any unnecessary network overhead. To this end, a forward error correction (FEC) technique can be adapted to enhance the video distribution, leading to higher QoE for end users. The proposed self-adaptive FEC-based mechanism (SHIELD) uses several video characteristics and specific VANETs details to safeguard real-time video streams against packet losses. One of the main contributions of this work is the combined used of network density, signal-to-noise ratio, packet loss rate, and the vehicle's position. This allows SHIELD to better protect the video sequences and enhance the QoE. In doing that, we are able to improve the user experience, while saving network resources. The advantages and drawbacks of the proposed mechanism are demonstrated through extensive experiments and assessed with QoE metrics, proving that it outperforms both adaptive and non-adaptive mechanisms.

ID DRIVER; ROAD
AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have become one of the essential approaches to effectively resolve problems such as traffic safety, road congestion, and energy consumption. However, due to the spatial-temporal interaction of the mixed traffic environment, the driving behaviors of traffic participants are continuously transmitted in time and space. This makes it difficult for the existing decision-making system of CAVs to make accurate judgments and effective strategies. In this study, a rate graph convolution Q-learning network (Rate GQN) is proposed to train a discrete strategy that can improve the comprehensive performance of CAVs in scenarios with spatial-temporal interaction. Firstly, the Rate algorithm is proposed to impose a ratio on the estimates of Q-values from the previous learning process, which improves the stability and performance of the algorithm by reducing the approximate error variance of the target value. Secondly, the traffic Scenario is modeled as a graph structure. And graph convolutional networks are adopted to extract the features information of graph structure to help the CAVs grasp the dynamic traffic interaction information quickly and accurately. Additionally, an internal dynamic multi-objective reward function is presented to improve the comprehensive performance of CAVs, including safety, efficiency, energy saving, and comfort. Finally, comparison and ablation experiments are constructed in a task-based traffic scenario (station stop and traffic light passing). The simulation results show that our Rate GQN method has faster training speed, a more stable training process, and better overall performance than the deep Q-learning network (DQN) and algorithms of the comparison group.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cluster combat is a typical example of an intelligent cluster application, and it is characterized by its large scale, low cost, retrievability, and intra-cluster autonomous coordination. An unmanned reconnaissance mission for a target group (URMFTG) is a significant pattern in UAV cluster combat. This paper discusses the collaborative path planning problem of unmanned aerial vehicle formations (UAVFs) and refueling tankers in a URMFTG with threat areas and fuel constraints. The purpose of collaborative path planning is to ensure that the UAVFs (with fuel constraints) can complete the reconnaissance mission for the target group with the assistance of refueling tankers, which is one of the most important constraints in the collaborative path planning. In this paper, a collaborative path-planning model is designed to analyze the relationship between the planning path of the UAVFs and the tankers, and a threat avoidance strategy is designed considering the threat area. This paper proposes a two-stage solution algorithm. It creates a UAVFs path-planning algorithm based on the fast search genetic algorithm (FSGA) and a refueling tanker path-planning algorithm based on the improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Based on simulation experiments, the solution method proposed in this paper can provide a better path-planning scheme for a URMFTG. That is, it decreases the rate of the UAVF's distance growth from 3.1% to 2.2% for the path planning of UAVFs and provides a better Pareto solution set for the path planning of refueling tankers.

AB In this study, the air-ground integrated deployment method is studied for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled mobile edge computing (MEC) system. The UAV can help to reduce the delay and energy consumption of MEC. However, the limited coverage range of UAV limits the quality of data offloading. To improve the efficiency of data transmission, a hierarchical game model is designed. Ground nodes form multiple coalitions actively according to the position of UAV and the UAV adjusts the position based on the data distribution of ground networks. The relationship between the UAV and ground nodes is modelled as a Stackelberg game. A coalition formation game (CFG) is constructed for the data gathering among ground nodes. It is proved that the proposed CFG is an exact potential game with at least one Nash equilibrium. Moreover, the property of Stackelberg equilibrium is proven for the air-ground cooperative relationship. Based on the hierarchical model, a distributed air-ground integrated deployment algorithm is proposed to jointly optimise the position of the UAV and the coalition formation of ground nodes. The simulation results show that the proposed method promotes the efficiency of data transmission greatly and can converge to a stable state with reasonable iteration times.

AB As a popular technology, visual-inertial odometry (VIO) has been widely applied in many fields such as autonomous robots and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, the trade-off between localization accuracy and real-time performance still needs to be optimized. This paper presents a real-time tightly-coupled monocular VIO system using point and line interrelated features (PLI-VIO) under the sliding window optimization framework. In line feature extraction part of PLI-VIO, a line segment extraction and coalescence algorithm based on EDlines is proposed, which extracts line features in real-time without concession on feature quality. At the same time, in order to get efficient and robust line tracking effect, PLI-VIO presents a line-to-point tracking method that fully utilizes the interrelation between point and line. Specifically, line features are divided as a group of points and tracked by pyramidal implementation of Lucas Kanade feature tracker. The proposed line feature tracking method can effectively reduce time consumption on tracking process in a robust way. Extensive evaluations on Euroc and TUM-VI public datasets are performed to demonstrate the preferable performance of our proposed system, and the results show that PLI-VIO obtains better localization accuracy with less computation cost compared against other state-of-the-art VIO algorithms.

AB Perceiving and parsing a maritime scene automatically and in real time is a key task for autonomous surface vehicle navigation. We propose a panoptic segmentation framework that allows end-to-end training and multiple task cascading to meet the navigational challenges of scene parsing in a complex maritime environment. In our framework, the feature extraction backbone is based on Res2Net combined with improved FPN. The fusion network neck adds a mask branch to the latest YOLO detector and embeds a bottleneck attention module. We address possible inference conflict between semantic segmentation and instance segmentation with a panoptic fusion head that resolves conflict using Dezert-Smarandache theory. We also constructed the first maritime scene parsing dataset MarPS-1395, which is completely and fully annotated. MarPS-1395 is the first panoptic segmentation dataset in this field. We validated our model on MarPS-1395 as well as the publicly available dataset to investigate the real-time performance and the accuracy of multitask implementation in panoptic segmentation, which included object detection and classification, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. The experimental results also show that our method can robustly accomplish full scene parsing in a complex maritime environment, and achieved a good balance between accuracy of segmentation and speed of computing.

AB In recent years, the advent of disruptive transport technologies has started to transform the transport sector. Governments are therefore challenged to find the right balance in transport governance frameworks that allows new services, practices, and entrants to emerge, but also ensures adequate and equitable service delivery, a fair and competitive landscape, and fulfillment of policy objectives. Workshop five of the 16th International Conference on Competition and Ownership in Land Passenger Transport (Thredbo 16) focused on this challenge. Eight studies of governance approaches to ridesourcing, autonomous public transport, and Mobility-as-a-Service were reported. These examples catered for a discussion on the development status of disruptive transport technologies and on what roles governments have adopted, what types of regulations and policies they have been using, and what is known about the impacts of these approaches. Drawing on this discussion, the workshop advocates transport scholars to work on the theoretical grounding of key concepts and to elicit empirical evidence from trials and operations on disruptive transport technologies' effects on e.g. equity, employment, and modal shares. To governments wishing to facilitate the development and diffusion of disruptive transport technologies, the workshop offers ten recommendations that in sum describe an explorative, collaborative, and reflexive governance approach.

AB Despite significant advances in machine learning and perception over the past few decades, perception algorithms can still be unreliable when deployed in challenging time-varying environments. When these systems are used for autonomous decision-making, such as in self-driving vehicles, the impact of their mistakes can be catastrophic. As such, it is important to characterize the performance of the system and predict when and where it may fail in order to take appropriate action. While similar in spirit to the idea of introspection, this work introduces a new paradigm for predicting the likely performance of a robot's perception system based on past experience in the same workspace. In particular, we propose two models that probabilistically predict perception performance from observations gathered over time. While both approaches are place-specific, the second approach additionally considers appearance similarity when incorporating past observations. We evaluate our method in a classical decision-making scenario in which the robot must choose when and where to drive autonomously in 60 km of driving data from an urban environment. Results demonstrate that both approaches lead to fewer false decisions (in terms of incorrectly offering or denying autonomy) for two different detector models, and show that leveraging visual appearance within a state-of-the-art navigation framework increases the accuracy of our performance predictions.

AB In January 2011, magmatic eruptions at Shinmoe-dake, Kirishima, Japan, started for the first time in 300 years. After three sub-plinian explosive events, lava accumulation started at the summit crater. The accumulation lasted for about three months, and the final volume of the accumulated lava reached 1.5 x 10(7) m(3). We conducted aeromagnetic surveys using an unmanned autonomous helicopter over the Shinmoe-dake summit crater in late May 2011, and late October to early November, 2011, in order to investigate the magnetization of this area and changes in the magnetic field associated with the 2011 eruption. The averaged magnetization intensity around Shinmoe-dake is 1.5 A/m. A demagnetized area elongated in the north to northwest direction from Shinmoe-dake has been detected. We also detected a clear change in the total magnetic field between the two aeromagnetic observations characterized by positive and negative changes in the south and north, respectively, of the Shinmoe-dake edifice. These changes are well reproduced by a model in which 20-70% of lava accumulated in the summit crater was cooled down below the Curie temperature and has been magnetized.

AB Introduction: The introduction of automated vehicles to the road environment brings new challenges for older drivers. Level 3 of conditional automation requires drivers to take over control of their vehicle whenever the automated system reaches its limits. Even though autonomous vehicles may be of great benefit to older drivers in terms of safely maintaining their mobility, a better understanding of their takeover performance remains crucial. The objective of this review of the literature is to shed more light on the effects that aging has on takeover performance during automated driving.
   Methods: Three database searches were conducted: PsychINFO, Web Of Sciences, and TRID. Studies from the last decade which included groups of older drivers were reviewed.
   Results: After checking through abstracts and texts of articles, 9 articles, 4 proceedings papers, and 1 technical report were included in this review. All studies included a driving simulator that refers to level 3 of automation (which requires supervision by the driver). Five out of fourteen studies showed that older adults had poorer takeover performance (in terms of takeover time and takeover quality) than younger adults. However, several factors, such as the type of non-driving related task (NDRT), were seen to influence takeover performance in older adults. Speed, type and duration of notification interval, distribution and duration of driving modes, and number of takeovers were all also factors of influence.
   Conclusion: This review synthesizes the results of 14 articles which investigate the effects of age-related changes on takeover performance. Various external factors as NDRTs, speed, type and duration of notification to take over, duration of the automated phase, distribution of the automated/manual phases may affect takeover performance in older adults. Even if the majority of articles showed that older adults are globally slower at taking over a vehicle than younger adults, findings concerning take over quality yield divergent results. It's probably due to age related cognitive changes, particularly in executive functions or to a great heterogeneity in this population. This literature review highlights the need to develop new research on the impact of aging on takeover performance.

AB We consider an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisting data collection from multiple sensor nodes (SNs). We provide a completion time minimization design via jointly deciding the UAV trajectory and the SN assignment scheme. In particular, we first characterize the fundamental features of the joint optimal solution to the formulated problem. On the one hand, the optimal UAV trajectory is proved following a successive-hover-fly (SHF) structure. Namely, in an optimal solution, the UAV successively visits multiple hovering points and performs hovering with designated duration, while the maximum speed is achieved during the whole flying period between each two hovering points. On the other hand, the optimal SN assignment is characterized to follow a segment-based scheme. Based on the two characterizations, we are motivated to implement SHF structure with turning points in trajectory design and reasonably assume each segment in SHF structure having constant SN assignment. Afterwards, we relax the binary constraints for SN assignments and establish a convex approximation for the reformulated problem, which enables an iterative algorithm. A suboptimal joint solution is obtained via iteratively optimizing the completion time. A realization strategy is also provided for the relaxed solution while assuring the completion of data collection tasks. Finally, the proposed solution is validated and evaluated through numerical results. Both a low complexity and an accurate task completion guarantee of our proposed solution are observed in comparison with the benchmarks.

AB High-precision location information formulates the basis of the modern Internet of Things (IoT). However, since the navigation signals from the global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) are frequently attenuated or blocked in urban areas, reliable and high accuracy positioning alternatives are thus required for ground devices (GDs). Due to the advantages of their flexible deployment and extensive coverage, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) show significant potential in this ground localization enhancement system. In this article, we propose a UAV aided positioning (UAP) system for GDs, where the UAVs provide valuable flying Line of Sight (LoS) observations. Specifically, we first give the fundamental limits of the proposed UAP system in terms of the Cramer-Rao low bound (CRLB), where the UAVs are treated as "agents" with unknown positions instead of anchors. Then, we formulate a general UAP method using the nonparametric belief propagation (NBP)-based probabilistic framework, to jointly positioning UAVs and GDs simultaneously. Moreover, a two-step clustering-based solution is given to tackle the data association challenge in the multi-UAV scenarios. We also show that proper data feedback could achieve additional performance advantages without any extra measurements. The optimal multi-UAV deployment strategy is then proposed, by which the potential of the UAP system could be fully characterized. Last but not least, we verify our solutions via numerical simulations and practical experiments, which provide meaningful insights and performance evaluations to the system design and implementations.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-enabled multicasting network has attracted significant attention in recent years. However, there are still some disadvantages of existing multicasting schemes used in these systems, such as low transmission efficiency and high feedback overhead. Accordingly, we propose a sliding coding window (SCW)-based random network coding (SCWRNC) scheme for a UAV multicasting network where one UAV base station is dispatched to the multicast data stream to multiple user equipments (UEs). The proposed scheme includes an SCW scheduling original packets for encoding, a lower triangular coding structure enabling UEs to decode out information even without receiving a full set of coded packets, and a feedback-compete mechanism requiring only one UE to send feedback information. The packet scheduling process is described as a five-tuple Markov decision process. Then, we give a theoretical analysis of the proposed scheme, based on which the sliding steps of SCW and the UAV hovering location are jointly optimized to maximize the system throughput. The optimal sliding steps are obtained by applying the Greedy scheduling technique, while the UAV optimal position is obtained by minimizing the maximum outage probability of all UEs. Furthermore, we also propose a flexible feedback mechanism, which enables more than one UE to send feedback for systems with sufficient resources and a "F-SCWRNC" scheme for systems where no UE is allowed to send feedback. Numerical results show that both the proposed SCWRNC scheme and F-SCWRNC scheme could achieve significant throughput gain over the existing ones.

TI Efficient Task Offloading for 802.11p-Based Cloud-Aware Mobile Fog

DT Article
ID RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; PERFORMANCE
AB Various emerging vehicular applications such as autonomous driving and safety early warning are used to improve the traffic safety and ensure passenger comfort. The completion of these applications necessitates significant computational resources to perform enormous latency-sensitive/nonlatency-sensitive and computation-intensive tasks. It is hard for vehicles to satisfy the computation requirements of these applications due to the limit computational capability of the on-board computer. To solve the problem, many works have proposed some efficient task offloading schemes in computing paradigms such as mobile fog computing (MFC) for the vehicular network. In the MFC, vehicles adopt the IEEE 802.11p protocol to transmit tasks. According to the IEEE 802.11p, tasks can be divided into high priority and low priority according to the delay requirements. However, no existing task offloading work takes into account the different priorities of tasks transmitted by different access categories (ACs) of IEEE 802.11p. In this paper, we propose an efficient task offloading strategy to maximize the long-term expected system reward in terms of reducing the executing time of tasks. Specifically, we jointly consider the impact of priorities of tasks transmitted by different ACs, mobility of vehicles, and the arrival/departure of computing tasks, and then transform the offloading problem into a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) model. Afterwards, we adopt the relative value iterative algorithm to solve the SMDP model to find the optimal task offloading strategy. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme by extensive experiments. Numerical results indicate that the proposed offloading strategy performs well compared to the greedy algorithm.

AB The motion performance of underwater gliders (UGs) is an important basis for their preliminary design. Because of their unique buoyancy-driven mode, the UGs differ greatly in dynamic model and working principle from the propeller-driven underwater vehicles, such as submarines, torpedoes and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Therefore, it's inadvisable to use the evaluation models and criteria of motion performance for the latters, which are established on the basis of their dynamic models, to evaluate the performance of UGs. There is a lack of applicable evaluation models and criteria to motion performance of UGs. In addition, as the effects of seawater depth on UGs are generally neglected in the dynamic model, its effects on the motion performance of UGs still need to be investigated further. In this paper, based on an established applicable dynamic model and evaluation models (the free perturbation and maneuverability equations) in the vertical plane, the applicable evaluation criteria are derived and the characteristics of motion performance of UGs under the effects of seawater depth variation are investigated. The results show that, the evaluation models and criteria of motion performance for the buoyancy-driven UGs show significant difference from those for the propeller-driven underwater vehicles. As velocity of the UG is affected by seawater depth variation, its dynamic stability is also affected obviously. With the increasing seawater depth, its dynamic stability becomes stronger, and its change rate of surfacing speed (maneuverability) increases obviously with seawater depth. The present work enriches motion performance theory of UGs, and provides valuable guidance for their applications in the deep-sea region.

AB Path planning is a vital and challenging component in the support of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and their deployment in autonomous missions, such as following ground moving target. Few attempts are reported in the literature on multirotor UAV path planning techniques for following ground moving targets despite the great improvement in their control dynamics, flying behaviors and hardware specifications. These attempts suffer several drawbacks including their hardware dependency, high computational requirements, inability to handle obstacles and dynamic environments in addition to their low performance regarding the moving target speed variations. In this paper, a novel dynamic Artificial Potential Field (D-APF) path planning technique is developed for multirotor UAVs for following ground moving targets. The UAV produced path is a smooth and flyable path suitable to dynamic environments with obstacles and can handle different motion profiles for the ground moving target including change in speed and direction. Additionally, the proposed path planning technique effectively supports UAVs following ground moving targets while maneuvering ahead and at a standoff distance from the target. It is hardware-independent where it can be used on most types of multirotor UAVs with an autopilot flight controller and basic sensors for distance measurements. The developed path planning technique is tested and validated against existing general potential field techniques for different simulation scenarios in ROS and gazebo-supported PX4-SITL. Simulation results show that the proposed D-APF is better suited for UAV path planning for following moving ground targets compared to existing general APFs. In addition, it outperforms the general APFs as it is more suitable for UAVs flying in environments with dynamic and unknown obstacles.

AB One commonly used method to measure and detect centimeter-scale changes on land is structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry, wherein sets of digital images are used to generate three-dimensional spatial models. Subcentimeter accuracy useful for geodetic studies is achievable when these surveys are conducted on land or from the air. This method has made its way into marine environments by way of scuba, remotely operated vehicle, and autonomous underwater vehicle-based surveys largely in the context of mapping. Repeated SfM photogrammetry surveys could be used to monitor changes in the stability of seafloor benchmarks and key sites as the interest in and need for marine geodetic measurements continues to grow. These studies require centimeter-level accuracy or better, and some rely on accurate placement, positioning, or relocation of geodetic monuments, benchmarks, and instruments. We assessed the accuracy of the photogrammetric method for this purpose by simultaneously conducting a remotely operated vehicle-based SfM photo survey to produce three-dimensional spatial data, and a precise pressure survey to accurately measure height information. We found that the SfM survey agreed with the pressure survey height within its uncertainty of +/- 6.0 cm while using a standard, off-the-shelf camera adapted for underwater use. This level of relative accuracy would allow us to detect changes in geodetic benchmarks or instrumented sites between repeated surveys where large changes or the accumulation of small changes is expected within the scene over several years. We believe that centimeter-level accuracy is obtainable with adjustments to the photogrammetry survey parameters, a higher-resolution camera, and inclusion of additional coded targets.

AB As semiautonomous driving systems are becoming prevalent in late model vehicles, it is important to understand how such systems affect driver attention. This study investigated whether measures from low-cost devices monitoring peripheral physiological state were comparable to standard EEG in predicting lapses in attention to system failures. Twenty-five participants were equipped with a low-fidelity eye-tracker and heart rate monitor and with a high-fidelity NuAmps 32-channel quick-gel EEG system and asked to detect the presence of potential system failure while engaged in a fully autonomous lane changing driving task. To encourage participant attention to the road and to assess engagement in the lane changing task, participants were required to: (a) answer questions about that task; and (b) keep a running count of the type and number of billboards presented throughout the driving task. Linear mixed effects analyses were conducted to model the latency of responses reaction time (RT) to automation signals using the physiological metrics and time period. Alpha-band activity at the midline parietal region in conjunction with heart rate variability (HRV) was important in modeling RT over time. Results suggest that current low-fidelity technologies are not sensitive enough by themselves to reliably model RT to critical signals. However, that HRV interacted with EEG to significantly model RT points to the importance of further developing heart rate metrics for use in environments where it is not practical to use EEG.

ID INFORMATION
AB Traffic load monitoring based on deep learning and computer vision has garnered significant attention in bridge engineering worldwide. Unlike traditional traffic load monitoring systems, computer vision-based techniques can accurately extract the spatiotemporal load distribution across the entire bridge in an autonomous manner. However, many of the related studies in the literature used data sets that were collected from a few specific areas of different bridges, and there are very limited data sets that provide complete coverage of the entire bridge, making a detailed comparison of different computer vision methods difficult. This paper presents a benchmark data set that provides a series of annotations and field measurements required for traffic load detection, tracking, and continuous monitoring on the bridge. The data set was collected by five cameras and two weigh-in-motion systems installed on a cable-stayed bridge and is divided into three subsets. The first subset contains over 32,000 images and annotation files of 11 types of vehicle-related targets, which are necessary for the training of vehicle detection models. The second subset consists of photos of the calibration board and coordinates of reference points that are used for camera calibration. The last subset is designated for the field verification of various algorithms, providing synchronized vehicle weight data and monitoring videos covering the whole bridge. To the author's knowledge, this data set is the first open-source data set for vision-based traffic load monitoring in a bridge, which will have tremendous value in promoting research in the area of innovative bridge health monitoring technologies. Details of this data set will be available in the public domain through a Zenodo data repository.

AB Despite the structure of road environments, imposed via geometry and rules, traffic flows exhibit complex multiagent dynamics. Reasoning about such dynamics is challenging due to the high dimensionality of possible behavior, the heterogeneity of agents, and the stochasticity of their decision-making. Modeling approaches learning associations in Euclidean spaces are often limited by their high sample complexity and the sparseness of available datasets. Our key insight is that the structure of traffic behavior could be effectively captured by lower-dimensional abstractions that emphasize critical interaction relationships. In this article, we abstract the space of behavior in traffic scenes into a discrete set of interaction modes, described in interpretable, symbolic form using topological braids. First, through a case study across real-world datasets, we show that braids can describe a wide range of complex behavior and uncover insights about the interactivity of vehicles. For instance, we find that high vehicle density does not always map to rich mixing patterns among them. Further, we show that our representation can effectively guide decision-making in traffic scenes. We describe a mechanism that probabilistically maps vehicles' past behavior to modes of future interaction. We integrate this mechanism into a control algorithm that treats navigation as minimization of uncertainty over interaction modes, and investigate its performance on the task of traversing uncontrolled intersections in simulation. We show that our algorithm enables agents to coordinate significantly safer traversals for similar efficiency compared to baselines explicitly reasoning in the space of trajectories across a series of challenging scenarios.

AB Satellite-aerial-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has been widely envisioned as a promising network architecture for 6G. In the SAGINs, high-altitude platform (HAP)-aided relaying satellite systems using hybrid free-space optics (FSO)/radio-frequency (RF) communications have recently attracted research efforts worldwide. Nevertheless, the main drawback of hybrid FSO/RF systems is the restricted bandwidth of the RF connection, especially when the FSO one is blocked by cloud coverage. This article explores a novel solution for the hybrid FSO/RF HAP-based SAGIN under the impact of weather and atmospheric conditions. Specifically, an additional unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is deployed to diverse the FSO link from the HAP-to-ground station to avoid cloud blockage while maintaining a high-speed connection of the FSO link. A mirror array constructed by reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), an emerging technology, is mounted on the UAV to reflect the signals from the HAP. The channel model of RIS-UAV takes into account both atmospheric turbulence and hovering-induced pointing errors. Furthermore, we present a novel link switching design with a multirate adaptation scheme for the proposed network under different weather and turbulence conditions. Numerical results quantitatively confirm the effectiveness of our proposal. Additionally, we provide insightful discussions that can be helpful for the practical system design of RIS-UAV-assisted HAP-based SAGIN using hybrid FSO/RF links. Monte Carlo simulations are also performed to validate the accuracy of theoretical derivations.

AB In this paper we study the impact of having used an automated taxi (AT) or simply living in a city where ATs are operating on users' preferences for and attitudes toward ATs. This paper aims then to contribute to the research on ATs and on the impact of experiencing innovations. Data were collected in three major cities in China where ATs were in operation (AT cities), and other major cities where only normal taxis (NTs) were operating (NT cities). A stated choice (SC) experiment was built that included level-of-services attributes, specific AT in-vehicle features, levels of AT adoption and customers' reviews. In addition, a set of attitudinal statements was included to measure injunctive norms, hedonic motivation and trust. Hybrid choice models were estimated accounting for intra-individual correlation. Results show that living in a city where AT are operating does not affect the willingness to pay for travel and waiting time, which is an expected result. But those living in AT cities compared with those living in NT cities are willing to pay just half the amount to have the in-vehicle feature "change destination during the trip" and around three times as much for good reviews about ATs for trips less than 30 min. Interestingly, trust has a positive and significant impact on the choice of AT only for those living in NT cities, while hedonic motivation is significant only for those living in AT cities. Finally, we did not find differences between those who had used an AT and those who had never used it.

ID OBJECTS
AB We describe a method for detecting crossing pedestrians and, in general, any object that is moving perpendicular to the driving direction of the vehicle. This is achieved by combining video snapshots from multiple cameras that are placed in a linear configuration and from multiple time instances. We demonstrate that the proposed array configuration imposes tight constraints on the expected disparity of static objects in a certain image region for a given camera pair. These regions are distinct for different camera pairs. In that manner, static regions can generally be distinguished from moving targets throughout the entire field of view when analyzing enough pairs, requiring only straightforward image processing techniques. On a self-captured dataset with crossing pedestrians, our proposed method reaches an F-1 detection score of 83.66% and a mean average precision (MAP) of 84.79% on an overlap test when used stand-alone, being processed at 59 frames per second without GPU acceleration. When combining it with the Yolo V4 object detector in cooperative fusion, the proposed method boosts the maximal F-1 scores of this detector on this same dataset from 87.86% to 92.68% and the MAP from 90.85% to 94.30%. Furthermore, combining it with the lower power Yolo-Tiny V4 detector in the same way yields F-1 and MAP increases from 68.57% to 81.16% and 72.32% to 85.25%, respectively. (c) The Authors.

ID DESIGN; OPTIMIZATION
AB In this paper, we consider an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled multi-user network with nonlinear wireless power transfer (WPT), where multiple user sensors are distributed on the ground. Acting as an energy source, the UAV operates at a fixed height and transfers energy to the multiple sensor nodes (SNs) via wireless signals. For more efficient energy harvesting (EH), an antenna array has been installed on UAV with a structure of three dimensional (3D) uniform linear array (ULA), which enables the UAV to perform analog beamforming for power concentration. Taking into account the UAV energy consumption and considering a practical nonlinear EH model, we characterize the UAV energy efficiency particularly for WPT task and subsequently formulate an efficiency maximization problem, in which the analog beamforming and UAV trajectory planning are jointly determined together with the transmit power control scheme. To deal with the nonconvex joint optimization problem, we first propose a cosine-based approximation for the complicated 3D ULA antenna pattern, in which a convex property is proved. Combining with the proved convexity in nonlinear EH model, through a series of mathematical analysis, we construct a convex subproblem based on any feasible point, solving which guarantees an improvement of the energy efficiency. Afterwards, an iterative algorithm is proposed for iteratively addressing the joint design until a convergence to a suboptimal solution. Via simulations, we verify the convergence and performance advantages of our proposed iterative solution. Among the solution, different beamforming preferences regarding the beam coverage enlargement and power concentration are also observed with respect to different antenna array scales.

ID PRIVACY
AB Simultaneous trajectory prediction for multiple heterogeneous traffic participants is essential for safe and efficient operation of connected automated vehicles under complex driving situations. Two main challenges for this task are to handle the varying number of heterogeneous target agents and jointly consider multiple factors that would affect their future motions. This is because different kinds of agents have different motion patterns, and their behaviors are jointly affected by their individual dynamics, their interactions with surrounding agents, as well as the traffic infrastructures. A trajectory prediction method handling these challenges will benefit the downstream decision-making and planning modules of autonomous vehicles. To meet these challenges, we propose a three-channel framework together with a novel Heterogeneous Edge-enhanced graph ATtention network (HEAT). Our framework is able to deal with the heterogeneity of the target agents and traffic participants involved. Specifically, agents' dynamics are extracted from their historical states using type-specific encoders. The inter-agent interactions are represented with a directed edge-featured heterogeneous graph and processed by the designed HEAT network to extract interaction features. Besides, the map features are shared across all agents by introducing a selective gate-mechanism. And finally, the trajectories of multiple agents are predicted simultaneously. Validations using both urban and highway driving datasets show that the proposed model can realize simultaneous trajectory predictions for multiple agents under complex traffic situations, and achieve state-of-the-art performance with respect to prediction accuracy. The achieved final displacement error (FDE@3sec) is 0.66 meter under urban driving, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has become increasingly popular in recent years, leading to a surge in research on this topic that is widely represented in the literature. They would be examined in accordance with the requirements of the sensors they house, their operating limits, and the output information they give. Since perception, planning, localization, and control are the major tasks of UAVs, an outstanding problem solver "Deep learning"is recently used in these systems. It is ideally suited for UAV applications because of its great capacity for learning representations from the complicated data received in actual situations. This paper provides an extensive review and in-depth analysis of current advancements in UAVs that have applications with DNN, as well as a quick summary of research and development during the previous ten years. In terms of UAVs flight monitoring, remote sensing and vision capability, and energy modeling, this survey provides a roadmap for understanding the sequential development of sophisticated UAVs by reviewing 173 retrieved papers. For this purpose, first of all, the main titles of the studies carried out for UAV applications were gathered under a taxonomy, and then information about the studies carried out in recent years related to these main research fields was given. In the last part of the study, attention was drawn to the still challenging points, such as autonomous fault detection, path planning, and onboard event detection, which are anticipated to be the future trends involving UAV applications.

AB The introduction of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) makes low-power links face many new challenges in UAV-assisted wireless-sensor network (WSN). In this article, the spatial characteristics of these low-power links are analyzed comprehensively, and the applicability of traditional link quality metrics and models is evaluated. In particular, the differences between link characteristics of UAV-assisted WSN and those of traditional WSN are discussed, and possible reasons for these differences are analyzed. To achieve this goal, two UAVs working on different bands are used and three different flight modes are designed. Experimental results show that link characteristics of UAV-assisted WSN become more complicated due to the 3-D movement of UAV. Link quality fluctuates significantly when the altitude or horizontal distance changes, and it is difficult to demarcate a clear bound between the connected and transitional region. Traditional models for spatial characteristic are only applicable when there is no UAV communication interference and the direction between the air node and ground node remains unchanged. Meanwhile, existing models between physical-layer metrics and packet reception ratio are only applicable when there is no UAV communication interference. For links with the same quality, stability of UAV-assisted WSN is not significantly different from that of traditional WSN. Finally, there is more obvious overall asymmetry between uplinks and downlinks in UAV-assisted WSN, and the quality of downlinks is significantly better than that of uplinks. The discovery of these new features would have great significance on the design of UAV-assisted WSN.

AB Landslides are a natural geological phenomenon and often cause economic losses, property damage, and loss of lives. The detection and recognition based on the dense point cloud derived from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAVs) images play an important role in understanding the mechanism of landslides. However, the brightness difference of UAV images with large altitude differences usually makes the dense point cloud within a landslide area show color stratification, and the processing results of popular commercial and open-source software are not ideal. In this study, a multi-view UAV image brightness compensation method based on regular 3D points is proposed, and is combined with the open-source software OpenMVG and OpenMVS to obtain a dense point cloud with balanced color on the landslide's surface. The selected study area is located in the active landslide region caused by the Tengqing coal mining area in Guizhou Province, China. The terrain following flight method was used to acquire complete high resolution UAV images of the study area. Experimental results show that the global gain and offset compensation methods proposed in this study can effectively reduce the 22.3% brightness difference in the overlapping area of the adjacent images. The comparison results and the processing results of other commercial software show that the method can be applied to the color balance of the dense point cloud for UAV images with large-altitude differences.

TI Crowd Detection in Aerial Images Using Spatial Graphs and

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) also known as drones are increasingly populating our skies. This represents a relevant issue both for the legislator and the researcher. While the regulation plans often assume precautionary approaches, stating restrictive conditions of use for the sake of public safety, the applied research is exploring novel strategies to develop autonomous vehicles endowed with trusty operating mechanisms. The challenge is to let drones overflying even populated areas while keeping a steady control of the situation on the ground, thus enabling the possibility of safe landing with no harm for people. This can be done employing on-board cameras and embedded GPUs which allow for the execution in real-time of computer vision applications. In this paper, we introduce a crowd detection method for drone safe landing. The pivotal points of our proposal are related to the computational limitations imposed by the currently available hardware resources of UAVs. In this sense, our method is based on the light-weight scheme of a fully-convolutional neural network which conjugates nimble computations and effectiveness. We propose a two-loss model where a classification task (oriented to distinguish between crowded/non-crowded scenes) is supported by a regression task (aimed at better focusing the agglomeration tendency of the persons). This latter job is realized by resorting to the construction of a spatial graph for each analysed image and to the evaluation of the corresponding clustering coefficient. As a further element, our model is endowed with the capability to produce class activation heatmaps which contribute to the semantic enrichment of the flight maps. We tested our model on a large dataset of aerial images and we observed how it compares favorably with other approaches proposed in literature.

ID MARKOV-MODELS; PREDICTION; BEHAVIOR
AB Developing an automated vehicle, that can handle complicated driving scenarios and appropriately interact with other road users, requires the ability to semantically learn and understand driving environment, oftentimes, based on analyzing massive amounts of naturalistic driving data. An important paradigm that allows automated vehicles to both learn from human drivers and gain insights is understanding the principal compositions of the entire traffic, termed as traffic primitives. However, the exploding data growth presents a great challenge in extracting primitives from high-dimensional time-series traffic data with various types of road users engaged. Therefore, automatically extracting primitives is becoming one of the cost-efficient ways to help autonomous vehicles understand and predict the complex traffic scenarios. In addition, the extracted primitives from raw data should 1) be appropriate for automated driving applications and also 2) be easily used to generate new traffic scenarios. However, existing literature does not provide a method to automatically learn these primitives from large-scale traffic data. The contribution of this letter has two manifolds. The first one is that we proposed a new framework to generate new traffic scenarios from a handful of limited traffic data. The second one is that, we introduce a nonparametric Bayesian learning method-a sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model-to automatically extract primitives from multidimensional traffic datawithout prior knowledge of the primitive settings. The developed method is then validated using one day of naturalistic driving data. Experiment results show that the nonparametric Bayesian learning method is able to extract primitives from traffic scenarios where both the binary and continuous events coexist.

AB Accurate subsidence inventory data, based on an understanding of local topography, are a crucial first step toward reliable subsidence prediction and mapping future subsidence hazards. However, conventional, human-based methods of surveying and mapping subsidence suffer from data omissions and errors due to problems regarding accessibility, safety, and manual digitization. This study employed unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetry to compile an accurate subsidence inventory map of abandoned mine areas. A Phantom 2 Vision? drone was used, which is inexpensive yet appropriate for detailed topographic surveying of small-sized mine sites with a history of subsidence. An autonomous flight plan was designed, taking into account the extent of target mapping areas. A series of 29 aerial photographs were obtained within 2 min; digitally georeferenced orthoimage and digital terrain model (DTM) with 5 cm resolution could be obtained by processing with coordinate information of pre-installed ground control points (GCPs) within 30 min. sinkhole-type subsidence, including locational information, was identified from the geocoded high-resolution orthoimage and the DTM, and its area and volume were calculated to be 427 m(2) and 2323 m(3) (length 25 m, width 23 m, depth 9.1 m), respectively, from its modeled shape. Contour lines (10 cm interval), slope, and curvature were produced using the DTM. Validation using the GCP locations showed an error of approximately 14 cm in the generated DTM, which was considered acceptable for subsidence mapping purposes. The proposed approach enables accurate, rapid, low-cost, and safe surveying and mapping, which complements conventional surveying methods at sites of mining subsidence.

AB Edge computing is a viable paradigm for supporting Industrial Internet of Things deployment by shifting computationally demanding tasks from resource-constrained devices to powerful edge servers. In this study, mobile edge computing (MEC) services are provided for multiple ground mobile nodes (MNs) through a time-division multiple access protocol using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled edge servers. Remotely controlled UAVs can serve as MEC servers due to their adaptability and flexibility. However, the current MEC approaches have proven ineffective in situations where the number of MNs rapidly increases or network resources are sparsely distributed. Furthermore, suitable accessibility across wireless networks via MNs with an acceptable quality of service is a fundamental problem for conventional UAV-assisted communications. To tackle this issue, we present an optimized computation resource allocation model using cooperative evolutionary computation to solve the joint optimization problem of queue-based computation offloading and adaptive computing resource allocation. The developed method ensures the task computation delay of all MNs within a time block, optimizes the sum of MN's accessibility rates, and reduces the energy consumption of the UAV and MNs while meeting task computation restrictions. Moreover, we propose a multilayer data flow processing system to make full use of the computational capability across the system. The top layer of the system contains the cloud center, the middle layer contains the UAV-assisted MEC servers, and the bottom layer contains the mobile devices. Our numerical analysis and simulation results prove that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional techniques such as equal offloading time allocation and straight-line flight.

AB this article, we consider a networked control system (NCS) with network-induced delay, in which the control center needs to control the remote unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to complete the trajectory tracking task. The sensor of the controlled UAV adopts the event-triggered mechanism, while the control center uses the adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) based tracking control method to generate control actions. The application of the ADP method brings new transmission options, i.e., the control center can choose to transmit control action or neural network model. Considering the fundamental tradeoff between these two transmission options with different transmission energy consumption and tracking cost, we formulate the joint optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). Due to the continuous value of state in MDP, we propose the deep Q-network (DQN)-based strategy, which uses the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, specifically DQN. Besides, we further propose a greedy strategy by calculating the instantaneous expected cost. Simulation results show that DQN-based strategy has better performance but depends on the training process, while greedy strategy is suboptimal but easy to compute. Besides, compared with the benchmark strategies, the proposed strategies can achieve a better compromise in the long-term average energy consumption and tracking cost by adjusting the value of the weighted factor. Furthermore, by comparing the difference of transmission decisions in the proposed strategies, we show that the proper transmission sequence in DQN-based strategy can reduce the tracking cost and transmission energy at the same time.

AB Mobile-edge computing (MEC) networks are facing limited coverage and harsh wireless transmission environments that severely hinder the computation capacity of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. To overcome these issues, this article proposes a novel MEC framework empowered by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relay and a reconfigurable intelligence surface (RIS). To fully exploit the potentials in terms of computation enhancement brought by the joint UAV and RIS design, we formulate a max-min computation capacity problem via determining the uplink signal detection, active beamforming of UAV, passive beamforming of RIS, time slot partition, computation bits of UAV, and UAV's trajectory. We develop a concave-convex procedure (CCCP)-based algorithm in an alternating optimization manner over three subproblems to solve the formulated problem. It finds that the CCCP-based algorithm is conducive to decouple the intractable expressions by converting them into new but tractable second-order cone (SOC) constrains. To evaluate the performance of the proposed CCCP-based algorithm, we later design a direct algorithm by exploiting the implicit convexity of the problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CCCP-based algorithm derives a comparable performance as the direct algorithm, and achieves about 2.57-Mb max-min computation capacity higher compared with the straight flight case, and 8.08-Mb max-min computation capacity higher compared with the case without RIS, which validate the superiority of the joint UAV and RIS design for computation enhancement.

To support low-latency, high-bandwidth, dense mobility, and high availability, researchers worldwide have proposed efficient 5G REC infrastructures to end vehicular users (VU). However, with the growing number of sensor units, intelligent automation, dense sensor integration at massive ultra-low latency is required. To address the issue, the focus has shifted toward sixth-generation (6G)-based intelligent C-V2X orchestration. However, the sensor data is exchanged through open channels, and thus trust and privacy among C-V2X nodes is a prime concern. Thus, blockchain (BC) is a potential solution to allow immutable exchange ledgers among CASV sensor units for secure data exchange. With this motivation, the proposed survey integrates BC and 6G-leveraged REC in C-V2X to address the issues of fifth-generation (5G)-REC through immutable, verified, and chronological timestamped data exchanged through 6G-envisioned terahertz (THz) channels, at high mobility, extremely low latency, and high availability. The survey also presents the open issues and research challenges in the 6G-envisioned BC-enabled REC C-V2X ecosystems via a proposed framework. A case study 6Edge is presented for smart 6G intelligent edge integration with BC-based ledgers. Finally, the concluding remarks and future direction of research are proposed. Thus, the proposed survey forms a guideline for automotive stakeholders, academicians, and researchers to explore the various opportunities of the possible integration in more significant detail.

AB While the 5-th generation of communication networks (5G) is taking its first deployment steps, high doubts still concern the fulfilment of the stringent requirements of its slices. To meet these complex requirements, robust access networks should support the current 5G air interface. In this regard, space and air networks, namely satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to play a key role due to wide coverage and flexible deployment, respectively. Currently, the integration of these platforms in the terrestrial networks is weak though. Therefore, we suggest bridging this gap by designing a heterogeneous traffic offloading approach in the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN). Our innovative offloading approach covers the co-existing requirements of two heterogeneous slices of 5G by offloading smartly the traffic to the appropriate segment of SAGIN. Specifically, the ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) traffic is offloaded to the UAV link and to the terrestrial link to satisfy its stringent requirements in terms of latency. However, the enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) traffic is offloaded to the UAV link, to the terrestrial link and to the satellite link because it is less sensitive to delay but needs high data rates. Our offloading approach boosts the network's availability and reduces the latency experienced in SAGIN through an efficient resource allocation and an optimized design of the UAVs trajectory. Our findings highlight the key role that the concrete integration between SAGIN segments plays to achieve a better quality of service (QoS) for different slices with heterogeneous requirements.

DE ISS; Short rendezvous profile; Human flight
AB The paper describes the reduction of the vehicle autonomous flight duration before docking to the ISS. The Russian Soyuz-TMA spacecraft dock to the ISS two days after launch. Due to the limited volume inside Soyuz-TMA the reduction of time until docking to the ISS is very important, since the long stay of the cosmonauts in the limited volume adds to the strain of the space flight. In the previous papers of the authors it was shown that the existing capabilities of Soyuz-TMA, the ISS and the ground control loop make it possible to transfer to the five-orbit rendezvous profile. However, the analysis of the cosmonauts' schedule on the launch day shows that its duration is at the allowable limit and that is why it is necessary to find a way to further reduce the flight duration of Soyuz-TMA before docking to less than five orbits. In a traditional rendezvous profile, the calculation of rendezvous burns begins only after determination of the actual vehicle insertion orbit. The paper describes an approach in which the first two rendezvous burns are performed as soon as the spacecraft reaches the reference orbit and the values of the burns are calculated prior to the launch based on the pre-flight data for the nominal insertion. This approach decreases the duration of the rendezvous by one orbit. The demonstration flight of a Progress vehicle using the proposed profile was implemented on August 1, 2012 and completely confirmed the correctness of the imbedded principles. The paper considers the possible improvements of the proposed approach and recovery from the contingencies. (c) 2013 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are required to thoroughly scan designated areas during underwater missions. They typically follow a zig-zag trajectory to achieve full coverage. However, effective coverage can be challenging in complex environments due to the accumulation and drift of navigation errors. Possible solutions include surfacing for satellite positioning or underwater acoustic positioning using transponders on other vehicles. Nevertheless, surfacing or active acoustics can compromise stealth during reconnaissance missions in hostile areas by revealing the vehicle's location.Methods We propose calibration and planning strategies based on error models and acoustic positioning to address this challenge. Acoustic markers are deployed via surface ships to minimize navigation errors while maintaining stealth. And a new path planning method using a traceless Kalman filter and acoustic localization is proposed to achieve full-area coverage of AUVs. By analyzing the statistics of accumulated sensor errors, we optimize the positions of acoustic markers to communicate with AUVs and achieve better coverage. AUV trajectory concealment is achieved during detection by randomizing the USV navigation trajectory and irregularizing the locations of acoustic marker.Results The proposed method enables the cumulative determination of the absolute position of a target with low localization error in a side-scan sonar-based search task. Simulations based on large-scale maps demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm.Discussion Solving the problem of accumulating underwater localization errors based on inertial navigation by error modeling and acoustic calibration is a typical way. In this paper, we have implemented a method to solve the localization error in a search scenario where stealth is considered.

AB Rubber isolators are usually used to protect high-precision equipment of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), avoiding damage from overlarge dynamic excitation. Considering the nonlinear properties of the rubber material, the nonlinear behavior of rubber isolators under shock exaltation is hard to be predict accurately without the available modal and accurate parameters. In view of this, the present study proposes a nonlinear model and parameter identification method of rubber isolators to present their transient responses under shock excitation. First, a nonlinear model of rubber isolators is introduced for simulating their amplitude and frequency-dependent deformation under shock excitation. A corresponding dynamic equation of the isolation system is proposed and analytically solved by the Newmark method and the Newton-arithmetic mean method. Secondly, a multilayer feed-forward neural network (MFFNN) is constructed with the current model to search the parameters, in which the differences between the estimated and tested responses are minimized. The sine-sweep and drop test are planned with MFFNN to build the parameter identification process of rubber isolators. Then, a T-shaped isolator composed of high-damping silicon rubber is selected as a sample, and its parameters were determined by the current identification process. The transient responses of the isolation system are reconstructed by the current mode with the identified parameter, which show good agreement with measured responses. The accuracy of the proposed model and parameter identification method is proved. Finally, the errors between the reconstructed responses and tested responses are analyzed, and the main mode of energy attenuation in the rubber isolator is discussed in order to provide an inside view of the current model.

AB In infrastructure-less scenarios such as rural environments, wild emergency response, military applications and disaster relief, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are capable of providing enhanced mobile edge computing (MEC) services for ground users. Although small latency is the most important advantage of MEC system, how to provide delay aware scheduling in UAV-enabled MEC system still remains unsolved. In this study, the authors investigate the delay aware scheduling problem in UAV-enabled orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) MEC system and formulate two non-convex optimisation problems. Moreover, they consider uplink and downlink architecture with characteristics in different UAV-ground links and traffic load. Furthermore, they propose two novel multi-stages resource allocation algorithms, i.e. the JSPA-T and JSPA-F algorithms with respect to downlink transmit power allocation and sub-carrier assignment. The mathematical frameworks with duality theory based alternative search optimisation and successive approximation method are proposed. The simulation results validate the performance improvement of the proposed solutions as well as the fast converge behaviour and small computational complexity.

AB We encounter a world where the role of robots has increased in society. Day by day, we can observe that problems related to autonomous vehicles are being solved. The focused problem that we have recently confronted is based on collaborative mapping with multi-robots since collaboratively generated map provides more information about the environment than with a single robot. Moreover, the mapping framework for robot team can be more efficient if 3D laser sensors are placed to cover wider area. However, laser sensors are commonly positioned intuitively and depended mostly on the designer's choice. To overcome designer-independent laser sensor setup for efficient collaborative mapping, a subjective evaluation of laser sensor placement is developed as another key aspect. This paper proposed a collaborative mapping framework for heterogeneous robot teams to make full use of collected information from different viewpoints and explore large areas more efficiently. It's comprised of two modules, localization of multi-robots and collaborative map construction. In addition, to avoid arbitrary setup of laser sensors in existing methods whose performance is heavily affected by designers' experience, a metric evaluation system was defined to determine the optimal placements of laser sensors and achieve maximum sweep area. The proposed methods were verified on both simulation and experiments which were carried out on a heterogeneous robot team (including an unmanned aerial vehicle and a ground vehicle). According to the metric evaluation, best placements were chosen for the laser sensors, and presented collaborative mapping technique was shown to work more efficiently compared with existing methods.

AB Nowadays, navigation systems are becoming common in the automotive industry due to advanced driver assistance systems and the development of autonomous vehicles. The MPU-6000 is a popular ultra low-cost Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) inertial measurement unit (IMU) used in several applications. Although this mass-market sensor is used extensively in a variety of fields, it has not caught the attention of the automotive industry. Moreover, a detailed performance analysis of this inertial sensor for ground navigation systems is not available in the previous literature. In this work, a deep examination of one MPU-6000 IMU as part of a low-cost navigation system for ground vehicles is provided. The steps to characterize the performance of the MPU-6000 are divided in two phases: static and kinematic analyses. Besides, an additional MEMS IMU of superior quality is also included in all experiments just for the purpose of comparison. After the static analysis, a kinematic test is conducted by generating a real urban trajectory registering an MPU-6000 IMU, the higher-grade MEMS IMU, and two GNSS receivers. The kinematic trajectory is divided in two parts, a normal trajectory with good satellites visibility and a second part where the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal is forced to be lost. Evaluating the attitude and position inaccuracies from these two scenarios, it is concluded in this preliminary work that this mass-market IMU can be considered as a convenient inertial sensor for low-cost integrated navigation systems for applications that can tolerate a 3D position error of about 2 m and a heading angle error of about 3 degrees.

AB We study the problem of planning a tour for an energy-limited Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to visit a set of sites in the least amount of time. We envision scenarios where the UAV can be recharged at a site or along an edge either by landing on stationary recharging stations or on Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) acting as mobile recharging stations. This leads to a new variant of the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) with mobile recharging stations. We present an algorithm that finds not only the order in which to visit the sites but also when and where to land on the charging stations to recharge. Our algorithm plans tours for the UGVs as well as determines the best locations to place stationary charging stations. We study three variants for charging: Multiple stationary charging stations, single mobile charging station, and multiple mobile charging stations. As the problems we study are nondeterministic polynomial time (NP)-Hard, we present a practical solution using Generalized TSP that finds the optimal solution that minimizes the total time, subject to the discretization of battery levels. If the UGVs are slower than the UAVs, then the algorithm also finds the minimum number of UGVs required to support the UAV mission such that the UAV is not required to wait for the UGV. Our simulation results show that the running time is acceptable for reasonably sized instances in practice. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm through simulations and proof-of-concept field experiments with a fully autonomous system of one UAV and UGV.

AB Objective: The objective of this article was to develop a multi-agent traffic simulation methodology to estimate the potential road safety improvements of automated vehicle technologies. Methods: We developed a computer program that merges road infrastructure data with a large number of vehicles, drivers, and pedestrians. Human errors are induced by modeling inattention, aimless driving, insufficient safety confirmation, misjudgment, and inadequate operation. The program was applied to simulate traffic in a prescribed area in Tsukuba city. First, a 100% manual driving scenario was set to simulate traffic for a total preset vehicle travel distance. The crashes from this simulation were compared with real-world crash data from the prescribed area from 2012 to 2017. Thereafter, 4 additional scenarios of increasing levels of automation penetration (including combinations of automated emergency braking [AEB], lane departure warning [LDW], and SAE Level 4 functions) were implemented to estimate their impact on safety. Results: Under manual driving, the system simulated a total of 859 crashes including single-car lane departure, car-to-car, and car-to-pedestrian crashes. These crashes tended to occur in locations similar to real-world crashes. The number of crashes predicted decreased to 156 cases with increasing level of automation. All of the technologies considered contributed to the decrease in crashes. Crash reductions attributable to AEB and LDW in the simulations were comparable to those reported in recent field studies. For the highest levels of automation, no assessment data were available and hence the results should be carefully treated. Further, in modeling automated functions, potentially negative aspects such as sensing failure or human overreliance were not incorporated. Conclusions: We developed a multi-agent traffic simulation methodology to estimate the effect of different automated vehicle technologies on safety. The crash locations resulting from simulations of manual driving within a limited area in Japan were preliminary assessed by comparison with real-world crash data collected in the same area. Increasing penetration levels of AEB and LDW led to a large reduction in both the frequency and severity of rear-end crashes, followed by car-to-car head-on crashes and single-vehicle lane departure crashes. Preliminary estimations of the potential safety improvements that may be achieved with highly automated driving technologies were also obtained.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been widely implemented in the domain of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, existing AI techniques, such as deep learning and ensemble learning, have been criticized for their black-box nature. Explainable AI is an effective methodology to understand the black box and build public trust in AVs. In this article, a maximum entropy-based Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) is proposed for explaining lane change (LC) decision. Specifically, we first build an LC decision model with high accuracy using eXtreme Gradient Boosting. Then, to explain the model, a modified SHAP method is proposed by introducing a maximum entropy base value. The core of this method is to determine the base value of the LC decision model using the maximum entropy principle, which provides an explanation more consistent with the human intuition. This is because it brings two properties: 1) maximum entropy has a clear physical meaning that quantifies a decision from chaos to certainty, and 2) the sum of the explanations is always isotropic and positive. Furthermore, we develop exhaustive statistical analysis and visualization to present intuitive explanations of the LC decision model. Based on the explanation results, we attribute the causes of predictions with wrong results to model defects or sample sparsity, which provides guidance to users for model optimization.

AB In recent years, autonomous driving technology has gradually appeared in our field of vision. It senses the surrounding environment by using radar, laser, ultrasound, GPS, computer vision and other technologies, and then identifies ob-stacles and various signboards, and plans a suitable path to control the driving of vehicles. However, some problems occur when this technology is applied in foggy en-vironment, such as the low probability of recognizing objects, or the fact that some objects cannot be recognized because the fog's fuzzy degree makes the planned path wrong. In view of this defect, and considering that automatic driving technology needs to respond quickly to objects when driving, this paper extends the prior defogging algorithm of dark channel, and proposes UDP-YOLO network to apply it to automatic driving technology. This paper is mainly divided into two parts: 1. Image processing: firstly, the data set is discriminated whether there is fog or not, then the fogged data set is defogged by defogging algorithm, and finally, the defogged data set is subjected to adaptive brightness enhancement; 2. Target de-tection: UDP-YOLO network proposed in this paper is used to detect the defogged data set. Through the observation results, it is found that the performance of the model proposed in this paper has been greatly improved while balancing the speed.

ID INTEGER AMBIGUITY RESOLUTION; UAV; SYSTEM
AB Autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) has generated great interest in recent years. However, much research has focused on the vision-based close docking stage; few studies have been conducted on the navigation algorithm for the rendezvous and following stages. High-precision relative navigation in following stage can provide favourable conditions for successful docking. Aiming at precise relative navigation in the complex high dynamic environment of aerial refueling rendezvous and following stages, a two-stage adaptive filtering architecture is exploited in this paper. An adaptive main Kalman filter (AKF) is realized for ambiguity eliminated GNSS/INS tightly coupled integrated system, and a robust adaptive subfilter is developed for GNSS individually. Particularly, aiming at the influence of pseudorange observation multipath outliers and state abnormal disturbances in unmanned air vehicle- (UAV-) tanker proximity, an INS-aided bifactor robust and classified factor adaptive filtering (IBRCAF) algorithm for single-frequency ambiguity resolution is proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by the simulation experiments for UAV-tanker. The results indicate that the IBRCAF algorithm can efficiently suppress the influence of pseudorange multipath gross errors and abnormal state disturbances and greatly raise the success rate of ambiguity resolution, and the two-stage adaptive filtering algorithm of IBRCAF-AKF can significantly improve relative navigation performance and achieve centimeter-level accuracy.

AB Lane detection is a technique that uses geometric features as an input to the autonomous vehicle to automatically distinguish lane markings. To process the intricate features present in the lane images, traditional computer vision (CV) techniques are typically time-consuming, need more computing resources, and use complex algorithms. To address this problem, this paper presents a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that prevents the complexities of traditional CV techniques. CNN is regarded as a reasonable method for lane marking prediction, while improved performance requires hyperparameter tuning. To enhance the initial parameter setting of the CNN, an S-Shaped Binary Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (SBBOA) is utilized in this paper. In this way, the relative parameters of CNN are selected for accurate lane marking. To evaluate the performance of the proposed SBBOA-CNN model, extensive experiments are conducted using the TUSimple and CULane datasets. The experimental results obtained show that the proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques in terms of classification accuracy, precision, F1-score, and recall. The proposed model also considerably outperforms the CNN in terms of classification accuracy, average elapsed time, and receiver operating characteristics curve measure. This result demonstrates that the SBBOA optimized CNN exhibits higher robustness and stability than CNN.

AB The invariant-set motion planner uses a collection of safe sets to find a collision-free path through an obstacle-filled environment [1]-[4]. This article extends the invariant-set motion planner to systems with persistently varying disturbances and parametric model uncertainty. This is accomplished by replacing the previously used positive invariant sets with robust positive invariant sets. Since the model uncertainty obfuscates the relationship between the invariant sets in the state space, and the references and obstacles in the output space, we reformulate the dynamics in velocity form so that the system output appears directly in the modified system state. Since the persistently varying disturbances will prevent the closed-loop system from converging to the desired reference, we introduce a new robust connection rule where references are connected when the invariant set of one reference contains the minimal volume robust invariant-set of another. In addition, we bound the time required to transition between invariant sets to ensure safety when the obstacles are moving. By parameterizing the invariant sets using a precomputed input-to-state Lyapunov function, we reduce the real-time computational complexity of our motion planner. The robust invariant-set motion planner is demonstrated for an automated highway driving case study.

AB In this article, we consider an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless power transfer (WPT) and relay communication network consisting of a base station (BS), a UAV, and multiple ground users. The UAV acts as both a wireless power transmission source and an uplink communication relay. Specifically, an entire transmission period of the considered system is divided into two stages. In the first stage, the UAV transfers the power to the ground users along a well-optimized flight trajectory and meanwhile, the users transmit data to the UAV using the harvested energy. Subsequently, in the second stage, the UAV flies to the vicinity of the BS and forwards the data to the BS. For the purpose of minimizing the energy consumed by the UAV, we jointly optimize the time durations of the two stages, the UAV's transmit powers for WPT and data forwarding, as well as its flight trajectory, subject to the constraints of the Quality of Service (QoS), the information forwarding, the energy causality, and the mobility of the UAV. The involved optimization problem is nonconvex and highly intractable. To this end, we propose an efficient alternating algorithm to iteratively solve the two subproblems with respect to the time durations of the two stages and the UAV's transmit powers and trajectory, respectively. The first subproblem has a closed-form optimal solution and the second subproblem is handled by addressing a surrogate convex problem based on the technique of successive convex approximation. Finally, the simulation results confirm the superiority of our proposed algorithm.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive decoding mechanism (ADM) for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled uplink (UL) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) communications. Specifically, considering a harsh UAV environment, where ground-to-ground links are regularly unavailable, the proposed ADM overcomes the challenging problem of conventional UL-NOMA systems whose performance is sensitive to the transmitter's statistical channel state information and the receiver's decoding order. To evaluate the performance of the ADM, we derive closed-form expressions for the system outage probability (OP) and system throughput. In the performance analysis section, we provide novel expressions for practical air-to-ground and ground-to-air channels, while taking into account the practical implementation of imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) in UL-NOMA. Moreover, the obtained expression can be adopted to characterize the OP of various systems under a Mixture of Gamma (MG) distribution-based fading channels. Next, we propose a sub-optimal Gradient Descent-based algorithm to obtain the power allocation coefficients that result in maximum throughput with respect to each location on UAV's trajectory. To determine the significance of the proposed ADM in nonstationary environments, we consider the ground users and the UAV to move according to the Random Waypoint Mobility (RWM) and Reference Point Group Mobility (RPGM) models, respectively. Accurate formulas for the distance distributions are also provided. Numerical solutions demonstrate that the ADM-enhanced NOMA not only outperforms Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA), but also improves the performance of UAV-enabled UL-NOMA even in mobile environments.

AB Traditional Japanese orchards control the growth height of fruit trees for the convenience of farmers, which is unfavorable to the operation of medium- and large-sized machinery. A compact, safe, and stable spraying system could offer a solution for orchard automation. Due to the complex orchard environment, the dense tree canopy not only obstructs the GNSS signal but also has effects due to low light, which may impact the recognition of objects by ordinary RGB cameras. To overcome these disadvantages, this study selected LiDAR as a single sensor to achieve a prototype robot navigation system. In this study, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and K-means and random sample consensus (RANSAC) machine learning algorithms were used to plan the robot navigation path in a facilitated artificial-tree-based orchard system. Pure pursuit tracking and an incremental proportional-integral-derivative (PID) strategy were used to calculate the vehicle steering angle. In field tests on a concrete road, grass field, and a facilitated artificial-tree-based orchard, as indicated by the test data results for several formations of left turns and right turns separately, the position root mean square error (RMSE) of this vehicle was as follows: on the concrete road, the right turn was 12.0 cm and the left turn was 11.6 cm, on grass, the right turn was 12.6 cm and the left turn was 15.5 cm, and in the facilitated artificial-tree-based orchard, the right turn was 13.8 cm and the left turn was 11.4 cm. The vehicle was able to calculate the path in real time based on the position of the objects, operate safely, and complete the task of pesticide spraying.

AB The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a promising solution to efficiently acquire data in large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In a wide-area WSN environment, UAV path planning is one of the challenging issues in solving the optimization problem to achieve complex and multiple objectives under various constraints related to UAV operation. In this article, we propose a novel asynchronous UAV path planning mechanism for multiobjective UAV operation. In a 3-D sensor field, a grid-based sensor field and information gathering model is introduced. We define a UAV coverage area where line-of-sight communication is possible between a UAV and the sensors and propose a method to quickly find the grid cells within the coverage area. We define a multipurpose fitness function that maximizes the value of the acquired sensing information and at the same time minimizes the time and energy required for UAV operation. The value of the sensing information reflects the sensor density for each sensor type within UAV coverage, as well as changes in the sensing information values over time. In the proposed method, time and energy objective functions are learned by considering location-dependent communication link quality, sensor density, and the next UAV locations. The optimum UAV position and the movement schedule of each UAV are asynchronously derived using the proposed particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with several UAV operational constraints. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can maximize the utility of the objective function and achieve fast convergence in finding the optimal solution compared with other methods.

AB The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) channel models are very important and useful for the design and evaluation of UAV communications. In existing works, the terrestrial scatterers are widely stationary or moving all the time, and the UAV is assumed to move at a constant speed. However, these modeling assumptions may not be appropriate in realistic scenarios. In this work, we propose a new 3-dimensional (3-D) dynamic non-wide-sense stationary (non-WSS) cluster-based geometric model for UAV multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. We assume that a few non-isotropic scatterers are distributed around the terrestrial receiver and have a probabilistic movement behavior. Meanwhile, we consider that the UAV flies at a varying speed, and we design a non-stationary mobility model with acceleration. The proposed channel model performs the birth-death evolutionary process of clusters based on a Markov model, and the time-variant multipath component (MPC) parameters (e.g., angle of arrival/departure (AoA/AoD), power, and delay) are obtained. In addition, we derive the space-time correlation function, mean Doppler spread, and root-mean-square doppler shift spread of the UAV MIMO channels, and provide the quasi-stationary interval. We also investigate the impact of some key model factors on the statistical properties by numerical simulations. Finally, we compare the space-time correlation functions and the second-order statistical properties between the proposed model and the UAV channel measurement results. The close agreements between the numerical simulations and field measurements have validated the proposed model.

AB Intelligent tires are one key element for autonomous self-driving cars and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), especially if the battery-driven sensor systems attain the transition to be self-powered. Harvesting vibrational energy of these tire pressure monitoring systems (TPMSs) is the promising technique to make tire sensors self-sufficient and to provide additional energy for sophisticated algorithms, which constitute the intelligence of vehicle tires. Despite of two decades of intense research, no commercial product has been established. This work analyzes the technological reasons and presents both challenges and opportunities of TPMS energy transducers. First, this article specifies significant system requirements and characterizes common energy sources. The authors determine the necessary amount of energy on two different paths. A throughout comparison between different TPMS transducers overviews the state of the art, comprehensively. Typical TPMS energy harvesters are summarized, distinctive TPMS transducers are shortly presented and common problems are outlined, focusing on the harvesting mechanism, restoring force, interface circuit, and energy generation. The pros and cons of different energy transducer principles for their operation inside the tire are balanced. Focusing on reliability and on normalized energy generation, this publication highlights potent energy harvesters for system enhancement and gives recommendations for future developments. Two significant outcomes among others are to switch the focus from linear systems to systems with a nonlinear restoring force as well as to more efficient interface circuits than low-efficient full-wave rectifiers.

AB The detection and identification of road anomalies and obstacles in the road infrastructure has been investigated by the research community using different types of sensors. This paper evaluates the detection and identification of road anomalies/obstacles using the data collected from the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) installed in a vehicle and in particular from the data generated by the accelerometers' and gyroscopes' components. Inspired by the successes of the application of deep learning to various identification problems, this paper investigates the application of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to this specific problem. In particular, we propose a novel approach in this context where the time-frequency representation (i.e., spectrogram) is used as an input to the CNN rather than the original time domain data. This approach is evaluated on an experimental dataset collected using 12 different vehicles driving for more than 40 km of road. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms significantly and across different sampling rates both the application of CNN to the original time domain representation and the application of shallow machine learning algorithms. The approach achieves an identification accuracy of 97.2%. The results presented in this paper are based on an extensive optimization both of the CNN algorithm and the spectrogram implementation in terms of window size, type of window, and overlapping ratio. The accurate detection of road anomalies/obstacles could be useful to road infrastructure managers to monitor the quality of the road surface and to improve the accurate positioning of autonomous vehicles because road anomalies/obstacles could be used as landmarks.

AB Low-observable manoeuvring target detection is a challenging problem for radar signal processing, due to the complex environment, target manoeuvrability, limited observation time etc. The study proposed a novel long-time coherent integration (LTCI) method for radar manoeuvring target, especially for low-observable unmanned aerial vehicle targets. The fast non-parametric searching LTCI via a non-uniform (NU) resampling and scale processing (SP) technique is proposed, where the high-order signal phase is reduced to linear term using NU resampling. After that, the SP method is applied to realise the range migration compensation. The sparse Fourier transform (FT) and inverse FT are performed for the final integration. The manoeuvring target would appear as peaks in the non-uniformly resampling and SP-sparse LTCI domain. Experiments using two sets of real radar data indicate that the proposed method can achieve a good balance between computational cost and integration gain. In addition, detailed detection performances are compared with the traditional methods, e.g., moving target detection, fractional FT, fractional ambiguity function, Radon-based LTCIs, and sparse fractional FT.

AB Rapid technological developments in autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV or drones) and an evolving legislation may soon open the way for their large-scale implementation in the last mile delivery of products. The use of drones could drastically decrease labour costs and has been hyped as a potential disruptor to the parcel delivery industry. Online retailers and delivery companies such as Amazon, are already filing up patents for the development of multi-level fulfilment centres for unmanned aerial vehicles or drone-beehives that would allow the deployment of this technology within built environment. A substantial amount of research has been carried out in the last years on the potential use of drones for parcel delivery, principally in the area of logistic optimisation. However, little is known about the potential market and economic viability of such services in Europe. This paper presents a modelling framework using EU-wide high-resolution population and land-use data to estimate the potential optimal location of drone-beehives based on economic viability criterion. It estimates the potential number of EU28 citizens that could potentially benefit from last mile-drone delivery services under four scenarios. The performed analyses indicates that under the scenario considered as the most technologically realistic, up to 7% of EU citizens could get access to such services. When considering technological improvements scenarios, the share reaches 30%. Furthermore, results suggest that due to the differences in population and land-use patterns in the different Member States, the potential drone coverage across Europe could be very heterogeneous, with the UK, Germany, Italy and France appearing as the most likely countries where drone-beehives may have the most efficient development.

AB An unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) network operates as an ad hoc autonomous tactical network. In this paper, we study the deployment of a UGV network and its ability to use location estimation to provide reliable data forwarding. This analysis involves (1) location estimation to obtain realistic estimates of the node's (UGV) spatial positions and (2) real-time path planning to obtain reliable routing among nodes using the estimates of the node positions. Conventional approaches commonly use the popular Random Waypoint (RWP) model (or its variants) as the mobility model. The RWP approach uses randomly selected node positions and has no way to cope with nodes moving in and out of transmission range. These deficiencies cause the route reliability to suffer. Our approach (1) uses an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for node mobility/location estimation and (2) uses a modified Ad Hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) algorithm for route selection using a new routing parameter called contact time. We refer to this combined approach as the AODV-LocPred algorithm. We compare the AODV-LocPred algorithm with AODV using the RWP model. This is referred to as AODV-RWP. Our simulations show that the AODV-LocPred algorithm significantly outperforms the AODV-RWP algorithm in terms of packet delivery ratio (PDR), because it provides realistic node position estimates and it copes in a reasonable way with nodes moving in and out of transmission range. However, the AODV-LocPred incurs an increase in end-to-end delay. Nonetheless, we expect that in many real-world settings, this tradeoff is acceptable.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is one of the fundamental capabilities for autonomous vehicles to achieve accurate localization in dynamic urban environments. However, in real-world scenarios, the presence of moving objects such as pedestrians, bicycles, or vehicles affects the localization accuracy of SLAM and leaves behind ghost trails in the created map. Hence, it is essential for SLAM to remove dynamic objects in real-time to improve its accuracy. In this article, we present dynamic objects removal LiDAR-inertial SLAM (DOR-LINS), a real-time moving objects removal framework for in light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-Inertial SLAM. Built on the foundation of lidar inertial odometry via smoothing and mapping (LIO-SAM), DOR-LINS integrates the capability of removing dynamic objects, enabling it to remove most of the dynamic objects and achieve precise odometry. Our contributions are reflected in three aspects. First, our method extracts ground points from the current scan and clusters nonground points to segment them into static and potential dynamic clusters. Then, we divide the submap and current scan into multiple bins and introduce a novel concept called ground pseudo occupancy to describe the occupancy of each bin. Second, based on the ground pseudo occupancy, dynamic clusters, and static clusters, we propose an approach named beam tracing test (BTT) and combine it with scan ratio test (SRT) to select candidate dynamic bins. Finally, we employ a dynamic point verification algorithm to filter out actual dynamic points from these candidate dynamic bins. As experimentally evaluated on the UrbanLoco dataset, our proposed method removes many dynamic points and yields promising performance against state-of-the-art methods.

AB In order to overcome the low long-term predictive accuracy associated with mainstream prediction models and the limited consideration of driver characteristics, this study presents an enhanced attention mechanism for human-like trajectory prediction, which is based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). A novel database structure is proposed that incorporates data about driving style and driving intent, pertaining to human factors. By utilizing the convolution computation of Convolutional Social-Long Short-Term Memory (CS-LSTM) for surrounding vehicles, spatial feature extraction around the target vehicle is achieved. Simultaneously, we introduce a dynamic driving style recognition model and a human-like driving intent recognition model to fulfill the output of the human-like module. From a temporal perspective, we employ a decoder attention mechanism to reinforce the emphasis on key historical information, while refining the attention mechanism based on driving style for human-like weight assignment. Comparative analysis with other models indicates that the proposed Driving Style-based Attention-enhanced Convolutional Social-Long Short-Term Memory (DACS-LSTM) model exhibits notable advantages in predicting human-like trajectories for long-term tasks. Visualizing the predicted trajectories of both the Attention-enhanced Convolutional Social-Long Short-Term Memory (ACS-LSTM) and our proposed model, and analyzing the impact of the human-like module on the predicted trajectory, shows that our model's predicted trajectory aligns more closely with the actual one. By comparing the weight distribution of the conventional attention mechanism and the enhanced attention mechanism proposed here, and analyzing the trajectory changes in conjunction with the driving styles, it becomes evident that our proposed model offers a marked improvement.

AB For the application of intelligent and green transportation systems (e.g., autonomous driving), traffic congestion is a severe challenge. So far, when traffic congestion is perceived for a route, a common solution is searching for another congestion-free route. However, it is observed that not all congestion should be tackled with rerouting since the extra overhead (e.g., travel time, fuel consumption, and CO2 emission) caused by specific congestion might be lower than that of rerouting. Against this backdrop, a prediction-based route guidance method (PRGM) is proposed for intelligent and green transportation systems. To begin with, PRGM involves a novel hybrid and dynamic system architecture based on the collaboration of vehicle clusters and the cloud platform. Notably, a backup mechanism between adjacent cluster heads is designed to avoid the problem that the data might be lost during dynamic clustering. Furthermore, PRGM involves a novel traffic congestion control strategy, which is based on four procedures: 1) perception about traffic congestion with three indexes (i.e., speed index, dense index, and acceleration index); 2) judgment about congestion type with four defined congestion types; 3) prediction about congestion duration considering the formation of congestion (i.e., why and how the congestion is formed); and 4) route planning about vehicles considering congestion duration and the extra time overhead of rerouting. Simulations are performed, and they show that the proposed PRGM not only can perceive traffic congestion more precisely and timely but also can reduce the travel time, fuel consumption, and CO2 emission of vehicles.

AB Integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into existing cellular networks encounters lots of challenges, among which one of the most striking concerns is how to achieve harmonious coexistence of aerial transceivers, inter alia, UAVs, and terrestrial user equipments (UEs). In this paper, a cellular-connected UAV network is focused, where multiple UAVs receive messages from base stations (BSs) in the down-link, while BSs are serving ground UEs in their cells. For effectively managing inter-cell interferences (ICIs) among UEs due to intense reuse of time-frequency resource block (RB) resource, a first $p$ -tier based RB coordination criterion is proposed and adopted. Then, to enhance wireless transmission quality for UAVs while protecting terrestrial UEs from being interfered by ground-to-air (G2A) transmissions, a radio resource management (RRM) problem of joint dynamic RB coordination and time-varying beamforming design minimizing UAV's ergodic outage duration (EOD) is investigated. To cope with conventional optimization techniques' inefficiency in solving the formulated RRM problem, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-aided solution is initiated, where deep double duelling Q network (D3QN) and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) are invoked to deal with RB coordination in discrete action domain and beamforming design in continuous action regime, respectively. The hybrid D3QN-TD3 solution is trained via interacting with the considered outer and inner environments in an online centralized manner so that it can then help achieve the suboptimal EOD minimization performance during its offline decentralized exploitation. Simulation results have illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid D3QN-TD3 algorithm, compared to several representative baselines.

AB Flying Ad hoc Network (FANET) is a self-organizing wireless network that constitutes swarms of flying nodes, namely Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and communicates in close proximity. It has various distinguishing characteristics that set it apart from other ad hoc networks, posing some issues, particularly in routing. UAVs are highly dynamic and have frequent topology changes. Hence, the network urges an efficient routing technique to coordinate the node swarms and enhance the evaluation metrics of the network. The biological behavior of various living organisms, such as animals, insects, microbes, and humans, inspires researchers to solve various routing problems in ad hoc networks. Decentralized self-organized swarms of UAVs closely resemble the biological system. Therefore, the Bio-Inspired Algorithms (BIA) resolve a wide range of routing challenges in FANET. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is adopted to survey FANET routing methods based on non-hybrid and hybrid BIAs to properly comprehend the existing bio-inspired strategies used in FANET routing. The review will be beneficial for the researchers in the specified area. To our knowledge, no SLR has been conducted about the FANET routing protocol that employs BIA. This paper examines 1) the characteristics and features of existing routing algorithms, 2) the need of both non-hybrid and hybrid BIA for effective and optimal routing, 3) an analysis of the method's simulation tools, evaluation metrics and mobility models, 4) the current issues and scope of the study related to the specified method.

AB The detection of small objects in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images, which contain a large number of objects with extremely small pixels, has been a major challenge over the last few decades. Owing to the lack of sufficiently detailed representation of object features, conventional detectors based on deep learning are unsatisfactory when detecting small objects. Meanwhile, the flight altitude and the shooting angle of the UAV always changing, which leads to an uneven dispersion of the multiple objects and a varying density of small objects. In response to the issues mentioned above, a novel lightweight Cross-layer Triple-branch Parallel Fusion Network (CTPFNet) is proposed to improve the real-time detection accuracy of small objects under UAV images. Firstly, a novel downsampling structure called the Inverse Residual Pooling Cascade (IRPC) module is proposed to obtain richer feature information about small objects. Secondly, we construct an improved global feature extraction structure Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks-Transformer (ELAN-Trans) to enhance the association between global features. Then, we design the Hybrid Dilated Depth Separable-Spatial Pyramid Pooling-Fast (HDDS-SPPF) to capture more contextual information by using the dilated convolution operations. To enhance the cross-scale transfer fusion of low-level original features containing more detailed localization information and deep-level deep features containing more semantic information, we propose a CTPF module embedded into the neck region for the secondary feature reuse of adjacent feature maps with varying resolutions. Extensive experiments on the public VisDrone2021-DET dataset show that the proposed model achieves significant performance gains with fewer parameters.

AB In this paper, we introduce the multiple Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone Stations (mTSP-DS), which is an extension to the classical multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (mTSP). In the mTSP-DS, we have a depot, a set of trucks, and some packet stations that host a given number of autonomous vehicles (drones or robots). The trucks start their mission from the depot and can supply some packet stations, which can then launch and operate drones/robots to serve customers. The goal is to serve all customers either by truck or by drones/robots while minimizing the makespan. We formulate the mTSP-DS as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to solve small instances. To address larger instances, we first introduce two variants of a decomposition-based matheuristic. Afterwards, we suggest a third approach that is based on populating a solution pool with several restarts of an iterated local search metaheuristic, which is followed by determining the best combination of tours using a set-partitioning model. To verify the performance of our algorithms, we conducted extensive computational experiments. According to the numerical results, we observe that the use of drone stations leads to considerable savings in delivery time compared to traditional mTSP solutions. Furthermore, we investigated the energy consumption of trucks and drones. Indeed, depending on the energy consumption coefficients of trucks and drones as well as on the distance covered by drones, the mTSP-DS can also achieve energy savings in comparison to mTSP solutions.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB Inferences of the lane changing behaviors (including lane changing initiation moment LCIM, cross-lane-mark moment CLMM, and lane changing duration LCD) of the surrounding vehicles and taking actions to avoid collision are essential for the safe operation of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). The majority of current models rely on data-driven methods that need to be trained before deployment. Besides, an analytical and stochastic formulation of the lateral model which can generate CLMM and LCD distribution and adjust the parameters online is still lacking. To the best of our knowledge, currently, no method can provide an analytically stochastic lateral movement that explicitly considers the system noise and simultaneously outputs the information of lane changing initiation moment, cross-lane-mark moment, and lane changing duration in a real-time manner. To fill such a gap, a stochastic lateral trajectory framework with parsimonious parameters is established and an online simultaneous inference of LCIM, CLMM, and LCD is developed. The proposed method is tested with the highD and NGSIM datasets. The results show that 1) computational efficiency-wise, the algorithm takes milliseconds to run, which suggests promising prospects for field deployment; 2) the false negative and false positive errors of the LCIM inference are as low as 1.5%, indicating that the method is robust to the stochastic noise; 3) LCIM inference is insensitive to the lane width, which means the model is error tolerant when such information is lacking; and 4) the error of CLMM inference is within 2 sec, while most of the error of LCD locates within 4 sec, suggesting satisfactory performance.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted much attention lately and are being used in a multitude of applications. But the duration of being in the sky remains to be an issue due to their energy limitation. In particular, this represents a major challenge when UAVs are used as base stations (BSs) to complement the wireless network. Therefore, as UAVs execute their missions in the sky, it becomes beneficial to wirelessly harvest energy from external and adjustable flying energy sources (FESs) to power their onboard batteries and avoid disrupting their trajectories. For this purpose, wireless power transfer (WPT) is seen as a promising charging technology to keep UAVs in flight and allow them to complete their missions. In this work, we leverage a multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) method to optimize the task of energy transfer between FESs and UAVs. The optimization is performed by carrying out three essential tasks: 1) maximizing the sum-energy received by all UAVs based on FESs using WPT; 2) optimizing the energy loading process of FESs from a ground BS; and 3) computing the most energy-efficient trajectories of the FESs while carrying out their charging duties. Furthermore, to ensure high-level reliability of energy transmission, we use directional energy transfer for charging both FESs and UAVs by using laser beams and energy beam-forming technologies, respectively. In this study, the simulation results show that the proposed MADRL method has efficiently optimized the trajectories and energy consumption of FESs, which translates into a significant energy transfer gain compared to the baseline strategies.

AB This paper aims to develop a paradigm that models the learning behavior of intelligent agents (including but not limited to autonomous vehicles, connected and automated vehicles, or human-driven vehicles with intelligent navigation systems where human drivers follow the navigation instructions completely) with a utility-optimizing goal and the system's equilibrating processes in a routing game among atomic selfish agents. Such a paradigm can assist policy makers in devising optimal operational and planning countermeasures under both normal and abnormal circumstances. To this end, we develop a Markov routing game (MRG) in which each agent learns and updates her own en-route path choice policy while interacting with others in transportation networks. To efficiently solve MRG, we formulate it as multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and devise a mean field multi-agent deep Q learning (MF-MA-DQL) approach that captures the competition among agents. The linkage between the classical DUE paradigm and our proposed Markov routing game (MRG) is discussed. We show that the routing behavior of intelligent agents is shown to converge to the classical notion of predictive dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) when traffic environments are simulated using dynamic loading models (DNL). In other words, the MRG depicts DUEs assuming perfect information and deterministic environments propagated by DNL models. Four examples are solved to illustrate the algorithm efficiency and consistency between DUE and the MRG equilibrium, on a simple network without and with spillback, the Ortuzar Willumsen (OW) Network, and a real-world network near Columbia University's campus in Manhattan of New York City.

AB Determining driver situational awareness is one of the most difficult tasks in driver performance profiling. Perception, being the first level of driver situational awareness, is perhaps the only objectively quantifiable factor for driver inattention detection. In the context of this paper, driver perception is defined as their ability to understand their operating environment and peripheral contextual information. One of the most reliable means of determining driver perception is through eye tracking and gaze concentration. In this study, a set of carefully chosen in-vehicle gaze targets are used to determine driver gaze concentration on/off the road. The time drivers spend looking at these predefined gaze targets has been used to characterise driver visual behaviour at roundabouts during normal driving. In total, 24 drivers completed a 22 km route, including two 5-exit two-lane roundabouts in urban and suburban traffic. This study shows that on the approach to roundabouts, driver gaze direction and gaze concentration was often diverted away from the direction of travel of the vehicle and for some drivers it took a significant amount of time to return their gaze towards the direction of travel of the vehicle. The study is based on the premise that a driver not looking at key regions in a scene cannot perceive the contents of those regions with sufficient detail for safe driving. It is not possible to determine a driver's level of understanding of a scene, unless the parameters of the scene as well as the driver's response is determined in real time.

AB Although automated vehicles (AVs) are rapidly being developed, the public sector continues to learn what this technology could mean for transportation policy. As reducing auto-based commute distances is one common planning objective, understanding the conditions under which individuals may adopt AVs to commute further is important. To that end, this study uses data from a 2016 survey of residents in Southern Ontario, Canada, to estimate the characteristics and motivations of individuals indicating the most interest in commuting further using AVs. Comparing findings with existing research on commute lengths and AV adoption, this study identifies how AV adoption may shape long-distance commuting, focusing on commuters who already drive to work. Results suggest significant potential for longer commutes and that longer AV-based commutes are expected to be taken by younger, higher educated, and tech-savvy individuals who already travel by car for regular daily trips, and by older individuals residing in urban neighborhoods. Findings on longer commutes, gender, and domestic responsibilities suggest that longer commutes could reinforce existing disparities in commuting distances between men and women but may be valuable to individuals with occasional chauffeuring responsibilities-suggesting potential for broader impacts in household social roles. Those expected benefits from AVs anticipated to motivate longer commutes include multitasking, safety improvements, better reliability, improved parking, and reduced traffic-suggesting that should AV technologies deliver in these realms, select commuters may derive significant utility. Paradoxically, several of the benefits expected to deliver the most consumer value may be undermined should additional AVs increase traffic significantly.

AB Introduction: With the increase in automated driver support systems, drivers are shifting from operating their vehicles to supervising their automation. As a result, it is important to understand how drivers interact with these automated systems and evaluate their effect on driver responses to safety critical events. This study aimed to identify how drivers responded when experiencing a safety critical event in automated vehicles while also engaged in non-driving tasks. Method: In total 48 participants were included in this driving simulator study with two levels of automated driving: (a) driving with no automation and (b) driving with adaptive cruise control (ACC) and lane keeping (LK) systems engaged; and also two levels of a non-driving task (a) watching a movie or (b) no non-driving task. In addition to driving performance measures, non-driving task performance and the mean glance duration for the non-driving task were compared between the two levels of automated driving. Results: Drivers using the automated systems responded worse than those manually driving in terms of reaction time, lane departure duration, and maximum steering wheel angle to an induced lane departure event. These results also found that non-driving tasks further impaired driver responses to a safety critical event in the automated system condition. Conclusion: In the automated driving condition, driver responses to the safety critical events were slower, especially when engaged in a non-driving task. Practical application: Traditional driver performance variables may not necessarily effectively and accurately evaluate driver responses to events when supervising autonomous vehicle systems. Thus, it is important to develop and use appropriate variables to quantify drivers' performance under these conditions. (C) 2017 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bio-inspired sensing modalities enhance the ability of autonomous vehicles to characterize and respond to their environment. This paper concerns the lateral line of cartilaginous and bony fish, which is sensitive to fluid motion and allows fish to sense oncoming flow and the presence of walls or obstacles. The lateral line consists of two types of sensing modalities: canal neuromasts measure approximate pressure gradients, whereas superficial neuromasts measure local flow velocities. By employing an artificial lateral line, the performance of underwater sensing and navigation strategies is improved in dark, cluttered, or murky environments where traditional sensing modalities may be hindered. This paper presents estimation and control strategies enabling an airfoil-shaped unmanned underwater vehicle to assimilate measurements from a bio-inspired, multi-modal artificial lateral line and estimate flow properties for feedback control. We utilize potential flow theory to model the fluid flow past a foil in a uniform flow and in the presence of an upstream obstacle. We derive theoretically justified nonlinear estimation strategies to estimate the free stream flowspeed, angle of attack, and the relative position of an upstream obstacle. The feedback control strategy uses the estimated flow properties to execute bio-inspired behaviors including rheotaxis (the tendency of fish to orient upstream) and station-holding (the tendency of fish to position behind an upstream obstacle). A robotic prototype outfitted with a multi-modal artificial lateral line composed of ionic polymer metal composite and embedded pressure sensors experimentally demonstrates the distributed flow sensing and closed-loop control strategies.

AB In conditionally automated driving, a vehicle issues a take-over request when it reaches the functional limits of self-driving, and the driver must take control. The key driving parameters affecting the quality of the take-over (TO) process have yet to be determined and are the motivation for our work. To determine these parameters, we used a dataset of 41 driving and non-driving parameters from a previous user study with 216 TOs while performing a non-driving-related task on a handheld device in a driving simulator. Eight take-over quality aspects, grouped into pre-TO predictors (attention), during-TO predictors (reaction time, solution suitability), and safety performance (off road drive, braking, lateral acceleration, time to collision, success), were modeled using multiple linear regression, support vector machines, M5', 1R, logistic regression, and J48. We interpreted the best-suited models by highlighting the most influential parameters that affect the overall quality of a TO. The results show that these are primarily maximal acceleration (88.6% accurate prediction of collisions) and the TOR-to-first-brake interval. Gradual braking, neither too hard nor too soft, as fast as possible seems to be the strategy that maximizes the overall TO quality. The position of the handheld device and the way it was held prior to TO did not affect TO quality. However, handling the device during TO did affect driver attention when shorter attention times were observed and drivers held their mobile phones in only one hand. In the future, automatic gradual braking maneuvers could be considered instead of immediate full TOs.

AB To mitigate the long-term spectrum crunch problem, the FCC recently opened up the 6 GHz frequency band for unlicensed use. However, the existing spectrum sharing strategies cannot support the operation of access points in moving vehicles such as cars and UAVs. This is primarily because of the directionality-based spectrum sharing among the incumbent systems in this band and the high mobility of the moving vehicles, which together make it challenging to control the cross-system interference. In this paper, we propose SwarmShare, a mobility-resilient spectrum sharing framework for swarm UAV networking in the 6 GHz band. We first present a mathematical formulation of the SwarmShare problem, where the objective is to maximize the spectral efficiency of the UAV network by jointly controlling the flight and transmission power of the UAVs and their association with the ground users, under the interference constraints of the incumbent system. We find that there are no closed-form mathematical models that can be used to characterize the statistical behaviors of the aggregate interference from the UAVs to the incumbent system. Then we propose a data-driven three-phase spectrum sharing approach, including Initial Power Enforcement, Offline-dataset Guided Online Power Adaptation, and Reinforcement Learning-based UAV Optimization. We validate the effectiveness of SwarmShare through an extensive simulation campaign. Results indicate that, based on SwarmShare, the aggregate interference from the UAVs to the incumbent system can be effectively kept below the target level without requiring the real-time cross-system channel state information. The mobility resilience of SwarmShare is also validated in coexisting networks with no precise UAV location information.

AB Maintaining the freshness of information in the Internet of Things (IoT) is a critical yet challenging problem. In this paper, we study cooperative data collection using multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with the objective of minimizing the total average Age of Information (AoI). We consider various constraints of the UAVs, including kinematic, energy, trajectory, and collision avoidance, in order to optimize the data collection process. Specifically, each UAV, which has limited on-board energy, takes off from its initial location and flies over sensor nodes to collect update packets in cooperation with the other UAVs. The UAVs must land at their final destinations with non-negative residual energy after the specified time duration to ensure they have enough energy to complete their missions. It is crucial to design the trajectories of the UAVs and the transmission scheduling of the sensor nodes to enhance information freshness. We model the multi-UAV data collection problem as a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP), as each UAV is unaware of the dynamics of the environment and can only observe a part of the sensors. To address the challenges of this problem, we propose a multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based algorithm with centralized learning and decentralized execution. In addition to the reward shaping, we use action masks to filter out invalid actions and ensure that the constraints are met. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can significantly reduce the total average AoI compared to the baseline algorithms, and the use of the action mask method can improve the convergence speed of the proposed algorithm.

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ALGORITHM
AB 5G wireless networks are paying increasing attention to Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communications as the number of autonomous vehicles rises. In V2X applications, a number of demanding criteria such as latency, stability, and resource availability have emerged. Due to limited licensed radio resources in 5G cellular networks, Cellular V2X (C-V2X) faces challenges in serving a large number of cars and managing their network access. A reason is the unbalanced load of serving Base Stations (BSs) that makes it difficult to manage the resources of the BSs optimally regarding the frequency reuse in cells and its subsequent co-channel interference. It is while the routing protocols could help redirect the load of loaded BSs to neighboring ones. In this article, we propose a resource-aware routing protocol to mitigate this challenge. In this regard, a hybrid C-V2X/ Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) vehicular network is considered. We employ cluster-based routing that enables many cars to interface with the network via some Cluster Heads (CH) using DSRC resources while the CHs send their traffic across C-V2X links to the BSs. Traditional cluster-based routings do not attend the resource availability in BSs that are supporting the clusters. Thus, our study describes an enhanced clustering method based on Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) that re-clusters the vehicles based on the resource availability of BSs. Simulation results show that the proposed re-clustering method improves the spectrum efficiency by at least 79%, packet delivery ratio by at least 5%, and load balance of BSs by at least 90% compared to the baseline.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Air access networks have been recognized as a significant driver of various Internet of Things (IoT) services and applications. In particular, the aerial computing network infrastructure centered on the Internet of Drones has set off a new revolution in automatic image recognition. This emerging technology relies on sharing ground-truth-labeled data between unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms to train a high-quality automatic image recognition model. However, such an approach will bring data privacy and data availability challenges. To address these issues, we first present a semisupervised federated learning (SSFL) framework for privacy-preserving UAV image recognition. Specifically, we propose a model parameter mixing strategy to improve the naive combination of federated learning and semisupervised learning methods under two realistic scenarios (labels-at-client and labels-at-server), which is referred to as federated mixing (FedMix). Furthermore, there are significant differences in the number, features, and distribution of local data collected by UAVs using different camera modules in different environments, i.e., statistical heterogeneity. To alleviate the statistical heterogeneity problem, we propose an aggregation rule based on the frequency of the client's participation in training, namely, the FedFreq aggregation rule, which can adjust the weight of the corresponding local model according to its frequency. Numerical results demonstrate that the performance of our proposed method is significantly better than those of the current baseline and is robust to different non-independent and identically distributed(IID) levels of client data.

AB This paper demonstrates the possibility of using the telemetry of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to monitor the state of atmospheric turbulence. The turbulence spectrum is determined from data on the roll, pitch, and yaw angles of the DJI Mavic Mini quadcopter and then compared with measurements of AMK-03 autonomous sonic weather station. The measurements are carried out at the Basic Experimental Complex (BEC) of the Zuev Institute of Atmospheric Optics, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences (SB RAS) (Tomsk, Russia), the territory of which has a nearly smooth and uniform surface, on July 24 and August 12, 2020. It has been found that the turbulence spectra obtained with AMK-03 and the DJI Mavic Mini are generally identical with minor discrepancies in the high-frequency spectral range from f similar to 1 Hz. For the data obtained in July, the turbulence spectra in the inertial range obey the 5/3 law, and the relation of measured turbulence spectra of the longitudinal and transverse velocity components corresponds to the Kolmogorov-Obukhov isotropic turbulence. As for the data obtained in August, a slight deviation from the 5/3 law was observed in both AMK-03 and DJI Mavic Mini measurements. The longitudinal and transverse turbulence scales were estimated by the least-square fit method with the von Karman model as a regression curve. The turbulence scales calculated from the July and August data of AMK-03 and the DJI Mavic Mini coincide, and the condition describing the relation between the longitudinal and transverse scales in the isotropic atmosphere stays true to a good accuracy.

AB Distracted driving has been recognized as a major challenge to traffic safety improvement. This article presents a novel driving distraction detection method that is based on a new deep network. Unlike traditional methods, the proposed method uses both temporal information and spatial information of electroencephalography (EEG) signals as model inputs. Convolutional techniques and gated recurrent units were adopted to map the relationship between drivers' distraction status and EEG signals in the time domain. A driving simulation experiment was conducted to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method. Twenty-four healthy volunteers participated and three types of secondary tasks (i.e., cellphone operation task, clock task, and 2-back task) were used to induce distraction during driving. Drivers' EEG responses were measured using a 32-channel electrode cap, and the EEG signals were preprocessed to remove artifacts and then split into short EEG sequences. The proposed deep-network-based distraction detection method was trained and tested on the collected EEG data. To evaluate its effectiveness, it was also compared with the networks using temporal or spatial information alone. The results showed that our proposed distraction detection method achieved an overall binary (distraction versus nondistraction) classification accuracy of 0.92. In terms of task-specific distraction detection, its accuracy was 0.88. Further analysis on the individual difference in detection performance showed that drivers' EEG performance differed across individuals, which suggests that adaptive learning for each individual driver would be needed when developing in-vehicle distraction detection applications.

ID VEHICLE NAVIGATION
AB In the near future, multi-sensor fusion will be the core component to navigate the autonomous driving platforms. This paper proposes new strategies to cope with the integration of an inertial navigation system (INS), a global navigation satellite system (GNSS), and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) to achieve simultaneous localization and mapping (INS/GNSS/LiDAR SLAM) especially in GNSS challenging environments where GNSS signals are blocked or contaminated with reflected signals. The proposed strategies implement a high level of integration with various information received from multiple sensors to collectively compensate for the specific drawbacks of those sensors included in the integrated system. The first strategy is to solve the divergence and drift problems of SLAM using the initial pose information from INS and the proposed refreshing process using an INS/GNSS integrated system. In addition, an updated mechanization is designed to qualify those received measurements based on cross validation of separate types of data. This mechanization is to ensure all measurements are reliable for the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) update process. Moreover, the SLAM-derived information plays a major role to recognize the vehicle movement which assists the system to accurately apply those appropriate vehicle motion constraint models. The preliminary results presented in this study illustrate that proposed algorithm performs superior than the traditional INS/GNSS integration scheme and provides absolute navigation accuracy of 2 meters and 0.6% of distance traveled in GNSS-denied as well as 1.2 meters in GNSS-hostile environments, respectively.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB An automated vehicle needs to learn how human road users communicate with each other in order to avoid misunderstandings and prevent giving a negative outward image during interactions. The aim of the present work is to develop an autonomous driving system which communicates its intentions to change lanes based on implicit and explicit rules used by human drivers. To reach this goal, we aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of which aspects of lane change behaviour makes them cooperative from the perspective of other drivers. Therefore a vehicle used various lane change announcement strategies by varying combinations of driving parameters in a static driving simulator. (First study: Start indicator signal, Waittime, lane change duration; Second study: Longitudinal acceleration). It's impact on the perception and behaviour of other road users was observed in two studies (N = 25 per study). The results showed that the earlier the merging vehicle was indicating its intentions, the more cooperative it was perceived. When turning on the indicator at a later time participants considered it as more cooperative to merge with a slower or faster lane change duration or to wait longer in the lane before starting to move to the other lane. An early longitudinal acceleration when starting to change lanes is perceived more cooperative. These findings can be used to model a lane change strategy based on human behaviour, which will eventually lead to more acceptable and safer interactions between automated and non-automated road users.

ID NAVIGATION
AB One of the most challenging problems in the domain of autonomous aerial vehicles is the designing of a robust real-time obstacle detection and avoidance system. This problem is complex, especially for the micro and small aerial vehicles, that is due to the Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) constraints. Therefore, using lightweight sensors (i.e., Digital camera) can be the best choice comparing with other sensors; such as laser or radar. For real-time applications, different works are based on stereo cameras in order to obtain a 3D model of the obstacles, or to estimate their depth. Instead, in this paper, a method that mimics the human behavior of detecting the collision state of the approaching obstacles using monocular camera is proposed. The key of the proposed algorithm is to analyze the size changes of the detected feature points, combined with the expansion ratios of the convex hull constructed around the detected feature points from consecutive frames. During the Aerial Vehicle (UAV) motion, the detection algorithm estimates the changes in the size of the area of the approaching obstacles. First, the method detects the feature points of the obstacles, then extracts the obstacles that have the probability of getting close toward the UAV. Secondly, by comparing the area ratio of the obstacle and the position of the UAV, the method decides if the detected obstacle may cause a collision. Finally, by estimating the obstacle 2D position in the image and combining with the tracked waypoints, the UAV performs the avoidance maneuver. The proposed algorithm was evaluated by performing real indoor and outdoor flights, and the obtained results show the accuracy of the proposed algorithm compared with other related works.

ID SELF-ORGANIZATION
AB Over the last decade, authorities have begun inquiring about the use of safe, comfortable, ecological vehicles for operation in an urban context as an alternative to private cars. Several on-demand transport projects have emerged with new automated vehicles known as cybercars or Personal Rapid Transit (PRT). Our state-of-the-art survey of the literature about automated On-Demand Transport (ODT) control solutions highlighted the desirability of a decentralized approach, although centralized approaches do have some advantages. In order to benefit from the advantages of both centralized/hierarchical and decentralized/heterarchical control approaches, we propose a new concept of control: open-control. In this paper, the context is intelligent transportation, where vehicles (e.g., PRTs) can be seen as autonomous decisional entities that are part of a transport system. In this context, the open-control concept is used to support two solutions to PRT routing with uncertainty and perturbations. This open-control concept, developed in our lab, exhibits the traditional explicit control, as well as an innovative type of control called implicit control, which allows system entities to be influenced via an Optimization Mechanism (OM). After introducing the open-control paradigm, we illustrate two applications of the implicit control of a PRT fleet, one based on a stigmergic method and the second based on an embedded version of the Dijkstra's algorithm. We present a real implementation of the second approach applied to an experimental PRT network. We describe our experimental platform for PRT control and report our first experimental results. These experiments clearly show the reactivity of the control faced with unpredictable events, such as path perturbation or dynamic insertion of PRT in the network. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB With the continuous development of Internet of Things, data transmission presents an exponential rising trend. Due to the limited energy storage and low transmission power of sensor nodes, it is impossible to continuously transmit a large amount of collected data to the remote cloud center for a long time. To guarantee the data reliability and extend the lifetime of sensor nodes, we use unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted data collection for data transmission to improve the performance of the network. As each sensor node has a certain business requirement for unloaded data volume, the flight trajectory and node access scheme are jointly optimized to minimize the energy consumed by all the sensing nodes. First, a model regarding the minimization problem of the maximum energy consumption was constructed. To effectively solve this nonconvex problem, the block coordinate descent method and slack variable method are used to transform the original optimization problem into two subproblems: trajectory optimization problem and node access scheme optimization problem. Second, an algorithm is proposed using the successive convex approximation to jointly optimize the flight trajectory and node access scheme. This algorithm acquires the optimal node access scheme and UAV flight trajectory successively in each iteration. When the number of iterations is great enough, the minimum-maximum energy consumption of sensing nodes is gradually converged. The simulation results showed that in comparison with the basic UAV flight scheme, the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the energy consumption of nodes and improve the data transmission rate, and meanwhile, this algorithm is characterized by favorable convergence and tolerable complexity.

AB With the explosive increment of computation requirements, the multiaccess edge computing (MEC) paradigm appears as an effective mechanism. Besides, as for the Internet of Things (IoT) in disasters or remote areas requiring MEC services, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and high altitude platforms (HAPs) are available to provide aerial computing services for these IoT devices. In this article, we develop the hierarchical aerial computing framework composed of HAPs and UAVs, to provide MEC services for various IoT applications. In particular, the problem is formulated to maximize the total IoT data computed by the aerial MEC platforms, restricted by the delay requirement of IoT and multiple resource constraints of UAVs and HAPs, which is an integer programming problem and intractable to solve. Due to the prohibitive complexity of the exhaustive search, we handle the problem by presenting the matching game theory-based algorithm to deal with the offloading decisions from IoT devices to UAVs, as well as a heuristic algorithm for the offloading decisions between UAVs and HAPs. The external effect affected by the interplay of different IoT devices in the matching is tackled by the externality elimination mechanism. Besides, an adjustment algorithm is also proposed to make the best of aerial resources. The complexity of proposed algorithms is analyzed and extensive simulation results verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithms, and the system performances are also analyzed by the numerical results.

AB Food crop classification and identification are crucial aspects of modern agriculture. With progression of drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), crop detection from RGB images goes through a paradigm shift from traditional image processing methods to deep learning (DL) methods due to effective breakthroughs in convolutional neural networks (CNN). Drone images are reliable for identifying different crops because of its higher spatial resolution. Food crop classification utilizing deep learning on drone images includes machine learning techniques for distinguishing and identifying different types of crops in images captured by UAVs. It is beneficial for various applications, like crop monitoring and precision agriculture. This paper presents a new Satin Bowerbird Optimization with deep learning for Food Crop Classification (SBODL-FCC) technique on UAV images. The presented SBODL-FCC technique exploits DL models with hyperparameter optimizers for food crop classification on UAV images. To accomplish this, the presented SBODL-FCC technique employs adaptive bilateral filtering technique for image preprocessing. Besides, the SBODL-FCC technique uses MobileNetv2 feature extractor with Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm for parameter optimization. Moreover, the food crop classification process is performed through convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) model. Furthermore, the hyperparameter tuning of the ConvLSTM method is accomplished through SBO algorithm. The experimental validation of the SBODL-FCC technique is validated on UAV image database and the results are inspected under different aspects. The simulation outcomes inferred that the SBODL-FCC technique reaches better performance over other models in terms of several performance measures.

AB Currently, unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is a hot research topic in marine technology and has been gradually applied into practice in different fields. Accurate positioning measurement and autonomous navigation are two fundamental issues for practical applications. Ultra-wideband (UWB)-based positioning mechanism has been widely used in indoor scenes. However, there are few cases that UWB positioning method is applied to outdoor occasions at present, especially in the sea surface. Due to occasional unavailability of global positioning system (GPS) signal, this article proposes a novel long-range UWB-positioning-based automatic docking path planning algorithm for USV. First, a novel automatic docking framework based on long-distance UWB positioning method is investigated. Furthermore, a hybrid filtering method using median filter (MF) and extended Kalman filter (EKF) is introduced to smooth ranging value, so as to calculate precise positioning information and heading angle of USV in the UWB-based coordinate system. The relative position measuring device based on long-distance UWB positioning technology is well-designed to be applied in the USV. Finally, segmented Dubins curve is applied to plan automatic docking trajectory iteratively so as to satisfy USV's dynamic constraints. Experimental results verify that the proposed long-range UWB-based positioning method has higher accuracy than traditional GPS, and therefore, it is particularly suitable for USV positioning without GPS signals. In the Sea trial, with the aid of derived high-precision positioning measurement instrumentation, the controlled USV can be navigated back to the dockyard along designed iterative Dubins curve.

AB Precision farming is the newest agricultural approach in countries with highly mechanized field operations, and the role of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in smart farming is becoming increasingly prominent. This work aimed to evaluate the stability of the DEDALO UGV developed by the University of BOLOGNA for precision orchard and vineyard management. The driving part of the machine is somewhat peculiar; it moves autonomously in the field combined with a tank to store water and pesticide mixture for crop protection, with an additional structure to carry agricultural implements. The study aimed to evaluate the stability of the agricultural unladen UGV, and mulcher and sprayer mounted configurations. In the case of the sprayer, the stability behavior was evaluated with an empty and full tank. The machine, in terms of stability, was studied both laterally and longitudinally. A theoretical model was developed based on the upstream side forces measured during experimental tipping tests. The results of the experimental data were compared with the theoretical predicted results to validate the model. In the lateral test, the average value of the limit stability angle was 48 degrees, while in the longitudinal test, it was 49 degrees. The results of the model were statistically correlative (R-2 > 95) and denoted that the most stable condition occurred in the case of the UGV fitted with the mulcher in the longitudinal tipping position (56 degrees), while the most unstable condition was the case of the unladen UGV in the longitudinal tipping position (40 degrees). Although the stability problem is not directly connected with the operator, as these machines do not require a driver, the lack of stability can lead to the UGV overturning with consequent risks for the surrounding environment and damage to the UGV body.

AB Nonterrestrial communications have emerged as a key enabler for seamless connectivity in the upcoming generation networks. This kind of network can support high data rate communications among aerial platforms (i.e., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), high-altitude platforms (HAPs), and satellites) and cellular networks, achieving anywhere and anytime connections. However, there are many practical implementation limitations, especially overload power consumption, high probability of blockage, and dynamic propagation environment. Fortunately, the recent technology reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is expected to be one of the most cost-efficient solutions to address such issues. RIS with low-cost elements can bypass blockages and create multiple line-of-sight (LoS) links and provide controllable communication channels. In this article, we present a comprehensive literature review on the RIS-assisted nonterrestrial networks (RANTNs). First, the framework of the RANTNs is introduced with detailed discussion about distinct properties of RIS in NTNs and the two deployment types of RIS, that is, terrestrial RISs (TRISs), and aerial RISs (ARISs), and the classification of RANTNs, including RIS-assisted air-to-ground (A2G)/ground-to-air (G2A), ARIS-assisted ground-to-ground (G2G), and RIS-assisted air-to-air (A2A) communications. In combination with next-generation communication technologies, the advanced technologies in RANTNs are discussed. Then, we overview the literature related to RANTNs from the perspectives of performance analysis and optimization, followed by the widely used methodologies. Finally, open challenges and future research direction in the context of the RANTNs are highlighted.

TI Triangulated investigation of trust in automated driving: Challenges and

AB In automated driving, an appropriate level of driver trust is essential to improve safety and ensure zero fatalities. Drivers must have a sufficient level of trust to intervene correctly in safety-critical situations: very low levels may lead to either continuous and excessive monitoring of the functions, reducing the attention paid to the environment or switching off these functions, whereas extreme trust in automated driving functions can result in dangerous driving situations because the environment is either insufficiently monitored or not monitored at all. A deeper understanding of trust in automated driving is challenging and requires a triangulated study in which the type of driver, vehicle usage, and environmental data are varied. However, many previous studies were based on a rather limited set of data sources, often relying on qualitative means such as pre-and-post interviews or trust questionnaires to evaluate trust in autonomous driving functions. Although data gathered through empirical research, such as conducting quantitative surveys or qualitative interviews, are simple to store and analyze, the collection and integration of vehicle and sensor data from different data sources usually pose important technical challenges in practice. Hence, a suitable data collection and integration strategy is required to address these challenges. In this context, we propose a general framework for collecting and integrating data from different sources with diverse capabilities and requirements to determine a driver's trust in automated driving. Our proposed framework facilitates the integration of empirical and measurement data, allowing a triangulated investigation to provide a road map for the automotive industry.

AB This study presents a radial basis function (RBF) aided extended Kalman filter (EKF) (namely, novel RBFEKF: NRBFEKF) to improve attitude estimation solutions in GPS-Denied environments. The NRBFEKF has been developed and applied for attitude estimation using only the outputs of strap-down IMU (gyroscopes and accelerometers) and strap-down magnetometer. In general, neural networks have the capability to map input-output relationships of a system without a-priori knowledge about them. A properly designed RBF neural network is able to learn and extract complex relationships given enough training. Furthermore, if there is a platform with inputs, outputs and many sensors, the RBF is able to adapt all the changes of sensors output. The RBFEKF, which is based on EKF aided by RBF network is validated in Matlab environment using simulated trip data and real data acquired during an UAV's trip. The RBFEKF has increased the accuracy of attitude estimation compared to typical EKF. In addition, the RBF is trained to map the vehicle manoeuvre for tuning measurement noise covariance matrix. Simulation results show that estimated measurement noise covariance matrix is closed to the nominal values in cruise flight (stationary phase), while in non-stationary phase the trained RBF neglects measurements from accelerometers, where accelerometer measurement model is not valid during this phase.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been applied to various promising applications because of their features of high-mobility, portability, rapid deployment, and modest power consumption. Small UAVs fly at low altitudes and typically short distances from the ground controller. It is of interest and value to model the propagation channel between low-altitude UAVs and ground stations. This article presents results of channel measurements at 3.9 GHz carried out in a suburban environment with a small-size UAV flying at low altitudes, up to 40 m. The authors also present comparative results from ray-tracing simulations. Height-dependent models for path loss, root mean square (RMS) delay spread, and the number of multipath components are provided. The results illustrate that although multipath effects exist at low altitudes in this environment, the two-ray path loss model works reasonably well in describing the channel behaviour. Initial ray tracing simulations show reasonable agreement with measurements. In addition, RMS delay spread results indicate that distant scatterers have an appreciable effect on the UAV air-ground (AG) propagation channels, which can be different from some terrestrial channels. Authors' results should be of use in the modelling of low-altitude AG propagation channels and in the performance analysis of UAV-enabled AG communication systems.

AB Lifelong indoor localization in a given map is the basis for navigation of autonomous mobile robots. In this letter, we address the problem of robust localization in cluttered indoor environments like office spaces and corridors using 3D LiDAR point clouds in a given Area Graph, which is a hierarchical, topometric semantic map representation that uses polygons to demark areas such as rooms, corridors or buildings. This representation is very compact, can represent different floors of buildings through its hierarchy and provides semantic information that helps with localization, like poses of doors and glass. In contrast to this, commonly used map representations, such as occupancy grid maps or point clouds, lack these features and require frequent updates in response to environmental changes (e.g. moved furniture), unlike our approach, AGLoc, which matches against lifelong architectural features such as walls and doors. For that we apply filtering to remove clutter from the 3D input point cloud and then employ further scoring and weight functions for localization. Given a broad initial guess from WiFi and barometer localization, our experiments show that our global localization and the weighted point to line ICP pose tracking perform very well, even when compared to localization and SLAM algorithms that use the current, feature-rich cluttered map for localization.

AB Autonomous Underwater Profiling Drifter (AUPD) is developed by National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), Chennai, India, for the vertical profiling of the ocean. AUPD is a free-drifting profiling platform for near real-time in-situ observation of the upper 2000 m of the ocean column. It measures conductivity and temperature profiles with reference to depth. The AUPD transmits measured data through ARGOS satellite Platform Terminal Transmitter (PTT) to ARGOS regional centre as per the requirement of the International ARGO program. The AUPD ascends or descends due change in buoyancy (+/- 250 cm(3)). While on sea surface (to transmit the profile data), the position of the float is derived using the Doppler shift method with an accuracy of similar to 100 m. NIOT developed AUPD and deployed in the Arabian Sea in 2013-2015. The AUPD is ballasted for a pre-deployment depth of 2000 m and pre-programmed for a typical profiling cycle of 2 days. The AUPD is designed with 32 bit Atmel micro-controller and a lithium battery bank provides power. It has endurance for 150 profiles. AUPD float is suitable to fulfil the demand for profiling floats for International Argo Program. This paper is focused on the development of AUPD. The paper also discusses testing and field deployment of AUPD float.

AB The accurate environment potential field (EPF) modeling method and highly efficient collision avoidance (CA) approach are key technologies for maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS). A novel and accurate environment potential field (EPF) model is proposed using electronic navigation chart (ENC) face objects to describe different types of navigable and non-navigable areas, and an improved artificial potential field (APF) method is presented to realize collaborative CA and obstacle avoidance (OA). Implicit equations of complex-shaped face objects were constructed based on R-function theory, and the discrete-convex hull method was introduced to realize automatic EPF modeling. Collaborative CA and OA experiments in restricted waters were conducted on a ship handling simulator. The results show that the improved APF method can obtain a robust and deterministic collision-free path under different weather conditions and in restricted waters, and the track zone width remains within 0.1 nm. The proposed face object EPF model is efficient and accurate, even with numerous vertices and complex shapes, and can drive the ship apart at a relatively safe distance in accordance with the recommended CA parameter. We present a practical CA approach and an effective EPF modeling method for APF-based ship path planning.

AB Human-computer interaction (HCI) is a cornerstone for the success of technical innovation in the logistics and supply chain sector. As a major part of social sustainability, this interaction is changing as artificial intelligence applications (Internet of Things, autonomous transport, Physical Internet) are implemented, leading to larger machine autonomy, and hence the transition from a primary executive to a supervisory role of human operators. A fundamental question concerns the level of control transferred to machines, such as autonomous vehicles and automatic materials handling devices. Problems include a lack of human trust toward automatic decision making or an inclination to override the system in case automated decisions are misperceived. This paper outlines a theoretical framework, describing different levels of acceptance and trust as a key HCI element of technology innovation, and points to the possible danger of an artificial divide at both the individual and firm level. Based upon the findings of four benchmark cases, a classification of the roles of human employees in adopting innovations is developed. Measures at operational, tactical, and strategic level are discussed to improve HCI, more in particular the capacity of individuals and firms to apply state-of-the-art techniques and to prevent an artificial divide, thereby increasing social sustainability.

DE Mapping; Localization; Rough terrain
ID REGISTRATION; VEHICLES
AB For autonomous navigation in difficult terrain, such as degraded environments in disaster response scenarios, robots are required to create a map of an unknown environment and to localize within this map. In this paper, we describe our approach to simultaneous localization and mapping that is based on the measurements of a 3D laser-range finder. We aggregate laser-range measurements by registering sparse 3D scans with a local multiresolution surfel map that has high resolution in the vicinity of the robot and coarser resolutions with increasing distance, which corresponds well to measurement density and accuracy of our sensor. By modeling measurements by surface elements, our approach allows for efficient and accurate registration and leverages online mapping and localization. The incrementally built local dense 3D maps of nearby key poses are registered against each other. Graph optimization yields a globally consistent dense 3D map of the environment. Continuous registration of local maps with the global map allows for tracking the 6D robot pose in real time. We assess the drivability of the terrain by analyzing height differences in an allocentric height map and plan cost-optimal paths. The system has been successfully demonstrated during the DARPA Robotics Challenge and the DLR SpaceBot Camp. In experiments, we evaluate accuracy and efficiency of our approach.

AB Edge/fog computing is a key enabling technology in 5G and beyond for fulfilling the tight latency requirements of emerging vehicle applications, such as cooperative and autonomous driving. Vehicular fog computing (VFC) is a cost-efficient deployment option that complements stationary fog nodes with mobile ones carried by moving vehicles. To plan the deployment and manage the VFC resources in the real world, it is essential to consider the spatiotemporal variations in both demand and supply of fog computing capacity and the tradeoffs between achievable quality-of-services and potential deployment and operating costs. The existing edge/fog computing simulators, such as IFogSim, IoTSim, and EdgeCloudSim, cannot provide a realistic technoeconomic investigation to analyze the implications of VFC deployment options due to the simplified network models in use, the lack of support for fog node mobility, and limited testing scenarios. In this article, we propose an open-source simulator VFogSim that allows real-world data as input for simulating the supply and demand of VFC in urban areas. It follows a modular design to evaluate the performance and cost efficiency of deployment scenarios under various vehicular traffic models, and the effectiveness of the diverse network and computation schedulers and prioritization mechanisms under user-defined scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, our platform is the first one that supports the mobility of fog nodes and provides realistic modeling of vehicle-to-everything in 5G and beyond networks in the urban environment. Furthermore, we validate the accuracy of the platform using a real-world 5G measurement and demonstrate the functionality of the platform taking VFC capacity planning as an example.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, are currently being used to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through applications, including the delivery of medical supplies, aerial spraying, and public space monitoring. In a pandemic, drone-based delivery is a promising and highly efficient method to reduce transportation time, cost, and exposure to infection. However, owing to both the limited battery lifetime and the limited functions of UAV in-flight missions, it is difficult to implement multiple deliveries over long distances in a single transportation mission. In this article, we study how to extend the drone flight time with charging stations and ensure multiple deliveries in a single mission. For multiple long-distance deliveries, optimization methods are required to design the delivery area networks of customers, charging stations, and delivery routes. We propose a joint routing and charging strategy (JRCS) comprising three phases to perform multiple deliveries in a single mission. We first split the customers of a delivery area using a clustering algorithm according to their distance from the nearest charging station and the maximum flight range. The second phase provides flight segmentation and intersegment routes between the depot, customer locations, and charging stations based on the maximum flight range and safe flight distance. The joint consideration of drone routes with charging stations minimizes the number of charging stations and ensures safe delivery. Finally, we formulate mixed-integer linear programming to solve the drone delivery route problem. According to simulation results, the proposed JRCS outperforms existing delivery approaches in terms of various performance metrics.

   FRAMEWORK
AB Distraction, misjudgement and driving mistakes can significantly affect a driver, resulting in an increased risk of accidents. There are diverse factors that can cause mistakes in driving such as unfamiliarity with the road, situation unawareness, fatigue, stress, and drowsiness. In emerging smart cars, sensing, actuation, advanced signal processing and machine learning are deployed to reduce the impact of driving errors by monitoring the state of the driver in real-time, detecting the mistakes, and deploying necessary actions to counteract them. Such strategies are collectively known as human-machine shared driving. Towards a better understanding of the developments taken place in this domain, as well as identifying gaps and trends in this discipline, a systematic review of the major studies and developments reported in the literature is conducted. The study is based on 155 papers of human-machine shared driving, selected through a thorough and comprehensive search of the literature. The review demonstrates that shared control approaches are mostly dependent on vehicle and environmental data obtained through various sensors. The majority of methods deploy active shared control by leveraging longitudinal and lateral dynamics. However, the precise recognition of driver's intent and actions, accurate estimation of situation awareness, and modelling the trust between driver and automation are still major challenges preventing timely transition of control from the driver to machine or vice-versa, and resulting in fatal accidents. Major challenges in human-machine shared driving are identified and potential future directions of the work are explored.

AB In view of the scarce spectrum resources and inconvenient deployment in wireless communications, this work focuses on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system where a UAV deployed as a base station serves two users by NOMA. A joint power allocation and aerial jamming (PAAJ) scheme is proposed to achieve reliable and secure communications for the system in the presence of a malicious eavesdropper. To be specific, dynamic power allocation is adopted to ensure the reliability of the system and another friendly UAV jammer is introduced to improve the security of the system. The closed-form expressions of connection outage probability (COP), secrecy outage probability (SOP), and effective secrecy throughput (EST) are derived to evaluate the performance of the security-required user in the practical condition of probabilistic line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) air-to-ground (A2G) channels. Moreover, the asymptotic EST is analyzed to obtain further insights. Numerical results show the validity of theoretical derivations and the superiority of the proposed PAAJ scheme over benchmark schemes. The EST of the UAV-enabled NOMA communication system outperforms the conventional terrestrial NOMA system at the low transmitting power from the UAV base station. There exists an optimal height of the UAV base station to maximize the EST, which provides a useful framework for designing UAV-enabled communication systems with heterogeneous service requirements.

AB Highly divergent estimates of benthic cover of sponges have been reported for Caribbean mesophotic reefs (90-100 m) based on quadrat point-intercept data collection using 2 methods: visual surveys conducted in situ by technical divers, and analyses of photographs taken by unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). The second method has been criticized for potential errors from image distortion caused by variable camera angle relative to the substratum, but without a broader comparison of both methods. We find that studies that have used the UUV-based method are advantageous for a number of reasons, most importantly: (1) access to the full mesophotic zone, (2) higher sample replication, and (3) reduced likelihood of sampling bias. For tech diving surveys conducted at 91 m, i.e. the deepest depth reported using this method but only midway through the mesophotic zone, studies have reported particularly high sponge cover (similar to 80 vs. < 10% for UUV-based surveys), which may be a consequence of low replication and targeted sampling influenced by very short working times under hazardous conditions. When evaluating benthic abundance metrics from photographs, issues associated with variable substratum angle are common to any topographically complex surface, particularly within a quadrat. Nevertheless, point-intercept estimates are not dependent on quadrat area and are not subject to error due to image distortion or surface complexity. Unlike visual census data from tech dives, UUV photographs can be validated by taxonomic experts and archived for re-analysis. Past tech diving surveys should be repeated using the UUV-based method with greater replication over the full range of the mesophotic zone in order to reconcile divergent estimates of benthic cover.

AB Landslides are one of the major factors threatening human life and social development. Monitoring and early warning of landslides are important parts of disaster prevention and control. However, due to complex terrain conditions, landslide monitoring in mountainous watersheds and high mountain valleys usually faces issues of high difficulty, high danger, poor data integrity, and low data accuracy compared with plains or hilly areas. Based on the fusion of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry, this article proposes a landslide deformation monitoring method that can be applied to complex terrain conditions where there are access restrictions and blind areas. The method is based on TLS to increase the number and range of ground control points (GCPs) of UAVs within the visual range and then uses assumed control points (ACPs) to reconstruct the UAV model and calculate landslide displacement in invisible areas. In addition, this article proposes and verifies a formula based on an allometricl equation to estimate the error between the calculated and real displacements based on this method. Then, we applied this method to a real landslide case and successfully realized landslide monitoring under the conditions of access limitation and blind areas. The proposed method enables landslide monitoring to overcome terrain restrictions, and it makes it possible to perform large-scale and high-precision ground deformation measurements with limited working ranges, which can be an effective tool for landslide monitoring in emergency situations and long-term risk evaluation.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been instrumental in enabling many new applications and services, including military and rescue operations, aerial surveillance, civilian applications, precision farming, as well as providing extensive wireless network access in remote areas. They have also been used in other areas such as transmission line and oil rig monitoring, disaster recovery, etc. With their increasing payload ability and flight duration, using UAVs is a preferred choice for a multitude of upcoming wireless communication systems. However, because of their open operational nature, UAVs are highly vulnerable to severe security breaches via cyber attacks, eavesdropping on navigational and communication links, etc. Given their widespread applications, the requirement of secured UAV communications has become more and more critical since security failures can lead to detrimental consequences. Several works have examined the extent of privacy and security issues in UAV-assisted networks and introduced various mitigation techniques to address different security challenges. In this paper, a comprehensive survey is conducted that centers on the security issues related to UAV-aided networks. A descriptive taxonomy of various security intrusions on the UAV networks and commonly-used secrecy performance metrics are thoroughly reviewed. An in-depth discussion is provided on alleviating threats with proactive security techniques blended with key wireless communication technologies such as mmWave, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), and cognitive radio. Moreover, several emerging topics like machine learning, software-defined networks, fog and edge computing, blockchain, are discussed in the context of UAV-aided secure communications.

AB In intelligent transportation systems (ITS), communications between vehicles, i.e. vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications are of greatest importance to facilitate autonomous driving. The current state-of-the-art for secure data exchange in V2V communications relies on public-key cryptography (PKC) consuming significant computational and energy resources for the encryption/decryption process and large bandwidth for the key distribution. To overcome these limitations, physical-layer security (PLS) has emerged as a lightweight solution by exploiting the physical characteristics of the V2V communication channel to generate symmetric cryptographic keys. Currently, key-generation algorithms are designed via empirical parameter settings, without resulting in optimum key-generation performance. In this paper, we devise a key-generation algorithm for PLS in V2V communications by introducing a novel channel response quantisation method that results in optimum performance via analytical parameter settings. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art, the channel responses incorporate all V2V channel attributes that contribute to temporal variability, such as three dimensional (3D) scattering and scatterers' mobility. An extra functionality, namely, Perturbe-Observe (PO), is further incorporated that enables the algorithm to adapt to the inherent non-reciprocity of the V2V channel responses at the legitimate entities. Optimum performance is evidenced via maximisation of the key bit generation rate (BGR) and key entropy (H) and minimisation of the key bit mismatch rate (BMR). A new metric is further introduced, the so-called secret-bit generation rate (SBGR), as the ratio of the number of bits which are successfully used to compose keys to the total amount of channel samples. SBGR unifies BGR and BMR and is thus maximised by the proposed algorithmic process.

AB Mobile users are interested in utilising high network capabilities without time and place constraints. However, with a high level of interest in the usage of mobile phones and internet facilities, the limited capacity of terrestrial base stations (BSs) is unbalanced. As a potential alternative to BSs, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as a means of transmitting wireless data to ground mobile users. As an air-to-ground communication network, the real UAVs deployed and collected communication data from ground mobile users. The main objective of this study is to analyse and evaluate user throughput, interference, and power transmission when the UAVs are at different heights. The parameters used include the locations of the UAVs and users, the altitudes and elevation angles from the users to UAVs, signal-to-noise-ratio, throughput values, the categories of line-of-sight, and non-line-of-sight links. Furthermore, K-means used as a clustering method for class identification, long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU) to analyse and evaluate system performance. The system's performance was compared with a multi-layer perceptron approach. The evaluation results show that the proposed LSTM-GRU provides reliable and encouraging performance with low computational complexity, which is appropriate for heterogeneous networks.

AB The purpose of this work is to review urban transportation likely to be offered in the future. Trip-making behaviour has already changed considerably as lifestyles change and they will continue to change in the future. This work reflects and places emphasis on profound thinking about the possibilities, rather than predicting them. Thoughts about possibilities for the future draw upon imagination, perceived and justified feasibility, and lessons gained from the past. This work attempts to capture the possibilities, logistics and travel modes of future urban transportation. A visionary, feasibility-related approach grounded in a realist perspective is proposed, only conceptually, to explore plausible visions for the future. In addition, this work shows the inefficiency of using private cars (PCs) and argues that in the development of autonomous and electric vehicles, PCs cannot provide a solution competitive with the potential that urban transportation systems have for the future. Hence, the solutions for the future must be based on public transport (PT) modes of travel, regardless of whether they are metro, bus, light rail, tram, ridesharing services, an ordinary taxi, personal rapid transit, or any other PT-based future mode. The key principal of operation for the mobility of a smart city will be the ability to optimize the connectivity of movement in order to approach a seamless move, while endowing the phrase door-to-door travel with new meaning. Finally, it would be remiss not to mention the unforeseeable implications of the Covid-19 pandemic for future mobility, more controllable by automation of non-privately owned vehicle, and with the prospect of people demonstrating a greater inclination towards changing their habits, behaviour, and thinking paradigms.

AB In the last few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are making a revolution as an emerging technology with many different applications in the military, civilian, and commercial fields. The advent of autonomous drones has initiated serious challenges, including how to maintain their safe operation during their missions. The safe operation of UAVs remains an open and sensitive issue since any unexpected behavior of the drone or any hazard would lead to potential risks that might be very severe. The motivation behind this work is to propose a methodology for the safety assurance of drones over the Internet (Internet of drones (IoD)). Two approaches will be used in performing the safety analysis: (1) a qualitative safety analysis approach and (2) a quantitative safety analysis approach. The first approach uses the international safety standards, namely, ISO 12100 and ISO 13849 to assess the safety of drone's missions by focusing on qualitative assessment techniques. The methodology starts with hazard identification, risk assessment, risk mitigation, and finally draws the safety recommendations associated with a drone delivery use case. The second approach presents a method for the quantitative safety assessment using Bayesian networks (BN) for probabilistic modeling. BN utilizes the information provided by the first approach to model the safety risks related to UAVs' flights. An illustrative UAV crash scenario is presented as a case study, followed by scenario analysis, to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. These two analyses, qualitative and quantitative, enable all involved stakeholders to detect, explore, and address the risks of UAV flights, which will help the industry to better manage the safety concerns of UAVs.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has very wide application prospect in aiding terrestrial cellular network communication, but it remains a challenge to optimize UAV locations and maximize user service rate during deployment. In this paper, a novel network optimization scheme based on anti-flocking model and improved Nash Equilibrium (NE) algorithm is proposed by studying the problem of dynamic UAV deployment and backhaul transmission. Firstly, the UAV-adaptive algorithm based on gray wolf optimization (U-GWO) is used to predeploy UAVs with limited number of UAVs. Secondly, ground mobile users are tracked by building a UAV-based anti-flocking (U-AF) model. Then, during the tracking of ground users by UAV, an improved NE strategy is used to establish the backhaul transmission links between UAVs, ground BSs and other UAVs to ensure that deployed UAVs can maximize the service rate and effective backhaul transmission rate of ground users. Simulation results show that the average service rate of User Equipment (UE) with U-GWO algorithm is improved from 1 % to 5.77 % compared to other different swarm intelligence optimization algorithms. And the service rate obtained with U-AF algorithm is 43.2 % improved compared to the baseline scenario without U-AF algorithm. For UAV backhaul transmission link construction, the simulation results show that the proposed improved NE strategy improves the average effective backhaul transmission rate by 12 %, the minimum backhaul transmission rate by 84 % and the overall iteration number by 5 % on average compared to a pure NE strategy.

AB Driver distraction behavior causes a large number of traffic accidents every year, resulting in economic losses and injuries. Currently, the driver still plays an important role in the driving and control of the vehicle due to the low level of vehicle automation and the immature development of autonomous driving. Therefore, it is vital to research distraction detection for drivers. However, in realistic driving scenarios with uncertain information, they are still some challenges in efficient and accurate driver distraction detection. In this paper, an improved deep learning model based on attention mechanisms and bi-directional feature pyramid networks (BiFPN) is proposed to identify driver distractions. Firstly, an improved data augmentation strategy is introduced to increase the data diversity to enhance the generalization capability of the model. Secondly, the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) attention mechanism layer is used after the C3 module of the original backbone network to enhance the important feature information and suppress the minor feature information. Finally, the BiFPN module is introduced into the neck network to better achieve multi-scale feature fusion without increasing the calculation amount too much. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper has an average mean accuracy rate (mAP) of 0.956 on the test set. Compared to the original model the mAP has improved by 13.2%. The detection speed of the model is 71 frames per second, and the memory occupation is 15.9 MB. This method has the advantages of high recognition accuracy, fast detection speed, and small memory occupation of the model, which are important for achieving engineering deployment.

AB The rapid development and commercialization of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has made it possible to conduct urban traffic information extraction using UAV images. However, the large variations of targets in urban environments, complex foregrounds and backgrounds in cities, and severe tree and shadow occlusions pose great challenges in car and road extraction using UAV images. In this study, we propose a lightweight, efficient dual contextual parsing network (EDCPNet) to address the above issues. The proposed efficient dual contextual parsing (EDCP) module in EDCPNet is mainly composed of spatial contextual parsing (SCP) and channel contextual parsing (CCP), which can effectively acquire rich contextual features in both spatial and channel dimensions, adaptively recalibrate the attention weights, perceive the salient features of targets in images, and suppress the importance of irrelevant elements. It, thus, leads to improved performance and adaptability that facilitate the practical applications of large-scale urban traffic monitoring in complex urban scenes. We conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets [UAV image dataset (UAVid) and urban drone dataset (UDD)] by comparing the proposed EDCPNet with six other competing methods, i.e., U-Net, PSPNet, Deelabv3+, SegNet, ESNet, and ERFNet, and validate the effectiveness of the proposed EDCP module via extensive ablation studies. The results suggest that the proposed network outperforms all competing methods in car and road extraction from UAV images with a balanced computational cost. Its great performance and low computational demand (with only 2.37M model parameters) facilitate its deployment on edge computing devices with memory constraints.

AB The paper develops a simulation model and evaluates fixed versus on-demand operational designs of a station-based automated feeder service. The evaluation considers the operational cost and average passenger level-of-service trade-offs as well as distributional differences in waiting times. Two case studies are used to evaluate such trade-offs under different fleet compositions; (1) a simple circular network feeder service; (2) a case based on a real-world coordinated branched service in Stockholm, combining fixed-line services on the trunk portion with a flexible feeder service on the branches. Results for the circular network indicate that there are benefits in utilizing an on-demand operational policy for the lowest and highest demand levels tested. When fixed service capacity is exceeded, it is found that there are potential benefits in on-demand operations with respect to average level-of-service, as well as delivering a more even distribution of passenger waiting times. Results for the real-world case show that combining DRT on branches with fixed services on the trunk improves the overall median waiting times for all DRT scenarios and provides substantial improvements for passengers on the trunk, at the cost of more variable, and less equitable waiting times on the branches. For larger fleet sizes, generalized travel costs are reduced with and without rebalancing and level-of service provided to branch-to-branch passengers is improved considerably by rebalancing idling vehicles to branch end-stops. The case studies demonstrate the usefulness of the simulation framework in evaluating trade-offs between fixed and on-demand service design variables and their effects on disaggregate level-of-service provided for stop-based feeder services.

AB A motion cueing algorithm (MCA) is employed to transform the linear and angular motion signals generated from a motion simulator without violating the physical and dynamical boundaries of the motion platform. In this respect, the accurate prediction of the motion scenarios is essential to enhance the efficiency of the MCA using prepositioning or time-varying reference model predictive control. While a recent approach that utilizes a feedforward neural network (NN) to forecast the motion scenarios is useful, the feedforward NN model has only forward dynamics relating to the signals without any feedback loop. In this article, a time-delay feedforward NN, a recurrent NN, and a nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) models with three different training procedures, i.e., Levenberg-Marquardt, Bayesian regularization, and scaled conjugate gradient, are exploited to predict the motion scenarios. As the NAR model employs the historical signals as the inputs, it can predict the motion scenarios with higher accuracy rates. Based on the series of empirical evaluations, NAR trained with Levenberg-Marquardt is able to outperform the other two counterparts in producing more accurate predictions of the motion signals. The NAR method has a lower computational load as compared with that of the recurrent NN, facilitating its real-time application. In addition to the MCA, the NAR method can be employed in other areas, including autonomous vehicles and motion sickness studies. It can also be easily implemented for air, sea, and/or land vehicle simulators for training purposes in virtual reality environments.

AB The Svalbard archipelago, with its partially closed waters influenced by both oceanic conditions and large tidal glaciers, represents a prime target for understanding the effects of ongoing climate change on glaciers, oceans, and ecosystems. An understanding of the role played by tidewater glaciers in marine primary production is still affected by a lack of data from close proximity to glacier fronts, to which, for safety reasons, manned surface vessels cannot get too close. In this context, autonomous marine vehicles can play a key role in collecting high quality data in dangerous interface areas. In particular, the contribution given by light, portable, and modular marine robots is discussed in this paper. The state-of-the-art of technology and of operating procedures is established on the basis of the experience gained in campaigns carried out by Italian National Research Council (CNR) robotic researchers in Ny-angstrom lesund, Svalbard Islands, in 2015, 2017, and 2018 respectively. The aim was to demonstrate the capability of an Unmanned Semi-Submersible Vehicle (USSV): (i) To collect water samples in contact with the front of a tidewater glacier; (ii) to work in cooperation with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for sea surface and air column characterisation in the proximity of the fronts of the glaciers; and (iii) to perform, when equipped with suitable tools and instruments, repetitive sampling of water surface as well as profiling the parameters of the water and air column close to the fronts of the tidewater glaciers. The article also reports the issues encountered in navigating in the middle of bergy bits and growlers as well as the problems faced in using some sensors at high latitudes.

AB In a bid to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, several countries worldwide are implementing policies to promote electric vehicles (EVs). However, contrary to expectations, the diffusion speed of EVs has been rather slow in South Korea. This study analyzes consumer preferences for the technological and environmental attributes of EVs and derives policy and environmental implications to promote market diffusion of EVs in South Korea. We conduct a choice-based conjoint survey of 1,008 consumers in South Korea and estimate the consumer utility function using a mixed logit model considering consumer heterogeneity. Based on the consumer utility function, we analyze consumers' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for EV attributes such as driving range, charging method, charging time, autonomous driving function, carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction rate, and purchase price. The results indicate that the current low acceptance of EVs is due to their relatively high price and lack of a battery charging technology that satisfies consumers' expectations of the charging method and time. One interesting finding is that Korean consumers have a relatively higher WTP for the CO2 reduction rate of EVs than consumers in other countries; however, they do not consider CO2 reduction over other technological attributes when choosing EVs. This implies that the rate of CO2 reduction of EVs is not an important factor for South Korean consumers when buying EVs. We also calculate the effect of CO2 reduction with the market penetration of EVs and find that CO2 reduction through the diffusion of EVs depends on the country's electricity generation mix.

AB Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are distinguished by their intelligence, compactness, and absence of human casualties, making them a vital component of the maritime industry. The implementation of vision-based algorithms for sea surface target detection can enhance the autonomous perceptual abilities of USVs. In the present study, a sea surface target detection algorithm was proposed that fulfils the requirements of USVs marine environment sensing and sea area monitoring. Sea surface target detection faces unique challenges, such as highly variable target sizes and a complex and changing marine environments. The current state-of-the-art You Only Look Once (YOLO) model was selected as the baseline target detection model. Firstly, to improve the network's ability to extract features of different sizes, a Cross Stage Partial Lightweight Spatial Pyramid Pooling-Fast (CSPLSPPF) structure was proposed. Additionally, for achieving the advantages of multiple feature maps to complement each other and output more judgmental feature maps, Path Aggregation Network Powerful (PANP) was proposed to more rationally fuse features of feature maps with different resolutions. Finally, lightweight convolution with fused attention(LCFA) was proposed to enable the network to selectively focus on crucial spatial and channel information while simultaneously reducing the model's parameter count. Experiments were conducted on a self-made Ocean Buoys dataset and the open-source Seaships dataset. The results showed that the proposed method could efficiently and accurately detect objects such as ships and buoys in marine environments, which was of significant value for USVs to achieve intelligent environment perception.

AB Distributed estimation of 6-DOF relative states, including three-dimensional relative poses and three-dimensional relative positions, is a key problem in UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) networks, which generally requires vision-involved iterative state estimation. How to achieve communication efficiency is a crucial challenge considering the large volume of vision data. This paper jointly considers the communication efficiency, latency, and accuracy for distributed relative state estimation involving vision data in UAV networks. The key is to solve a distributed graph optimization problem, which includes two key steps: (1) local graph construction and node state initialization in an initialization phase, and (2) iterative state update and communication with neighbors until convergence in online iteration phase. A communication efficient, Locating Then Informing (LTI) initialization scheme is proposed, which is run only once by each node to initialize each node's local graph and initial states. For online iteration, a RIPPLE-like distributed state iteration scheme is proposed. It inherits the advantages of traditional sequential and parallel methods while avoiding their drawbacks. It enables nodes' states to converge quickly using fewer rounds of communications. The communication costs for the initialization and online iteration processes are analyzed theoretically. Extensive evaluations use synthetic data generated by AirSim (a widely used UAV network simulation platform) and real-world data are presented. The results show that the proposed method provides accuracy comparable to the centralized graph optimization method and significantly outperforms the other distributed methods in terms of accuracy, communication cost, and latency.

AB Object detection and classification are key processes in advanced driver-assistance systems. The existing object detection and classification methods are effective in normal daylight conditions. However, the performance of these methods deteriorates in adverse driving conditions, such as those involving low light, illumination changes, and nighttime conditions. To overcome these limitations, several feature-based algorithms have been developed that introduce local features, such as local binary pattern, local tetra pattern, and local density encoding, for adverse driving conditions. However, these local patterns cannot effectively address the noise in real driving conditions because the relationship between the neighboring pixels cannot be comprehensively encoded. To solve these problems, this study developed a robust feature-based method by introducing a triangular-pattern-based sigmoid function to effectively encode and establish the robust feature of neighboring pixels in the local region. The performance of the proposed pattern is evaluated by integrating it into state-of-the-art object detection algorithms. The proposed method significantly increases the vehicle detection ratio of YOLOv5s by 11.7% for an intersection over a union of 0.5 in difficult driving conditions for the CCD dataset. Moreover, the detection ratios of the proposed method are comparable to those of other state-of-the-art object detection methods such as Retina, Faster RCNN, and Deformable DETR over various datasets such as KITTI, COCO, HCI, and CCD. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is implemented on a Raspberry Pi-based autonomous car system to evaluate its performance during real driving conditions. Our proposed method supports robust input feature extraction and can thus be used to enhance the performance of the existing obstacle detection and classification systems.

AB Accurate fault detection for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) actuators is essential for ensuring flight safety and mission completion. Without the requirement of modeling complex physical mechanism, data-driven actuator fault detection approaches have attracted much attention. Among them, the long short-term memory (LSTM) approach has shown superior performance due to its capability of modeling complex spatial-temporal features. However, the modeling uncertainty of LSTM is actually changeable under different flight conditions, which has not been well considered in the existing researches. In this article, a novel uncertainty-aware LSTM (UA-LSTM) based dynamic flight condition fault detection approach for UAV actuator is proposed. A prediction-based fault detection model is first set up based on LSTM, utilizing the information from both the flight action modes and the actuator effect. Its inputs are specifically selected by both physical mechanism and data correlation analysis. Furthermore, time-series features indicating the prediction uncertainty of the model are constructed on the selected inputs to characterize dynamic flight conditions more accurately. Then, an adaptive threshold estimation space is set up based on an enhanced distribution-based condition clustering approach. Fault detection thresholds for various flight conditions are obtained and are smoothed to reduce the influence of disturbances. Finally, the fault detection model with stepwise adaptive detection threshold is acquired. Experimental results on both simulation and real flight data illustrate that the proposed approach is superior for actuator fault detection under dynamic flight conditions.

AB This paper studies optimum deployment design and radio resource allocation in a coordinated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs)-assisted vehicular communication network. The scarcity of radio resources and the lack of appropriate communication paths have been challenging in the existing vehicular networks. Although employing UAVs with well-designed deployments can support vehicular communications by providing line-of-sight (LoS) links, however, limited energy and spectrum scarcity issues motivate us to apply non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with successive-interference-cancellation (SIC) as a solution to enhance radio resource efficiency for downlink infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) links. Meanwhile, due to the high complexity of the overall optimization problem that jointly handles deployment design and resource allocation for the studied UAVs-assisted vehicular network, we propose a low-complexity hierarchical suboptimal solution method. First, to efficiently find the optimum deployment of UAVs, we propose Stackelberg game with competitive nature as a game theory-based method, where UAVs are divided into leaders and followers groups that compete with each other to obtain the optimal position. Subsequently, we perform a low-complexity dynamic method in which radio resources are allocated in a sub-channel assignment algorithm and in a power allocation problem, respectively. Finally, the closed-form expressions of the optimal power allocation are derived using the KKT optimality conditions. Simulation results demonstrate improved performance for deployment design using the Stackelberg game. It is shown that NOMA improves the achievable sum rate compared to conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA). Also, fast convergence of the proposed resource allocation and deployment design is obtained.

AB E-Mobility deployment has attained increased interest during recent years in various countries all over the world. This interest has focused mainly on reducing the reliance on fossil fuel-based means of transportation and decreasing the harmful emissions produced from this sector. To secure the electricity required to satisfy Electric Vehicles' (EVs') charging needs without expanding or overloading the existing electricity infrastructure, stand-alone charging stations powered by renewable sources are considered as a reasonable solution. This paper investigates the simulation of the optimal energy management of a proposed grid-independent, multi-generation, fast-charging station in the State of Qatar, which comprises hybrid wind, solar and biofuel systems along with ammonia, hydrogen and battery storage units. The study aims to assess the optimal sizing of the solar, wind and biofuel units to be incorporated in the design along with the optimal ammonia, hydrogen and battery storage capacities to fulfill the daily EV demand in an uninterruptable manner. The main objective is to fast-charge a minimum of 50 EVs daily, while the constraints are the intermittent and volatile nature of renewable energy sources, the stochastic nature of EV demand, local meteorological conditions and land space limitations. The results show that the selection of a 468 kWp concentrated photovoltaic thermal plant, 250 kW-rated wind turbine, 10 kW biodiesel power generator unit and 595 kWh battery storage system, along with the on-site production of hydrogen and ammonia, to generate 200 kW power via fuel cells can achieve the desired target, with a total halt of on-site hydrogen and ammonia production during October and November and 50% reduction during December.

AB The economic situation and the future supply of food for the growing world population require the productivity of power and machinery to increase further. Moreover, legislation and demands in the areas such as environmental protection, maintenance of product quality and facilitation of work are factors that will exert a decisive influence on future developments.
   In the foreseeable future, the trend towards larger, more powerful machines will remain undiminished. Mobile machines are becoming even more complex due to the combination of work steps and because subsequent processing has been taken over by these machines. The percentage of self-propelled machines will grow further. Self-propelled machines are also being developed for those kinds of work that are still carried out by tractors and implements today. Nevertheless, the development of new sensors for the control of additional machine functions makes operation easier. Despite high vehicle mass, further developments in tyres and tracks avoid harmful soil compaction. In the future, continuously variable, power-splitting hydrostatic transmissions with electric control will lead to further increase in the productivity of agricultural tractors and simplify their operation. Electric power-splitting transmissions will gain in importance as an alternative to hydrostatic transmissions. Automatic vehicle control, especially through high-precision global positioning systems (GPS), will allow new working procedures such as onland ploughing to be carried out. In addition, the driver's work load will be reduced further, and productivity will increase due to higher driving speed and extended work time during twilight periods. Only after numerous safety questions have been solved will autonomous, unmanned vehicles be employed. At first, their use will be restricted to simple work such as tillage.

AB Traffic simulation is a crucial tool for testing and evaluating hypotheses in both the design of autonomous driving systems and the optimization of urban transportation, where modelling and calibrating driver behaviour is key. In this article, we introduce a novel approach to calibrating driver models by combining fuzzy logic and inference to produce a plausible parametrization that, simultaneously, reproduces drivers' behaviour peculiarities and road traffic characteristics. The calibration system uses solely vehicle trajectories that describe cars' movements through the road network, with a resolution of time and space enough to allow for determining the lane of the road used, speed, and acceleration at every second of the survey period. This data is processed by a lightweight modelling and inference system capable of interpreting the input data through the lens of domain knowledge and physics laws in order to learn plausible driver model parameters using fuzzy computation. The outcome is a set of parameters for mathematical models which emulate the social and physical features of the behaviour of a driver-vehicle unit. Albeit this study limits itself to determining parameters for car-following and lane-change models, the systematic approach for calibration can be seen as a framework where also other driver model components can be calibrated (e.g. gap-acceptance). We evaluate our system on both synthetic and real data while comparing it with other approaches for calibration. We summarize our findings using a thorough analysis where we point out the most relevant aspects to consider when calibrating driver models.

AB Network slicing is a logical network function that supports communication service requirements for specific usage scenarios or business models. It has become an essential factor in solving future network architecture. In recent years, heterogeneous network slicing between multiple autonomous domains has emerged, with significant limitations compared to single-domain networks. Data sharing in heterogeneous network slices challenge the confidentiality of sensitive data significantly. Preventing sensitive data from leaking and protect-ing core data have become urgent problems to be solved. Therefore, we propose a multi-party (multi-sender to multi-receiver) anonymous authentication scheme on certificateless cryptography(CLC) and identity-based cryptosystem(IBC) institutional domain Internet of Vehicles(IoV) to smart healthcare. Our scheme realizes heterogeneous communication between multiple senders and multiple receivers, and uses different system parameters for heterogeneous cryptographic systems. In this work, the limitation of one-to-many or many -to-one communication in existing heterogeneous networks is broken through. The proposed work utilizes the pseudo-identity generated by the trusted authority to communicate in IoV slices, ensuring the anonymity of the sender; The authorization Center TA can uniquely determine the true identity of the vehicle through pseudo-random values for traceability. What is more, the Lagrange interpolation formula is employed to prevent the leakage of the identities of smart healthcare slices, ensuring the anonymity of the receiver. Under the random oracle model, the proposed scheme has proved to satisfy unforgeability, confidentiality, and anonymity under the computational Diffie-Hellman problem. Experimental results indicate that our proposal achieves better performance than existing schemes.

AB Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) are considered one of the prominent technologies to be adopted in 6G and beyond networks. However, one of the main IRS limitations is restricting the communication to the reflective dimension, which means that users located behind the IRS surface cannot benefit from it. In this paper, we make use of intelligent omni-surfaces (IOS), as an alternative to IRS, in addition to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to achieve secure communication in an Internet-of-Things (IoT) communication system. Specifically, we propose IOS-UAV assisted communication wherein an access point (AP) tries to send confidential information to a legitimate IoT device in presence of an eavesdropper. The UAV serves two fold; it acts as a friendly jammer that is trying to degrade the signal quality at the eavesdropper and as a source of energy to power up the IoT device via simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) to address the limited power available to it. We formulate an average secrecy rate maximization problem, which jointly optimizes the AP and UAV transmission powers, the UAV trajectory, IOS phase shifts and power splitting factor. The formulated problem is non-convex, therefore we exploit successive convex approximation (SCA) to tackle this issue. Simulation results show that the iterative SCA solution converges rapidly. Besides, the proposed scheme outperforms the traditional system without IOS by a gap of 140% in terms of the secrecy capacity.

AB Predicting lane change maneuvers is critical for autonomous vehicles and traffic management as lane change may cause conflict in traffic flow. Most existing studies do not consider the effect of traffic context (i.e., traffic level and vehicle type) on lane change maneuvers. Therefore, these models cannot adapt to different traffic environments. This study aims to address this problem and establish an integrated lane change prediction model incorporating traffic context using machine learning algorithms. In addition, lane change decisions and lane change trajectories are both predicted to capture the whole process, which have been less studied. The framework of the proposed model contains two parts: the traffic context classification model, which is used to predict traffic level and vehicle type, and the integrated lane change prediction model, which is used to predict lane change decision with XGBoost and lane change trajectories with LSTM incorporating context information. Instead of considering lane change, we establish trajectory prediction models for left lane change and right lane change, further improving the prediction accuracy. The naturalistic trajectories of the highD dataset are used to train and validate the model. The results show that the proposed model improves the accuracy from 97.02% to 98.20% when predicting lane change decision that incorporate traffic context. In addition, the MSE decreases from 11.21 to 6.62 when predicting trajectories. The proposed models are also validated on NGSIM dataset, proving the adaptability of the model. The proposed model can be applied to different environments to reduce collision risks caused by lane change maneuvers and improve traffic management and driving safety.

AB Grant-free non-coherent index-modulation (NC-IM) has been recently considered as an efficient massive access scheme for enabling cost- and energy-limited Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices that transmit small data packets. This paper investigates the grant-free NC-IM scheme combined with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing for applicant to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based massive IoT access. Specifically, each device is assigned a unique non-orthogonal signature sequence codebook. Each active device transmits one of its signature sequences in the given time-frequency resources, by modulating the information in the index of the transmitted signature sequence. For small-scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) deployed at the UAV-based aerial base station (BS), by jointly exploiting the space-time-frequency domain device activity, we propose a computationally efficient space-time-frequency joint activity and blind information detection (JABID) algorithm with significantly improved detection performance. Furthermore, for large-scale MIMO deployed at the aerial BS, by leveraging the sparsity of the virtual angular-domain channels, we propose an angular-domain based JABID algorithm for improving the system performance with reduced access latency. In addition, for the case of high mobility IoT devices and/or UAVs, we introduce a time-frequency spread transmission (TFST) strategy for the proposed JABID algorithms to combat doubly-selective fading channels. Finally, extensive simulation results are illustrated to verify the superiority of the proposed algorithms and the TFST strategy over known state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB Naturalistic driving data (NDD) can help understand drivers' reactions to each driving scenario and provide personalized context to driving behavior. However, NDD requires a high amount of manual labor to label certain driver's state and behavioral patterns. Unsupervised analysis of NDD can be used to automatically detect different patterns from the driver and vehicle data. In this paper, we propose a methodology to understand changes in driver's physiological responses within different driving patterns. Our methodology first decomposes a driving scenario by using a Bayesian Change Point detection model. We then apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation method on both driver state and behavior data to detect patterns. We present two case studies in which vehicles were equipped to collect exterior, interior, and driver behavioral data. Four patterns of driving behaviors (i.e., harsh brake, normal brake, curved driving, and highway driving), as well as two patterns of driver's heart rate (HR) (i.e., normal vs. abnormal high HR), and gaze entropy (i.e., low versus high), were detected in these two case studies. The findings of these case studies indicated that among our participants, the drivers' HR had a higher fraction of abnormal patterns during harsh brakes, accelerating and curved driving. Additionally, free-flow driving with close to zero accelerations on the highway was accompanied by more fraction of normal HR as well as a lower gaze entropy pattern. With the proposed methodology we can better understand variations in driver's psychophysiological states within different driving scenarios. The findings of this work, has the potential to guide future autonomous vehicles to take actions that are fit to each specific driver.

ID UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE
AB Multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, are increasingly being used to spray liquid pesticides to control emerging pest infestations in field crops. In recent years, UAVs have been used to release predatory mites and other natural enemies to optimise and promote sustainable pest management practices by relying less on conventional insecticides. Drone dispensed samples of predatory mites are typically mixed with a granular material, vermiculite, which serves as a filler. The low density of the vermiculite and weather conditions (mainly wind), influences the distribution pattern of predatory mites when delivered by a UAV-based system. The purpose of this paper is to present a data driven methodology to develop a mathematical model that can be used to optimise UAV-based autonomous dispensing of predatory mites. The model characterises the distribution of vermiculite as a function of wind speed and direction, and the UAVs altitude and forward speed. The model is constructed by first conducting outdoor experiments and then using machine-learning techniques on the collected data. The constructed model produced an average generalisation error of 12.8%, RMSE. Due to its parametric and predictive nature, the model is amenable for the future design of UAV flight controllers that can compensate for the targeting error caused by wind. The proposed modelling methodology could be useful not only for the dispensing of predatory mites, but also for other UAV dispensing applications, such as liquid or granular pesticide deliveries.

AB Connected and automated (self-driving) vehicles (CAVs and AVs) will soon become a viable mode option, though their exact pattern of adoption and use is expected to vary based on consumer interests and concerns about the technology. Past work has shown the rate at which AVs are implemented depends on several factors, such as individual and household demographics and technology costs (Bansal and Kockelman, 2017; Lee et al., 2017; Daziano et al., 2017). This research analyzes another group of attributes that help predict how people will purchase and use AVs: land use characteristics.
   Here, the results of two large-scale preference surveys are used to estimate how land use characteristics impact Americans' perceptions of, interest in, and willingness to pay for AV technology, while controlling for demographic attributes. Both surveys were conducted in 2017 and together represented over 4000 U.S. households.
   Statistical models like the ordered probit and multinomial logit are used to estimate the impacts of demographics and land use characteristics on AV-related behavior. Various land use variables arise as significant depending on the question being asked of the respondents. For example, poor job accessibility via automobile is associated with higher levels of interest in AVs, higher anticipated use of AV technology, a willingness-to-pay (WTP) for self-driving capability, and a greater reliance on AVs for some long-distance travel.
   This research provides metrics of practical (and statistical) significance of a suite of land use variables, relative to common demographic predictors, to identify for planners, engineers, policymakers, and others where the most rapid AV deployments will occur first.

AB Recently, more and more research has been done on micro air vehicles (MAVs). An autonomous flight control system is necessary for developing practical MAVs to be used for a wide array of missions. Due to the limitations of size, weight, and power, MAVs have the very low payload capacity and moments of inertia. The current technologies with rate and acceleration sensors applied on larger aircrafts are impractical to MAVs, and they are difficult to be scaled down to satisfy the demands of MAVs. Since surveillance has been considered as the primary mission of MAVs, it is essential for MAVs to be equipped with on-board imaging sensors such as cameras, which have rich information content. So vision-based techniques, without increasing the MAVs payload, may be a feasible idea for flight autonomy of MAVs. In this paper, a new robust horizon extraction algorithm based on the orientation projection method is proposed, which is the foundation of a vision-based flight control system. The horizon extraction algorithm is effective for both color images and gray images. The horizon can be extracted not only from fine images captured in fair conditions but also from blurred images captured in cloudy, even foggy days. In order to raise the computational speed to meet real-time requirements, the algorithmic optimization is also discussed in the paper, which is timesaving by narrowing the seeking scope of orientations and adopting the table look-up method. According to the orientation and position of the horizon in the image, two important angular attitude parameters for stability and control, the roll angle and the pitch angle, could be calculated. Several experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the algorithm.

AB Objective: Varying driver distraction algorithms were developed using vehicle kinematics and driver gaze data obtained from a camera-based driver monitoring system (DMS).
   Background: Distracted driving characteristics can be difficult to accurately detect due to wide variation in driver behavior across driving environments. The growing availability of information about drivers and their involvement in the driving task increases the opportunity for accurately recognizing attention state.
   Method: A baseline for driver distraction levels was developed using a video feed of 24 separate drivers in varying naturalistic driving conditions. This initial assessment was used to develop four buffer-based algorithms that aimed to determine a driver's real-time attentiveness, via a variety of metrics and combinations thereof.
   Results: Of those tested, the optimal algorithm included ungrouped glance locations and speed. Notably, as an algorithm's performance of detecting very distracted drivers improved, its accuracy for correctly identifying attentive drivers decreased. Conclusion: At a minimum, drivers' gaze position and vehicle speed should be included when designing driver distraction algorithms to delineate between glance patterns observed at high and low speeds. Distraction algorithms should be designed with an understanding of their limitations, including instances in which they may fail to detect distracted drivers, or falsely notify attentive drivers.
   Application: This research adds to the body of knowledge related to driver distraction and contributes to availablemethods to potentially address and reduce occurrences. Machine learning algorithms can build on the data elements discussed to increase distraction detection accuracy using robust artificial intelligence.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) can be supported by multiple isolated sensor networks (MISN) when the connectivity of IoT is constrained by obstacles. Mobile nodes have been used as relays to connect partitioned networks. However, mobile nodes have the problem of not being able to move or moving slowly when encountering obstacles. In order to tackle this issue, three types of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm modes are proposed, and UAV swarm assisted connectivity enhancement algorithms (UsCE) are designed. A UAV swarm with high degree of freedom and flexibility provides a new way in IoT for solving the above connectivity problem. Our target is to find an optimal solution that minimizes the number of UAVs in the swarm and maximizes the connection time of MISN. We divide the working modes of a UAV swarm into hovering and flying. Firstly, the ground sink nodes are classified by a MISN's sink node classification algorithm to generate hovering points for the UAV swarm. Secondly, the results are optimized and adjusted by a minimum UAV swarm hovering connection algorithm to obtain an optimal solution under the hovering mode. Finally, we achieve an optimal connectivity when the UAV swarm works in flying mode through the UAV swarm flight connectivity algorithm and compare it with two previously proposed algorithms. Simulation results show that the complexity of the algorithms is low, the connection time of MISN increases significantly, and the number of UAVs is small. An optimal UAV swarm assisted connectivity enhancement scheme for MISN of different scales is derived.

TI Magnetometer Calibration for Portable Navigation Devices in Vehicles
   Using a Fast and Autonomous Technique

ID MAGNETIC-FIELD
AB Using absolute navigation systems (such as global navigation satellite systems) has proved to be insufficient for indoor navigation or when navigating in urban canyons due to multipath and obstruction. This opened the gate widely for sensor-based navigation systems to be used, particularly after the development of low-cost microelectromechanical system sensors. Heading determination is one of the most important aspects for navigation solutions. Magnetometer is a low-cost sensor that can provide an absolute heading from magnetic north by sensing the Earth's magnetic field. Magnetometer readings are usually affected by magnetic fields, other than the Earth's magnetic field, and by other error sources; therefore, magnetometer calibration is required. In this paper, a technique is proposed for fast and automatic magnetometer calibration that requires small space coverage. There is no user involvement in the calibration process, and there are no required specific movements. The proposed technique performs 3-D-space magnetometer calibration using 2-D calibration equations with pitch and roll sectors. The 3-D-space is divided into a group of pitch and roll sectors. Inside each sector, 2-D calibration can be performed for the leveled magnetometer readings, which make the calibration process faster and requiring less data. This technique makes the magnetometer useful for determining heading in pseudo-tethered devices, particularly when used while driving. Pseudo-tethered navigation devices are tethered at normal operation, but they can change their orientation according to user needs such as portable vehicle navigation devices, which can be placed on the dashboard of a vehicle or attached to the wind shield.

TI An omni-directional model of injury risk in planar crashes with
   application for autonomous vehicles
SO TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Automated driving systems; injury risk function; NASS-CDS; CISS
AB Objective: Automated driving systems (ADS) are actively being deployed within the driving fleet. ADS are designed to safely navigate roadways, which entails an expectation of encountering varying degrees of potential conflict with other road users. The ADS design and evaluation process benefits from estimating injury severity probabilities for collisions that may occur. Current regression models in the literature are typically bespoke analyses involving targeted principal directions of force (PDOFs) and occupant positions. It is preferable to rely on injury severity models derived from a single source to provide a continuous function of risk for all planar collisions, while also accounting for specific vehicle and occupant characteristics. The novel feature of the proposed models is continuous, parametric injury risk surfaces that encompass the full spectrum of available United States field data. Methods: We used years 2001-2015 of the National Automotive Sampling System, Crashworthiness Data System (NASS-CDS) and years 2017-2019 of the Crash Investigation Sampling System (CISS) to estimate injury risk at the maximum abbreviated injury scale (MAIS) 3 and higher (3+) and 5 and higher (5+) levels for all adult occupants traveling in 2002 or newer passenger vehicles which were less than 10 years old at the time of the crash. The models account for occupant, vehicle, and crash characteristics. Interactions with vulnerable road users (e.g., pedestrian, bicyclist) were not considered. Results: We present statistical models suitable to predict injury in all non-rollover crashes at the maximum MAIS3+ and 5+ levels, and show that these models can be comparable to similar single scenario (e.g., frontal) crash models. We discuss challenges with imputing missing field data, and discuss handling of covariates that may not be known at the time of the crash. Conclusions: Collision severity assessment is a vital component of the ADS design process. We developed a novel injury risk function that can assess occupant injury risks across the spectrum of foreseeable planar collisions. These models can provide insight on potential outcomes of counterfactual simulations, injury risk and crashworthiness considerations for human driven vehicles, and provide an evaluation tool that can be applied in ADS safety impact evaluation.

AB In this article, we investigate the content transmission in a heavy-crowded multiple access cellular network, whose data traffic is offloaded through the combination of edge caching and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication. In this context, we formulate a novel optimization problem, which minimizes the sum content acquisition delay of users by optimizing the multiuser association and cache placement jointly with UAV trajectory and transmission power over a given flight duration. However, due to the uncertainty of the environment (e.g., random content requests and dynamic UAV positions), it is often difficult and impractical to solve the formulated problem using conventional optimization methods. To this end, we model our problem as a partially observable stochastic game where the macro base station (MBS) and UAVs act as agents to collectively interact with the environment to receive distinctive observations. Moreover, we take advantage of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) learning strategy and propose a novel Dual-Clip PPO-based algorithm to solve the converted problem. To guide agent exploration, a new exploration criterion is proposed in which each UAV agent can obtain an intrinsic reward when it explores beyond the boundary of explored regions (BeBold). Note that the MBS agent has the extrinsic reward given by the environment only. Numerical results reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms the standard PPO-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Moreover, the proposed joint design scheme can achieve a dramatic reduction of content acquisition delay compared with the benchmark schemes.

AB Speed harmonization is an active traffic management strategy used to delay traffic flow breakdown and mitigate congestion by changing speed limits throughout a road segment based on prevailing traffic, weather, and road conditions. Traditional implementations rely on fixed roadway sensors to collect traffic information and variable speed signs at fixed locations to display updated speeds. Moreover, most implementations use a reactive rule-based decision tree to activate the control strategy. This set-up faces three challenges: 1) fixed infrastructure sensors provide an incomplete picture of traffic flow dynamics throughout the segment which can reduce the effectiveness of the strategy, 2) the limited set of scenarios in which speed control can be applied given the reliance on fixed road sensors and signs, significantly affecting performance, and 3) the difficulty in predicting future traffic state using data from fixed traffic sensors. To overcome these challenges, this paper puts forward a predictive speed harmonization system that uses the detailed vehicle trajectories broadcast by connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and machine learning techniques to predict the location of traffic congestion. The system relies on a traffic management center (TMC) to collect data from CAVs within a road segment, predict traffic congestion, and broadcast updated speed limits to CAVs to mitigate congestion. Furthermore, the system introduces an optimization-based formulation for speed control to maximize performance. Case studies of multiple operational scenarios show that the proposed speed harmonization system can reduce the severity and length of traffic shockwaves, improve overall traffic stability, increase overall speed, and reduce travel time.

AB Cooperative perception (a.k.a. Collective perception or cooperative sensing) will allow Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) to share information about detected objects. Cooperative perception improves the sensing accuracy, confidence and range of CAVs, and extends their perception of the driving environment. First message generation rules based on the mobility and dynamics of detected objects have been proposed to decide when a cooperative perception message should be generated and what information it should include. Studies have shown that this type of generation rules can compromise the scalability of cooperative perception and vehicular networks, as they tend to transmit significant amounts of redundant information and generate small and frequent cooperative perception messages that increase the communications overhead. To combat these inefficiencies, this paper proposes and evaluates three techniques that combine, for the first time, baseline mobility-based generation rules for cooperative perception messages with mechanisms to control the redundancy and organize the information about detected objects in order to avoid the frequent transmission of small messages. This study demonstrates that the proposed techniques improve the perception of CAVs and reduce the information age. In addition, the techniques reduce the channel load and improve the scalability of cooperative perception services and vehicular networks. The study demonstrates that the most effective technique is based on: (1) first applying the generation rules to decide whether a cooperative perception message should be generated, (2) then applying redundancy control, and finally (3) organizing the information about all detected objects to avoid small and frequent messages.

AB The deployment flexibility and maneuverability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) increased their adoption in various applications, such as wildfire tracking, border monitoring, etc. In many critical applications, UAVs capture images and other sensory data and then send the captured data to remote servers for inference and data processing tasks. However, this approach is not always practical in real-time applications due to the connection instability, limited bandwidth, and end-to-end latency. One promising solution is to divide the inference requests into multiple parts (layers or segments), with each part being executed in a different UAV based on the available resources. Furthermore, some applications require the UAVs to traverse certain areas and capture incidents; thus, planning their paths becomes critical particularly, to reduce the latency of making the collaborative inference process. Specifically, planning the UAVs trajectory can reduce the data transmission latency by communicating with devices in the same proximity while mitigating the transmission interference. This work aims to design a model for distributed collaborative inference requests and path planning in a UAV swarm while respecting the resource constraints due to the computational load and memory usage of the inference requests. The model is formulated as an optimization problem and aims to minimize latency. The formulated problem is NP-hard so finding the optimal solution is quite complex; thus, this article introduces a real-time and dynamic solution for online applications using deep reinforcement learning. We conduct extensive simulations and compare our results to the state-of-the-art studies demonstrating that our model outperforms the competing models.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) systems have been implemented for over a decade, from transportation to military surveillance, and is proven worthy of integration in the next generation of wireless protocols. Though UAVs have immense potential, they have major drawbacks when it comes to real-world implementation, such as energy capacity, loss of signal quality, and spectrum limitations. To overcome these challenges, integration of UAVs with spectrum-efficient techniques, including cognitive radio (CR) and nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been proposed. In this article, we incorporate transmit-antenna selection (TAS) into an underlay cognitive radio NOMA network, which provides additional benefits through employing multiple-antenna-selection approach at the UAV with the goal of better serving the ground NOMA devices. The links associated with the multiantenna UAV are theoretically assumed to experience Nakagami- $m$ fading distribution. We also emphasize the degraded performance caused by imperfect successive interference cancelation (SIC) when decoding signals at the ground NOMA devices. The closed-form expressions for the proposed model are derived to evaluate two main performance metrics, namely, the outage probability and the ergodic capacity. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to analyze the performance of the system in different scenarios. We observe that the power allocation factors for the devices in a group and the altitude of UAV have a noticeable impact on the performance of the system. Furthermore, the increase in the number of antennas at the UAV can complement these effects and further improve the system performance.

AB The SOTA methods proposed voxelization or pillarization to regularize unordered point clouds, improving computing efficiency for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. However, they usually trade partial accuracy for speed. Thus, we bring up a new problem setting: "Is it possible to keep high detection accuracy while point-cloud quantization is applied?". To this end, we found that the inconsistent sparsity of the point cloud over the depth distance, which is still an open question, might be the main reason. To address the inconsistency effect, we first proposed a new pillar-based vehicle detection model, named SVDnet, in which novel plug-ins are introduced in its backbone and neck. Specifically, a novel low-rank objective is designed to force the backbone to extract distance/sparsity-aware features and suppress the other feature variations among vehicle samples. Next, we alleviated the remaining feature inconsistency resulting from distance/sparsity in the neck by dynamic feature selection and adaptive feature fusion. Here, feature selection is realized by a position attention network, while feature fusion is achieved by a Distance Alignment Ratio-generation Network (DARN). Later, the selected and fused features, less sensitive to sparsity, are concatenated and fed to an SSD-like detection head. Besides, we also integrate the proposed plug-ins with multiple pillar/voxel-based methods for performance boosting. Our evaluation shows that SVDnet improves the average precision of the distant cases by 8.11% with only 0.23 milliseconds speed drop compared with PointPillars. Furthermore, the extensional results validate that our plug-ins can help SOTA pillar/voxel-based methods to gain noticeable improvement, especially for far-range objects.

AB This study explores the aging population's behavior toward the adoption of and willingness to pay (WTP) for autonomous vehicles (AVs), with a focus on the roles of attitudes and land use variables. A structural equation model with interaction effects was developed to explore the impacts of socioeconomic and demographic attributes, mobility profiles, attitudes collected through a user behavior survey, and land use variables extracted from the Smart Location database. Among different structures tested, a direct causal effect from adoption to WTP shows the best model fit, implying that any parameter affecting the adoption will indirectly affect WTP in the same direction. Focusing on the older population, the model results show that they were positively affected by their interest in driving assistance and safety features. Older adults also seemed to be more sensitive to mobility costs compared with younger travelers. We further explored the impact of land use characteristics. In general, it appears that living in areas associated with higher population density and higher centrality index (based on auto accessibility) tends to lower AV adoption rates. Comparing the older population with younger people, no significant difference was observed in view of land use impacts on AV adoption. However, the older population's WTP tends to increase in urban areas with higher roadway network densities (e.g., urban areas) and is likely to decrease in neighborhoods with higher employment density and higher percentage of single-vehicle households. We suggest that the latter effect might be associated with other micro-level attributes such as their income and lifestyle patterns.

AB This article puts forth an aerial edge Internet of Things (EdgeIoT) system, where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is employed as a mobile-edge server to process mission-critical computation tasks of ground Internet of Things (IoT) devices. When the UAV schedules an IoT device to offload its computation task, the tasks buffered at the other unselected devices could be outdated and have to be canceled. We investigate a new joint optimization of UAV cruise control and task offloading allocation, which maximizes tasks offloaded to the UAV, subject to the IoT device's computation capacity and battery budget, and the UAV's speed limit. Since the optimization contains a large solution space while the instantaneous network states are unknown to the UAV, we propose a new deep-graph-based reinforcement learning framework. An advantage actor-critic (A2C) structure is developed to train the real-time continuous actions of the UAV in terms of the flight speed, heading, and the offloading schedule of the IoT device. By exploring hidden representations resulting from the network feature correlation, our framework takes advantage of graph neural networks (GNNs) to supervise the training of UAV's actions in A2C. The proposed graph neural network-enabled A2C (GNN-A2C) framework is implemented with Google Tensorflow. The performance analysis shows that GNN-A2C achieves fast convergence and reduces considerably the task missing rate in aerial EdgeIoT.

AB Automatic recovery is an important step in enabling fully autonomous missions using fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating from ships or other moving platforms. However, automatic recovery in moving arrest systems is only briefly studied in the research literature, and is not yet an option when using low-cost, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) autopilots. Acknowledging the reliability and low cost of COTS avionics, this paper adds recovery functionality as a modular extension based on non-intrusive additions to an autopilot with very general assumptions on its interface. This is achieved by line-of-sight guidance, which sends an augmented desired position to the autopilot, to ensure line-following along a virtual runway that guides the UAV into the arrest system. The translation and rotation of this line is determined by the pose of the arrest system, determined using two Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, where one is configured as a Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) base station. The relative position of the UAV and arrest system is also precisely estimated using RTK GNSS. Through extensive field testing, on two different fixed-wing UAVs, the system has shown its performance and reliability; 43 recovery attempts in a stationary net hit 0.01 +/- 0.25m to the right and 0.07 +/- 0.20m below the target in calm conditions. Further, 15 recoveries in a barge-mounted, ship-towed net hit 0.06 +/- 0.53m to the right and 0.98 +/- 0.27m below the target in winds up to 4 m/s. The remaining error is largely systematic, caused by communication delays, and could be reduced with more integral effect or through direct compensation.

AB Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles work seamlessly within the GPS signal range, but their performance deteriorates in GPS-denied regions. This paper presents a unique collaborative computer vision-based approach for target tracking as per the image's specific location of interest. The proposed method tracks any object without considering its properties like shape, color, size, or pattern. It is required to keep the target visible and line of sight during the tracking. The method gives freedom of selection to a user to track any target from the image and form a formation around it. We calculate the parameters like distance and angle from the image center to the object for the individual drones. Among all the drones, the one with a significant GPS signal strength or nearer to the target is chosen as the master drone to calculate the relative angle and distance between an object and other drones considering approximate Geo-location. Compared to actual measurements, the results of tests done on a quadrotor UAV frame achieve 99% location accuracy in a robust environment inside the exact GPS longitude and latitude block as GPS-only navigation methods. The individual drones communicate to the ground station through a telemetry link. The master drone calculates the parameters using data collected at ground stations. Various formation flying methods help escort other drones to meet the desired objective with a single high-resolution first-person view (FPV) camera. The proposed method is tested for Airborne Object Target Tracking (AOT) aerial vehicle model and achieves higher tracking accuracy.

AB Using the frequency-division duplex long-term evolution (LTE)-based multistatic passive radar system for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) detection is considered. The typical outdoor terrestrial LTE eNodeBs and the broadband direct air-to-ground communications network eNodeBs are used to cover the UAVs at the low altitude and at the medium-high altitude, respectively. The bistatic range measurements are obtained from multiple eNodeBs, and the hyperbolic positioning technique is used for target localisation. Since the existing LTE downlink signals are more suitable for the transmission of the communication data rather than target detection, a new LTE downlink signal feature termed as target localisation reference signals (TLRS) is designed exclusively for the passive radar application using the Costas frequency coding and the P4 phase coding. Compared with the existing LTE downlink signal features, the TLRS have better waveform properties and could potentially provide much higher target detection accuracy. Meanwhile, the TLRS occupy only 0.266% LTE downlink time-frequency resources within a time frame of 1 s when the bandwidth is 10 MHz and have no negative impact on the normal LTE downlink data transmission.

ID SEQUENTIAL MONTE-CARLO; PARTICLE FILTER
AB Particle Filters (PFs) have been successfully used in three-dimensional (3D) model-based pose estimation. Typically, these filters depend on the computation of importance weights that use similarity metrics as a proxy to approximate the likelihood function. In this paper, we explore the use of a two-stage 3D model-based approach based on a PF for single-frame pose estimation. First, we use a classifier trained in a synthetic data set for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) detection and a pretrained database indexed by bounding boxes properties to obtain an initial rough pose estimate. Second, we employ optimization algorithms to optimize the used similarity metrics and decrease the obtained error. We have tested four different algorithms: (a) Particle Filter Optimization (PFO), (b) Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), (c) modified PSO, and (d) an approach based on the evolution strategies present in the genetic algorithms named Genetic Algorithm-based Framework (GAbF). To check the quality of the estimate on each iteration, we have tested several similarity metrics (color, edge, and mask-based) based on the UAV Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model. The framework is applied to the outdoor pose estimation of a fixed-wing UAV for autonomous landing in a Fast Patrol Boat (FPB). We extend our previous approach by adopting a better problem formulation, using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for UAV detection, making the comparison between the used similarity metrics, comparing pose optimization schemes, and showing new results. The future work will focus on the inclusion of this scheme in a tracking architecture to increase the accuracy of the result between observations.

AB Recently, the millimeter-wave band has been used in outdoor wireless communications to improve the frequency utilization efficiency. In this study, we propose a method to realize line-of-sight multiple-input multiple-output (LOS-MIMO) transmission independent of the transmitted distance using a two-dimensional (2-D) fixed antenna element arrangement, assuming millimeter-wave-band communication by small autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles. In conventional LOS-MIMO transmission with uniformly spaced antenna elements, the theoretical upper bound of the channel capacity is obtained, which decreases at a certain transmitted distance. Therefore, we focus on the fact that the propagation channel characteristics in pure LOS are geometrically determined by the transmitted distance, and consider the optimization of the arrangement of antenna elements. The element arrangement is fixed without using antenna selection from the viewpoint of system simplification. In addition, from the viewpoint of array size, we study the optimization corresponding to a 2-D element arrangement. The proposed method approximates the optimal arrangement from a vast number of 2-D element arrangements using a genetic algorithm. We evaluate the channel capacity characteristics of the proposed method by computer simulation and show that the characteristic degradation due to change in the transmitted distance in conventional LOS-MIMO transmission is improved. In addition, we evaluate a 4 x 4 MIMO transmission in an outdoor environment. The 4 x 4 MIMO propagation channel is also measured by an actual measurement equipment in the 66-GHz band and it is shown that the measured and calculated results agree with each other.

AB In the last 20 years car sharing has been a growing trend in personal mobility. Multiple aspects of these systems have been already discussed: different forms of car sharing, users preferences and behavior, or benefits estimation. Nevertheless, the management of these systems needs to be continuously improved to remain a competitive alternative. In this work, we propose a reservation scheme to manage rental reservations of a two-way station-based car sharing system. It allows the operator to better plan the necessary vehicles at each station, and encourages the drivers to make better use of the existing vehicles, by showing flexibility in the starting rental time. The reservation scheme is organized with an auction, where drivers bet for their preferred rental start time. Drivers participating in the auction are offered a reduced rental fare, which is then complemented with the reservation fee that results from the auction. The auction is solved under Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism for combinatorial auctions, which guarantees the desired properties for the operator and a fair assignment for the drivers. The proposed scheme is tested on instances inspired by the Mobility car sharing system in Zrich, Switzerland. The results show that operators could decrease their fleets with low to no impacts on the overall rental revenues, especially when drivers show flexibility in their rental start times. For certain levels of demand price elasticity, even positive impacts on the overall rental revenues can be expected. Moreover, reservation fees are proven to partially compensate for the decrease in rental revenues provided to the auction users.

AB Robust, scalable simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms support the successful deployment of robots in real-world applications. In many cases these platforms deliver vast amounts of sensor data from large-scale, unstructured environments. These data may be difficult to interpret by end users without further processing and Suitable visualization tools. We present a robust, automated system for large-scale three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and visualization that takes stereo imagery from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and SLAM-based vehicle poses to deliver detailed 3D models of the seafloor in the form of textured polygonal meshes. Our system must cope with thousands of images, lighting conditions that create visual seams when texturing, and possible inconsistencies between stereo meshes arising from errors in calibration, triangulation, and navigation. Our approach breaks down the problem into manageable stages by first estimating local structure and then combining these estimates to recover a composite georeferenced structure using SLAM-based vehicle pose estimates. A texture-mapped surface at multiple scales is then generated that is interactively presented to the user through a Visualization engine. We adapt established solutions when possible, with an emphasis on quickly delivering approximate yet visually consistent reconstructions on standard computing hardware. This allows scientists oil a research cruise to use our system to design follow-up deployments of the AUV and complementary instruments. To date, this system has been tested on several research cruises in Australian waters and has been used to reliably generate and visualize reconstructions for more than 60 dives covering diverse habitats and representing hundreds of linear kilometers of survey.

AB Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technique that smartly reshapes wireless propagation environment in the future wireless networks. In this paper, we apply RIS to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network, in which the transmit signals from multiple UAVs to ground users are strengthened through RIS. Our objective is to minimize the power consumption of the system while meeting the constraints of minimum data rate for users and minimum inter-UAV distance. The formulated optimization problem is non-convex by jointly optimizing the position of UAVs, RIS reflection coefficients, transmit power, active beamforming vectors and decoding order, and thus is quite hard to solve optimally. To tackle this problem, we divide the resultant optimization problem into four independent subproblems, and solve them in an iterative manner. In particular, we first consider the sub-solution of UAVs placement which can be obtained via the successive convex approximation (SCA) and maximum ratio transmission (MRT). By applying the Gaussian randomization procedure, we yield the closed-form expression for the RIS reflection coefficients. Subsequently, the transmit power is optimized using standard convex optimization methods. Finally, a dynamic-order decoding scheme is presented for optimizing the NOMA decoding order in order to guarantee fairness among users. Simulation results verify that our designed joint UAV deployment and resource allocation scheme can effectively reduce the total power consumption compared to the benchmark methods, thus verifying the advantages of combining RIS into the multi-UAV assisted NOMA networks.

AB Robotic systems usually evolve on manifolds, which are often overparameterized or minimally parameterized (but with singularities) in model predictive control (MPC). How to naturally incorporate the system manifold constraints without overparameterization or singularity is a fundamental problem when deploying MPC on robotic systems. In this article, we propose a unified on-manifold MPC framework to address this issue. This framework first formulates the MPC based on a canonical representation of on-manifold systems. Then, the on-manifold MPC is solved by linearizing the system at each point along the trajectory under tracking. There are two main advantages of the proposed scheme. First, the linearized system leads to an equivalent error system represented by local coordinates without singularities. Second, the process of system modeling, error-system derivation, linearization, and control has the manifold constraints completely decoupled from the system descriptions, enabling us to develop a symbolic MPC framework naturally encapsulating the manifold constraints. In this framework, one needs only to supply system-specific descriptions without dealing with the manifold constraints. To validate the generality of the proposed framework, we implement it on two different robotic platforms, a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) evolving on a Lie group, and an unmanned ground vehicle moving on curved surface with a non-Lie group structure. To validate the nonsingularity and tracking performance, we test it in tracking aggressive UAV trajectories. Experimental results show that with a single, global on-manifold MPC, the quadrotor tracks highly aggressive trajectories with large actuator efforts and attitude variation (360 degrees) in both roll and pitch directions.

AB With the help of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), remote terminals that out of wireless coverage can be connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Currently, the IoT relies on a large number of low-cost wireless sensors with limited energy supply to realize ubiquitous monitoring and intelligent control. The hybrid-powered networks composed of wireless-powered communication (WPC) terminal and solar-powered UAV can solve the energy supply problem of the IoT networks, and the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique can solve the massive access problem of IoT terminals. Exploiting these benefits, we investigate joint UAV 3-D trajectory design and time allocation for aerial data collection in hybrid-powered NOMA-IoT networks. To maximize the total fair network throughput, we jointly consider energy limitation, Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, and flight conditions. The problem is nonconvex and time-dimension coupled which is intractable to solve by traditional optimization methods. Therefore, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm called fair communication is accomplished by trajectory design and time allocation (FC-TDTA), which uses the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) as its basis. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm performs better than benchmarks in fair throughput maximization. The proposed FC-TDTA algorithm can make the UAV: 1) fly in appropriate direction and speed, so that the UAV can arrive at the charging station before the energy runs out and 2) conduct WPC energy transmission and data collection to achieve fair communication.

AB In recent years, control design for unmanned systems, especially a tractor-trailer system, has gained popularity among researchers. The emergence of such interest is caused by the potential reduction in cost and shortage of number of workers and labors. Two industries will benefit from the advancements of these types of systems: agriculture and cargo. By using the unmanned tractor-trailer system, harvesting and cultivating plants will become a safe and easy task. It will also cause a reduction in cost which in turn reduces the price on the end consumers. On the other hand, by using the unmanned tractor-trailer system in the cargo industry, shipping cost and time for the item delivery will be reduced. The work presented in this paper focuses on the development of a path tracking and a cascaded controller to control a tractor-trailer in reverse motion. The path tracking controller utilizes the Frenet-Serret frame to control the kinematics of the tractor-trailer system on a desired path, while the cascade controller's main objective is to stabilize the system and to perform commands issued by the path tracker. The controlled parameters in this proposed design are the lateral distance to a path, trailer's heading angel, articulated angel, and articulated angle's rate. The main goal of such controller is to follow a path while the tractor-trailer system is moving in reverse and controlling the stability of the articulated vehicle to prevent the occurrence of a jackknife incident (uncontrolled state). The proposed controller has been tested in a different scenario where a successful implementation has been shown.

AB Ensuring safer mobility for evacuee drivers during a hurricane evacuation has always been a major concern for traffic managers. That concern has grown further, particularly after recent hurricanes, which forced millions of people to evacuate, causing significant congestion and a high number of traffic crashes. Though several strategies have been deployed to manage the heavy traffic demand during a hurricane evacuation, current approaches seem to have less impact on traffic safety. In a situation where people are ordered to evacuate to a safer place involving long hours of driving, perception related errors are inevitable. In such conditions, advanced driving assistance system or vehicle automation can have a positive impact. In this study, we assess the safety impact of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems during an evacuation. We develop a microscopic simulation model of evacuation traffic in SUMO and calibrate it using real-world traffic data collected during the evacuation period of hurricane Irma for a segment in the Interstate highway in Florida. To evaluate the safety impact of ACC systems, we adopt two surrogate measures: time to collision (TTC) and deceleration rate to avoid a collision (DRAC). Our simulation experiments show that, during the evacuation, about 49.7% of traffic collisions can be reduced at a 25% market penetration of ACC equipped vehicles. Our result has potential implications for hurricane evacuation management since a modest decrease in the number of crashes can help reduce the massive delays most commonly experienced during a major evacuation.

AB The revolutionary changes in automotive industry toward fully connected automated electrical vehicles necessitate developments in automotive electronics at unprecedented speed. Signal, control, and power electronics will heterogeneously be integrated at minimum space with sensors and actuators to form highly compact and ultra-smart systems for functions like traction, lighting, energy management, computation, and communication. Most of these systems will be highly safety relevant with the requirements in system availability exceeding today's already high automotive standards. Unlike the human drivers of today, passengers in the automated car do not pay constant attention to the driving actions of the vehicle. Hence, reliability research is massively challenged by the new automotive applications. Guaranteeing the specified lifetime at statistical average is no longer sufficient. Assuring that no failure of an individual safety relevant part occurs unexpectedly becomes most important. The paper surveys the priority actions underway to cope with the tremendous challenges. It highlights practical examples in all three directions of reliability research: (i) Experimental reliability tests and physical analyses: New and highly efficient accelerated stress tests are able to cover the complex and multifold loading situation in the field. New analytics techniques can identify the typical failure modes and their physical root causes; (ii) Virtual techniques: Schemes of validated simulations allow capturing the physics of failure (PoF) proactively in the design for reliability (DfR) process; and (iii) Prognostics health management (PHM). A new concept is introduced for adding a minimum of PHM features at various levels of automotive electronics to provide functional safety as required for autonomous vehicles. This way, the new generation of reliability methods will continuously provide estimates of the remaining useful life (RUL) for each relevant part under the actual use conditions to allow triggering maintenance in time

AB Recently, many exciting usage scenarios and groundbreaking technologies for sixth generation (6G) networks have drawn more and more attention. The revolution of 6G mainly lies in ubiquitous intelligence, which promotes the development of edge intelligence (EI) by running artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms at the network edge. By embedding training capabilities across the network nodes, federated learning (FL) can achieve high security and alleviate network traffic congestion, which provides a promising way to realize the ubiquitous EI. While traditional FL usually relies static terrestrial base stations (BSs) for the global model aggregation, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could effectively supplement the terrestrial BSs because of their high maneuverability, thereby building the air-ground integrated FL (AGIFL). Nevertheless, how to effectively deploy the UAV and allocate resources to boost the learning performance and achieve high energy efficiency in the AGIFL remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we study how to jointly optimize the UAV location and resource allocation to minimize the incurred cost in terms of two objectives: i) the minimization of terrestrial users' energy consumption; ii) the minimization of tradeoff between energy consumption and training latency. The formulated non-convex problems are efficiently solved by alternating optimization techniques based on successive convex approximation (SCA) approaches after appropriate problem decomposition. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed algorithms can reduce more cost than three benchmarks while guaranteeing the learning accuracy. Furthermore, we construct a real-world AGIFL system, implement the proposed algorithms in the system, and carry out field experiments to verify the superiority of our algorithms.

AB The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has been viewed as a typical application for the fifth generation (5G) mobile networks. This article investigates the energy efficiency (EE) optimization problem for the Device-to-Device (D2D) communications underlaying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted IIoT networks with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). We aim to maximize the EE of the system while satisfying the constraints of transmission rate and transmission power budget. However, the designed EE optimization problem is nonconvex involving joint optimization of the UAV's location, beam pattern, power control, and time scheduling, which is difficult to tackle directly. To solve this problem, we present a joint UAV location and resource allocation algorithm to decouple the original problem into several subproblems and solve them sequentially. Specifically, we first apply the Dinkelbach method to transform the fraction problem to a subtractive-form one and propose a mulitiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D)-based algorithm to optimize the beam pattern. We then optimize UAV's location and power control using the successive convex optimization techniques. Finally, after solving the above variables, the original problem can be transformed into a single-variable problem with respect to the charging time, which is linear and can be tackled directly. Numerical results verify that significant EE gain can be obtained by our proposed algorithm as compared to the benchmark schemes.

AB In this paper, we propose an advanced co-simulation platform that performs the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) simulation and the wireless network simulation concurrently. As UAV-based applications become more advanced and complicated and the commands and data transmitted between UAV and ground control station significantly increase, it is vital to safely and robustly transmit the packets carrying commands and data in a wireless network environment. However, the conventional UAV simulation platforms do not take into account the wireless network conditions encountered in the real-world flight so they cannot sufficiently simulate packet transmission. To address this issue, co-simulation platforms have been developed to verify UAV-based applications under a virtual wireless network environment. However, they still cannot effectively support the co-simulation needed to develop the UAV-based applications. In this paper, we have derived a list of improvements to the conventional co-simulation platform based on analysis of the conventional ones. Based on these improvements, we have developed an advanced co-simulation platform consisting of a UAV simulation part, a wireless network simulation part, and an integration part. In this platform, a two-channel approach was introduced to parallelize the synchronization required for performing the UAV simulation and the wireless network simulation simultaneously. The experimental results carried out on three test scenarios demonstrate that the proposed platform accurately performs co-simulation by efficient interoperation of its three parts and by remarkable reduction of the processing time delay, and that it is extendible due to its modularized software architecture.

AB Automated vehicles (AVs) are a concrete possibility in the near future. As AVs may shift transportation paradigms, transportation agencies are eager to update their models to consider them in planning. In this context, the use of advanced models may be challenging, given the uncertainty in the use and deployment of AVs. In this paper, we present a general framework to extend the four-step model to include AVs, and test our extension on North Central Texas Council of Governments' model. Our approach introduces a module for AV ownership and exogenous parameters into an existing four-step model to account for changes in travel decisions for AV owners, and for the impacts of AVs on network performance. The latter is modeled using the concept of passenger-car-equivalent to avoid imposing network-wide assumptions on AVs' capacity consumption. We analyze five scenarios, representing different assumptions on the impacts of AVs, and include references to inform the selection of modeling parameters. We compute aggregate metrics that suggest that the model is sensitive to the proposed parameters, with the passenger-car-equivalent assumptions having the largest impact on model outcomes. Results suggest that, even when we assume that AVs can better use network capacity and that trip-making rates do not drastically increase, AVs may lead to an increase of about 2.8% in vehicle-hours traveled while also improving speeds by about 1.8%. If AVs introduce additional friction on traffic, the system performance may deteriorate. The analyses presented here suggest that existing modeling tools may be adjusted to support analyses of a future with AVs.

AB Lately, the development and implementation of automated driving moved to the center of interest in the automotive industry. In this context, one of the central issues - the configuration of adequate trajectories - is mainly tackled using a technical approach. However, it appears that a technically ideal driving performance does not necessarily coincide with the drivers' subjective preferences. This study strives to determine thresholds of a subjectively accepted driving performance regarding lateral vehicle control. A second objective is to analyze the influence of selected personal and situational factors on these thresholds. An empirical online survey with 161 participants rating video sequences of driving performances was conducted. The video sequences differed not only with regard to the lateral offset of the ego-vehicle but also concerning the weather (sun/rain) and traffic conditions (existence/driving behavior of oncoming traffic). Additionally, the participants' driving experience and sensation seeking were considered in the data evaluation. To analyze the data, binary logistic regression analyses were calculated. They revealed that the subjective evaluation of driving performances varies primarily depending on the lateral offset of both the ego-vehicle and the oncoming traffic. The results indicate that regarding the lateral offset certain thresholds of subjectively accepted driving performances do exist. Regarding the development of automated driving systems, two issues need to be considered in order to ultimately guarantee user acceptance. First, the subjective thresholds need to be integrated into the systems' trajectory planning. Second, the oncoming traffic's driving behavior has to be considered. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this article, we present a comparative study of two existing deep learning tools that are used in a novel way to detect anomalies in the streamed data of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Detecting anomalies is very vital to predict potential faults that are caused by hardware and software faults and may prevent the UAV from hazardous accidents. Therefore, we suggest using multiple long short-term memory and multioutput convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) to detect anomalies in UAV data. LSTM networks attracted many researchers in several domains, as it is a useful tool for learning dynamic temporal patterns and long-range dependencies in sequential data, which cannot be achieved using traditional neural networks. However, utilizing multiple LSTM networks would result in too much redundancy. The redundancy issue can be solved by incorporating one convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) network with multiple outputs. The ConvLSTM is suitable for analyzing multivariate temporal data; due to its convolutional architecture and the advantage of preserving the benefits of the LSTM networks. We evaluated and compared the two approaches using well-known indicators such as the detection rate, the false alarm rate, the precision, and the F.score indicators. The two methods exhibited promising results in predicting different types of faults, for instance (sensor-impulse and sensor-cut). However, the multioutput ConvLSTM was faster in training and testing phases, and its results were superior in predicting (sensor-stuck and sensor-drift) faults.

AB As the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem evolves, innovative applications with stringent demands with respect to latency will emerge. To handle computation-intensive tasks in a timely manner, data offloading to Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers has been suggested. On the other hand, prospective IoT networks are expected to include Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to enhance coverage and connectivity, while retaining reliable communication links with ground nodes in urban, suburban, and rural terrain. Nevertheless, the evolution of UAV-aided MEC-enabled IoT presupposes the mitigation of security threats through the implementation of efficient and robust countermeasures. As UAVs inherently have certain limitations in terms of energy, computational, and memory resources, designing lightweight security solutions is required. This paper provides an overview of the UAV-aided MEC-enabled IoT and a detailed presentation of use cases and application scenarios, where security is of utmost importance. Subsequently, up-to-date research works on security solutions for the UAV-aided MEC-enabled IoT are comprehensively presented. To this end, the adoption of information-theoretic techniques that ensure adequate Physical-Layer Security (PLS) is discussed along with sophisticated security approaches based on emerging technologies, such as Blockchain and Machine Learning (ML). In addition, research studies on software- and hardware-based methods for the identification and authentication of network nodes are presented. Finally, this paper provides future perspectives in this research domain, stimulating further work.

AB Although automated vehicles (AVs) could offer a potentially effective solution to improving road safety, the benefit associated with AVs can be realized only when the public intend to use them. While some efforts have been made to understand why people would use AVs, few of them have investigated the role of social and personal factors in AV acceptance. The present study aimed to fill in this research gap. An AV acceptance model was proposed by extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with social and personal factors, i.e., initial trust, social influence, and the Big Five personality and sensation seeking traits. The validity of the proposed model was confirmed with a questionnaire survey administrated to 647 drivers in China. Results revealed that at the very beginning of AV commercialization, perception factors (i.e., perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness) from the original TAM showed significant influence on users' intention to use AVs. But more importantly, it was social influence and initial trust that contributed most to explain whether users would accept AVs or not. Some personality traits also played certain roles in AV usage intention. In particular, sensation seekers and those with a higher openness to experience were more likely to trust AVs and had a higher intention to adopt them. In contrast, neurotic people showed a lower level of trust and were less likely to accept AVs. Practically, these findings suggest that promotion of AVs to influential individuals that could help form good social opinions would have significant downstream effects on AV acceptance at the early state of its marketization.

AB In this study, the authors propose a novel three-dimensional (3D) non-stationary geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) and the corresponding deterministic and stochastic simulation models for non-isotropic unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Ricean fading channels. The proposed GBSM employs a two-cylinder model, where the signal is a superposition of line-of-sight component, single-bounced rays around the UAV, single-bounced rays around the ground station (GS), single-bounced rays on the ground, and double-bounced rays. The non-stationarity is reflected on the time-varying angles of departure and angles of arrival. Since the authors consider the GS to be mobile, the proposed 3D GBSM is general and suitable for UAV-aided vehicular communication scenarios. Based on the proposed model, some important channel statistical properties are derived and thoroughly investigated, including the space-time correlation function, Doppler power spectral density, envelope level crossing rate and average fade duration. Moreover, the proposed model has the ability to investigate the influence of some unique UAV-related parameters on channel characteristics and non-stationarity. Finally, excellent agreement is achieved between the reference model and simulation models, demonstrating the feasibility of simulation models as well as the correctness of theoretical derivations.
