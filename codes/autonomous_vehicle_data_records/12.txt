AB Communication between road users is a major key to coordinate movement and increase roadway safety. The aim of this work was to grasp how pedestrians (Experiment A), cyclists (Experiment B), and kick scooter users (Experiment C) sought to visually communicate with drivengers when they would face autonomous vehicles (AVs). In each experiment, participants (n = 462, n = 279, and n = 202, respectively) were asked to imagine themselves in described situations of encounters between a specific type of vulnerable road user (e.g., pedestrian) and a human driver in an approaching car. The human driver state and the communicative means of the approaching car through an external Human-Machine Interface (eHMI) were manipulated between the scenarios. The participants were prompted to rate from "never" to "always" (6-point Likert scale) the frequency with which they would seek eye contact with the human driver either in order to express their willingness to cross or to make their effective decision to cross. Our findings revealed that a passive human driver in an AV with no visual checking on the road triggered a decline in vulnerable road users' desire to communicate by eye contact (Experiments A-C). Moreover, the results of Experiment C demonstrated that the speed screen, the text message screen, and the vibrating mobile app eHMI signals diminished kick scooter users' desire to communicate visually with the human driver, with some age-based differences. This suggested a better comprehension of the approaching car's intentions by the kick scooter users, driven by the features of the eHMI.

AB The increasing accessibility of mobility datasets has enabled research in green mobility, road safety, vehicular automation, and transportation planning and optimization. Many stakeholders have leveraged vehicular datasets to study conventional driving characteristics and self-driving tasks. Notably, many of these datasets have been made publicly available, fostering collaboration, scientific comparability, and replication. As these datasets encompass several study domains and contain distinctive characteristics, selecting the appropriate dataset to investigate driving aspects might be challenging. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper that performs a systematic review of a substantial number of vehicular datasets covering various automation levels. In total, 103 datasets have been reviewed, 35 of which focused on naturalistic driving, and 68 on self-driving tasks. The paper gives researchers the possibility of analyzing the datasets' principal characteristics and their study domains. Most naturalistic datasets have been centered on road safety and driver behavior, although transportation planning and eco-driving have also been studied. Furthermore, datasets for autonomous driving have been analyzed according to their target self-driving tasks. A particular focus has been placed on data-driven risk assessment for the vehicular ecosystem. It is observed that there exists a lack of relevant publicly available datasets that challenge the creation of new risk assessment models for semi- and fully automated vehicles. Therefore, this paper conducts a gap analysis to identify possible approaches using existing datasets and, additionally, a set of relevant vehicular data fields that could be incorporated in future data collection campaigns to address the challenge.

AB Bicycling is one of the fundamental modes of transportation especially in developing countries. Because of the lack of effective protection for bicyclists, vehicle-bicycle (V-B) accident has become a primary contributor to traffic fatalities. Although AEB (Autonomous Emergency Braking) systems have been developed to avoid or mitigate collisions, they need to be further adapted in various conflict situations. This paper analyzes the driver's braking behavior in typical V-B conflicts of China to improve the performance of Bicyclist-AEB systems. Naturalistic driving data were collected, from which the top three scenarios of V-B accidents in China were extracted, including SCR (a bicycle crossing the road from right while a car is driving straight), SCL (a bicycle crossing the road from left while a car is driving straight) and SSR (a bicycle swerving in front of the car from right while a car is driving straight). For safety and data reliability, a driving simulator was employed to reconstruct these three scenarios and some 25 licensed drivers were recruited for braking behavior analysis. Results revealed that driver's braking behavior was significantly influenced by V-B conflict types. Pre-decelerating behaviors were found in SCL and SSR conflicts, whereas in SCR the subjects were less vigilant. The brake reaction time and brake severity in lateral V-B conflicts (SCR and SCL) was shorter and higher than that in longitudinal conflicts (SSR). The findings improve their applications in the Bicyclist-AEB and test protocol enactment to enhance the performance of Bicyclist-AEB systems in mixed traffic situations especially for developing countries.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; BEHAVIOR; DRIVERS
AB The recognition of the preceding vehicle lane-changing manoeuvre (LCM) is essential for improving the rationality and safety of the decision-making of driverless vehicles. However, traditional recognition researches for preceding vehicle LCM are generally characterized by problems such as low recognition accuracy and poor research foundation. In response to these problems, this paper carried out naturalistic driving study (NDS) on the highway, from which a large amount of on-road data consisting of lane-keeping (LK) and lane-changing left and right (LCL, LCR) manoeuvres were collected. A stacking-based ensemble learning method for the recognition of the LCM of the preceding vehicle, which integrates the random forest, support vector machine, long and short-term memory network (LSTM), and bi-directional LSTM based on attention mechanism (AT-Bi-LSTM) algorithms, is proposed. Compared with traditional machine learning methods, the proposed method exhibits greater advantages in terms of its recognition accuracy. It is particularly of note that the recognition accuracy of the model at 0.4 s and 0.8 s after the LCM reached 90.77% and 95.54%, respectively. The study reported is of great significance for the construction of more intelligent vehicle-vehicle collaboration and the promotion of the industrial applications of intelligent vehicle technology.

AB A dual model predictive control (DMPC) method based on virtual trajectory is proposed in this paper, in order to achieve autonomous cooperative formation control of underactuated unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in complex ocean environment. Firstly, the formation tracking error model of the USVs is designed, and considering the large initial state tracking error of USVs, a virtual transition trajectory is put forward to guide the design of tracking controller. To solve the mutation problem caused by misalignment of the follower USV's desired trajectory in the early stage, an improved differential tracker is introduced into virtual leader USV to smooth the desired trajectory of the follower USV. In addition, a dual mode switching strategy is designed to decide when and how to quit the transition of the virtual USV. A nonlinear disturbance observer is introduced to compensate the complex marine environment interference. Finally, by introducing terminal penalty function and linear state feedback controller, the Lyapunov function is constructed to prove the control stability of the proposed model predictive control method in finite time domain, and the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method are verified by simulation experiments.

AB Presently, most passive safety tests are performed with a precisely specified seat position and carefully seated ATD (anthropomorphic test device) dummies. Facing the development of autonomous vehicles, as well as the need for safety verification during crashes with various seat positions such research is even more urgently needed. Apart from the numerical environment, the existing testing equipment is not validated to perform such an investigation. For example, ATDs are not validated for nonstandard seatback positions, and the most accurate method of such research is volunteer tests. The study presented here was performed on a sled test rig utilizing a 50cc Hybrid III dummy according to a full factorial experiment. In addition, input factors were selected in order to verify a safe test condition for surrogate testing. The measured value was head acceleration, which was used for calculation of a head injury criterion. What was found was an optimal seat angle -117 degrees-at which the head injury criteria had the lowest represented value. Moreover, preliminary body dynamics showed a danger of whiplash occurrence for occupants in a fully-reclined seat.

AB The purpose of this research is to propose a tracking and mapping system of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) using a high operating frequency sonar, which provides the ability to track obstacles and predict pathways for the intelligent system. In this paper, the active sonar equation is used to calculate the effective parameters in the real-time environment and conditions such as salinity, temperature, depth, pH, and noise. In this research, the operating frequency of the transducer is 200 kHz and the channel depth is as much as 200 m. The multi-beam effect and the Doppler effect on the omnidirectional transducer are well demonstrated in the results and tests. All of these results are implemented and tested in an AUV processed by a high-speed mini-PC. Results show that the secondary echoes of the object under real-time environmental conditions could be more powerful than the primary echoes (direct echoes) because the object has different target strengths at different angles. In addition, the relative velocity between the object and the transducer affects the appearance and size of the reflected echo and causes error. As the relative speed increases, the pulse length becomes larger and the amplitude of the wave increases.

AB Automotive radar is one of the enabling technologies for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and subsequently fully autonomous vehicles. Along with determining the range and velocity of targets with fairly high resolution, autonomous vehicles navigating complex urban environments need radar sensors with high azimuth and elevation resolution. Size and cost constraints limit the physical number of antennas that can be used to achieve high resolution direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation. Multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) schemes achieve larger virtual arrays using fewer physical antennas than would be needed for a single-input/multiple-output (SIMO) system. This paper presents a high-fidelity physics simulation of a 77GHz, frequency-modulated continuous-waveform (FMCW)-based 128 channel (8 transmitters (T-x), 16 receivers (R-x)) MIMO radar sensor. The 77GHz synthetic radar returns from full scale traffic scenes are obtained using a high-fidelity physics, shooting and bouncing ray electromagnetics solver. A fast Fourier transform (FFT) based signal processing scheme is used across slow-time (chirp) and space (channel) to obtain range-Doppler and DoA maps, respectively. Detection and angular separation performance comparisons of 16, 64 and 128 channel MIMO radar sensors are made for two complex driving scenarios.

AB Existing research that forecasts market penetration of installed connected and autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies is often confused with the traffic composition in roadway networks. Users may override AV mode due to arrival time pressure, facility constraint (e.g., "I will have to make a U-turn a mile away if I do not cross the solid double-yellow lines here"), drug and alcohol influence, pleasure, envy (e.g., "why the front car can surpass that slow truck but I can't?"), insufficient law enforcement, driving culture, media and public sentiment, etc. Therefore, the installation and the usage of AV technologies should not be instantaneously assumed ignorable in planning and policy studies. This paper is dedicated to clarifying this confusion by demonstrating that ignoring the difference between the installation and the usage of AV technologies might lead to systematic bias in evaluating policy and investment decisions. Through a system dynamics (SD) model, the complex interactions of relevant factors are captured so that the mixed traffic condition influences traffic law enforcement adjustment effort and system investment decisions, which, in turn, influence the AV technology usage share and the system performance. The case study applies to the greater Washington, D.C. area for demonstrating the feasibility and advantages of the proposed model and for studying policy implications. This paper does not attempt to forecast; instead, it proposes a modeling framework for studying the conditions under which differentiating the installation and the usage of AV technologies might be critical in forecasting the traffic composition trend and system performance for public policy and investment decisions.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Safety validation of Autonomous Vehicles (AV) requires simulation. Automotive manufacturers need to generate scenarios used during this simulation-based validation process. Several approaches have been proposed to master scenario generation. However, none have proposed a method to measure the potential hazardousness of the scenarios with regard to the performance limitations of AV. In other words, there is no method offering a metric to guide the search for potentially critical scenarios within the infinite space of scenarios. However, designers have knowledge of the functional limitations of AV components depending on the situations encountered. The more sensitive the AV is to a situation, the more safety experts consider it to be critical. In this paper, we present a new method to help estimate the sensitivity of AV to logical situations and events before their use for the generation of concrete scenarios submitted to simulators. We propose a characterization of the inputs used for sensitivity analysis (definition of the context of the automation function, generation of functional and logical situations with their associated events). We then propose an approach to set up a distribution function that will make it possible to select situations and events according to their importance in terms of sensitivity. We illustrate this approach by implementing it on the Traffic Jam Chauffeur (TJC) function. Finally, we compare the obtained sensitivity rank with expert judgment to demonstrate its relevance. This approach has been shown to be a promising method to guide the search for potentially hazardous scenarios that are relevant to the simulation-based safety validation process for AV.

AB Battery thermal management is of great significance to enhance the comprehensive performance of autonomous underwater vehicles(AUVs). However, few relevant studies have been conducted on the AUV's battery thermal management (BTM). In this work, the phase change material (PCM) cooling was proposed for AUV's BTM with taking into account natural convection. The temperature behavior of the battery and the melting behavior of PCM were studied under different parameters including thickness of PCM and eccentricity between PCM and battery. In addition, the enhanced heat transfer mechanism of the PCM melting process was further revealed based on the temperature deviation index. More importantly, the dimensionless temperature control rate (TCR) factor and the dimensionless heat storage rate (HSR) factor were introduced to quantitatively evaluate and optimize the eccentricity on the enhancement performance. The results show that PCMs have an excellent performance in the battery thermal management of AUVs. Unlike the traditional view, the whole PCM melting process was further subdivided into three stages according to the thermal energy storage mode or heat transfer types. Increasing the eccentricity can accelerate the melting of the PCM, while the reduced time of complete PCM melting was not linearly correlated with the eccentricity. The optimal eccentricity between PCM and battery was 10 mm, i.e., the eccentricity ratio epsilon = 0.625. The temperature control performance rate and heat storage per-formance rate were enhanced by 29.4 % and 5.7 % at e = 10 mm, respectively. These findings can provide guidelines for accurate design of the PCM cooling system for the AUV's battery thermal management.

AB Understanding the timing and reproductive behavior of commercial fish species is a key part of well-informed stock assessments and fishery management, but this information is often limited, particularly for species that spawn in deep water. Petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani) is one of the most commercially important flatfish species in the US and is known to spawn off the West Coast during winter months. A number of spawning grounds have been identified using catch data and tagging studies, but to our knowledge there have been no direct visual observations of aggregating petrale sole. In 2018, we observed unusually high densities of petrale sole in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) imagery collected at a feature inshore of Santa Lucia Bank off the California coast. In addition to aggregations of fish, we observed fish in positions and configurations that we believe to be related to spawning behavior including physical contact between individuals and evidence of consistent size differentiation within clusters. We present images of the aggregating petrale sole and information on the physical and environmental conditions at this site. We also compare these observations to the results of AUV surveys carried out in 2005 at the same site. Analysis of commercial catch data from this area supports the hypothesis that this is a seasonal petrale sole aggregation as fishing at this location occurs mainly during winter months with catches dominated by petrale sole. In addition to the potential identification of a spawning aggregation, these observations show how advanced technologies can provide insight into the reproductive behavior of a commercially important species in-situ.

AB In this paper, we present a new solution for the Autonomous navigation problem, using a Decomposition-Coordination Method (DCM) 1. The main purpose of this work is to compute an optimal and safe path for the multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in a dynamic environment, moving from an initial location to the desired state. We assume that the flight environment is totally known to a supervisory unit, and the positions and trajectories of dynamic obstacles could be known in real-time, thus to perform in such environment a high reactivity is required as well as good connectivity with the supervisory unit that provides the safe path, each time one obstacle or more are detected on the road, so that the UAV could autonomously diverts from the unsafe path to the new safe one, and avoid the potential collisions. First and foremost, we choose a generalized nonlinear model for the multi-rotors in view of the rotational and translational dynamics of the UAV. We then associate that model with the objective functions. After that, we proceed to the resolution of the multi-objective optimization problem using our approach of decomposition-coordination. The principle of this method consists in decomposing the system into several smaller subsystems to simplify the treatment. Then we achieve the coordination afterward using Lagrange multipliers. To prove the convergence and stability of our method we make use of a Lyapunov function chosen particularly for this system. In the last section we present the simulation results, to confirm the reliability of our method. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Localization of a vehicle is a key component for driving assistance or autonomous navigation. In this work, we propose a visual positioning system (VPS) for vehicle or mobile robot navigation. Different from general landmark-based or model-based approaches, which rely on some predefined known landmarks or a priori information about the environment, no assumptions on the prior knowledge of the scene are made. A stereo-based vision system is built for both extracting feature correspondences and recovering 3-D information of the scene from image sequences. Relative positions of the camera motion are then estimated by registering the 3-D feature points from two consecutive image frames. Localization of the mobile platform is finally given by the reference to its initial position.

ID KERNEL DENSITY-ESTIMATION; ACCIDENT; SAFETY; INSURANCE; EVENTS
AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to considerably improve road safety. That said, accident risk will continue to inflict societal costs. The ability to manage and measure these risks is fundamental to ensure societal acceptance and public adoption of AVs. In particular, the ability to quantitatively compare the safety of AVs relative to human drivers is crucial. Managing risk exposures through driving operational design domains (ODD) will also become prevalent. Ultimately, the deployment of AVs will hinge on the premise that they are safer than humans. In this paper, we posit a methodology to quantitatively evaluate AV risks and minimise their risk exposure once they are publically available. Two contributions are offered. First, we provide a proactive means of evaluating AV risks based on driving behaviour and safety-critical events. This offers statistically meaningful comparisons between humans and AVs given the limitation of current historical data. Second, we propose a novel risk-aware path planning methodology for AVs based on telematics behavioural data. Driving data from a cohort of young human drivers over roughly 270,000 km in Ireland is used to demonstrate the posited methodology. An unsupervised geostatistical tool called Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is used to identify "behavioural hotspots" and the risk exposure at each edge or road segment is modelled. The results are incorporated into a path planning algorithm to find safe route paths for AVs, minimising risk exposures. In addition, Self-Organising Maps (SOM) are employed to identify similar risk groups and individual spatial risk patterns are considered.

AB Mandatory lane change (MLC) is a critical step in formulating global route of an autonomous vehicle on the urban road network. Improper MLC decisions on arterial roads could jeopardise efficiency (travel cost) and reliability (possibility of failed lane change). However, the existing research studies seldom investigate the optimal MLC decision at the planning level to maximise the reliability-based driving efficiency. This research aims at addressing two core strategic decision variables (MLC decision point on the road and maximum waiting time before giving up MLC). A series of simulation experiments for various scenarios are conducted for an arterial road to reveal their relationship. The results indicate that both identified decision variables inherently affect travel time spent on this road and the rate of failed MLCs, and a trade-off exists between arterial travel time and the rate of failed MLCs. Based on the simulation analysis, an analytical lane-level link performance (LLP) function is formulated to assess the impacts of MLC decisions on driving efficiency. The analysis validates that the optimal MLC strategic decision (MLC decision position and maximum waiting time) can be determined by maximising LLP function. It is promising to apply the proposed LLP function in lane-level routing algorithm in the future.

TI Modal Choice for the Driverless City: Scenario Simulation Based on a

ID AUTOMATED VEHICLES; TRAVEL-TIME; IMPACT; POLICY
AB The possible future introduction of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) raises questions about how they might affect the demand for transport and especially modal choice. In this research, a stated preference (SP) survey and a modelling process using Mixed Logit are proposed to simulate the future market share of AVs/SAVs and how their introduction into the system could change the modal choice, especially in relation to active and public transport modes. An efficient SP survey design has been developed based on the state-of-the-art information and carried out in 2020 among citizens of two medium-sized Southern European cities within a car-intensive region. The design considered different trip purposes (compulsory, leisure), different trip distances, and attributes not taken into account before, such as comfort and the physical characteristics of the terrain for the active modes. The model results suggest that AVs and SAVs were the preferred transport modes for most respondents, accounting for more than 58% of the market share in the scenarios presented. Also, we detected some socioeconomic differences in the propensity to use this mode of transport showing that men living in high-income households and car users were more prone to use autonomous alternatives. The models allowed us to simulate different scenarios, such as experiencing higher costs for using the AV alternative. Policies imposing a higher cost for the AV alternative but lower costs and waiting times for the SAV and public transport alternatives could decrease the AV's market share favouring more sustainable modes. The above scenario showed that achieving a more sustainable future mobility system considering AVs requires an in-depth transport demand knowledge and adequate transport policies.

AB Internet of Underwater Things (IoUTs) is completely embraced by acoustic sensor nodes that are commonly battery consumption. The sensor's battery life is restricted and it is problematic while it needs to recharge. Moreover, these kinds of underwater sensor nodes may form the cluster to store the huge amount of energy. The cluster head formation is the main problem that the cluster head needs to use added energy for aggregation and data collection to broadcast the data packets to the destination. The autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have to be used to connect the sensor nodes with the internet or particular devices, the path discovery within the AUV is the primary issue for producing the efficient routing in IoUTs. In this paper, the proposed routing strategy is used to provide energy proficiency while performing the cluster-based routing. AUV is responsible for selecting the cluster head and maintaining cluster-based scheduling. The AUV path is constructed to increase the residual energy for the sensor nodes in the network. It coordinates the AUV's effective way of arranging calculations into the steering convention. This incorporated specialized strategy depends on two stages: A-ANTD (AUV-Assisted Network Transmit Devising) and TARD (Transmit Assisted Route Devising). A-ANTD uses the collaboration of performance of multiple ventures to decrease energy utilization for the system and stays away from the problem area and sector issue with a vital GN (Gateway Nodules) plans. The experimental results show that the proposed methodology has improved performance compared with the other methods.

AB Optical flow and disparity are two informative visual features for autonomous driving perception. They have been used for a variety of applications, such as obstacle and lane detection. The concept of "U-V-Disparity" has been widely explored in the literature, while its counterpart in optical flow has received relatively little attention. Traditional motion analysis algorithms estimate optical flow by matching correspondences between two successive video frames, which limits the full utilization of environmental information and geometric constraints. Therefore, we propose a novel strategy to model optical flow in the collision-freespace (also referred to as drivable area or simply freespace) for intelligent vehicles, with the full utilization of geometry information in a 3-D driving environment. We provide explicit representations of optical flow and deduce the quadratic relationship between the optical flow component and the vertical coordinate. Through extensive experiments on several public datasets, we demonstrate the high accuracy and robustness of our model. In addition, our proposed freespace optical flow model boasts a diverse array of applications within the realm of automated driving, providing a geometric constraint in freespace detection, vehicle localization, and more. We have made our source code publicly available at https://mias.group/FSOF.

AB Advances in science and technologies not only improve our workflow and increase the quality of life but also change the way emergency rescue operates. The eCall system is the evidence of such a new evolutionary step. However, studies are not available about 'smart' rescue methods of independent human (neither pedestrian nor a driver) who turned out to be on the roadside for one or another reason and need first aid. The research questions were how to increase the quality and speed of the rescue process by using Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication and the human pose estimation function and how to increase the reliability of transmitted information. In the article, we presented an overview about the current state-of-the-art in human pose estimation technology, discussed current methods of rescue, concept, and disadvantages of the current approach, and finally proposed our own method of rescue based on blending of vehicular communication networks with advancements in human pose estimation function. The research novelty in a scientific sense is a concept of a new information management method, where Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) act as witnesses itself without any human intervention. An example of SOS Packet Format has been designed. We proposed a novel view on the future ambulance.

AB This article presents an autonomous navigation approach based on a transmission tower for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) power line inspection. For this complex vision task, a perspective navigation model, which plays an important role in the description and analysis of the flight strategy, is introduced. Based on the proposed navigation model, valuable cues are excavated from a perspective image, which enhances the capability of the perception of three-dimensional direction and simultaneously improves the safety of intelligent inspection. Specifically, for robust and continuous localization of the transmission tower, a developed detecting-tracking visual strategycomprised tower detection based on a faster region-based convolutional neural network and tower tracking by kernelized correlation filtersis presented. Further, segmentation by fully convolutional networks is applied to the extraction of transmission lines, from which the vanishing point (VP), an important basis for determining the flight heading, can be obtained. For more robust navigation, the designed scheme addresses the scenario of a nonexistent VP. Finally, the proposed navigation approach and constructed UAV platform were evaluated in a practical environment and achieved satisfactory results. To the best of our knowledge, this article marks the first time that a navigation approach based on a transmission tower is proposed and implemented.

AB An intelligent autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) simulator with path-planning capability was developed. A guidance system of the simulator automatically generates continuous-curvature paths of a cubic B-spline class constrained by the minimum turning radius of the marine vehicle and waypoints. The simulator of the guidance system includes a line-of-sight (LOS) algorithm and a horizontal proportional-derivative (PD) controller, adapting the Euler-Rodriguez quaternion method on the base of 3-D Euler-Lagrange formulation. A web-based interactive simulation system can animate the attitudes and position of the AUV in real time. A 3000-T AUV was used to test the guidance system. Comparisons of linear and cubic path-planning strategies were discussed, including a straight line and a conventional cubic spline method, three parametric methods for planning cubic B-spline paths, and an iterative method for improving and expanding the function of the path generator. Simulation results of the tracking performance tests show that the AUV can precisely approach targets and waypoints using the proposed method. The improvement in the cross-tracking error was approximately 80%, whereas reduction in traveling time was 5%.

AB A hierarchical hybrid control system is proposed to cope with highly automated driving in highway environments with multiple lanes and surrounding vehicles. In the high-level layer, the discrete driving decisions are coordinated by the finite-state machine (FSM) based on the relative position identification and predictive longitudinal distance of the surrounding vehicles. The low-level layer is responsible for the vehicle motion control, where the model predictive control (MPC) approach is utilized to integrate the longitudinal and lateral control mainly including car-following control and lane changing control. The proposed control system focuses on two issues regarding safe driving on highways. On one hand, the subject vehicle must always keep a safe distance with its leading vehicle to avoid the rear-end collision. On the other hand, the subject vehicle should also overtake the preceding vehicle by safe lane changes if the desired speed is not achieved. The effectiveness of the hybrid control is tested in the simulation, whose results verify that the driving decisions are made reasonably and the vehicle motion control obeys stability and comfort requirements. Moreover, it is also indicated by the simulations in random scenarios that the control strategy is able to deal with most of ordinary situations on highways although some emergency situations or critical driving maneuvers of other vehicles are not considered.

AB Path planning for space vehicles is still a challenging problem although considerable progress has been made over the past decades. The major difficulties are that most of existing methods only adapt to static environment instead of dynamic one, and also can not solve the inherent constraints arising from the robot body and the exterior environment. To address these difficulties, this research aims to provide a feasible trajectory based on quadratic programming(QP) for path planning in three-dimensional space where an autonomous vehicle is requested to pursue a target while avoiding static or dynamic obstacles. First, the objective function is derived from the pursuit task which is defined in terms of the relative distance to the target, as well as the angle between the velocity and the position in the relative velocity coordinates(RVCs). The optimization is in quadratic polynomial form according to QP formulation. Then, the avoidance task is modeled with linear constraints in RVCs. Some other constraints, such as kinematics, dynamics, and sensor range, are included. Last, simulations with typical multiple obstacles are carried out, including in static and dynamic environments and one of human-in-the-loop. The results indicate that the optimal trajectories of the autonomous robot in three-dimensional space satisfy the required performances. Therefore, the QP model proposed in this paper not only adapts to dynamic environment with uncertainty, but also can satisfy all kinds of constraints, and it provides an efficient approach to solve the problems of path planning in three-dimensional space.

AB The trajectory tracking problem of autonomous lighter than air vehicles in the presence of wind gusts is studied in this paper. The airship is represented as one point which is its center of volume, and only the kinematic equations are considered for the path tracking design. The control algorithm uses the Lyapunov theory and the Sontag's universal stabilizing feedback. The proposed control laws are robust, by construction, with respect to uncertainties in the model and unknown external parameters. Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the performance of the proposed control strategy.

AB In this paper, a soft-switching proximate time-optimal control (PTOC) is proposed based on the model-compensation extended state observer (ESO) and Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy switching, for the fast set-heading tracking of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). First, based on Pontryagin's maximum principle, a time-optimal control (TOC) law is derived for the first-order Nomoto model of the underactuated AUV. Then, a model-compensation active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is developed; the outstanding characteristic is that the nonlinear heading dynamic model is compensated to a first-order Nomoto model rather than by a double integral system through implementing a model-compensation ESO (MC-ESO). The regular ESO is replaced with a reduced-order ESO (RESO) to reduce complexity, and the model-compensation RESO (MC-RESO) is designed by adding the known partial model to RESO. Based on the controller scaling method, a parameter self-tuning strategy is proposed for model-compensation ADRC (MC-ADRC) with changed plant parameters at different velocities. Finally, the soft-switching PTOC is developed for heading control, and the MC-RESO is adopted to estimate the unmeasured velocity and unknown total disturbances for feedback and compensation. The TOC with an unsaturated region (RTOC) is employed to enhance the robustness by using a switching region to replace the switching curve, and a soft-switching strategy between ADRC (near the origin) and RTOC (far from origin) is designed based on the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy mode. Several simulations are carried out, the effectiveness of self-tuning MC-ADRC is verified, and the proposed soft-switching PTOC shows better performance compared with MC-ADRC.

AB The cooperative path following problem of multiple underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) involves two tasks. The first one is to force each AUV to converge to the desired parameterized path. The second one is to satisfy the requirement of a cooperative behavior along the paths. In this paper, both of the tasks have been further studied. For the first one, a simplified path following controller is proposed by incorporating the dynamic surface control (DSC) technique to avoid the calculation of derivatives of virtual control signals. Besides, in order to handle the uncertain dynamics, a new type of neural network (NN) adaptive controller is derived, and then an NN based energy-efficient path following controller is firstly proposed, which consists of an adaptive neural controller dominating in the neural active region and an extra robust controller working outside the neural active region. For the second one, in order to reduce the amount of communications between multiple AUVs, a distributed estimator for the reference common speed is firstly proposed as determined by the communications topology adopted, which means the global knowledge of the reference speed is relaxed for the problem of cooperative path following. The overall algorithm ensures that all the signals in the closed-loop system are globally uniformly ultimately bounded (GUUB) and the output of the system converges to a small neighborhood of the reference trajectory by properly choosing the design parameters. Simulation results validate the performance and robustness of the proposed strategy.

AB Due to the high resolution of angles of arrivals (AoAs) provided by the massive MIMO base station in 5 G wireless systems, it is promising to integrate 5G-based localization technology into autonomous driving to improve the accuracy and robustness of vehicle localization. In this paper, we investigate the problem of 5G cloud-assisted cooperative localization for vehicle platoons. The existing 5G-based localization algorithms focused on single-user localization and are not efficient for the localization of vehicle platoon where the positions of the vehicles are highly correlated. To the best of our knowledge, cloud-assisted cooperative localization tailored to vehicle platoons has not been studied before. To address this challenging problem, we first propose a Gamma-Markov-Group-Sparse (GMGS) model to capture the joint distribution of the vehicle positions in a vehicle platoon. Then we formulate the vehicle platoon cooperative localization as a sparse Bayesian inference (SBI) problem. The existing standard SBI algorithms such as variational Bayesian inference (VBI) and approximate message passing (AMP) cannot be applied to our platoon localization problem due to the complicated GMGS prior and the ill-conditioned measurement matrix. As such, we propose a novel turbo vehicle platoon cooperative localization (Turbo-VPCL) algorithm to fully exploit the correlations of the vehicle positions (as captured by the GMGS prior) under the ill-conditioned measurement matrix. Simulation results verify that the proposed Turbo-VPCL can achieve significant gain over the-state-of-art SBI algorithms.

AB The design and construction of a biomimetic flapping foil autonomous underwater vehicle is detailed. The vehicle was designed as a proof of concept for the use of oscillating foils as the sole source of motive power for a cruising and hovering underwater vehicle. Primary vehicle design requirements included scalability and flexibility in terms of the number and placement of foils, so as to maximize experimental functionality. This goal was met by designing an independent self-contained module to house each foil, requiring only direct current power and a connection to the vehicle's Ethernet local area network for operation. The results of tests on the foil modules in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Marine Hydrodynamics Water Tunnel and the MIT Ship Model Testing Tank are both used to demonstrate fundamental properties of flapping foils and to predict the performance of the specific vehicle design based on the limits of the actuators. The maximum speed of the vehicle is estimated based on the limitations of the specific actuator and is shown to be a strong function of the vehicle drag coefficient. When using four foils, the maximum speed increases from 1 m/s with a vehicle CD of 1.4 to 2 m/s when CD = 0.1, where CD is based on vehicle frontal area. Finally, issues of vehicle control are considered, including the decoupling of speed and pitch control using pitch-biased maneuvering and the tradeoff between actuator bandwidth and authority during both the cruising and hovering operation.

ID DRIVING CESSATION; AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; TRANSITIONS
AB Objective
   We examine the relationships between contemporary progress in on-road vehicle automation and its coherence with an envisioned "autopia" (automobile utopia) whereby the vehicle operation task is removed from all direct human control.
   Background
   The progressive automation of on-road vehicles toward a completely driverless state is determined by the integration of technological advances into the private automobile market; improvements in transportation infrastructure and systems efficiencies; and the vision of future driving as a crash-free enterprise. While there are many challenges to address with respect to automated vehicles concerning the remaining driver role, a considerable amount of technology is already present in vehicles and is advancing rapidly.
   Methods
   A multidisciplinary team of experts met to discuss the most critical challenges in the changing role of the driver, and associated safety issues, during the transitional phase of vehicle automation where human drivers continue to have an important but truncated role in monitoring and supervising vehicle operations.
   Results
   The group endorsed that vehicle automation is an important application of information technology, not only because of its impact on transportation efficiency, but also because road transport is a life critical system in which failures result in deaths and injuries. Five critical challenges were identified: driver independence and mobility, driver acceptance and trust, failure management, third-party testing, and political support.
   Conclusion
   Vehicle automation is not technical innovation alone, but is a social as much as a technological revolution consisting of both attendant costs and concomitant benefits.

AB Recent studies on macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) have shifted towards enhancing MFD dynamics in terms of efficiency and realism. In this paper, a multi-reservoir dynamic network loading (MRDNL) model for a large-scale urban road network is developed. The proposed framework consists of a hyper-link and a hyper-node model. The hyper-link model is constructed using variational theory (VT) by introducing a set of constraints that construct an upper bound for upstream and downstream cumulative accumulations. Using VT, LWR is incorporated into MFD dynamics to enhance traffic propagation at reservoirs. The hyper-link model captures important traffic phenomena, such as kinematic waves, queueing, and congestion, while the hyper-node model functions as a medium for transferring flow to other parts of the multi-reservoir urban network. A numerical scheme is advanced for solving the proposed MRDNL model and its performance is evaluated using a hypothetical traffic network. Compared to previous MFD-based dynamic network loading models, our approach is more computationally efficient since it does not require discretization and offers more realistic solutions by considering multiple kinematic waves and including the dynamics of urban traffic signals. This study, further, incorporated connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) into MFD dynamics and evaluated the network-wide effect of introduction of CAVs in urban traffic networks. For a network with 100% CAV market penetration rate, an approximate enhancement of 30% in total network outflow was found.

AB In the coming years, connectivity between vehicles with autonomous driving features and roadside infrastructure will become more and more a reality on our roads, pursuing to improve road safety and traffic efficiency. In this regard, two main communication standards are considered as key enablers, that is ITS-G5 (based on IEEE 802.11p) and C-V2X (3GPP). To assess the real performance of these technologies, there is still need for an objective and independent one-to-one comparison of these technologies using off-the-shelf hardware under identical and real-life traffic conditions. Until today, performance evaluations are limited to simulations, emulations or individual technology assessments in real-life circumstances. In this paper, an exhaustive and fair evaluation of the technologies has been conducted in a real-life highway environment under identical conditions. Tailored evaluation tools in combination with our in-house CAMINO vehicular framework has been utilized to perform the tests and analyze the results for different well-specified test cases. The performance evaluation shows that for the short-range technologies, C-V2X PC5 has, in general, a higher range than ITS-G5, while ITS-G5 offers lower latency than C-V2X PC5 in low-density scenarios. Long-range 4G C-V2X can be considered as an alternative for certain use cases. The outcome of this experimentation study can be used as valuable information for the further development of future (5G) connected and autonomous driving.

AB Shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEVs) are expected to serve a significant fraction of the passenger transportation needs in cities and surrounding urban areas. In this paper, we consider optimal operation of a cyber-physical system (CPS) comprising a large fleet of SAEVs and a set of charging hubs located across the transportation network and supported by the power grid. The hubs are considered to have a number of charging stations, a stand-alone battery bank for energy storage, and limited rooftop photo-voltaic (PV) generation capacity. We developed a robust mixed integer linear programming model. It considers a number of practical features of both the power and transportation systems, including day-ahead load commitment for electricity via an alternative current power flow model, real time price spikes of electricity, energy arbitrage, uncertainty in passenger demand, and balking of passengers while waiting for a ride. We demonstrated our methodology by implementing it on a sample CPS with 500 SAEVs and five hubs with fifty charging stations in each. Our methodology yields operational decisions for day ahead commitment of power and real time control of the SAEVs and the hubs. The sample CPS is used to examine impact of hub capacity and fleet size on various system performance measures. We discuss the computational challenges of our methodology and propose a simplified myopic approach that is capable of dealing with much larger fleet sizes and a variety of hub capacities. Reduction in computation time and the optimality gap for the myopic approach are examined.

AB Vehicles that operate beneath or on the surface of water (e.g., boats, remotely operated vehicles, unmanned underwater vehicles, etc.) are subjected to external hydrodynamic forces and require an online hydrodynamic observer for precise autonomous control. The accurate calculation of current forces requires accurate sensor data and computational fluid dynamics, which impose a huge computational burden and cannot be applied in the real-time control of such vehicles. Fish can accurately perceive the effects of ocean currents, a function that can be achieved through an artificial lateral line system. In this study, an online hydrodynamic observer is proposed that uses an artificial lateral line system to estimate the resultant forces acting on water vehicles in real time for the autonomous control of the vehicle. A small three-layer artificial neural network is used to construct the hydrodynamic observer to evaluate various hydrodynamic forces in the form of a six-axis resultant force, such as the damping effects of currents and effects of wind and waves. In this study, an artificial lateral line system is designed for vehicles of any geometry. The system consists of a multipressure sensor array, data acquisition unit, and computational unit. Each pressure sensor is packaged as a separate unit that can be assembled on the surface of an underwater robot. These pressure sensors measure the pressure changes caused by the ocean current forces, while the data acquisition unit collects, collates, and sends the pressure sensor and attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) data to the processing unit. The processing unit uses an artificial neural network to estimate the ocean current forces acting on the vehicle body coordinate system based on the pressure sensor array, and converts them into the inertial reference system in the geoid based on the data acquired from the AHRS. This study explores the effects of the number of sensors and their locations on the accuracy of the estimated results. It investigates whether a scale factor can be used to estimate other available observers of the same size and geometry to enable the rapid deployment of artificial lateral devices to different vehicles. To evaluate the generalization performance of the proposed hydrodynamic observer, tests were conducted in dynamic water environments, such as rivers and oceans.

AB An unknown nonlinear disturbance seriously affects the trajectory tracking of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Thus, it is critical to eliminate the influence of such disturbances on AUVs. To address this problem, this paper proposes a double-loop proportional-integral-differential (PID) neural network sliding mode control (DLNNSMC). First, a double-loop PID sliding mode surface is proposed, which has a faster convergence speed than other PID sliding mode surfaces. Second, a nonlinear high-order observer and a neural network are combined to observe and compensate for the nonlinear disturbance of the AUV system. Then, the bounded stability of an AUV closed-loop system is analyzed and demonstrated using the Lyapunov method, and the time-domain method is used to verify that the velocity- and position-tracking errors of AUVs converge to zero exponentially. Finally, the radial basis function (RBF) neural network PID sliding mode control (RBFPIDSMC) and the RBF neural network PID sliding mode control (RBFPDSMC) are compared with this method in two trajectory tracking control simulation experiments. In the first experiment, the average Euclidean distance of the position-tracking error for this method was reduced by approximately 73.6% and 75.3%, respectively, compared to those for RBFPDSMC and RBFPIDSMC. In the second experiment, the average Euclidean distance of the position tracking error for this method was reduced by approximately 86.8% and 88.8%, respectively. The two experiments showed that the proposed control method has a strong anti-jamming ability and tracking effect. The simulation results obtained in the Gazebo environment validated the superiority of this method.

AB In deep ocean applications, a camera's viewing range is related to its low-light-level performance. Hence, a high-resolution ultra-low-light-level digital still camera (thereafter L3DSC), designed from the ground up for deep ocean autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) imaging, is presented. A high-resolution (1024 x 1024) electron-multiplying CCD (EMCCD) is adopted as an image sensor to ensure low-light capability. A thermo electric cooler (TEC) is employed to lower image sensor temperature to promote low-light-level performance. Totem pole circuits that are able to generate 50-V pulse wave at 10 MHz are implemented to drive the EM pin, and power consumption of the circuit is optimized. An EMCCD digital image is buffered in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and then transferred through USB interface to a solid-state drive (SSD), which is installed in the image storage unit. The camera is controlled by AUV via Ethernet, and image data stored in the camera could be downloaded via the same interface after AUV retrieved from the sea. The camera module is mounted into a 6000-m depth-rate titanium alloy housing. The diagonal field of view is measured to be 58.4 deg in air. Experiments show that the minimum scene illumination of L3DSC is better than 5 x 10(-4) Lux; underwater imaging distance is longer than 10 m, and total image data capacity is 200 gigabytes. These results demonstrate the camera's low-light-level imaging performance and feasibility for AUV applications. (C) 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

AB The use of high-quality data is required to complete the job of lateral control utilizing Behavioral Cloning (BC) through an End-to-End (E2E) learning system. The majority of E2E learning systems gather this high-quality data all at once before beginning the training phase (i.e., the training process does not start until the end of the data collection process). The demand for high-quality data necessitates a large amount of human effort and substantial time and money spent waiting for data collection to be completed. As a result, it is critical to find a viable option to reduce both the time and cost of data collecting while also maintaining the performance of a trained vehicle controller. This paper offers a novel behavioral cloning approach for lateral vehicle control to address the aforementioned problems. The proposed technique begins by collecting the least amount of human driving data possible. The data from human drivers are utilized for training a convolutional neural network for lateral control. The trained neural network is subsequently deployed to the vehicle's automated driving controller, replacing a human driver. At this point, a human driver is out of the loop, and an automated driving controller, trained by the initial data from a human driver, drives the vehicle to collect further training data. The driving data obtained are sent into a convolutional neural network training module, then the newly trained neural network is deployed to the automated driving controller that will drive the vehicle further. The data collection alternates neural network training processes using the collected data until the neural network learns to correctly associate an image input with a steering angle. The proposed incremental approach was extensively tested in simulated environments, and the results are promising, only 3.81% (1,061 out of 27,884) of the total data came from a human driver. The incrementally trained neural networks using data collected by automated controllers were able to drive the vehicle in two different tracks successfully. The AI chauffeur was able to drive the vehicle on Track B for more than 70% of the track even though it has not seen the track before.

AB Efficient operations of traffic signals are of critical importance in urban areas, as signalized intersections prevent the smooth flow of traffic and cause delays. This paper devises an eco-driving algorithm based on connected vehicle technologies, with basic kinematic wave and car-following models. The objectives of the proposed algorithm are to increase the throughput of signal intersections and decrease fuel consumption. Specifically, we focus on a signalized intersection under mixed traffic flows with connected and autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs). Through the proposed algorithm, the vehicle speeds at the intersection (i.e., the intersection control speed) and signal timings can be adjusted in response to the real-time traffic conditions. According to the signal timing and the speed at the intersection, the algorithm estimates the time points of each vehicle entering the intersection. An advisory speed limit approach is formulated for each AV, making the vehicle enter the intersection at the allocated timing with the control speed. An onboard alert is set for each HV to stop or pass through. The algorithm is evaluated under various market penetration rates of AVs, different congestion levels, and with signal actuation. The results indicate that the eco-driving algorithm can increase the throughput and average travel speed at signalized intersections in addition to gaining fuel savings.

AB In order to solve the accuracy problem of the future motion prediction of the surrounding vehicles with different types of drivers, this paper proposes a comprehensive lateral motion prediction method that combines driver intention prediction and vehicle behavior recognition. For different drivers, different driver optimization models are established: personal optimal model and system optimal model. Then, the driver's intention prediction probability is obtained through the game theory. Different from the traditional game theory, we apply different model for different driver on the premise of getting the type of driver instead of using the Nash equilibrium for all players. According to the results of driver intention prediction and the vehicle behavior recognition, the optimized polynomial trajectory is used to obtain the driver's intention prediction trajectory and the vehicle behavior recognition trajectory. Next, the Nash-optimization function of the intention prediction trajectory and the behavior recognition trajectory are established respectively according to the trajectory error, and the balance between the two is our comprehensive trajectory. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted simulations under mandatory lane changing and discretionary lane changing conditions. The simulation results show that our algorithm can accurately predict the future motion of the vehicle under different drivers, different speeds and different gaps between vehicles. Its prediction performance is much better than other algorithms.

ID FOREST-FIRE; NETWORKS; MODEL
AB Uninhabited aerial vehicles provide numerous advantages in fighting wildland fires that include persistent operation and elimination of humans from performing what can be dull, dangerous, and dirty work. Multiple cooperating uninhabited aerial vehicles can potentially bring about a paradigm shift in the way we fight complex wildland fires. This paper investigates algorithmic development for cooperative control of a number of uninhabited aerial vehicles engaged in fighting a wildland fire. The paper considers two tasks to be performed by a group of uninhabited aerial vehicles: 1) Cooperative tracking of a fire front for accurate situational awareness, and 2) cooperative, autonomous fire fighting using fire suppressant fluid. The scenario considered in this paper makes the following assumptions: information regarding the location of the fire and position of all uninhabited aerial vehicles is made available to each uninhabited aerial vehicle; and each uninhabited aerial vehicle is equipped with unlimited fire suppressant fluid which extinguishes fire in a circle of specified area directly beneath it. This paper formulates these two tasks of fire fighting based upon optimization of respective utility functions, develops a decentralized control method for the cooperative uninhabited aerial vehicles, and analyzes the system for its stability and its ability to carry out the tasks. The proposed strategies have been verified with the help of extensive simulations. Although simplifying assumptions have been made, this preliminary study presents a framework for path planning and cooperative control of multiple uninhabited aerial vehicles engaged in gathering data and actively fighting forest fires.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) system has played an important role in complex Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT). As we know, single AUV is inefficient in collecting data in large-scale IoUT. In order to improve the timeliness of data, this article uses multiple AUVs with specific formation shape to collect sensory data. However, the intermittent and unreliable characteristics of underwater acoustic communication between AUVs seriously affects the performance of formation control. To solve this issue, this article mainly investigates formation control problem of leade-follower structured AUVs with state prediction estimation under the condition of unreliable underwater acoustic channel. First, a novel formation control law derived from backstepping sliding mode method is proposed, and then, a suitable Lyapunov functional is constructed to prove sufficient stability conditions. Second, Gaussian prediction model considering time delay and packet dropout has been designed to estimate the intermittent communication channel. Moreover, a new metric named formation uniform degree (FUD) is proposed to measure the degree of queue uniformity in a quantitative manner. Finally, extensive simulation results compared with traditional methods based on ideal channel model demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed formation control method.

AB Recent reports from World Health Organization (WHO) show the impact of human negligence as a serious concern for road accidents and casualties worldwide. There are number of reasons which led to this negligence; hence, need of intelligent transportation system (ITS) gains more attention from researchers worldwide. For achieving such autonomy different sensors are involved in autonomous vehicles which can sense road conditions and warn the control system about possible hazards. This work is focused on designing one such sensor system which can detect and range multiple targets under the impact of adverse atmospheric conditions. A high-speed Linear Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (LFMCW) based Photonic Radar is proposed to detect multiple targets by integrating Mode division multiplexing (MDM). Reported results in terms of range frequency, Doppler frequency and range resolution are demonstrated using numerical simulations with the bandwidths of 1 and 4 GHz and under adverse atmospheric conditions carrying 75 dB/km of attenuation. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed photonic radar, moving targets are also demonstrated with different speed. System reported substantial range resolution of 15 cm using 1 GHz of bandwidth and 3 cm using 4 GHz of bandwidth.

AB Voice recognition technology can almost accurately recognize a user's voice in the absence of background noise or when the noise levels are extremely low. However, voice recognition in the presence of background noise with various voice signals is complicated. The problem in the current voice separation scheme is that though voice separation is possible from mixed voice signals, a permutation problem occurs that renders it difficult to identify the desired signal among the separated signals. In this paper, we propose a driver voice separation method for autonomous vehicles. To solve the permutation problem, active-beacon-based driver sound separation (ABDSS) utilizing active sound is used to distinguish the driver's sound. After recording the voice work, simulation was performed. In the simulation, the proposed method succeeded in separating and distinguishing the original voice signals from the mixed voice signals. In addition, the coherence, kurtosis, and skewness calculation were used to verify that the separated signals were correctly identified in the simulation. Therefore, the proposed method is simpler in terms of hardware configuration than the existing methods and it is suitable for in-vehicle voice separation systems as well. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents an optimal robust control method for trajectory tracking of a X-rudder autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) subjects to velocity sensor failures and uncertainties. Two reduced-order extended state observers (ESOs) are designed to estimate the surge and heave velocities, and the estimated values are used to replace all the linear velocity-related parameters in controller design, which helps releasing the requirements of linear velocities measurement and makes the controller robust against linear velocity sensor failures. In kinematics control loop, line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law and Lyapunov-based control are employed, and the unknown attack angle is calculated based on the estimated linear velocities. In dynamics control loop, a robust disturbance rejection control law is constructed using disturbance observers and modified terminal sliding mode control. Moreover, a multi-objective optimization method is proposed to achieve X-rudder allocation, which is not only energy efficient but also robust against rudder failures, and helps tackling the rudder input saturation problem at the same time. Finally, comparative numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB The responsive and dynamic character of liquid crystals (LCs), arising from their ability to self-organize into long-range ordered structures while maintaining fluidity, has given them a role as key enabling materials in the information technology that surrounds us today. Ongoing research hints at future LC-based technologies of entirely different types, for instance by taking advantage of the peculiar behavior of cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) subject to curvature. Spherical shells of CLC reflect light omnidirectionally with specific polarization and wavelength, tunable from the UV to the infrared (IR) range, with complex patterns arising when many of them are brought together. Here, these properties are analyzed and explained, and future application opportunities from an interdisciplinary standpoint are discussed. By incorporating arrangements of CLC shells in smart facades or vehicle coatings, or in objects of high value subject to counterfeiting, game-changing future uses might arise in fields spanning information security, design, and architecture. The focus here is on the challenges of a digitized and information-rich future society where humans increasingly rely on technology and share their space with autonomous vehicles, drones, and robots.

AB Self-driving vehicles (SAE Level 5) are driven by automated vehicle technology and without any human driver input. These vehicles will especially be helpful to people who cannot drive, whether for medical- or age-related reasons. Since the current population of older Americans is the largest it has ever been, it is important to study transportation needs for older population and the potential of self-driving vehicles to solve their mobility problems. This study investigated older adults' (aged 60 and over) perception of self-driving vehicles from the perspective of users and pedestrians. Five factors were measured to assess older adults' perception including attitude, perceived usefulness, social norm, trust, and compatibility. Older adults' willingness to use a self-driving vehicle, defined as acceptance, was also assessed. Data collection (N = 173) was done using an online survey approach. The results show that older adults perceive self-driving vehicles with positive attitude, perceived usefulness, trust, social norm, and acceptance as users. However, as pedestrians, the perception was either neutral or negative, except for the positive perceived usefulness. The results also revealed that if the older adults are familiar with self-driving vehicles, they are more likely to have a favorable perception of them. These results indicate great potential for the adoption of self-driving vehicles by older adults. However, they also raise concern about the interaction between older pedestrians and self-driving vehicles. The findings of this study will be helpful to developers in designing vehicles that meet the transportation needs of older adults and allow effective interaction between them and the vehicles.

AB Lane-keeping assistance design for road vehicles is a multi-objective design problem that needs to simultaneously maintain lane tracking, ensure driver comfort, provide vehicle stability, and minimize conflict between the driver and the autonomous controller. In this work, a cooperative control strategy is proposed for lane-keeping keeping by integrating driving monitoring, variable level of assistance allocation, and human-in-the-loop control. In the first stage, a time-varying physical driver loading pattern is identified based on a relationship between lateral acceleration, road curvature, and the measured maximum driver torque. Together with the monitored driver state that indicates driver mental loading, an adaptive driver activity function is then formulated that replicates the levels of assistance required for the driver in the next stage. To smoothly transition authority between various modes (from manual to autonomous and vice versa) based on the generated levels of assistance, a novel higher-order sliding mode controller is proposed and closed-loop stability is established. Further, a novel sharing parameter (which is proportional to the torques coming from the driver and from the autonomous controller) is used to minimize the conflict. Experimental results on the SHERPA high-fidelity vehicle simulator show the real-time implementation feasibility. Extensive experimental results provided on the Satory test track show improvement in cooperative driving quality by 9.4%, reduction in steering workload by 86.13%, and reduced conflict by 65.38% when compared with the existing design (no sharing parameter). These results on the cooperative performance highlight the significance of the proposed controller for various road transportation challenges.

AB For practical reasons, surveys that aim for a large number of respondents tend to restrict themselves to closed-ended responses. Despite potentially bringing richer insights, the use of open-ended questions poses great challenges in terms of extracting useful information while significantly increasing the analysis time. Nevertheless, automatic text analysis techniques speed up the analysis of open-ended responses. In this research, we explore the potential to use techniques in topic modelling [Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Supervised LDA (sLDA)] to extract information from open-ended responses. This is compared to the information obtained from closed-ended responses, accomplished using a questionnaire that measures the intention to use shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). Two versions of the questionnaire- Ver_OE and Ver_Lk were used, with open-ended and Likert scales measuring the same attitudes in the alternative versions. Factors were extracted for closed-ended questions. For questions common to both versions of the questionnaire, respondents answering Ver_OE had a higher positive attitude towards autonomous vehicles. These attitudinal questions were placed after the open-ended questions. When evaluating the performance of the models that predict the intention to use SAVs, models estimated using Ver_OE performed better. This increased further with the inclusion of the information extracted from the open-ended responses using both, the unsupervised (LDA) and supervised (sLDA) methods. No improvement was observed in the model for Ver_Lk. These indicate the potential for the use of open-ended questions to measure attitudes and topic modelling to extract information from these responses.

AB Nowadays, intelligent systems play an important role in a wide range of applications, including financial ones, smart cities, healthcare, and transportation. Most of the intelligent systems are composed of prefabricated components. Inappropriate composition of components may lead to unsafe, power-consuming, and vulnerable intelligent systems. Although artificial intelligence-based systems can provide various advantages for humanity, they have several dark sides that can affect our lives. Some terms, such as security, trust, privacy, safety, and fairness, relate to the dark sides of artificial intelligence, which may be inherent to the intelligent systems. Existing solutions either focus on solving a specific problem or consider the some other challenge without addressing the fundamental issues of artificial intelligence. In other words, there is no general framework to conduct a component selection process while considering the dark sides in the literature. Hence, in this paper, we proposed a new framework for the component selection of intelligent systems while considering the dark sides of artificial intelligence. This framework consists of four phases, namely, component analyzing, extracting criteria and weighting, formulating the problem as multiple knapsacks, and finding components. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first component selection framework to deal with the dark sides of artificial intelligence. We also developed a case study for the component selection issue in autonomous vehicles to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework. Six components along with four criteria (i.e., energy consumption, security, privacy, and complexity) were analyzed and weighted by experts via analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. The results clearly show that the appropriate composition of components was selected through the proposed framework for the desired functions.

AB A new scheme of LiDAR-embedded smart laser headlight module (LHM) for autonomous vehicles is proposed and demonstrated. The LiDAR sensor was fabricated by LeddarTech with the wavelength of 905-nm, whereas the LHM was fabricated by a highly reliable glass phosphor material that exhibited excellent thermal stability. The LHM consisted of two blue laser diodes, two blue LEDs, a yellow glass phosphor-converter layer with a copper thermal dissipation substrate, and a parabolic reflector to reflect the blue light and the yellow phosphor light combined into white light. The LHM exhibited a total output optical power of 9.5 W, a luminous flux of 4,000 lm, a relative color temperature of 4,300 K, and an efficiency of 421 lm/W. The high-beam patterns of the LHMs were measured to be 180,000 luminous intensity (cd) at 0 degrees (center), 84,000 cd at +/- 2.5 degrees, and 29,600 cd at +/- 5 degrees, which met the ECE R112 class B regulation. The low-beam patterns also satisfied the ECE R112 class B regulation as well. Integrating the signals received from the Lidar detection and CCD image by a smart algorithm, we demonstrated the generation of smart on/off signals for controlling the laser headlights. The recognition rate of the objects was evaluated to be more than 86%. This novel LiDAR-embedded smart LHM with the unique highly reliable glass phosphor-converter layer is favorable as one of the most promising candidates for use in the next-generation high-performance autonomous vehicle applications.

AB This paper analyzes how a central agent may bring a mixed traffic system including both human-driven and autonomous vehicles to an equilibrium that both maximizes the efficiency and is stable under the control. The evolution of the human drivers' route choices, as well as the agent's control measures, is described using a joint day-to-day (DTD) dynamical model based on probability route choice. Within this setting, we show that (1) the fixed point of the proposed dynamical system coincides with the unique mixed equilibrium, and (2) the system is asymptotically stable in continuous time, namely it always converges to the mixed equilibrium from a given initial state. We then examine how alternative control policies may affect the transition trajectory leading to the mixed equilibrium. Two alternative control schemes are proposed and analyzed. The first, referred to as the stability-first control, aims to stabilize a given disequilibrium as soon as possible. The second seeks to minimize the total system cost accumulated over the transition period, hence called the efficiency-first control. We propose a continuous time optimal control formulation for both schemes and discuss how the formulation can be discretized and solved to local optimality using existing algorithms. Numerical experiments conducted on two illustrative examples highlight the differences among the three control schemes and how the share of autonomous vehicles affects the tradeoff between the efficiency and stability of the mixed traffic system.

AB Several converging trends appear to reshape the way citizens and goods move about. These trends are social, including urbanization and population growth, and technological, such as increased automation and connectivity. All these factors influence the market for connected, automated, shared and electric (CASE) vehicles, which presents many opportunities and challenges. The pace of the shift to a profoundly penetrated market for CASE vehicles is far from secure. Such transformation depends on the development of technologies, consumer attitudes, and policies. An expanding body of research has investigated the potential social and behavioral results of deploying CASE vehicles. However, most academic literature to date concentrates on technological issues linked to these vehicles. There are several teams from federal and state agencies, OEMs, academia, startups, and consortiums working on this complex subject. This study investigates several academic papers, as well as federal and industry reports, considering all the stakeholders mentioned above. Its aim is to present a comprehensive picture of the implementation barriers and drivers of CASE vehicle usage and provide suggestions to solve them. The findings confirm that several issues are currently affecting the implementation of CASE vehicles on the road. Although there have been significant partnerships and collaborations between CASE vehicle stakeholders, namely technology companies, federal-state agencies, and academic scholars, considerable work is still required to solve the remaining barriers facing CASE-related technologies. This would enable decision-makers to create effective policies for future transportation networks and increase the speed of CASE vehicle market penetration to enhance road network's level of service.

AB With the rapid development of low-end Internet of Things (IoT) devices and shipborne sensors, efficient multi-source data fusion methods for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) have recently attracted significant research interest in intelligent edge-enabled maritime applications. The data fusion capacity can enhance the situation awareness of ASVs, leading to improved efficacy and safety in ASV-empowered maritime IoT (MIoT). Both cameras and automatic identification system (AIS) equipment, which provide visual and positioning information, respectively, have become the commonly adopted cost-effective sensors. In this work, we first introduce a lightweight YOLOX-s network with transfer learning to accurately and robustly detect the moving vessels at different scales in real time. A data augmentation method is then proposed to promote its generalization ability. The detected vessels and synchronous AIS messages are finally fused to make full use of the multi-source sensing data, contributing to an augmented reality (AR)-based maritime navigation system at the shipborne intelligent edges. The AR system is able to superimpose both static and dynamic information from the collected AIS messages onto the video-captured images. It has the capacity of providing auxiliary information for early warning of navigation risks for ASVs in MIoT networks. Compared with traditional single-sensor-based navigation methods, our data fusion framework exhibits more reliable and robust results, and appears to have substantial practical potential applications. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of our framework under different navigational conditions.

AB Marine science and Internet of Underwater Things applications rely significantly on collecting data from underwater sensors. Data collection using long-distance underwater acoustic communications consumes a lot of energy in underwater sensor nodes, which are powered by batteries. To achieve low-energy consumption, we can use the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to move close to sensor nodes and exploit the short-range and high-rate communications. Most of the existing AUV-based data collection schemes consider the scenarios having the knowledge of node positions, where the cruising trajectory can be computed before the AUV's departure. These schemes cannot apply to some scenarios such as turtle tracking for a certain sea area having no position information. To this end, we first propose a planning-while-detecting approach to dynamically detect the sensors on turtles and adjust the AUV cruising direction to collect data. To further improve data efficiency under the energy limit of the AUV, we group the sensors that can share the same trajectory using their detected directions. A grouping-based dynamic trajectory planning (GDTP) is then proposed to determine the next cruising direction that can visit the group of sensors having the largest amount of data and demanding the least cruising energy at the risk of detection errors. Simulation results show that GDTP achieves significantly higher data collection efficiency than the existing trajectory planning algorithms in dynamic scenarios, and as the communication range increases, it can even outperform the existing algorithms with node locations.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in postdisaster search and rescue operations, object tracking, and other tasks. Therefore, the autonomous perception of UAVs based on computer vision has become a research hotspot in recent years. However, UAV images include dense objects, small objects, and arbitrary object directions, which bring about significant challenges to existing object detection methods. To alleviate these issues, we propose a global-local feature enhanced network (GLF-Net). Considering the difficulty of processing UAV images with complex scenes and dense objects, we designed a backbone based on an involution and self-attention that can extract effective features from complex objects. A multiscale feature fusion module is also proposed to address the presence of numerous small objects in UAV images through multiscale object detection and feature fusion. To accurately detect rotated objects, a rotated regional proposal network was designed based on the midpoint offset representation, which can apply a rotated box to determine the real direction and contour of an object. GLF-Net achieves a state-of-the-art detection accuracy [86.52% mean average precision (mAP)] on our created rotated object detection UAV (RO-UAV) dataset, while achieving 96.95% and 97% mAP on the public datasets high resolution ship collections 2016 (HRSC2016) and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences High Resolution Aerial Object Detection Dataset (UCAS-AOD), respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a high detection accuracy and generalization, which can meet the practical requirements of UAVs under various complex scenarios.

AB In this paper, the problem of identification-based robust motion control of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is investigated. The unknown system parameters are estimated by using an adaptive parameter identifier, whose gains are optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Removing the trial and error procedure and ensuring the convergence property together with fast response, are the benefits of such identification scheme. On the other hand, the system uncertainties, hydrodynamic parameter variations and external disturbances which affect the identified dynamical model, are also taken into account. The cross-coupling effects between subsystems are also considered as model uncertainties. Such uncertain model is then adopted in control synthesis procedure, in the steering and diving modes. In order to achieve the robust stability and performance, two robust control strategies are presented here to solve the motion control problem. First, an mixed sensitivity problem is formulated in which the weighting functions are selected based on an optimization criterion, by using PSO algorithm. Controller order reduction is also applied to the resulting diving and steering controllers, using the Hankel norm approximation. Then, an Adaptive Sliding Mode Control (ASMC), whose sliding surface coefficients are optimized by PSO algorithm, is developed for the identified AUV model. Possessing the robustness properties with respect to system perturbations, the developed Sliding Mode Control (SMC) removes the complexity of uncertain model representation and the limitations on choosing the weighting functions in the control problem. The upper bounds of perturbations are not required to be known in the proposed control schemes. The simulation results are also presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed identification-based control methods.

AB A novel flight route planning design technique is proposed for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) autonomous navigation based on the combination of evolutionary algorithms and modified artificial potential field methods. In this framework, the individual candidate route is capable of avoiding threats by introducing a virtual potential field while taking into account a variety of flight constraints. The candidate flight route is divided into several sections whose lengths are calculated individually such that the corresponding speed of each UAV can be evaluated to ensure that each member arrives at the desired termination simultaneously. The flight route planner has been tested under a variety of scenarios and proven to be effective in achieving the rendezvous of UAVs.

AB This paper explores the effects of day of week and season of year demand variations for shared rides, along with realistic travel party sizes, on shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) services across the Austin, Texas region. Using the agent-based POLARIS program, synthetic person-trips that reflect travel-party size (from one to four persons) and demand variations over days and months, as evident in the National Household Travel Survey data were simulated in each scenario over a 24 h travel day. Results show that realistic party sizes can bring considerable changes to SAV fleet performance, including up to 8.5% higher service rates (number of requests accepted within 15 min), 5 min shorter journey times (wait time + travel time), 28% higher vehicle occupancies on weekends, and roughly 4% lower empty fleet VMT. Weekend travel is most impacted by season of year, with weekday travel patterns looking more uniform (thanks to work and school trips). Various performance metrics for the Austin network, like total and empty VMT, change by up to 30% when considering realistic variations in party size and time of year. This paper underscores the value of recognizing day-to-day and month-to-month variations in travel demand, and the importance of agent-based model equations to reflect travel-party size. Such realism can help quantify SAV seat occupancies more accurately, highlighting the importance of shared mobility. However, it also creates demand and supply issues for operators that now need more information on party size to manage dynamic ride-sharing, or those that may wish to shift their fleet vehicles to other regions for special events to protect profits while offering reasonable wait times to customers throughout the year.

AB The core concept of Internet of Things (IoT) is to equip real world objects with computing, processing, and communicating capabilities to enable socializing between them. Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an adherent of IoT that has realized significant advancements using communication technologies. Vehicles connected through Internet are capable of sharing information that can substantially enhance the quality of traffic on roads. Social IoT (SIoT) is an instance of IoT that deals specifically in socialization of connected objects. SIoT enables the notion of Social IoV (SIoV) where vehicles are the key entities for sharing information between themselves and the infrastructure (commonly known as road side units). Vehicles in SIoV socialize by exchanging data such as traffic congestions, weather conditions, infotainment, vacant parking slots, alternate routes, and discount coupons for restaurants. In SIoV, vehicles can communicate with other vehicles and infrastructure through traditional communication technologies like Wi-Fi, cellular networks or through dedicated short range communication, etc. SIoV will be confronted with ethical dilemmas and expected to function in an ethically responsible manner. This paper highlights the ethical implications of SIoV systems. Vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure involves autonomous decision making that requires setting ethical and moral rules before taking verdict. This paper discusses the lack of ethical guidelines in designing and deploying of SIoV systems that are of utmost importance. Finally, an addition to SIoV architecture is proposed to incorporate the ethical and moral principles for scheming the SIoV systems.

AB Vehicle classification is a challenging task in the area of image processing. It involves the classification of various vehicles based on their color, model, and make. A distinctive variety of vehicles belonging to various model categories have been developed in the automobile industry, which has made it necessary to establish a compact system that can classify vehicles within a complex model group. A well-established vehicle classification system has applications in security, vehicle monitoring in traffic cameras, route analysis in autonomous vehicles, and traffic control systems. In this paper, a hybrid model based on the integration of a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and an evolutionary feature selection model is proposed for vehicle classification. The proposed model performs classification of eight different vehicle categories including sports cars, luxury cars and hybrid power-house SUVs. The used in this work is derived from Stanford car dataset that contains almost 196 cars and vehicle classes. After performing appropriate data preparation and preprocessing steps, feature learning and extraction is carried out using pre-trained VGG16 first that learns and extracts deep features from the set of input images. These features are then taken out of the last fully connected layer of VGG16, and feature optimization phase is carried out using evolution-based nature-inspired optimization model Genetic Algorithm (GA). The classification is performed using numerous SVM kernels where Cubic SVM achieves an accuracy of 99.7% and outperforms other kernels as well as excels in terns of performance as compared to the existing works.

AB The automotive industry is undergoing a deep revolution. With the race towards autonomous driving, the amount of technologies, sensors and actuators that need to be integrated in the vehicle increases exponentially. This imposes new great challenges in the vehicle electric/electronic (E/E) architecture and, especially, in the In-Vehicle Network (IVN). In this work, we analyze the evolution of IVNs, and focus on the main network processing platform integrated in them: the Gateway (GW). We derive the requirements of Network Processing Platforms that need to be fulfilled by future GW controllers focusing on two perspectives: functional requirements and structural requirements. Functional requirements refer to the functionalities that need to be delivered by these network processing platforms. Structural requirements refer to design aspects which ensure the feasibility, usability and future evolution of the design. By focusing on the Network Processing architecture, we review the available options in the state of the art, both in industry and academia. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each architecture in terms of the coverage provided for the functional and structural requirements. In our analysis, we detect a gap in this area: there is currently no architecture fulfilling all the requirements of future automotive GW controllers. In light of the available network processing architectures and the current technology landscape, we identify Hardware (HW) accelerators and custom processor design as a key differentiation factor which boosts the devices performance. From our perspective, this points to a need - and a research opportunity - to explore network processing architectures with a strong HW focus, unleashing the potential of next-generation network processors and supporting the demanding requirements of future autonomous and connected vehicles.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) boosts road safety, efficiency, and infotainment by connecting vehicles to form the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Specifically to safety, IoV complements autonomous cars beyond sensors' line-of-sight, facilitating vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications in a smart transportation environment. The correctness of data exchanged among vehicles is paramount to ensure vehicles behave as per norms. Traditional misbehavior detection methods hardly defend vehicular security effectively due to rapid dynamics and location privacy. In particular, those node-centric classifiers become ill-fit in IoV. This work proposes a data-centric misbehavior detection model based on supervised machine learning (ML). The work also integrates plausibility checks with ML techniques and instantiates the model with six algorithms to demonstrate their comparative effectiveness. In addition to misbehavior detection, the model classifies attack types to support validating countermeasures. Specifically, the work analyzes the supervised learning algorithms for detecting misbehavior in IoV, compares their performance, and identifies their limitations. VeReMi, a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) position forgery attack built-in simulated road traffic data set, is used to test the effectiveness of the proposed model. The performance metrics include precision-recall (PR) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and significance of ML to detect misbehavior in IoV. The addition of plausibility checks improves the precision and recall by 5% and 2%, respectively.

AB Road accidents wreck lives. Could technology stop them from happening? Driving better road safety with technology and artificial intelligence are the key elements considered by several carmakers. The key aspect of transportation in the future is to build an ecosystem comprising autonomous, connected, electric and shared mobility. The evolution of autonomous vehicles (AVs) can potentially aid transportation to people and be deployed to resolve mobility-related pain for drivers and safety on roads while changing lanes. Thus, the intelligent assistance system should be smart enough to track such vehicles while deviating into another lane. In this paper, we propose a lane change prediction framework for feature learning, with the aim to have a deep and comprehensive understanding of lane change behaviors, meanwhile, reach a high performance based on the selected features. A time-step dataset with more than 1000 features is constructed from vehicle trajectory data. To identify the key features involved in the original feature set, an XGBoost-based three-step feature learning algorithm is proposed, which integrates the feature importance ranking, metric selection and recursive feature elimination. After analyzing the accuracy of test data from different time segment positions, the sliding window method is applied on a time-step dataset with filtered features to properly select time segments, which are flattened into corresponding time-series dataset for model prediction. In our case studies, a publicly available dataset, Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM), is adopted to conduct experiments of feature learning and lane change prediction, where we achieved a new state-of-art accuracy with 97.6% under the time-series data of 75 selected features and 1-second window size with predictor XGBoost after adopting proposed three-step method, which is superior to the other state-of-the-art feature selection methods.

AB In order to facilitate rapid prototyping and testing in the advanced motorsport industry, we consider the problem of imitating and outperforming professional race car drivers based on demonstrations collected on a high-fidelity Driver-in-the-Loop (DiL) hardware simulator. We formulate a contextual reinforcement learning problem to learn a human-like and stochastic policy with domain-informed choices for states, actions, and reward functions. To leverage very limited training data and build human-like diverse behavior, we fit a probabilistic model to the expert demonstrations called the reference distribution, draw samples out of it, and use them as context for the reinforcement learning agent with context-specific states and rewards. In contrast to the non-human-like stochasticity introduced by Gaussian noise, our method contributes to a more effective exploration, better performance and a policy with human-like variance in evaluation metrics. Compared to previous work using a behavioral cloning agent, which is unable to complete competitive laps robustly, our agent outperforms the professional driver used to collect the demonstrations by around 0.4 seconds per lap on average, which is the first time known to the authors that an autonomous agent has outperformed a top-class professional race driver in a state-of-the-art, high-fidelity simulation. Being robust and sensitive to vehicle setup changes, our agent is able to predict plausible lap time and other performance metrics. Furthermore, unlike traditional lap time calculation methods, our agent indicates not only the gain in performance but also the driveability when faced with modified car balance, facilitating the digital twin of the DiL simulation.

AB Validation and Verification (V&V) of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based cyber physical systems such as Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is currently a vexing and unsolved problem. AVs integrate subsystems in areas such as detection, sensor fusion, localization, perception, and path planning. Each of these subsystems contains significant AI content integrated with traditional hardware and software components. The complexity for validating even a subsystem is daunting and the task of validating the whole system is nearly impossible. Fundamental research in advancing the state-of-the-art for AV V&V is required. However, for V&V researchers, it is exceedingly difficult to make progress because of the massive infrastructure requirements to demonstrate the viability of any solution. This paper presents PolyVerif, the world's first open-source solution focused on V&V researchers with the objective of accelerating the state-of-the-art for AV V&V research. PolyVerif provides an AI design and verification framework consisting of a digital twin creation process, an open-source AV engine, access to several open-source physics based simulators, and open-source symbolic test generation engines. PolyVerif's objective is to arm V&V researchers with a framework which extends the state-of-the-art on any one of the many major axes of interest and use the remainder of the infrastructure to quickly demonstrate the viability of their solution. Given its open-source nature, researchers can also contribute their innovations to the project. Using this critical property of open-source environments, the innovation rate of the whole research community to solve these vexing issues can be greatly accelerated. Finally, the paper also presents results from several projects which have used PolyVerif.

AB This work addresses the problem of robust tracking control for skid-steer mobile platforms, using tube-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control. The strategy seeks to mitigate the impact of disturbances propagated to autonomous vehicles originated by traction losses. To this end, a dynamical model composed by two coupled sub-systems stands for lateral and longitudinal vehicle dynamics and fire behavior. The controller is aimed at tracking prescribed stable operation points of the slip and side-slip beyond the robot pose and speeds. To reach robust tracking performance on the global system, a centralized control scheme operates under a predictive control framework composed by three control actions. The first one compensates for disturbances using the reference trajectory-feedforward control. The second control action corrects the errors generated by the modeling mismatch. The third one is devoted to ensure robustness on the closed-loop system whilst compensating for deviations of the state trajectories from the nominal ones (i.e. disturbance-free). The strategy ensures robust feasibility even when tightening constraints are met. Such constraints are calculated on-line based on robust positively invariant sets characterized by polytopic sets (tubes), including a terminal region to guarantee robustness. The benefits of the controller regarding tracking performance, constraint satisfaction and computational practicability were tested through simulations with a Cat (R) 262C skid-steer model. Then, in field tests, the controller evidenced high tracking accuracy against terrain disturbances when benchmarking performance with respect to inherent robust predictive controllers.

TI How PTV Vissim Has Been Calibrated for the Simulation of Automated

SO ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; TRAFFIC CONDITIONS; BEHAVIOR; IMPACTS
AB Recently, in the literature, microscopic simulation is one of the most attractive methods in impact assessment of automated vehicles (AVs) on traffic flow. AVs can be divided into different categories, each having different driving characteristics. Hence, calibrating microscopic simulators for different AV categories could be challenging in AVs' impact assessment. The PTV Vissim microscopic traffic simulation software has been calibrated for simulating diverse types of AVs in a large body of literature. There are two main streams of studies in literature adapting AVs' driving behaviors in Vissim following either internal (i.e., adjusting the parameters of the Vissim's default driving behavior models) or external (i.e., adapting AVs' behavior through external VISSIM interfaces) modeling approaches. The current paper investigates how the PTV Vissim has been internally calibrated for the simulation of different types of AVs and compares the calibrated values in the literature with default values introduced in the recent version of PTV Vissim. In the present paper, the reviewed studies are partitioned into two main categories according to the characteristics of the studied AVs, the studies focused on autonomous automated vehicles (AAVs) and the ones focused on cooperative automated vehicles (CAVs). Our findings indicate that the literature expects a lower value for parameters including standstill distance (CC0), headway time (CC1), following variation (CC2), the threshold for entering "following" (CC3), negative/positive following thresholds (CC4/CC5), speed dependency of oscillation (CC6), oscillation acceleration (CC7), safety distance reduction factor (SDRF), and minimum headway front/rear (MinHW) for AVs than conventional vehicles (CVs). Besides, the literature expects higher values for parameters including standstill acceleration (CC8), acceleration at 80 km/h (CC9), looking distances, and maximum deceleration for cooperative braking (MaxDCB) for AVs. When cautious AVs are introduced, deterring effects are expected in the literature (e.g., higher CC0). Moreover, CAVs can have higher looking distance values compared with AAVs.

DE Intelligent vehicle; trajectory planning; basic path planning; fast-bias

AB A novel driving-behavior-oriented method is proposed in this paper for improving trajectory planning performance of autonomous vehicle driving on urban structural road. Differ from the irregularity and unpredictability of escaping a maze or travelling on off-road, the driving on road emphasizes more on the compliance of road traffic rules and the satisfaction of passenger comfort rather than purely pursuing the shortest route or the shortest time. Therefore, the driving-behavior-oriented framework is employed in trajectory planning, which divides trajectory into lane change, turn and U-turn, according to the basic traffic rules and the daily behaviors of drivers. The presented approach mainly includes basic path planning, fast-bias RRT path planning and velocity planning. The basic path planning consists of lane change, turn and U-turn behaviors, which generates smooth path with continuous curvature. In order to ensure the completeness of the programming algorithm, a fast-bias RRT (FB-RRT) algorithm is embedded. As guiding by the driving behavior, normal random, goal-bias and Gaussian sampling strategies are fused to form FB-RRT, which could make the best use of the basic path planning and reduce the randomness of node's extension to save the computation time. After collision-free path generating, cubic polynomial curve is employed to schedule velocity profile for coping with vehicle stability requirements, actuator constraints and comfort conditions. The planner has been tested in simulation and a real vehicle in various typical scenarios. Test results illustrate that the presented method could generate a trajectory with controllable extrema of curvature as well as with continuous and smooth enough curvature. Besides, generated trajectory has short length, high success rate (no less than 80% average success rate in complex environment) and real time (the average period is less than 100 ms). Moreover, the velocity profile meets the vehicle stability requirements, actuator constraints, and comfort conditions.

AB The hydrodynamic interaction between an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) manoeuvring in close proximity to a larger underwater vehicle can cause rapid changes in the motion of the AUV. This interaction can lead to mission failure and possible vehicle collision. Being self-piloted and comparatively small, an AUV is more susceptible to these interaction effects than the larger body. In an aim to predict the manoeuvring performance of an AUV under the effects of the interaction, the Australian Maritime College (AMC) has conducted a series of computer simulations and captive model experiments. A numerical model was developed to simulate pure sway motion of an AUV at different lateral and longitudinal positions relative to a larger underwater vehicle using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFDs). The variables investigated include the surge force, sway force and the yaw moment coefficients acting on the AUV due to interaction effects, which were in turn validated against experimental results. A simplified method is presented to obtain the hydrodynamic coefficients of an AUV when operating close to a larger underwater body by transforming the single body hydrodynamic coefficients of the AUV using the steady-state interaction forces. This method is considerably less time consuming than traditional methods. Furthermore, the inverse of this method (i.e. to obtain the steady state interaction force) is also presented to obtain the steady-state interaction force at multiple lateral separations efficiently. Both the CFD model and the simplified methods have been validated against the experimental data and are capable of providing adequate interaction predictions. Such methods are critical for accurate prediction of vehicle performance under varying conditions present in real life. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The estimation of road excitation profile is important for evaluation of vehicle stability and vehicle suspension performance for autonomous vehicle control systems. In this work, the nonlinear dynamics of the active automotive system that is excited by the unknown road excitation profile are considered for modeling. To address the issue of estimation of road profile, we develop an adaptive supertwisting observer for state and unknown road profile estimation. Under Lipschitz conditions for the nonlinear functions, the convergence of the estimation error is proven. Simulation results with Ford Fiesta MK2 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed observer for state and unknown input estimation for nonlinear active suspension system.

The controller is composed of fuzzy PD control with membership function tuning by linguistic hedge. A neural network compensator approximates the dynamics of the UVMS in decentralized form. The new controller has the advantages of simplicity of implementation due to decentralized design, precision, and robustness to payload variations and hydrodynamic disturbances. It has significantly low energy consumption compared to both the conventional PD and conventional fuzzy control methods. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is illustrated by results of simulations for a six degrees of freedom autonomous underwater vehicle with a three degrees of freedom on-board manipulator.

The vehicle, operated from RRS James Clark Ross, obtained more than 450 track-km of under-ice multibeam data. We show imagery from first- and multiyear ice, including young ridges, old hummocks and undeformed melting ice. In addition, we show how the combination of other on-board sensors enabled the vehicle to obtain detailed information about seabed topography, water structure and current fields in an exploratory mode within a region which is seldom visited because of difficult year-round ice conditions. This included identification of a new current regime in the Norske Trough.

AB Autonomous driving with artificial intelligence technology has been viewed as promising for autonomous vehicles hitting the road in the near future. In recent years, considerable progress has been made with Deep Reinforcement Learnings (DRLs) for realizing end-to-end autonomous driving. Still, driving safely and comfortably in real dynamic scenarios with DRL is nontrivial due to the reward functions being typically pre-defined with expertise. This paper proposes a human-in-the-loop DRL algorithm for learning personalized autonomous driving behavior in a progressive learning way. Specifically, a progressively optimized reward function (PORF) learning model is built and integrated into the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) framework, which is called PORF-DDPG in this paper. PORF consists of two parts: the first part of the PORF is a pre-defined typical reward function on the system state, the second part is modeled as a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for representing driving adjusting intention by the human observer, which is the main contribution of this paper. The DNN-based reward model is progressively learned using the front-view images as the input and via active human supervision and intervention. The proposed approach is potentially useful for driving in dynamic constrained scenarios when dangerous collision events might occur frequently with classic DRLs.

AB Timely and reliable information sharing among autonomous vehicles (AVs) provides a promising approach for reducing traffic congestion and improving traffic efficiency in future intelligent transportation systems. In this paper, we consider millimeter-wave (mmWave) based multi-hop vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications to facilitate ultra-reliable low-latency information sharing among AVs. We propose a novel framework for performance analysis and design of relay selection schemes in mmWave multi-hop V2V communications, while taking into account the mmWave signal propagation characteristics, road topology, and traffic conditions. In particular, considering the minimum tracking distance requirement of road traffic, the headway, i.e., the distance between adjacent AVs, is modeled as shifted-exponential distribution. Moreover, we model the communication path losses using the Manhattan distance metric in the taxicab geometry, which can more accurately capture the characteristics of mmWave signal propagation in urban grid roads than conventional Euclidean distance geometry. Based on the proposed model, we investigate the latency and reliability of mmWave multi-hop V2V communications for three widely adopted relay selection schemes, i.e., random with forward progress (RFP), most forward with fixed radius (MFR), and nearest with forward progress (NFP), respectively. Furthermore, we propose a novel relay selection scheme for joint optimization of the single-hop forward progress (FP) and single-hop latency according to the AVs' instantaneous locations and an estimate of the residual multi-hop latency. Simulation results show that, by balancing the current single-hop latency and the residual multi-hop latency for the multi-hop V2V network, the proposed relay selection scheme significantly outperforms the MFR, NFP and RFP in both multi-hop transmission latency and reliability of mmWave V2V communications.

AB This article deals with the motion of a hovering unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with six degrees of freedom. The effects of the motion on the measured signal of a multiple-input multiple-output radar mounted underneath the UAV are analyzed. For each degree of freedom, namely the translation in x, y, and z directions as well as the rotation around x, y, and z axes, an algorithm is proposed to compensate the considered motion. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated by measuring validated vital signs independent of the current UAV motion.

AB Supporting policies are required to govern the (unintended) negative consequences of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) implementation and to maximize their benefits. The first step towards formulating policies is to identify the potential impacts of AVs. While the impacts of AVs on the economy, environment, and society are well explored, the discussion around their beneficial and adverse impacts on public health is still in its infancy. Based on evidence from previous systematic reviews about AVs' impacts, we developed a conceptual model in this study to systematically identify the potential health impacts of AVs in cities. The proposed model, first, summarizes the potential changes in transportation after AV implementation into seven points of impact: (1) transportation infrastructure, (2) land use and the built environment, (3) traffic flow, (4) transportation mode choice, (5) transportation equity, (6) jobs related to transportation, and (7) traffic safety. Second, transportation-related risk factors that affect health are outlined. Third, information from the first two steps is consolidated, and the potential pathways between AVs and public health are formulated. Based on the proposed model, we found that AVs can impact public health through 32 pathways, of which 17 can adversely impact health, eight can positively impact health, and seven are uncertain. The health impacts of AVs are contingent upon supporting policies. Equipping AVs with electric motors, regulating urban area development, implementing traffic demand management strategies, controlling AV ownership, and imposing ride-sharing policies are some strategies that can reinforce the positive impacts of AVs on public health.

AB This study proposes an adaptive non-singular integral terminal sliding mode control (ANITSMC) scheme for trajectory tracking of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with dynamic uncertainties and time-varying external disturbances. The ANITSMC is first proposed for a first-order uncertain non-linear dynamic system to eliminate the singularity problem in conventional terminal sliding mode control (TSMC) and avoid the requirement of the bound information of the lumped system uncertainty. The time taken to reach the equilibrium point from any initial error is guaranteed to be finite. The proposed ANITSMC is then applied to trajectory tracking control of AUVs. It guarantees that the velocity tracking errors locally converge to zero in finite time and after that the position tracking errors locally converge to zero exponentially. The designed ANITSMC of AUVs avoids the requirement of the prior knowledge of the lumped system uncertainty bounds as opposite to the existing globally finite-time stable tracking control (GFTSTC), provides higher tracking accuracy than the existing GFTSTC and adaptive non-singular TSMC (ANTSMC) and offers faster convergence rate and better robustness against dynamic uncertainties and time-varying external disturbances than the adaptive proportional-integral sliding mode control (APISMC). Comparative simulation results are presented to validate the superiority of the ANITSMC over the APISMC.

AB With the popularization of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology, mixed traffic flows that consist of AVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) will appear in the real world. Although many studies of the features of mixed traffic flow have been carefully evaluated, few studies have focused on the effect of aggressive driving performance on mixed traffic flow. This study aims to develop an approach to evaluate the effects of aggressive driving on the stability and capacity performance under the conditions of AV and HDV mixed traffic flow. First, since a car-following model can describe the relationship between vehicles, we calibrate a car-following model for aggressive driving and nonaggressive driving behaviors based on real traffic data and previous research results. Then, in a mixed traffic flow environment, a basic linear stability formula and capacity calculation expression are developed that consider the effects of vehicle order on the capacity. Finally, because the proportion of aggressive driving and aggressive driving parameters may change, nine combinations of three aggressive driving proportions and three driving parameter cases are used for the sensitivity analysis. The results indicate that the effect of aggressive driving on mixed traffic flow is complex. When the proportion of aggressive driving is less than 35%, the increase in the proportion of aggressive driving increases the traffic capacity and reduces the unstable part. However, when the proportion of aggressive driving is greater than 35%, the increase in the proportion of aggressive driving increases the unstable part. When the penetration rate of AVs exceeds 0.490, mixed traffic flow remains stable at all aggressive driving proportions. In addition, the capacity of a mixed traffic flow may be improved as the penetration rate of AVs increases. To a certain extent, these conclusions provide a theoretical basis for formulating different management modes of AVs and HDVs.

AB Since the advent of deep belief network deep learning technology in 2006, artificial intelligence technology has been utilized in various convergence areas, such as autonomous driving and medical care. Some services requiring fast decision making and action typically work seamlessly with edge computing service model. In autonomous driving of a connected vehicle with vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, roadside unit (RSU) acts as an edge computing device and it will make safer service by processing V2X messages fast, sent by vehicles or other devices. IEEE 1609.2 standard provides application message security technology to ensure the security and reliability of vehicle-to-vehicle communication messages. It uses elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) signatures based on the NIST p256 curve for message authenticity. In this paper, we investigate that RSU should be able to verify 3500 ECDSA signatures per second considering the expected maximum number of vehicles on nearby roads (e.g., during rush hour), message transmission rate, and IEEE 802.11p wireless channel capacity. RSU should satisfy this requirement without assistance of hardware-based cryptographic accelerator. For the requirement, we propose a hybrid approach of parallel ECDSA signature verification at high speed by using CPU and GPU, simultaneously. Moreover, we implemented the proposed method in various modern computing environments for RSU and edge computing devices. Through the experiments, we reach the conclusion that GPU can contribute to the required performance of ECDSA signature verification in RSU platform, which could not satisfy the above throughput only with CPU unit. The target platform with Intel Pentium E6500 CPU and GeForce GTX650 GPU can verify 5668 signatures per second with 30% utilization, while CPU in the platform can process only 2640 signatures. Even in a higher-performance edge computing device, we examine experimentally that the performance can be further improved by using the proposed hybrid approach.

AB Today AUVs operation still remains restricted to very particular tasks with low real autonomy due to battery restrictions. Efficient path planning and mission scheduling are principle requirement toward advance autonomy and facilitate the vehicle to handle long-range operations. A single vehicle cannot carry out all tasks in a large scale terrain; hence, it needs a certain degree of autonomy in performing robust decision making and awareness of the mission/environment to trade-off between tasks to be completed, managing the available time, and ensuring safe deployment at all stages of the mission. In this respect, this research introduces a modular control architecture including higher/lower level planners, in which the higher level module is responsible for increasing mission productivity by assigning prioritized tasks while guiding the vehicle toward its final destination in a terrain covered by several waypoints; and the lower level is responsible for vehicle's safe deployment in a smaller scale encountering time varying ocean current and different uncertain static/moving obstacles similar to actual ocean environment. Synchronization between higher and lower level modules is efficiently configured to manage the mission time and to guarantee on-time termination of the mission. The performance and accuracy of two higher and lower level modules are tested and validated using ant colony and firefly optimization algorithm, respectively. After all, the overall performance of the architecture is investigated in 10 different mission scenarios. The analysis of the captured results from different simulated missions confirms the efficiency and inherent robustness of the introduced architecture in efficient time management, safe deployment, and providing beneficial operation by proper prioritizing the tasks in accordance with mission time.

AB Machine vision based vehicle re-identification (ReID) plays an important role in some Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Yet, most previous methods mainly focus on fixed surveillance cameras instead of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). With high flexibility, the UAV-based vehicle ReID problem has some special challenges including complicated shooting angles, low discrimination of top-down features, and large variance in vehicle scales, etc. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel structure for UAV-based vehicle ReID without license plates. Firstly, a triple-head segmentation net is proposed for segmenting UAV-captured vehicles under different heights and directions. Secondly, a posture calibration model is designed to uniform the vehicle postures based on the segmentation results, with the purpose of reducing the influence of different postures. Thirdly, the novel Cross-View & Hard-Sensitive Metric Learning (CHSML) method is proposed to train a ReID network with cross-view training constraint and hard sensitive principles; the mechanism of CHSML takes the cross-view samples of same ID as a training unit to learn the potential visual relationship in cross-view and builds a hard sensitive weight matrix to make learning more focus on hard samples, which improves the low ReID accuracy brought by cross-view or hard samples. Moreover, to facilitate the research of UAV-based vehicle ReID, a large-scale UAV-based vehicle ReID dataset called VeRi-UAV is released with 17,516 vehicles of 453 IDs. The experiments show that the proposed structure gains a better performance compared with the representative methods in the UAV-based vehicle ReID task.

AB This paper presents a model predictive control-based fault detection and reconstruction algorithm for longitudinal control of autonomous driving using a multi-sliding mode observer. In order to secure the safe longitudinal control of a vehicle, a numbers of factors must be ensured, such as the reliability of the longitudinal information, the data on the forward object from the environment sensor, and the acceleration of the ego vehicle. Thus, we propose a reasonable failure detection scheme for the acceleration signal of the host vehicle and the relative values of the front object of the radar. In order to identify the faults of the radar and the vehicle acceleration sensor related to the automated longitudinal control, the multiple sliding mode observer and prediction of model predictive control (MPC) algorithm are applied. The relative acceleration is reconstructed by applying a sliding mode observer (SMO) with clearance and relative speed measurements. The upper and lower limits of longitudinal acceleration were computed by analyzing human driving data under the preceding vehicle and reconstructed acceleration. A proper acceleration range can be defined precisely based on several reconstructed upper and lower bounds by using a multiple sliding mode observer with stored prediction data of relative values, making it possible to effectively identify the fault of the host vehicle's acceleration sensor. By applying MPC for this study, optimal control input and prediction of relative states can be obtained that are more reasonable than those using the linear prediction model. The proposed fault detection algorithm can identify the abnormal state of the environment sensors by using the accumulated past sensor data. By comparing the stored prediction of relative states with the stored data on current states for a given period, the signal faults of the longitudinal target information can be detected from environment sensors. With these fault indices of states, the final fault diagnoses of sensors can be determined by assessing confidence through statistical analysis of 27 sets of normal driving data. In order to obtain a reasonable performance evaluation, this study uses actual driving data and a 3D full vehicle model constructed in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The test results reveal that the proposed algorithm can successfully detect the fault of the radar and acceleration sensor of the automated driving vehicle.

AB Modeling and simulation (M&S) plays a critical role in both engineering and basic research processes. However, M&S is only truly useful if the model and simulation outputs are accurate. As such, significant research has been undertaken to establish what "accurate" means for simulations and what subsequent level of "trust" should be given to M&S outputs. Trust in M&S outputs is established by verifying and validating the models and simulations. While a wealth of research can be found to define verification and validation (V&V) for traditional M&S, little research has been done to define a methodology for the V&V of simulations of complex, intelligent, and autonomous systems. Specifically, no methodology for V&V of simulations of autonomous robots has been developed to date. This paper presents a brief overview of the current V&V methods in use for traditional simulations. In light of this review, a novel framework for the V&V of simulations for predicting the behaviors of autonomous robots is developed, and this framework is presented in detail. This V&V framework is then applied to the use-case of an autonomous unmanned ground vehicle's (UGV's) navigation task. The framework is applied for model validation of Global Positioning System (GPS), inertial measurement unit (IMU), and RGB camera sensor models. The framework is further applied to validate these sensor models for an example camera-based autonomous navigation algorithm, stop sign detection.

AB The traditional signalized intersection is no longer able to meet the increasing demands of transportation. A method combining autonomous intersection management (AIM) and connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is suggested for solving existing traffic problems. This study proposes a control method for unsignalized intersections based on cooperative grouping, which discretizes the continuous traffic flow into a series of small-scale vehicle groups. In addition, a Petri Net model with a progressive structure is proposed, for which the time domain sequence of each group is strictly defined. To realize the global control of CAVs, the whole process of vehicle movement is decomposed into two processes: i) adjustment on branches and ii) coordination in the junction. All grouping conditions in the junction are clearly defined, and time windows are used for the discrete traffic flow modeling. Furthermore, a cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) model with bifurcations is proposed for grouping and following the control of vehicles on each branch. Simulation results show that vehicles are automatically grouped according to their initial positions, and no collision occurs during the whole process. Applied with the proposed method, the traffic capacity of a four-branch intersection exceeds 10000 veh/h under ideal conditions. The vehicles run more smoothly and show a better fuel economy than the other two methods.

AB This paper studies the cooperative control of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with sensors and autonomous flight capabilities. In this paper, an architecture is proposed that takes a small quadrotor as a mission UAV and a large six-rotor as a platform UAV to provide an aerial take-off and landing platform and transport carrier for the mission UAV. The design of a tracking controller for an autonomous docking and landing trajectory system is the focus of this research. To examine the system's overall design, a dual-machine trajectory-tracking control simulation platform is created via MATLAB/Simulink. Then, an autonomous docking and landing trajectory-tracking controller based on radial basis function proportional-integral-derivative control is designed, which fulfills the trajectory-tracking control requirements of the autonomous docking and landing process by efficiently suppressing the external airflow disturbance according to the simulation results. A YOLOv3-based vision pilot system is designed to calibrate the rate of the aerial docking and landing position to eight frames per second. The feasibility of the multi-rotor aerial autonomous docking and landing technology is verified using prototype flight tests during the day and at night. It lays a technical foundation for UAV transportation, autonomous take-off, landing in the air, and collaborative networking. In addition, compared with the existing technologies, our research completes the closed loop of the technical process through modeling, algorithm design and testing, virtual simulation verification, prototype manufacturing, and flight test, which have better realizability.

AB This paper investigates control design for the platoon of automated vehicles whose sensors have limited sensing capability. A novel hybrid platoon model is established, in which actuator delay (e. g., the fueling and braking delay) and the effect of sensing range limitation are involved. Based on the new model, a framework of guaranteed-cost controller design is presented, which can robustly stabilize the platoon of vehicles with a given level of disturbance attenuation. The obtained controller is complemented by additional conditions that were established to guarantee string stability and zero steady-state spacing error, yielding a useful string-stable platoon control algorithm. The effectiveness and advantage of the presented methodology is demonstrated by both numerical simulations and experiments with laboratory-scale Arduino cars.

The path following controller is divided into two parts: one part generating a heading command and another part designing a robust control. To determine the reference heading command under various uncertainties, the vector field method is employed, and then the RISE feedback controller is designed to follow the heading command.

AB Studies on self-driving transport vehicles have focused on longitudinal and lateral driving strategies in automated structured road scenarios. In this study, a double parallel network (DP-Net) combined with longitudinal and lateral strategy networks is constructed for self-driving transport vehicles in structured road scenarios, which is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory network (LSTM). First, in feature extraction and perception, a preprocessing module is introduced that can ensure the effective extraction of visual information under complex illumination. Then, a parallel CNN sub-network is designed that is based on multifeature fusion to ensure better autonomous driving strategies. Meanwhile, a parallel LSTM sub-network is designed, which uses vehicle kinematic features as physical constraints to improve the prediction accuracy for steering angle and speed. The Udacity Challenge II dataset is used as the training set with the proposed DP-Net input requirements. Finally, for the proposed DP-Net, the root mean square error (RMSE) is used as the loss function, the mean absolute error (MAE) is used as the metric, and Adam is used as the optimization method. Compared with competing models such as PilotNet, CgNet, and E2E multimodal multitask network, the proposed DP-Net is more robust in handling complex illumination. The RMSE and MAE values for predicting the steering angle of the E2E multimodal multitask network are 0.0584 and 0.0163 rad, respectively; for the proposed DP-Net, those values are 0.0107 and 0.0054 rad, i.e., 81.7% and 66.9% lower, respectively. In addition, the proposed DP-Net also has higher accuracy in speed prediction. Upon testing the collected SYSU Campus dataset, good predictions are also obtained. These results should provide significant guidance for using a DP-Net to deploy multi-axle transport vehicles.

AB The interest in using drones in various applications has grown significantly in recent years. The reasons are related to the continuous advances in technology, especially the advent of fast mi-croprocessors, which support intelligent autonomous control of several systems. Photography, construction, and monitoring and surveillance are only some of the areas in which the use of drones is becoming common. Among these, last-mile delivery is one of the most promising areas. In this work we focus on routing problems with drones, mostly in the context of parcel delivery. We survey and classify the existing works and we provide perspectives for future research.

AB In this paper, the heading control of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle is improved in order to counteract the undesirable effect of the waves in the actuators system. Wave filter suggested is a linear passive observer and includes features like estimation of both the low frequency heading and heading rate of the vehicle from noisy measurement of an Inertial Measurement Unit, removing the oscillatory component. Matlab/Simulink tool is used to show the proposed solution into the control loop, its performance and the simulation with real data. The experimental results confirm the suitable filtering, the estimating properties of the observer and the navigation response expected, reducing control action and thus vibrations of the rudder.

The flow regime for a survey-class AUV is defined, and a mathematically optimal velocity results for these energy-limited vehicles. A range-maximal hotel load is one of the inferences. Cavitation is shown not to affect this type of AUV. Environmental and computational problems of turbulence are discussed. A table of vital statistics of contemporary survey-class AUVs is provided.

AB In this paper, we propose a highway merging method to enhance vehicle autonomy in the highway travelling. The proposed decision making algorithm includes a Modified Intelligent Driver Model (MIDM) based vehicle distance adjustment and path prediction for collision avoidance. In order to maximise the safety and driving efficiency, a time optimal target is selected when the front and rear gap conditions that secure the merging safety are not satisfied. The suggested algorithm is implemented by a lane change manoeuvre and Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) that are based on a control strategy inspired by the brain limbic system. In order to demonstrate the performance of the suggested merging strategy, the concept of Level of Service (LOS) is utilised in the simulations.

AB This paper presents an idea for controlling the formation flight of unmanned aerial vehicles. Formation flight control with a leader-follower configuration based on position and velocity errors has proven to be problematic, especially during the activation of formation flight mode with large distances between leader and follower, and with large differences in leader and follower heading angles. Proposed formation flight control scheme is composed of two stages - guidance on a leader and precise leader following. Synthesis of the two stage switching controller is described, implemented and presented. Proposed control system was checked and verified during simulation tests. Leader and follower flight parameters were presented and analyzed. Proposed control algorithm improves formation flight organization. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB In this letter, we consider a secure offloading system consisting of a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted edge server, ground user equipments (UEs) and a malicious eavesdropper UAV. With the aim of maximizing secrecy sum-rate, we propose an adaptation of a helper UAV to switch the mode between jamming and relaying. We jointly optimize the helper UAV's trajectory and mode and UEs' offloading decision under energy budget constraints and operational limitations of nodes. The proposed algorithm is developed based on a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based method, whose superior performances are verified via numerical results, as compared to other benchmark schemes.

DE Autonomous UAVs; Tree avoidance; Faster R-CNN; Monocular vision; Smart

ID UAV; VISION; FLIGHT; CROP
AB In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are widely utilized in precision agriculture, such as tree plantations. Due to limited intelligence, these UAVs can only operate at high altitudes, leading to the use of expensive and heavy sensors for obtaining important health information of the plants. To fly at low altitudes, these UAVs must possess the capability of obstacle avoidance to prevent crashes. However, most current obstacle avoidance systems with active sensors are not applicable to small aerial vehicles due to the cost, weight, and power consumption constraints. To this end, this paper presents a novel approach to the autonomous navigation of a small UAV in tree plantations only using a single camera. As the monocular vision does not provide depth information, a machine learning model, Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), was trained for the tree trunk detection. A control strategy was implemented to avoid the collision with trees. The detection model uses image heights of detected trees to indicate their distances from the UAV and image widths between trees to find the widest obstacle-free space. The control strategy allows the UAV to navigate until any approaching obstacle is detected and to turn to the safest area before continuing its flight. This paper demonstrates the feasibility and performance of the proposed algorithms by carrying out 11 flight tests in real tree plantation environments at two different locations, one of which is a new place. All the successful results indicate that the proposed method is accurate and robust for autonomous navigation in tree plantations.

AB Introduction: This study addressed a gap in the literature - the potential of using autonomous vehicles (AV) to enhance children's mobility. Prior studies documented the perceived benefits and concerns about this prospect, but did not examine the features in AV and support mechanisms that are desired by potential users. Method: An on-line survey was used to collect public opinions within the United States. In the survey, willingness to use AVs for this use case was asked twice to assess if participants changed their mind after being asked about concerns related to this prospect and importance of car features. A combination of statistical and machine-learning methods were used to profile individuals with high versus low post-willingness and to identify variables that differentiated the two groups. Results: Results indicated that respondents who were lower on their post-willingness to use AVs to transport children were more concerned about how AVs would protect children, how someone could harm the children inside, and whether there would be someone at the destination. In addition, they were less in favor of technology, older in age, and rated car features such as having a designated adult waiting at destination, a camera, and a microphone as relatively required (as opposed to optional). These results highlight potential users' needs and requirements as they think about AVs in the context of parent-children mobility practices. Practical Applications: Relevant stakeholders should develop deployment and implementation plans while taking into account ridership contexts and vulnerable road users who can benefit from enhanced mobility.

AB With the emergence of new vehicle-mounted services, such as autonomous driving and augmented reality, the computing capability at the edge of the Internet of vehicles (IoV) has become increasingly demanding, and the edge computing of the IoV has also emerged. With the rise of the IoV, new vehicle-mounted applications keep emerging. Vehicle-mounted applications need to process the sensor data of themselves and other vehicles around them. The amount of data is huge, and processing these sensor data requires powerful computing power. But typical vehicles have limited computing power, so such computation-intensive tasks need to be uploaded to a data center for processing. The MEC (Mobile Edge Computing) technology is a good choice to solve this problem. This paper advocates reasonable scheduling of parked vehicles to cooperate with edge servers for collaborative edge computing and studies the resource scheduling scheme under the target of user relative satisfaction. This paper describes the main entities and related functions in the network and proposes a secure and reliable protocol for interaction between entities. The serviceability of different parked vehicles in collaborative edge computing was evaluated to select stable task performers and solve the resource scheduling optimization problem between parked vehicles and edge servers. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme has better customer satisfaction and maximum overhead than the existing scheme that only considers using edge server to perform tasks. Therefore, the method of this paper has important theoretical significance and potential practical value.

AB Car-following is the most general behavior in highway driving. It is crucial to recognize the cut-in intention of vehicles from an adjacent lane for safe and cooperative driving. In this paper, a method of behavior estimation is proposed to recognize and predict the lane change intentions based on the contextual traffic information. A model predictive controller is designed to optimize the acceleration sequences by incorporating the lane-change intentions of other vehicles. The public data set of next generation simulation is labeled and then published as a benchmarking platform for the research community. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately estimate vehicle behavior and therefore outperform the traditional car-following control.

DE Algorithm/protocol design and analysis; mobile communication systems
AB In applications involving networks of sensor-equipped autonomous vehicles, it is crucial to have an energy-efficient communication protocol due to the limited on-board batteries. Unlike traditional sensor networks, vehicle sensor networks typically consist of only a small number of nodes. We exploit this fact in our protocol design by optimizing specifically for these mobile small-scale networks. Our proposed solution, ConverSS, is a hybrid MAC/routing protocol that is energy-efficient for vehicle sensor networks. We have evaluated the protocol through simulation in ns-2 and verified its operation in a testbed network deployment. The results show that ConverSS is robust to real-world link impairments and that it outperforms common layered solutions by as much as a factor of 10.

AB Micro-air-vehicles (MAV) are small, autonomous, aerial vehicles designed for reconnaissance and difficult to reach missions, Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are extremely small machines in which electronic and mechanical components are combined on a single silicon chip using photolithographic micromachining techniques. The question of whether MEMS can help improve the performance of futuristic MAV is pondered. The treatment focuses on the lifting and control surfaces of MAV, particularly the fixed-wing type. Two additional ideas are advanced to improve the performance of the lifting surfaces of MAV: effecting chaotic mixing to energize the laminar boundary layer and thus delay separation; and using genetic algorithms to optimize the shape of the airfoil section.

AB Active rear steering has been used in many research work to enhance ground vehicles' lateral stability. However, there is a shortage in the published research studies that consider the incorporation of active rear steering for autonomous vehicles applications, especially in case of multi-axle combat vehicles. In this paper, various H infinity controllers are developed to actively steer rear axles of a multi-axle combat vehicle using a linearized bicycle model. The proposed controllers are incorporated with a 22 degrees of Freedom nonlinear Trucksim full vehicle model to study and compare the developed controllers' performance on a hard surface. Moreover, a frequency-domain analysis is conducted to investigate the influence of the active rear steering on the path-following controllers' robustness in terms of stability and performance. Three path-following controllers are designed, where the first controller is applied on the front two axles of the vehicle, while the rear two axles are fixed. The second is applied to all-wheel steering vehicle. The third controller is an integration between the designed front steering path-following controller and a developed lateral stability active rear steering controller. Eventually, a series of virtual maneuvers are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the intended controllers to present the advantages and limitations of each controller at different driving conditions.

AB Connected-vehicle system is an important component of smart cities. The complete benefits of connected-vehicle technologies need the real-time information of all vehicles and other road users. However, the existing connected-vehicle deployments obtain the real-time status of connected vehicles, but without knowing the unconnected traffic since there are still many unconnected vehicles and pedestrians on the roads. Therefore, it is urgent to find an approach to collect the high-resolution real-time status of unconnected road users. When it is difficult for all vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists to broadcast their real-time status in the near future, enhancing the traffic infrastructures to actively sense and broadcast each road user's status is an intuitive solution to fill the data gap. This paper introduces a new-generation LiDAR-enhanced connected infrastructures that can actively sense the high-resolution status of surrounding traffic participants with roadside LiDAR sensors and broadcast connected-vehicle messages through DSRC roadside units. The system architecture, the LiDAR data processing procedure, the data communication, and the first pilot implementation at an intersection in Reno, Nevada are included in this paper. This research is the start of the new-generation connected infrastructures serving connected/autonomous vehicles with the roadside LiDAR sensors. It will accelerate the deployment of the connected network for the smart cities to improve traffic safety, mobility, and fuel efficiency.

We explored the functions and citation network the China national standards from a complex-network perspective. Different types of standards were clustered and citation relationships were identified based on standards' document analyses. In this paper, the evolution of standard nodes and citation links are presented, and implications for future standardization work are proposed. In total, 114 existing standards were identified through desktop research and network analysis by using the Gephi ForceAtlas2 algorithm. This study can be helpful for future standardization in areas such as autonomous driving and carbon-related standards based on citation-network analysis.

AB Ride-sourcing services have become increasingly important in meeting travel needs in metropolitan areas. However, the cruising of vacant ride-sourcing vehicles generates additional traffic demand that may worsen traffic conditions. This paper investigates the allocation of a certain portion of road space to on-street parking for vacant ride-sourcing vehicles. A macroscopic conceptual framework is developed to capture the trade-off between capacity loss and the reduction of cruising. Considering a hypothetical matching mechanism adopted by the platform, we further materialize the framework and then apply it to study the interactions between the ride-sourcing system and parking provision under various market structures.

TI Shared Mobility for Transport and Its Environmental Impact VeSIPreS: A
   Vehicular Soft Integrity Preservation Scheme for Shared Mobility
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Car manufacturers are noticing and encouraging a trend away from individual mobility, where a vehicle is owned and driven by one or only a few other persons, and towards shared-mobility concepts. That means that many different people use and have access to the same vehicle. An attacker disguised as a regular short-time user can use the additional attack vectors (s)he gets by having physical access to tamper the vehicle's software. The software takes a continuously more crucial role in cars for autonomous driving, and manipulations can have catastrophic consequences for the persons on board. Currently, there is no mechanism available to the vehicle owner to detect such manipulations in the vehicle done by the attacker (short-time user). In this work, a novel vehicle attestation scheme called Vehicular Soft Integrity Preservation Scheme (VeSIPreS) is proposed to detect tampering in the software stack of a vehicle and guarantee the upcoming driver that the previous user has not changed the software of the vehicle. The solution consists of a software module in the vehicle and a mobile-based user application for the vehicle owner to monitor the vehicle's soft integrity. Inside the vehicle, the software module is implemented in the central gateway, which acts as the primary security component. VeSIPreS uses Trusted Platform Module (TPM) in the central gateway, which anchors trust in our proposed solution. This paper also provides a proof-of-concept implementation with a TPM, demonstrating its application and deployment feasibility and presentig a security analysis to show the security of VeSIPreS.

AB Autonomous experimentation is an emerging area of research, primarily related to autonomous vehicles, scientific combinatorial discovery approaches in materials science and drug discovery, and iterative research loops of planning, experimentation, and analysis. However, autonomous approaches developed in these contexts are difficult to apply to high-dimensional mapping technologies, such as scanning hyper-spectral imaging of biological systems, due to sample complexity and heterogeneity. We briefly cover the history of adaptive sampling algorithms and surrogate modeling in order to define autonomous adaptive data acquisition as an objective-based, flexible building block for future biological imaging experimentation driven by intelligent infrastructure. We subsequently summarize the recent implementations of autonomous adaptive data acquisition (AADA) for scanning hyperspectral imaging, assess how these address the difficulties of autonomous approaches in hyperspectral imaging, and highlight the AADA design variation from a goal-oriented perspective. Finally, we present a modular AADA architecture that embeds AADA-driven flexible building blocks to address the challenge of time resolution for high-dimensional scanning hyperspectral imaging of nonequilibrium dynamical systems. In our example research-driven experimental design case, we propose an AADA infrastructure for timeresolved, noninvasive, and label-free scanning hyperspectral imaging of living biological systems. This AADA infrastructure can accurately target the correct state of the system for experimental workflows that utilize subsequent expensive, high-information-content analytical techniques.

AB This paper discusses whether the knowledge of the driving mode of an approaching vehicle (manual vs. automated) influences pedestrians' decisions while crossing a street. Additionally, the paper explores how different appearances and driving behaviours of vehicles interact with driving mode in affecting pedestrians' road-crossing behaviours. In a video-based experiment with sixty participants, two vehicles with different appearances (a BMW 3 and a Renault Twizy) were presented as either manually-driven or automated vehicles. Both vehicles displayed either yielding or non-yielding behaviour on a straight road devoid of other traffic. Participants were asked to indicate whether they would cross the street in front of the approaching vehicle, at different distances ranging from 45 m to 1.5 m. The results showed that there was no significant influence of the knowledge of the driving mode (manually-driven vs automated) on pedestrians' willingness to cross the street at any distance. The vehicle's behaviour (whether it is maintaining speed or yielding) played a dominant role in pedestrians' decision to cross a road, and this was similar for both modes and both vehicles, at all distances. However, results suggested that in situations and at distances when the intent of the vehicle was not fully clear by the behaviour of the car alone, there were differences between the two vehicles at certain distances, which could be attributed to the differences in their appearance such as size, aggressiveness and novelty. A futuristic-looking vehicle inspired less confidence in road crossing situations compared to an ordinary-looking vehicle. Additionally, a novel and futuristic-looking vehicle appeared to make it easier for people to believe that it is an automated vehicle. We conclude by discussing design implications for the development of external HMIs automated vehicles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
AB The article discusses an autonomous and flexible robotic system for radiation monitoring. The detection part of the system comprises two NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors: one of these is collimated to allow directionally sensitive measurements and the other is used to calculate the dose rate and provides sufficient sensitivity. Special algorithms for autonomous operation of an unmanned ground vehicle were developed, utilizing radiation characteristics acquired by the implemented detection system. The system was designed to operate in three modes: radiation mapping, localization of discrete sources and inspection of a region of interest. All of the modes were verified experimentally. In the localization mode, the time required to localize ionizing radiation sources was reduced by half compared to the field mapping mode exploiting parallel trajectories; the localization accuracy remained the same. In the inspection mode, the desired functionality was achieved, and the changes in the sources arrangement were detected reliably in the experiments.

ID CONSTRAINTS
AB This paper describes the parallelization of a two-phase metaheuristic for the vehicle routing problem with time windows and a central depot (VRPTW). The underlying objective function combines the minimization of the number of vehicles in the first search phase of the metaheuristic and the minimization of the total travel distance in the second search phase. The parallelization of the metaheuristic is based on the concept of cooperative autonomy, i.e., several autonomous two-phase metaheuristics cooperate through the exchange of solutions. The parallelized two-phase metaheuristic was subjected to a comparative test on the basis of 356 problems from the literature with sizes varying from 100 to 1000 customers. The derived results seem to justify the proposed parallelization concept.

ID AUTOMATIC GUIDANCE
AB The long time wish of endowing agricultural vehicles with an increasing degree of autonomy is becoming a reality thanks to two crucial facts: the broad diffusion of global positioning satellite systems and the inexorable progress of computers and electronics. Agricultural vehicles are currently the only self-propelled ground machines commonly integrating commercial automatic navigation systems. Farm equipment manufacturers and satellite-based navigation system providers, in a joint effort, have pushed this technology to unprecedented heights; yet there are many unresolved issues and an unlimited potential still to uncover. The complexity inherent to intelligent vehicles is rooted in the selection and coordination of the optimum sensors, the computer reasoning techniques to process the acquired data, and the resulting control strategies for automatic actuators. The advantageous design of the network of onboard sensors is necessary for the future deployment of advanced agricultural vehicles. This article analyzes a variety of typical environments and situations encountered in agricultural fields, and proposes a sensor architecture especially adapted to cope with them. The strategy proposed groups sensors into four specific subsystems: global localization, feedback control and vehicle pose, non-visual monitoring, and local perception. The designed architecture responds to vital vehicle tasks classified within three layers devoted to safety, operative information, and automatic actuation. The success of this architecture, implemented and tested in various agricultural vehicles over the last decade, rests on its capacity to integrate redundancy and incorporate new technologies in a practical way.

AB The Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technique has achieved astonishing progress over the last few decades and has generated considerable interest in the autonomous driving community. With its conceptual roots in navigation and mapping, SLAM outperforms some traditional positioning and localization techniques since it can support more reliable and robust localization, planning, and controlling to meet some key criteria for autonomous driving. In this study the authors first give an overview of the different SLAM implementation approaches and then discuss the applications of SLAM for autonomous driving with respect to different driving scenarios, vehicle system components and the characteristics of the SLAM approaches. The authors then discuss some challenging issues and current solutions when applying SLAM for autonomous driving. Some quantitative quality analysis means to evaluate the characteristics and performance of SLAM systems and to monitor the risk in SLAM estimation are reviewed. In addition, this study describes a real-world road test to demonstrate a multi-sensor-based modernized SLAM procedure for autonomous driving. The numerical results show that a high-precision 3D point cloud map can be generated by the SLAM procedure with the integration of Lidar and GNSS/INS. Online four-five cm accuracy localization solution can be achieved based on this pre-generated map and online Lidar scan matching with a tightly fused inertial system.

AB The accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles is crucial for the sustainability and safety of connected and autonomous vehicles under mixed traffic streams in the real world. The task of trajectory prediction is challenging because there are all kinds of factors affecting the motions of vehicles, such as the individual movements, the ambient driving environment especially road conditions, and the interactions with neighboring vehicles. To resolve the above issues, this work proposes a novel Heterogeneous Context-Aware Graph Convolutional Networks following the Encoder-Decoder architecture, which simultaneously extracts the hidden contexts from individual historical trajectories, varying driving scene, and inter-vehicle interactional behaviors. Specifically, the historical vehicle trajectories are fed into Temporal Convolutional Network to capture the individual context. Besides, a 2-Dimensional Convolutional Network with temporal attention is designed for transforming the scene image stream into compressing scene context. Then a Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks is devised to model the evolving interactional patterns, which incorporates the acquired individual and scene contexts as the representation of the node. Finally, the aforementioned three contexts are combined and fed into the decoder to produce future trajectories. The proposed model is validated on two real-world datasets which contain various driving scenarios. Results demonstrated that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy and achieves immense stability towards different vehicle states.

AB This paper provides a mathematical approach to study the duration of collision-free motion of multiple unmanned autonomous vehicles (UXVs) operating in confined areas. A simple geometric model of the UXVs is first proposed, and the dynamics of the model is shown. The expected time of first collision is then formulated using the concept of mean free path from molecular dynamics. Monte-Carlo simulation is performed to verify the theory developed. The expected time of first collision is a function of the number of UXVs, the UXV speed and the sensor field of view (FOV) for a given operational area and vehicle size. Furthermore, the critical number of UXVs, above which collision can be deemed to occur instantly, is obtained.

AB Unmanned ground vehicles are an important force in the future of the military that realizes unmanned and information warfare. Different types of equipment, such as nuclear, biological, and explosive, can replace humans in complex battlefield environments. With the rise of information warfare, modern warfare will be more damaging and easily lead to personnel casualties. Reducing such damage without lessening equipment and supplies handling, medical evacuation, military reconnaissance surveillance, mine detection, and joint combat tasks is crucial. Under military requirement, unmanned ground vehicles shows military potential and combative effectiveness when executing the most dangerous military missions, thereby representing an important direction in military equipment development. Unmanned vehicles will also play a role in the success of future wars and battlefield initiatives. The unmanned ground vehicle is complex and a nonlinear time-varying system, which is difficult to describe with an accurate mathematical model. The model of traditional control is also struggles to satisfy the design index of the system. However, based on the traditional control theory, artificial intelligence can solve the control problem. A vehicle-automated driving system is responsible for the real-time and accurate motion control action of an unmanned ground vehicle. The performance of such a driving system is key to the vehicle's intelligence in environmental awareness, path planning, and decision-making ability. With the technology's development, the future of vehicle automated driving system should be more capable of adapting to environments and autonomous driving.

AB Recently, deep neural networks have greatly improved autonomous driving. However, as a great deal of training data is required, most studies have employed simulators. Generalization of such driving is key in terms of safety. The simulated environments feature only small variations in favorable conditions and thus cannot be used for benchmarking. Therefore, we developed a new open-source (OpenAI Gym-like) off-road environment featuring differently structured forests, plateaus, deserts, and snowfields. The dynamic topographical structures make the off-road environment a very challenging generalization problem. Our off-road environment can precisely evaluate autonomous driving in terms of generalization. Additionally, we proposed an evaluation method based on the success rate of driving tasks, enabling effective driving ability measurement. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of existing end-to-end driving methods in our off-road environment. The results show that the end-to-end driving methods lack generalization ability and fail to generalize to unseen environments. Our off-road environment can help autonomous driving researchers develop a better, generalizable driving system. Unreal engine-level assets and codes are available at https://github.com/lssac7778/Off-road-Benchmark. We briefly introduce our model in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SERSv0TFUwQ&t=44s.

AB With the rapid development of 5 G, artificial intelligence and other technologies, the intelligent transportation system (ITS) bursts flourish fireworks. It is acknowledged that driving security problem still runs through the ITS development history.It is the driver who plays the decisive role in a vehicle accident, and the performance of autopilot system is also the kernel in guaranteeing the security of autonomous vehicle. Therefore, many researchers devote to self-driving system optimization and human abnormal driving behavior detection. Note that they either relied on simulators, or confined to several specific driving patterns, which undoubtedly limited their application value. In addition, some works require the vehicles have high computing power and abundant storage memory, which aggravated their burden. Different from previous works, we propose a driving behavior evaluation scheme based on vehicle-edge-cloud architecture. When vehicles running on the road, they transmit the data reflecting the autopilots/driver behaviors to the edge networks via the telematics box. The edge networks use the driving behavior evaluation model trained by cloud server, and send the behavior rankings back to vehicles. The cloud server continuously trains and optimizes the driving behavior evaluation model using vehicle data, and regularly transmits the model to the edge networks for upgrading. The experimental results show robustness and feasibility of the scheme.

AB With the significant research and advancements in technologies, arose new applications such as autonomous driving and augmented/virtual reality. These applications required massive computational resources for the execution of various tasks. Utilizing vehicles resources in a distributed manner and collectively with the help of volunteer computing for various computational tasks is an emerging research area. The appropriate and intelligent decision in selecting a volunteer vehicle is crucial in this opportunistic network where information is exchanged between vehicles. In this paper, we propose Intelligent Volunteer Computing-based VANETs architecture to fulfill the computational requirements of vehicles applications intelligently. We propose selection criteria to select volunteers' vehicles capable of the execution of the computationally intensive task. In this study to rightly identify the volunteer vehicle for task execution, we use a machine learning approach that predicts the capability of certain vehicles in completing the task. Extensive experimentation is conducted for the prediction of the computing capability of optimal volunteer vehicles. We used nine different regression techniques on publicly available datasets. The results show these techniques can efficiently predict the capability of volunteers. By comparing the regression techniques, the results indicate that the ridge regression and support vector regression can significantly reduce the mean square error, relative absolute error, and root mean square errors. Simulations are conducted to compare the proposed scheme with the existing one.

TI A Cooperative Lane-Changing Strategy for Weaving Sections of Urban

SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
ID MODEL; SIMULATION
AB To alleviate the lane-changing conflicts between weaving vehicles and enhance the traffic efficiency in the weaving section of urban expressway under the connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) environment, a cooperative lane-changing strategy for CAVs is proposed. The strategy consists of an upper layer of decision making, which determines the lane-changing sequences of weaving vehicles based on their lane-changing advantages quantified by a set of utility functions, and a lower layer of control, which generates detailed instructions of speed adjustments and lane-changing manoeuvres for weaving vehicles. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy under different traffic demand settings, a numerical simulation, including a base case and a control case, is conducted. Then, to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy for the mixed traffic state and compare its performance with the existing CAV lane-changing method, benchmark and comparison tests with six different market penetration rates (MPRs) of CAVs are carried out under the congested demand setting. In addition, the delay improvement ratio, inverse time-to-collision, and ratio of large deceleration time are selected as performance indicators to investigate the effect of the proposed strategy on enhancing the operational efficiency, traffic safety, and passenger's comfort within the weaving section. According to the simulation results, the overall efficiency, safety and comfort in the weaving section under the CAV environment, are all improved, when the proposed strategy is applied to weaving vehicles. The proposed strategy is also superior to the existing CAV lane-changing method on maintaining traffic efficiency and safety. Therefore, the proposed cooperative lane-changing strategy, based on CAV technologies, shows good potential in solving the problem of lane-changing conflicts within the weaving section and facilitating the traffic management and traffic control of urban expressway.

TI How to Design the eHMI of AVs for Urgent Warning to Other Drivers with
   Limited Visibility?
SO SENSORS
LA English
DT Article
DE autonomous vehicles; external human-machine interface; other road users;
   collision warning
AB The importance of an external interaction interface (eHMI) has grown in recent years. Most eHMI concepts focus on communicating autonomous vehicle (AV)'s yielding intention to pedestrians at a crossing. However, according to previous studies, pedestrians at a crossing rely mainly on the vehicle's movement information (implicit communication) rather than information from eHMIs (explicit communication). This paper has the purpose of proposing a specific use case in which the eHMI of future AVs could play an indispensable role in the safety of other road users (ORUs). Often VRUs cannot see the traffic flow due to a series of parked or stopped vehicles, which is a frequent cause of fatal traffic collision accidents. Drivers may also not be able to see approaching pedestrians or other cars from the side for the same reason. In this paper, the impact of an eHMI is tested from the perspective of drivers with limited visibility when a jaywalker steps into the road. A combination of colors, shapes, and information levels is presented on an eHMI. We show that our proposed eHMI design, in the deadlock scenario of a jaywalker and a driver who both lack visibility, significantly reduced the reaction time compared to when there was no eHMI. In the experiment, the willingness to stop, varying from 0 to 5, was measured from the driver's perspective. The results showed that most users felt uncertainty and did not move quickly when seeing the light band color alone. Textual information on the eHMI was significantly more effective in providing an urgent warning of this specific scenario than vertical and horizontal light bands with color without text. In addition, red color, blinking rapidly above 3 Hz, and egocentric messages were also necessary to reduce the PRT(perception response time). By using text-added eHMI (Vertical + Text eHMI), the mean time to achieve a score above 4 for willingness to stop was 2.113 s faster than when there was no eHMI. It was 2.571 s faster than the time until the slider of the participants reached the maximum level for willingness to stop. This is a meaningful amount of difference when considering a PRT of 2.5 s, which is the Korean road design standard. As eHMIs tend to be applied for smarter mobility, it is expected that they will be more effective in preventing accidents if the eHMI is standardized in autonomous driving level 2 to 3 vehicles driven by humans before fully autonomous driving becomes a reality.

AB In truck platooning, the leading vehicle is driven manually, and the following vehicles run by autonomous driving, with the short inter-vehicle distance between trucks. To successfully perform platooning in various situations, each truck must maintain dynamic stability, and furthermore, the whole system must maintain string stability. Due to the short front-view range, however, the following vehicles' path planning capabilities become significantly impaired. In addition, in platooning with articulated cargo trucks, the off-tracking phenomenon occurring on a curved road makes it hard for the following vehicle to track the trajectory of the preceding truck. In addition, without knowledge of the global coordinate system, it is difficult to correlate the local coordinate systems that each truck relies on for sensing environment and dynamic signals. In this paper, in order to solve these problems, a path planning algorithm for platooning of articulated cargo trucks has been developed. Using the Kalman filter, V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) communication, and a novel update-and-conversion method, each following vehicle can accurately compute the trajectory of the leading vehicle's front part for using it as a target path. The path planning algorithm of this paper was validated by simulations on severe driving scenarios and by tests on an actual road. The results demonstrated that the algorithm could provide lateral string stability and robustness for truck platooning.

AB AI software is often used as a means for providing greater autonomy to automated systems, capable of coping with harsh and unpredictable environments. Due in part to the enormous space of possible situations that they aim to address, autonomous systems pose a serious challenge to traditional test-based verification approaches. Efficient verification approaches need to be perfected before these systems can reliably control critical applications. This publication describes Livingstone PathFinder (LPF), a verification tool for autonomous control software. LPF applies state space exploration algorithms to an instrumented testbed, consisting of the controller embedded in a simulated operating environment. Although LPF has focused on NASA's Livingstone model-based diagnosis system applications, the architecture is modular and adaptable to other systems. This article presents different facets of LPF and experimental results from applying the software to a Livingstone model of the main propulsion feed subsystem for a prototype space vehicle.

AB In this work, we study the performance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system where an RIS is installed on a UAV to reflect the signal to the ground user from the sky. More specifically, we present two different methods to denote the probability density functions (PDFs) of the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). With these two distributions, closed-form expressions for the outage probability, average bit error rate (BER), and average sum-rate are derived, respectively. Additionally, we develop the analysis on the optimal UAV altitude and location. Finally, numerical results are given to verify our analysis.

AB In order to solve the multi-objective planning and trajectory tracking control problem related to maritime autonomous surface ships (MASSs), a new design scheme for autonomous navigation is proposed in this paper, with a receding horizon navigation and control (RHNC) system that contains navigation and control modules. In the navigation module, we designed a superposition field gradient descent local search algorithm based on the cost field, emission field, and guidance field to navigate the MASS reference path, and in the control module, we designed a nonlinear controller that can handle multiple constraints based on the NMPC framework. Under the new scheme, the navigation module completes local path planning to reduce costs and emissions, the control module accomplishes accurate trajectory tracking and real-time collision avoidance, and the information is transmitted in both directions between the two modules to collaboratively complete the MASS navigation and control tasks. We conducted a simulation study of the navigation algorithm and controller and the autonomous navigation system using a Kriso Container ship (KCS). The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative design scheme in reducing navigation costs and emissions and avoiding autonomous collision avoidances.

AB Livestock management is an emerging area of application of the quadrotor, especially for monitoring, counting, detecting, recognizing, and tracking animals through image or video footage. The autonomous operation of the quadrotor requires the development of an obstacle avoidance scheme to avoid collisions. This research develops an obstacle avoidance-based autonomous navigation of a quadrotor suitable for outdoor applications in livestock management. A Simulink model of the UAV is developed to achieve this, and its transient and steady-state performances are measured. Two genetic algorithm-based PID controllers for the quadrotor altitude and attitude control were designed, and an obstacle avoidance algorithm was applied to ensure the autonomous navigation of the quadrotor. The simulation results show that the quadrotor flies to the desired altitude with a settling time of 6.51 s, an overshoot of 2.65%, and a steady-state error of 0.0011 m. At the same time, the attitude controller records a settling time of 0.43 s, an overshoot of 2.50%, and a zero steady-state error. The implementation of the obstacle avoidance scheme shows that the distance threshold of 1 m is sufficient for the autonomous navigation of the quadrotor. Hence, the developed method is suitable for managing livestock with the average size of an adult sheep.

AB Every day, humans make hundreds of decisions, most of which are based on information we gather from our surroundings. The majority of this perception when it comes to driving is visual. Autonomous vehicles that are capable of recognizing items around them and making quick decisions in response to these impulses are self driving cars. Self-driving cars are the main concern and an emerging subject for every automobile giant in the world. Death due to human failure in a road accident increases with every passing month and with technology assisting humans in every possible field, it is essential to prioritize road safety with it. In a thorough investigation of traffic safety, it was discovered that human error was the sole cause of 57% of accidents and a contributory factor in more than 90% of them. In comparison, only 2.4% of crashes were the result of a mechanical issue, and 4.7% were the result of environmental variables alone. Autonomous cars not only help reduce human errors while driving but also help in reducing driver's fatigue to a greater extent. This study examines the work of a number of scholars in order to provide a quick summary of how computer vision is being used in autonomous cars today. Previous research has shown the use of deep learning algorithms with the help of LiDAR sensors but they come with the problem of being relied on costly hardware. This paper focuses on the vertical and lateral movement of the car while using a more budget friendly yet effective option using just simple computer vision algorithms like Color space transformation, Canny edge detection and Hough line transformation to make the car detect lane lines and steering the car so that it remains bound to them. Simple computer vision requires less operational hardware which indicates that using cost effective boards like Raspberry Pi and Nvidia Jetson Nano can yield much more powerful results. The paper also highlights the reconstruction of a ready-made remote-controlled car that helps understanding autonomous cars even better.

AB We consider a problem of finding the effectiveness of applying varying amounts of motion in fields of autonomous unmanned vehicles performing group search operations. These fields are typically deployed to provide extended coverage over that provided by a single sensor in spatially extended search regions. The autonomous nature of these distributed sensing assets is attributable to constraints on communications bandwidth and manpower. Due to the potential large cost discrepancy between fielding moving searchers and fixed searchers, the potential benefit of searcher motion relative to that achievable by deployment of larger numbers of fixed nodes is a critical operational consideration. We build a parametric analytical model of searcher performance for fields of moving searchers, and through a perturbation analysis examine the effectiveness of searcher motion vice nonmotion in terms of numbers of searchers required to achieve similar goals. Numerical simulations support the conclusions that are obtained.

AB To further advance the performance and safety of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), an integrated chassis control framework is proposed. In the longitudinal motion control module, a velocity-tracking controller was designed with the integrated feedforward and feedback control algorithm. Besides, the nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) method was applied to the four-wheel steering (4WS) path-tracking controller design. To deal with the failure of key actuators, an active fault-tolerant control (AFTC) algorithm was designed by reallocating the driving or braking torques of the remaining normal actuators, and the weighted least squares (WLS) method was used for torque reallocation. The simulation results show that AMRs can advance driving stability and braking safety in the braking failure condition with the utilization of AFTC and recapture the braking energy during decelerations.

AB Farming is facing many economic challenges in terms of productivity and cost-effectiveness. Labor shortage partly due to depopulation of rural areas, especially in Europe, is another challenge. Domain specific problems such as accurate monitoring of soil and crop properties and animal health are key factors for minimizing economical risks, and not risking human health. The ECSEL AFarCloud (Aggregate Farming in the Cloud) project will provide a distributed platform for autonomous farming that will allow the integration and cooperation of agriculture Cyber Physical Systems in real-time in order to increase efficiency, productivity, animal health, food quality and reduce farm labor costs. Moreover, such a platform can be integrated with farm management software to support monitoring and decision-making solutions based on big data and real-time data mining techniques.

AB Today, suburban areas are home to an ever-increasing majority of the global population. Models indicate that the next generation of US metropolitan growth will rapidly continue outside of urban cores, where car-based development patterns have served as the dominant paradigm for more than a century. With the emergence of autonomous mobility technologies and services, the suburbs of the future offer key opportunities to tackle pressing environmental challenges, such as significant GHG emissions from private vehicle trips, underutilized and fragmented landscape spaces, and a high proportion of impervious surfaces. To leverage this opportunity, our research team employed a novel scenario-based parametric modeling framework to generate and optimize suburban land use patterns and block configurations that leverage autonomous mobility to optimize environmental performance and accessibility metrics. The framework performed through our project, NOGAS (Next Optimized Generation of Autonomous Suburbs), consists of five key parametric modules and a heuristic design process covering various planning and design decision-making stages including scenario generation, analysis, optimization, and visualization. It is the first of its kind tailored for suburban settings with emerging mobility systems, which, more importantly, prioritizes landscape performance and accessibility over the traditional automobile-centric approach in suburban development. One of the most significant findings from this research is that substantial enhancements to a neighborhood's environmental performance and overall accessibility can be achieved by modifying existing suburban land use patterns and individual block configurations, without the necessity of increasing density. The results of the framework further suggest that a strategic atomized land use scheme, combined with an innovative clustered block typology, is favored for the anticipated widespread adoption of autonomous mobility systems and improved environmental performance. The innovative methods and findings introduced in this research illuminate an alternative approach to sustainable suburban development, offering valuable insights for city planners and developers to shape future suburban master plans, zoning regulations, and design guidelines.

AB Public acceptance of agricultural technologies is an important determinant of their success. In the case of autonomous crop robots, recent research from Germany suggests that societal acceptance of the technology plays an important role for farmer acceptance of crop robots. Yet little research has been conducted so far into how the public perceives autonomous agricultural technologies like crop robots. Investigating the public's opinion on crop robots will provide answers to one of farmers' questions in the decision to invest in crop robots. Through consumer segmentation and hypotheses-based characterization, specific consumer groups with differing attitudes towards crop robots are identified. Two discrete choice experiments on digital and autonomous methods of weed management (n = 675) and tractor size and degree of autonomy (n = 645), conducted as part of a larger representative consumer survey in Germany (n = 2,012), are submitted to a Hierarchical Bayes estimation and subsequent latent class analysis. The identified consumer segments are characterized in a hypotheses-based approach with hypotheses centering on consumer attitudes measured as 5-point Likert-type items and as spontaneous image associations. Both subsamples can be segmented into three groups, which are comparable between the experiments in their socio-economic composition. Results suggest that the German public is largely positively inclined towards autonomous agricultural technologies. The method of weed control is considered more important than the vehicle type (i.e., conventional tractor or crop robot) and vehicle size is considered more important than degree of autonomy. Only the respective smallest consumer segments in the two experiments indicate indifference or a more conservative perspective. Participants' attitude towards environmental preservation appears to have a positive influence on their evaluation of autonomous agricultural technologies. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first investigation into the public opinion of crop robots, based on a large sample representative of the German population in four socio-demographic variables. It indicates that the German population is most interested in the reduction of agrochemicals in plant production and will also accept autonomous agricultural technologies to achieve this goal. Policymakers should make use of these insights when communicating about novel technologies in agriculture and extension agents should relay this information to farmers, particularly those already interested in investing in crop robots.

AB In this paper, a docking navigation method for autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) based on a binocular vision system (BVS) is proposed. A BVS simulation platform is built for simulation research purposes. First, unnecessary scene information in the image is filtered through green light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and filters. Then the image is processed via graying, binarization, and median filtering to highlight the connected area of the LED in the image. Subsequently, the center of mass of the connected area is selected as the feature point (FP), and the FPs are described using an improved Haar wavelet transform. The multidimensional description vector of FP is obtained and matched. Finally, the position and pose of the refueling cone sleeve are estimated. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the presented AAR navigation method.

AB With the improvement of UAV performance and intelligence in recent years, it is particularly important for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to improve the ability of autonomous air combat. Aiming to solve the problem of how to improve the autonomous air combat maneuver decision ability of UAVs so that it can be close to manual manipulation, this paper proposes an autonomous air combat maneuvering decision method based on the combination of simulated operation command and the final reward value deep deterministic policy gradient (FRV-DDPG) algorithm. Firstly, the six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) model is established based on the air combat process, UAV motion, and missile motion. Secondly, a prediction method based on the Particle swarm optimization radial basis function (PSO-RBF) is designed to simulate the operation command of the enemy aircraft, which makes the training process more realistic, and then an improved DDPG strategy is proposed, which returns the final reward value to the previous reward value in a certain proportion of time for offline training, which can improve the convergence speed of the algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by building a simulation environment. The simulation results show that the algorithm can improve the autonomous air combat maneuver decision-making ability of UAVs.

AB Motion planning under uncertainty for an autonomous system can be formulated as a Markov Decision Process with a continuous state space. In this letter, we propose a novel solution to this decision-theoretic planning problem that directly obtains the continuous value function with only the first and second moments of the transition probabilities, alleviating the requirement for an explicit transition model in the literature. We achieve this by expressing the value function as a linear combination of basis functions and approximating the Bellman equation by a partial differential equation, where the value function can be naturally constructed using a finite element method. We have validated our approach via extensive simulations, and the evaluations reveal that compared to baseline methods, our solution leads to better planning results in terms of path smoothness, travel distance, and time costs.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can perform flexible operations in complex underwater environments due to their autonomy. Localization is one of the key components of autonomous navigation. Since the inertial navigation system of an AUV suffers from drift, observing fixed objects in an inertial reference system can enhance the localization performance. In this paper, we propose a method of localizing AUVs by exploiting visual measurements of underwater structures and artificial landmarks. In a framework of particle filtering, a camera measurement model that emulates the camera's observation of underwater structures is designed. The particle weight is then updated based on the extracted visual information of the underwater structures. Detected artificial landmarks are also used in the particle weight update. The proposed method is validated by experiments performed in a structured basin environment.

ID IMPROVING INS; SYSTEM
AB This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous navigation for small UAVs, with no extra sensor added to the conventional INS/GNSS setup. The proposed method significantly increases the accuracy and reliability of autonomous navigation, especially for small UAVs with low-cost IMUs. This improvement is of special interest in the case of GNSS outages, where inertial coasting drifts very quickly. In the proposed architecture, the VDM provides the estimate of position, velocity, and attitude, which is updated within a filter based on available observations, such as IMU data or when available, GNSS measurements. The filter is capable of estimating wind velocity and dynamic model parameters, in addition to navigation states and IMU sensor errors. Monte Carlo simulations reveal major improvements in navigation accuracy compared to conventional INS/GNSS systems during GNSS outages of 5 min. A discussion on the observability is also presented at the end. Copyright (C) 2016 Institute of Navigation.

AB A new optimization algorithm called multi-frequency vibrational genetic algorithm (mVGA) that can be used to solve the path planning problems of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is significantly improved. The algorithm emphasizes a new mutation application strategy and diversity variety such as the global random and the local random diversity. Clustering method and Voronoi diagram concepts are used within the initial population phase of mVGA process. The new algorithm and three additional GAs in the literature are applied to the path planning problem in two different three-dimensional (3D) environments such as sinusoidal and city type terrain models, and their results are compared. For both of the demonstration problems considered, remarkable reductions in the computational times have been accomplished. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI Federated Learning on the Road Autonomous Controller Design for
   Connected and Autonomous Vehicles
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS

ID OPTIMIZATION; COMMUNICATION
AB The deployment of future intelligent transportation systems is contingent upon seamless and reliable operation of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). One key challenge in developing CAVs is the design of an autonomous controller that can accurately execute near real-time control decisions, such as a quick acceleration when merging to a highway and frequent speed changes in a stop-and-go traffic. However, the use of conventional feedback controllers or traditional learning based controllers, solely trained by each CAV's local data, cannot guarantee a robust controller performance over a wide range of road conditions and traffic dynamics. In this paper, a new federated learning (FL) framework enabled by large-scale wireless connectivity is proposed for designing the autonomous controller of CAVs. In this framework, the learning models used by the controllers are collaboratively trained among a group of CAVs. To capture the varying CAV participation in the FL training process and the diverse local data quality among CAVs, a novel dynamic federated proximal (DFP) algorithm is proposed that accounts for the mobility of CAVs, the wireless fading channels, as well as the unbalanced and non-independent and identically distributed data across CAVs. A rigorous convergence analysis is performed for the proposed algorithm to identify how fast the CAVs converge to using the optimal autonomous controller.In particular, the impacts of varying CAV participation in the FL process and diverse CAV data quality on the convergence of the proposed DFP algorithm are explicitly analyzed. Leveraging this analysis, an incentive mechanism based on contract theory is designed to improve the FL convergence speed. Simulation results using real vehicular data traces show that the proposed DFP-based controller can accurately track the target CAV speed over time and under different traffic scenarios. Moreover, the results show that the proposed DFP algorithm has a much faster convergence compared to popular FL algorithms such as federated averaging (FedAvg) and federated proximal (FedProx). The results also validate the feasibility of the contract-theoretic incentive mechanism and show that the proposed mechanism can improve the convergence speed of the DFP algorithm by 40% compared to the baselines.

TI Behavioral Decision-Making Approach for Vehicle Platoon Control: Two
   Noncooperative Game Models
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Behavioral decision; game theory; Nash equilibrium; vehicle platoon
AB Game theory has been extensively studied in recent years for its potential benefits on solving interactions between autonomous vehicles in platoon control. In this article, we propose two behavioral decision-making approach based on non-cooperative game theory with both the complete information and incomplete information for cooperative vehicle platoon systems. The non-cooperative game payoff function takes the platooning performances of economy, comfort, safety, and further achieving self-driving functions into consideration. For the driving situations with incomplete information, a belief pool is constructed to represent the action probability for different behavioral types of vehicles, which will be updated by combining the driving intention identification with a Bayesian probability formula. With this, the stable strategies can be obtained for the two potentially conflicting parties, ensuring that neither of them has a motivation to change their driving behavior. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that with the proposed behavioral decision-making approaches with complete information, the cooperative platoon performance can be markedly improved; with incomplete information, the platoon can determine the behavioral types of conflicting vehicles and complete collaborative decision-making approaches for solving not only the simple road-rights conflicting problems, but also for the extended vehicle platoon driving scenarios in a more complex transportation system.

DE Vehicle detection; CNN; multi-task; region-of-interest
ID OBJECT; OCCLUSION
AB Vehicle detection is a challenging problem in autonomous driving systems, due to its large structural and appearance variations. In this paper, we propose a novel vehicle detection scheme based on multi-task deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and region-of-interest (RoI) voting. In the design of CNN architecture, we enrich the supervised information with subcategory, region overlap, bounding-box regression, and category of each training RoI as a multi-task learning framework. This design allows the CNN model to share visual knowledge among different vehicle attributes simultaneously, and thus, detection robustness can be effectively improved. In addition, most existing methods consider each RoI independently, ignoring the clues from its neighboring RoIs. In our approach, we utilize the CNN model to predict the offset direction of each RoI boundary toward the corresponding ground truth. Then, each RoI can vote those suitable adjacent bounding boxes, which are consistent with this additional information. The voting results are combined with the score of each RoI itself to find a more accurate location from a large number of candidates. Experimental results on the real-world computer vision benchmarks KITTI and the PASCAL2007 vehicle data set show that our approach achieves superior performance in vehicle detection compared with other existing published works.

AB In Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), vehicular networks are enabling technologies for onboard data services such as traffic safety, user infotainment, etc. Vehicular networks face many challenges when it comes to providing satisfactory quality of service, mainly because of issues that arise from unreliable communication in unfavorable propagation conditions. One prime example is Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication in the presence of big vehicles that present obstacles in the communication path of smaller vehicles, where the signal strength decays drastically due to the big vehicle shadowing. As a result, the communication range is shortened, and the safety message dissemination capability is reduced. In this paper, we analyze the impact of big vehicle shadowing on V2V communications, taking into account Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) networks. A geometric as well as a stochastic approach is employed to analyze the length of shadow regions for conventional cars and big vehicles on the road in different scenarios. This paper analyses the effect of large vehicles shadowing on a V2V communication link as a function of the shadow region length. A beamforming-based signal reception technique is proposed in order to mitigate packet collisions caused by hidden nodes. Considering relaying operation by big vehicles, three relaying schemes are proposed to improve the V2V message dissemination performance. Extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

AB The availability of vehicle interaction data, which is obtained by an in-vehicle forward collision warning system, including spacing between the leading and the following vehicle and time-to-collision, provides a valuable opportunity to predict crash risks in real time. When this opportunity is combined with connected vehicle technologies including vehicle-to-vehicle wireless communications, it is expected that more effective crash prevention would be achievable by providing predictive warning information as a part of proactive traffic safety management (PTSM). The purpose of this study is to develop a more reliable in-vehicle warning information provision strategy based on the prediction of crash risks using vehicle interaction data. A crash risk prediction model based on a long short-term memory was able to predict the crash risk after 3 seconds with a mean absolute percentage error of 8% using the data for the past 5 seconds. The predicted crash risk data were applied to derive the optimal threshold for triggering in-vehicle warning information, which is the essence of the proposed warning provision strategy. This study defined three indicators to evaluate the reliability of warning information: correct detection rate (CDR), detection failure rate (DFR), and information provision rate (IPR). An exemplar analysis result showed that the optimal threshold to minimize IPR in a situation where CDR and DFR are 100% and 0%, respectively, was identified as 0.69. The proposed methodology that predicts crash risks in real time and provides V2V-based warning information in a more proactive manner is expected to mitigate the crash risk significantly.

AB Automated vehicles (AVs) receive tremendous attention and achieve rapid development. It is foreseeable that hybrid operations of human driving vehicles and automated vehicles in the urban transportation environment will be a long-standing state. To investigate the influence of AVs on the hybrid ride-hailing market, data-driven agent-based modeling and simulation (D(2)ABMS) for large-scale transportation networks is proposed, in which human drivers, automated vehicles, and passengers form three types of agents. D(2)ABMS goes beyond existing approaches by employing data-driven multi-objective deep learning to learn ride-sourcing drivers' offline/online behavior. Embedding is used to represent the hidden attributes of different classes of drivers. Ride-sourcing data collected from the city of Hangzhou, China, are used to train and validate the drivers' decision-making model. Hybrid operations of human driving vehicles and automated vehicles with D(2)ABMS are comprehensively tested in various scenarios. The results show that a small proportion of automated vehicles in the hybrid ride-hailing market can significantly reduce the average waiting time of passengers. Besides, compared to the human driving scenario, the total exhaust emissions and vehicle kilometers traveled can be reduced by 12.3% in the AVs scenario. The proposed D(2)ABMS system has the potential to help transportation planners and ride-hailing platforms to assess their policies and operations management strategies in the era of shared mobility and automated vehicles.

AB In this paper, we present the combined usage of two different simulation levels to evaluate the economic and quality-of-service impact of deploying a fleet of autonomous wheelchairs in a hospital. The first simulation level deals with the physical world and takes into account the characteristics of a real robot, such as dimensions, sensor configuration, and speed. We simulate different trajectories in order to obtain realistic transportation times that are subsequently used in the high-level simulation. This high-level simulation considers those hospital resources that are affected by the inclusion of automated wheelchairs, and computes the economic implications of partially or totally substituting the current fleet of manual wheelchairs. Our results show that switching to automated wheelchairs may be beneficial in terms not only of reduced waiting times for patients, but also of economic savings.

AB Autonomous aerial refueling technology is an effective solution to extend flight duration of unmanned aerial vehicles, and also a great challenge due to its high risk. A novel real-time drogue detection and tracking strategy of monocular vision system for autonomous aerial refueling is proposed. It uses a direct image registration-based tracking method to ensure reliable and real-time tracking, and an ROI detection based on edge features to solve the tracking drift problem. A multiply patches fusion structure is adopted in the tracking method to improve the tracking accuracy and slow the divergence speed. Finally, various experiments are conducted to validate the proposed image processing strategy. These results show that the proposed strategy obtains a high accuracy as well as the real-time performance, and achieves a better performance than state-of-the-art methods.

AB In Autonomous aerial refueling (AAR), the position of the rapid moving drogue varies greatly by the influence of airflow. Real-time airborne position measurement is the key to the successful docking of refueling components. Aiming at the problems above, a fast and robust positioning method is proposed which fuses image detection, image tracking, prediction, and binocular stereo vision measurement algorithms. Meanwhile, we built an embedded end of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and digital signal processor (DSP), and deployed the proposed method. The hardware system integrates image acquisition module and image processing module. We designed interactive paths of image streams on the heterogeneous multicore platform, and implemented parallel acceleration algorithm. Our algorithms and embedded system have withstood harsh environmental test and performs good results on the drogue videos of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) compared with state-of-the-art trackers.

AB This study addresses the problem of autonomous rear parking (ARP) for car-like nonholonomic vehicles. ARP includes path planning to generate an efficient collision-free path from the start point to the target parking slot and path following to produce control inputs to stably follow the generated path. This paper proposes an efficient ARP method that consists of the following five components: (1) OpenAI Gym environment for training the reinforcement learning agent, (2) path planning based on rapidly exploring random trees, (3) path following based on model predictive control, (4) reinforcement learning based on the Markov decision process, and (5) travel length estimation between the start and the goal points. The evaluation results in OpenAI Gym show that the proposed ARP method can successfully be used by minimizing the difference between the reference points and trajectories produced by the proposed method.

AB This article considers the problem of planning collision-free reference trajectories for autonomous vehicles. Because optimal solutions to the problem may be hard to obtain in real time, we devise a procedure which yields potentially suboptimal but feasible solutions under standard assumptions. A hierarchical decomposition of the original problem based on a novel interpretation of the maneuver concept allows to consider independently the questions of which maneuver to choose and how to execute it in detail. The computation of trajectories relies on mixed-integer programming and can be performed efficiently based on the proposed decomposition, while controllable sets are used to assess the feasibility of a maneuver prior to its execution. An exemplary overtaking scenario demonstrates the efficacy of our approach. (C) 2019 European Control Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The selection of an appropriate method for modeling vehicle dynamics heavily depends on the application. Due to the absence of human intervention, the demand for an accurate and real-time model of vehicle dynamics for intelligent control increases for autonomous vehicles. This paper develops a multibody vehicle model for longitudinal-vertical dynamics applicable to advanced driver assistance (ADAS) applications. The dynamic properties of the chassis, suspension, and tires are considered and modeled, which results in accurate vehicle dynamics and states. Unlike the vehicle dynamics models built into commercial software packages, such as ADAMS and CarSim, the proposed nonlinear dynamics model poses the equations of motion using a subset of relative coordinates. Therefore, the real-time simulation is conducted to improve riding performance and transportation safety. First, a vehicle system is modeled using a semi-recursive multibody dynamics formulation, and the vehicle kinematics and dynamics are accurately calculated using the system tree-topology. Second, a fork-arm removal technique based on the rod-removal technique is proposed to reduce the number of bodies, relative coordinates, and equations constrained by loop-closure. This increase the computational efficiency even further. Third, the dynamic simulations of the vehicle are performed on bumpy and sloping roads. The accuracy and efficiency of the numerical results are compared to the reference data. The comparative results demonstrate that the proposed vehicle model is effective. This efficient model can be utilized for the intelligent control of vehicle ADAS applications, such as forward collision avoidance, adaptive cruise control, and platooning.

AB Vehicle positioning has been subjected to extensive research regarding driving safety measures and assistance as well as autonomous navigation. The most common positioning technique used in automotive positioning is the global positioning system (GPS). However, GPS is not reliably accurate because of signal blockage caused by high-rise buildings. In addition, GPS is error prone when a. vehicle is inside a tunnel. Moreover, GPS and other radio-frequency-based approaches cannot provide orientation information or the position of neighboring vehicles. In this study, we propose a cooperative-vehicle positioning (CVP) technique by using the newly developed optical camera communications (OCC). The OCC technique utilizes image sensors and cameras to receive and decode light-modulated information from light-emitting diodes (LEDs). A vehicle equipped with an OCC transceiver can receive positioning and other information such as speed, lane change, driver's condition, etc., through optical wireless links of neighboring vehicles. Thus, the target vehicle position that is too far away to establish an OCC link can be determined by a computer-vision-based technique combined with the cooperation of neighboring vehicles. In addition, we have devised a back-propagation (BP) neural-network learning method for positioning and range estimation for CVR The proposed neural-network-based technique can estimate target vehicle position from only two image points of target vehicles using stereo vision. For this, we use rear LEDs on target vehicles as image points. We show from simulation results that our neural-network-based method achieves better accuracy than that of the computer-vision method.

AB Target recognition is a key module in modern human-computer interaction (HCI) and computer vision systems It is pervasively used in many domains like autonomous vehicles and robot, remote operation, and video surveillance. However, due to the complicated environment and object occlusion, target recognition is still a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel target recognition algorithm toward autonomous robot by leveraging the Kinect sensors. More specifically, we utilize the Kinect sensors to capture scenario image in real-time. Subsequently, we present an improved HSV-based image segmentation algorithm to decompose the captured image, where morphological operation is employed for foreground target extraction. Afterward, we leverage Spatial Pyramid (SP)-based scheme for visual feature extraction. Then, we adopt a new distance metric for target matching. Comprehensive experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our proposed method.

AB In the future our resource on land will be over exploited. The exploration of new resources in the ocean is in progress. Mining will be done on the bottom of the sea. The sea is also a big source of renewable energy. Off shore wind parks and tide plants are built. Also, the major world trade is handled over sea routes and several big harbors. All this maritime facilities are getting older and there are effects like corrosion or malfunctions. In general, they need to be inspected frequently. For deep sea applications, security reasons and cost reduction autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) will be the first choice. The project "CView" addresses one of these inspection problems, the harbor inspection. But the algorithms, we present in this article can be adapted to many other inspection tasks. One of the main goals in this project is to find cracks or damaged areas at the underwater buildings or to observe critical sections under water with cost effective methods.
   The platform for developing the guidance algorithms for inspection is the AUV "SeaCat". This underwater vehicle has a control software system with an user interface for mission planning, a mission control system, a precise navigation system, optimized motor control with an autopilot and sensors for obstacle detection and inspection.
   For obstacle and inspection target detection, a scanning sonar is used. The sonar images are automatically processed with edge detection and line extraction algorithms to get a simplified environment description, which is used by the guidance methods presented in this article. A pan-tilt enabled sensor head with camera, laser measurement and MBES (Multi Beam Echo Sounder) is used to inspect the detected objects. Additionally, these sensors provide distance information to the inspection object which can be used by the inspection guidance.
   This article presents methods for inspection using the online information from the vehicle sensors to guide the vehicle efficient and safely. It is also important to handle the interaction between mission planning and execution. During mission planning, the operator will define the type of the inspection object (wall, vessel, sluice, etc.). The algorithms we develop use the information from the mission planning and the online data from the vehicle sensors to guide the vehicle to get the optimal inspection results. Therefore, a precise distance control to the inspection object, collision avoidance and object recognition are needed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,

ID HISTOGRAM
AB Unlike micro aerial vehicles, most mobile robots have non-holonomic constraints, which makes lateral movement impossible. Consequently, the vision-based navigation systems that perform accurate visual feature initialization by moving the camera to the side to ensure a sufficient parallax of the image are degraded when applied to mobile robots. Generally, to overcome this difficulty, a motion model based on wheel encoders mounted on a mobile robot is used to predict the pose of a robot, but it is difficult to cope with errors caused by wheel slip or inaccurate wheel calibration. In this study, we propose a robust autonomous navigation system that uses only a stereo inertial sensor and does not rely on wheel-based dead reckoning. The observation model of the line feature modified with vanishing-points is applied to the visual-inertial odometry along with the point features so that a mobile robot can perform robust pose estimation during autonomous navigation. The proposed algorithm, i.e., keyframe-based autonomous visual-inertial navigation (KAVIN) supports the entire navigation system and can run onboard without an additional graphics processing unit. A series of experiments in a real environment indicated that the KAVIN system provides robust pose estimation without wheel encoders and prevents the accumulation of drift error during autonomous driving.

AB In a mixed traffic environment, the connected vehicle platoon cannot communicate and collaborate with the surrounding vehicles. In this case, there is a high risk of collision in large vehicle platoon's lane change scenario where the non-connected surrounding vehicle occupies the target lane-changing space of the platoon. This study proposes a collision-avoidance lane change control method for a connected bus platoon to elude the non -connected vehicle in the target lane for completing lane change in the mixed traffic environment safely. A platoon vehicle sensor system with low-cost and low data processing complexity is designed, which equips with multiple sensors in longitudinal and lateral directions. Under control of the proposed platoon controller on the basis of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, the platoon following vehicles are fully autonomous in both longitudinal and lateral directions. The safe lane change decision-maker is designed based on the Finite State Machine (FSM). The decision-maker fuses multiple sensor data and determines the lane change operation of the following vehicles. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a three-vehicle platoon is carried out the lane change experiments in a high-fidelity mixed traffic scenario built by the PreScan-Simulink joint simulation platform. Exposure-to-Risk Index (ERI) of the platoon vehicles is adopted to evaluate the collision risk of the platoon during lane changing process. Three typical case scenarios are tested, including unimpeded lane change, passive waiting lane change, and active accelerating lane change. The simulation results show that all platoon vehicles have an excellent success rate in lane change without collision with the non-connected surrounding vehicle in these scenarios. The proposed method exhibits compelling benefits on improving the safety of platoon vehicles in the mixed traffic environment.

AB Introducing autonomous vehicles (AVs) on the market is likely to bring changes in the mobility of travelers. In this work, extensive research is conducted to study the impact of different levels of automation on the mobility of people, and full driving automation needs further study because it is still under development. The impacts of AVs on travel behavior can be studied by integrating AVs into activity-based models. The contribution of this study is the estimation of AVs' impacts on travelers' mobility when different travel demands are provided, and also the estimation of AVs' impact on the modal share considering the different willingness of pay to travel by AVs. This study analyses the potential impacts of AVs on travel behavior by investigating a sample of 8500 travelers who recorded their daily activity plans in Budapest, Hungary. Three scenarios are derived to study travel behavior and to find the impacts of the AVs on the conventional transport modes. The scenarios include (1) a simulation of the existing condition, (2) a simulation of AVs as a full replacement for conventional transport modes, and (3) a simulation of the AVs with conventional transport modes concerning different marginal utilities of travel time in AVs. The simulations are done by using the Multi-Agent Transport Simulation (MATSim) open-source software, which applies a co-evolutionary optimization algorithm. Using the scenarios in the study, we develop a base model, determine the required fleet size of AVs needed to fulfill the demand of the different groups of travelers, and predict the new modal shares of the transport modes when AVs appear on the market. The results demonstrate that the travelers are exposed to a reduction in travel time once conventional transport modes are replaced by AVs. The impact of the value of travel time (VOT) on the usage of AVs and the modal share is demonstrated. The decrease in the VOT of AVs increases the usage of AVs, and it particularly decreases the usage of cars even more than other transport modes. AVs strongly affect the public transport when the VOT of AVs gets close to the VOT of public transport. Finally, the result shows that 1 AV can replace 7.85 conventional vehicles with acceptable waiting time.

AB In this paper a novel, Gibbs sampler-based algorithm is proposed for coordination of autonomous swarms. The swarm is modeled as a Markov random field (MRF) on a graph with a time-varying neighborhood system determined by local interaction links. The Gibbs potential is designed to reflect global objectives and constraints. It is established that, with primarily local sensing/communications, the swarm configuration converges to the global minimizer(s) of the potential function. The impact of the Gibbs potential on the convergence speed is investigated. Finally a hybrid algorithm is developed to improve the efficiency of the stochastic scheme by integrating the Gibbs sampler-based method with the deterministic gradient-flow method. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the proposed approach and verify the analyses. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To investigate the effects of different market penetration rates (MPRs) of intelligent vehicles - Intelligent Driving Model (IDM) for autonomous vehicles (AVs), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) for AVs, and Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) - in mixed traffic flows with human driving vehicles (HDVs) at intersections, three signalized intersections (fixed signal, gap-based actuated signal, and delay-based actuated signal-controlled intersections) with low, medium, and high traffic demands are investigated. The simulation results indicate that CAVs with the CACC system outperform AVs with ACC or IDM systems and could reduce the average delay under low and high demand scenarios by 49% to 96%. CAVs with the CACC system could also significantly reduce average delay with a 20% MPR, while significant drops could only be observed after 60% and 80% MPRs for AVs with the ACC/IDM system. Gap-based and delay-based actuated signal control schemes are preferred under medium traffic flow demand, and CACC/ACC systems could significantly improve the performance of actuated signal-controlled intersections under high traffic flow demand.

AB Recent developments in wireless communication technologies have led to the evolution of connectivity between vehicles. Maintaining connectivity between vehicles increases a vehicle's awareness of other nearby vehicles, which can be used in safety applications. Identification of malicious misbehaving vehicles plays an important role in road safety. This research establishes the minimum detectable error (MDE) boundary for relative position between the observer and status vehicles (SV) using vehicle sensor and GPS error profile from field tests and established minimum standards. The results demonstrated that the MDE increases in the lateral direction (side-to-side) with the increase in relative distance between the observer and status vehicles (OV and SV) while remaining the same in the longitudinal direction (front-to-back). This research effort explores the use of Sensor-Based Misbehavior Detection (SBMD) with current specifications and the defined MDE boundary for implementation in the Intersection Movement Assist (IMA) safety application to rectify false positive and false negative hazard messages propagated by a malicious misbehaving vehicle. The simulation approach used in this research quantifies the total number of false positive/negative hazard detections received by a third-party vehicle (TPV) using the IMA safety application and assesses the capability of the OV equipped with SBMD to rectify the false positive/negative hazard detection. In cases where there was no hazard, SBMD produced an 83% to 90% improvement in the reduction of false positive hazard detections. In the cases with hazard scenario, where the SV is in the not-safe-to-cross zone, SBMD produced an 80% to 99% improvement in application performance.

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
LA English
DT Article
DE Autonomous vehicle; Stop-and-go waves; Traffic wave dissipation
AB The traffic jam phenomenon known as stop-and-go waves is commonplace on many roadways and is unavoidable due to the imperfect nature of human driving behaviour. Previous research by Stern et al. (2018) has demonstrated experimentally that a single Autonomous Vehicle (AV) can be harnessed to dissipate stop-and-go waves produced by 20 other passenger vehicles driving in a cycle. However, the experiment was conducted in an idealistic situation of a single-lane ring road with one AV; meaning no lane changing was possible and multiple AV interaction was left untested. To address these limitations, the AV driving behaviour used to achieve this, known as FollowerStopper (FS), was modelled for use in the Aimsun traffic simulation software and validated before further numerical experiments were conducted. The microsimulation scenarios were designed to observe how multiple AVs driven by the FS controller (referred to as FS-AVs in this paper) affect their traffic wave dissipation capability. Both single and double-lane ring roads experimental designs were used with the latter capturing the untested effect of lane changes. FS AV was found to be less effective than originally documented in both cases. Multiple FS-AVs included within one lane were still able to improve traffic flow and dissipate the stop-and-go waves, although it is sensitive to the combination of different factors and any deviation away from the ideal condition is likely to produce worse-off traffic operations in terms of traffic flow. For double-lanes, human-driven vehicles (HDVs) would change lanes at heightened rates to occupy the larger gap the FS-AV needs for its dissipating strategy, causing it to further pullback and set off a chain reaction to upstream traffic. Stop-and-go waves had not been dissipated and decreased traffic performance in terms of flow, speed and delay time resulted. Our results also showed that the wave dampening effect of the FS-AV does not translate between the ring road and its linear equivalent. On the other hand, our preliminary simulation results using a real-life freeway model did not suggest multiple FS-AVs worsen traffic conditions. The contradicting results might be due to different traffic conditions such as vehicle density. Further research is required to investigate what factors could adversely affect FS-AV's ability to dampen shockwaves and explore possible improvement to its driving algorithm.

AB Collaborative perception is essential to address occlusion and sensor failure issues in autonomous driving. In recent years, theoretical and experimental investigations of novel works for collaborative perception have increased tremendously. So far, however, few reviews have focused on systematical collaboration modules and large-scale collaborative perception datasets. This article reviews recent achievements in this field to bridge this gap and motivate future research. We start with a brief overview of collaboration schemes. After that, we systematically summarize the collaborative perception methods for ideal scenarios and real-world issues. The former focuses on collaboration modules and efficiency, and the latter is devoted to addressing the problems in actual application. Furthermore, we present large-scale public datasets and summarize quantitative results on these benchmarks. Finally, we highlight gaps and overlooked challenges between current academic research and real-world applications.

AB With the development of internet of vehicles and automated driving, individual-based trajectory control at intersections becomes possible. Trajectory planning and coordination for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have been studied at isolated "signal-free"intersections and in "signal-free"corridors under the fully CAV environment in the literature. Most existing studies are based on the definition of approaching and exit lanes. The route a vehicle takes to pass through an intersection is determined by its movement. That is, only the origin and destination arms are included. This study proposes a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to optimize vehicle trajectories at an isolated "signal-free"intersection without lane allocation, denoted as "lane-allocation-free"(LAF) control. Each lane can be used as both approaching and exit lanes for all vehicle movements including left-turn, through, and right-turn. A vehicle can take a flexible route by way of multiple arms to pass through the intersection. In this way, the spatial-temporal resources are expected to be fully utilized. The interactions between vehicle trajectories are modeled explicitly at the microscopic level. Vehicle routes and trajectories (i.e., car-following and lane-changing behaviors) at the intersection are optimized in one unified framework for system optimality in terms of total vehicle delay. Considering varying traffic conditions, the planning horizon is adaptively adjusted in the implementation of the proposed model to make a balance between solution feasibility and computational burden. Numerical studies validate the advantages of the LAF control in terms of both vehicle delay and throughput with different demand structures and temporal safety gaps.

AB Improving the safety of bicycle riders is one of the critical issues for autonomous driving. The crossing intention of the cyclist is expected to be predicted from the on- board camera of an autonomous vehicle. In a real traffic situation, a cyclist usually turns his or her head to check the situation of the back of him or her before he or she crosses the road. Therefore, the action of turning the head is an important cue to indicate the intention of crossing a road. This research proposes to estimate the cyclist's intention based on the body and head orientation using deep neural networks. The proposed system first detects the cyclists and extracts the area of the cyclist from red green blue (RGB) images based on a segmentation neural network. After that, the image of each cyclist is processed by a pose estimation neural network to detect each joint of the cyclist. Subsequently, the heat-map image of each joint of the cyclist is imported into a classification neural network to estimate the body and head orientation. The body orientation and head orientation are jointly used for the prediction of the cyclist's intention. In a separate process, the cyclist's position is estimated based on the disparity image generated from a stereo camera. Finally, two results, the cyclist's position and intention, are integrated to predict the trajectory of the cyclist. A series of experiments have been performed and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system has a satisfactory performance. In addition, the comparison experiments show that the model with only heat-map images as input has the best accuracy in the body and head orientation estimation.

AB As a critical component of the Internet of Things, connected automated vehicles (CAVs) are progressively gaining attention for their benefits in terms of increased safety and reduced traffic congestion. In this article, a novel distributed data-driven model-predictive control (DDMPC) approach including feedforward for disturbance is proposed for cruise control of a hybrid platoon with a combination of human-operated and autonomous vehicles. By employing a predictor constructed from input/output data, predictive controllers are obtained without depending on the characteristic information of the system. A robustness analysis is performed with a combination of the inputto-state stability (ISS) theory with the sampled-data systems theory, and the L-2-norm string stability is ensured by strict mathematical proof. In addition, we also discuss the asymptotic stability when the controller switches. CarSim simulation and bench experiment results verify that the DDMPC for connected vehicles can be robust to velocity disturbances and achieve satisfactory performance in ensuring string stability.

AB A novel description of dual-envelop-oriented path tracking issue is presented for fully automated vehicles which considers shape of vehicle as inner-envelop (I-ENV) and feasible road region as outer-envelop (O-ENV). Then implicit linear model predictive control (MPC) approach is proposed to design moving horizon path tracking controller in order to solve the situations that may cause collision and run out of road in traditional path tracking method. The proposed MPC controller employed varied sample time and varied prediction horizon and could deal with modelling error effectively. In order to specify the effectiveness of the proposed dual-envelop-oriented moving horizon path tracking method, veDYNA-Simulink joint simulations in different running conditions are carried out. The results illustrate that the proposed path tracking scheme performs well in tracking the desired path, and could increase path tracking precision effectively.

AB Autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) with a robot operation system (ROS)-based platform have been widely used in automation-assisted manufacturing. AGV robots in smart manufacturing are mainly used to handle materials. Such AGV robots with an ROS are generally capable of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and can therefore perform autonomous navigation (the well-known ROS-based SLAM navigation). From the viewpoint of "smart" manufacturing, which is expected to have richer artificial intelligence and human-robot interaction (HRI), an AGV robot with only ROS-based SLAM autonomous navigation is extremely restricted in functions and human-robot interactions. In this work, to increase HRIs and the flexibility of usage of AGVs with only ROS-based SLAM autonomous navigation, a hand-gesture-control-based navigation approach using a wearable armband with sensor data from both surface electromyography (SEMG) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is presented. The developed hand-gesture-control-based navigation with artificial neural network (ANN) hand gesture command recognition can be incorporated into a typical AGV operation with SLAM autonomous navigation. The hand-gesture-control-based navigation for AGVs proposed in this study mainly consists of two calculation phases: the detection of the significant hand gesture for the corresponding gesture operation command by the analysis of eight-axis SEMG data, and the recognition of hand gesture commands from the operator using an ANN with nine-axis IMU data. To appropriately combine the detection and recognition of hand gestures, two strategies were developed for the navigation control of an AGV in a certain continuous time period: ANN recognition by the IMU in a fixed decision window with an SEMG system wake-up, and ANN recognition by the IMU in a variable decision window with both a system wake-up and end. A series of online test experiments on AGV navigation by hand gesture control demonstrated that the presented approach has a competitive performance, particularly for short-path navigation.

AB The limited communication and computing resources, as well as the rising concerns about the privacy protection, bring significant challenges to the massive data training and analysis in vehicular networks. To address these challenges, in this paper a platoon-based distributed learning framework design for data learning is carried out, where the vacant computation resources of vehicle platooning networks are leveraged. In the proposed framework, a 2-phase Markovian stochastic process is utilized to depict the learning service heterogeneity for each participating vehicle. Meanwhile, we propose a joint scheduling and resource allocation scheme for efficiency-oriented distributed learning to maximize the learning accuracy subject to a given learning time constraint. The optimization problem is solved as follows. First, given the scheduled vehicles, the communication resource allocation is modeled as a minimum-maximum problem to minimize the learning delay of each learning round. Subsequently, an efficiency-oriented unbiased global aggregation policy is proposed to explore the convergence difference between partial scheduling and total scheduling. Considering the learning convergence and remaining time, an on-demand scheduling scheme is introduced to determine the number of scheduled vehicles. Finally, combining the learning efficiency of each vehicle with the scheduled number of vehicles, the scheduled vehicle set is selected. Simulations results show that the proposed scheduling policy can schedule the number of participating vehicles on demand based on the trade-off between learning performance and learning latency.

AB In recent years, the use of electric Autonomous Wheeled Mobile Robots (AWMRs) has dramatically increased in transport of the production chain. Generally, AWMRs must operate for several hours on a single battery charge. Since the energy density of the battery is limited, energy efficiency becomes a key element in improving material transportation performance during the manufacturing process. However, energy consumption is influenced by the navigation stages, because the type of motion necessary for the AWMR to perform during a mission is totally defined by these stages. Therefore, this paper analyzes methods of energy efficiency that have been studied recently for AWMR navigation stages. The selected publications are classified into planning and motion control categories in order to identify research gaps. Unlike other similar studies, this work focuses on these methods with respect to their implications for the energy consumption of AWMRs. In addition, by using an industrial Self-Guided Vehicle (SGV), we illustrate the direct influence of the motion planning stage on global energy consumption by means of several simulations and experiments. The results indicate that the reaction of the SGV in response to unforeseen obstacles can affect the amount of energy consumed. Hence, energy constraints must be considered when developing the motion planning of AWMRs.

AB This brief is concerned with integrated autonomous takeoff, target search, task assignment, and tracking using multiple fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in urban environments. The problem is to design flight autonomy that is embedded onboard each UAV to enable autonomous flight coordination and distributed tasking. Control logic design based on a finite state automaton model, integrating four modes of operations, namely, the takeoff mode, the fly-to-area of operation mode, the search mode, and the tracking mode, is presented. Different from the state-of-the-art of recent research, this brief provides a preliminary research on the autonomous cooperative takeoff for miniature fixed-wing UAVs, by considering collision avoidance, communication failure, etc. To make UAVs autonomously and cooperatively search roads in the urban environments, an efficient improved search algorithm is proposed based on recent research on the coverage search in the literature. For the target tracking, using geometric relations (relative position, orientations, speed ratio, and minimal turning radius), a systematic algorithm is developed to generate an optimal online path. All the algorithms in this work are developed based on realistic miniature fixed-wing UAV dynamic models. The main focus of the brief is to test the developed control logic and also the algorithms. The proposed framework is evaluated by our 3-D multi-UAV test bed.

ID MODEL
AB Automated highway driving combining longitudinal vehicle control and lane decision represents an important part on the way to autonomous driving. The general goal in this work is to investigate an ego-vehicle control approach for automated highway driving. For this, a multi-lane and multi-vehicle environment is considered where the vehicles around the controlled ego-vehicle represent disturbance inputs. The control law should be designed to increase local traffic flow stability around the ego-vehicle. The novelty in this work is represented by considering string stability in a multi-lane and multi-vehicle context, i.e. effects of ego-vehicle lane changes on surrounding traffic. The lane decision process results in a switching law based on the concept of minimum entropy control which represents a mixed H-2 - H-infinity control design method. Since it is well known that string stability is implied by bounding the H-infinity norm of a vehicle to vehicle transfer function it seems reasonable to apply this control strategy for automated highway driving. Thereby, each lane is assigned with an entropy value based on the actual traffic situation and the target lane is decided to balance local unequal distributions of traffic density. Lane changes are allowed only if local string stability can be assured. Longitudinal ego-vehicle control is realized with a compensator blending strategy where a dynamic compensator is derived targeting H-2 and H-infinity performance measure. The overall automated highway driving approach is evaluated by means of two test cases, namely a merging scenario and a highway driving scenario in a multi-lane and multi-vehicle traffic environment implemented in the high fidelity vehicle simulation tool IPG CarMaker.

AB The unmanned surface vehicles have been used most frequently in recent years in different applications, like environmental research. For this vehicles to accomplish their autonomous missions, a path-following algorithm is necessary to reduce the cross-track error in the presence of environmental disturbance. This article presents a control scheme based on the path-following nonlinear guidance law for a small unmanned surface vehicle called Krick Felix which follows a straight path. A dynamic model of 3 degrees of freedom for this vehicle is presented. The control scheme consists of a cascade control loop that is capable of guaranteeing zero cross-track error in the presence of environmental disturbance without adding an integral action. A nonlinear Lyapunov stability analysis is carried out for this control scheme taking in consideration the dynamics of both the inner loop and the external loop. The simulation was realized by implementing the 3-degree-of-freedom nonlinear model of the Krick Felix. The simulation also took account of the environmental factors, that is, marine currents. An experimental test is carried out with the Krick Felix where the control scheme present satisfactory results.

AB Virtual prototype is an important idea to resolve design problems of railway vehicle. A different development method, which is based on national product and autonomous development, and would like to reflect the specialty of railway vehicle development in China, is presented. According to the developing process of railway vehicle, the research contents and developing method are pointed out. The integration between CAD and performance analysis software on dynamics and strength is mainly considered. In CAD environment, the properties for dynamics computing are extracted directly from the model and exported with model. This method can avoid data losing caused by model rebuilding in CAE software, and increase the direct dependence of product CAD. Then the vehicle model with properties will be used for real-time dynamics and kinematics analysis and simulation. Therefore, the strength of the parts can be analyzed. The results of dynamics and strength analysis will be fed back to optimize the design model. All operations are dispatched by a control platform, and all data are managed according to the principle of PDM. Testing results show this method is correct.

AB An accurate and robust perception system is key to understanding the driving environment of autonomous driving and robots. Autonomous driving needs 3-D information about objects, including the object's location and pose, to understand the driving environment clearly. A camera sensor is widely used in autonomous driving because of its richness in color and texture, and low price. The major problem with the camera is the lack of 3-D information, which is necessary to understand the 3-D driving environment. In addition, the object's scale change and occlusion make 3-D object detection more challenging. Many deep learning-based methods, such as depth estimation, have been developed to solve the lack of 3-D information. This survey presents the image 3-D object detection 3-D bounding box encoding techniques and evaluation metrics. The image-based methods are categorized based on the technique used to estimate an image's depth information, and insights are added to each method. Then, state-of-the-art (SOTA) monocular and stereo camera-based methods are summarized. We also compare the performance of the selected 3-D object detection models and present challenges and future directions in 3-D object detection.

AB With the development of artificial intelligence, autonomous driving has gradually attracted attentions from academia and industry. Detecting road conditions correctly and timely is essential to autonomous driving. Thus, we propose a flexible and parallel framework called RISAT for real-time instance segmentation. RISAT improves on YOLOv3 by adding a new parallel branch to generate masks. RISAT can produce a good performance on high-quality segmentation for each instance using GAN. Furthermore, we utilizes ROI class loss on both mask learning for each class and perceptual loss on detailed information. On the benchmark of MS COCO, the frame per second(FPS) of RISAT can achieve 43, which is much faster than that of MNC and FCIS. Besides, the average precision(AP) of RISAT is greater than the previous one-stage object detection method by 0.5.

ID DESIGN
AB Autonomous driving is a promising technology to, among many aspects, improve road safety. There are however several scenarios that are challenging for autonomous vehicles. One of these are unsignalized junctions. There exist scenarios in which there is no clear regulation as to is allowed to drive first. Instead, communication and cooperation are necessary to solve such scenarios. This is especially challenging when interacting with human drivers. In this work we focus on unsignalized T-intersections. For that scenario we propose a discrete event system (DES) that is able to solve the cooperation with human drivers at a T-intersection with limited visibility and no direct communication. The algorithm is validated in a simulation environment, and the parameters for the algorithm are based on an analysis of typical human behavior at intersections using real-world data.

AB For autonomous driving to operate safely it is crucial to perceive surrounding objects correctly. Not only detection but also state estimation (track) of a perceived object is urgent. The state is required to enable a safe motion planning, since it allows to predict the future position of an object. To include only valid information, the state estimations must be maintained to determine which track is active and which is not. Mostly, a simple count-based approach is used. For this, we present an investigation of two common approaches from non-cooperative track management in comparison to two new management strategies to maintain tracks in a cooperative scenario. We evaluate them using three simulated scenarios with a varying rate of cooperative vehicles. A confidence-based approach was able to increase the average precision by up to 9 percentage points.

AB In this paper, we present our novel autonomous surface vessel platform, a full-scale Roboat for urban transportation. This 4-m-long Roboat is designed with six seats and can carry a payload of up to 1000 kg. Roboat has two main thrusters for cruising and two tunnel thrusters to accommodate docking and interconnectivity between Roboats. We build an adaptive nonlinear model predictive controller for trajectory tracking to account for payload changes while transporting passengers. We use a sparse directed graph to represent the canal topological map and then find the most time-efficient global path in a city-scale environment using the A* algorithm. We then employ a multiobjective algorithm's lexicographic search to generate an obstacle-free path using a point-cloud projected two-dimensional occupancy grid map. We also develop a docking mechanism to allow Roboat to "grasp" the docking station. Extensive experiments in Amsterdam waterways demonstrate that Roboat can (1) successfully track the optimal trajectories generated by the planner with varying numbers of passengers on board; (2) autonomously dock to the station without human intervention; (3) execute an autonomous water taxi task where it docks to pick up passengers, drive passengers to the destination while planning its path to avoid obstacles, and finally dock to drop off passengers.

AB Vehicle ad hoc networks (VANETs) are vital towards the success and comfort of self-driving as well as semi-automobile vehicles. Such vehicles rely heavily on data management and the exchange of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) for external communication with the environment. VANETs are vulnerable to a variety of attacks, including Black Hole, Gray Hole, wormhole, and rush attacks. These attacks are aimed at disrupting traffic between cars and on the roadside. The discovery of Black Hole attack has become an increasingly critical problem due to widespread adoption of autonomous and connected vehicles (ACVs). Due to the critical nature of ACVs, delay or failure of even a single packet can have disastrous effects, leading to accidents. In this work, we present a neural network-based technique for detection and prevention of rushed Black and Gray Hole attacks in vehicular networks. The work also studies novel systematic reactions protecting the vehicle against dangerous behavior. Experimental results show a superior detection rate of the proposed system in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques.

AB This paper experimentally demonstrates the effectiveness of an anticipative car-following algorithm in reducing energy use of gasoline engine and electric Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV), without sacrificing safety and traffic flow. We implement a Vehicle-in-the-Loop (VIL) testing environment in which experimental CAVs driven on a track interact with surrounding virtual traffic in real-time. We explore the energy savings when following city and highway drive cycles, as well as in emergent highway traffic created from microsimulations. Model predictive control handles high level velocity planning and benefits from communicated intentions of a preceding CAV or estimated probable motion of a preceding human driven vehicle. A combination of classical feedback control and data-driven nonlinear feedforward control of pedals achieve acceleration tracking at the low level. The controllers are implemented in ROS and energy is measured via calibrated OBD-II readings. We report up to 30% improved energy economy compared to realistically calibrated human driver car-following without sacrificing following headway.

AB Connected and automated technologies for vehicles pave the way for major changes in traffic control methodology. A decentralized control system based on a communication network using vehicle-to-vehicle communications and each vehicle's on-board controller will be one of the predominant approaches to vehicle trajectory optimization when the deployment of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) has advanced, because of its scalability and fault resistance compared to the centralized system. In this study, we propose a dynamic game-based vehicle trajectory optimization approach that can be utilized in a decentralized control system based on CAV technologies for merging segments, which is one of the bottlenecks of highways. Since the decentralized system is constructed by equal individual vehicles that decide their own optimal control in conflicting situations, we introduce a game-theory-based approach for obtaining a satisfactory result for those vehicles. Further, for achieving the optimal result at the end of the target segment, we employ a dynamic game to design the whole interrelated time-series trajectories of competing pairs of vehicles. To tackle the curse of dimensionality, we use an efficient method to enumerate the sets of combinations - a zero-suppressed binary decision diagram (ZDD) - and propose an algorithm that uses this ZDD to solve the dynamic game. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated via numerical experiments, and is compared to a static game-based model and an individual dynamic decision model. The results prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach-it induces efficiently adjusted behaviors of competing vehicles and enables merging success, especially in a situation where the initial gaps between vehicles are not enough for immediate lane change, which is achieved by the combined effect of the game-theoretic approach and the dynamic decision approach.

AB Vehicle detection is a crucial task in autonomous driving systems. Due to large variance of scales and heavy occlusion of vehicle in an image, this task is still a challenging problem. Recent vehicle detection methods typically exploit feature pyramid to detect vehicles at different scales. However, the drawbacks in the design prevent the multiscale features from being completely exploited. This paper introduces a feature pyramid architecture to address this problem. In the proposed architecture, an improving region proposal network is designed to generate intermediate feature maps which are then used to add more discriminative representations to feature maps generated by the backbone network, as well as improving the computational cost of the network. To generate more discriminative feature representations, this paper introduces multilayer enhancement module to reweight feature representations of feature maps generated by the backbone network to increase the discrimination of foreground objects and background regions in each feature map. In addition, an adaptive RoI pooling module is proposed to pool features from all pyramid levels for each proposal and fuse them for the detection network. Experimental results on the KITTI vehicle detection benchmark and the PASCAL VOC 2007 car dataset show that the proposed approach obtains better detection performance compared with recent methods on vehicle detection.

ID INTEGRATION; GPS
AB Accurate vehicle localization technologies are significant for current onboard navigation systems and future autonomous vehicles. More specifically, positioning accuracy is expected at the submeter level. This paper presents an accurate vehicle self-localization system and evaluates the proposed system in different classes of urban environments. The developed system adopts an innovative global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning method as the key technique. The GNSS positioning method can improve the positioning error by reducing the effects of multipath interference and non-line-of-sight errors with the aid of a three-dimensional map. To improve positioning accuracy further, the vehicle localization system integrates the GNSS positioning technique with inertial sensors and vision sensors by considering the characteristics of each sensor. The inertial sensors represent vehicle movement with heading direction and vehicle speed. The vision sensor is used to recognize the position change relative to lane markings on the road surface. Those techniques and sensors collaborate to provide an accurate position in the global coordinate system. To verify the effectiveness and stability of the proposed system, a series of tests was conducted in one of the most challenging urban cities, Tokyo. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed system can achieve submeter accuracy for the positioning error mean and has a 90% correct lane rate in the localization.

AB Cameras form an essential part of any autonomous surface vehicle's sensor package, both for COLREGs compliance to detect light signals and for identifying and tracking other vessels. Due to limited fields of view compared to more traditional autonomy sensors such as lidars and radars, an autonomous surface vessel will typically be equipped with multiple cameras which can induce biases when used in tracking if a target is present in multiple image frames. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline for camera-based maritime tracking that combines georeferencing with clustering-based multi-camera fusion for bias-free camera measurements with target range estimates. Using real-world datasets collected using the milliAmpere research platform the performance of this pipeline exceeded a lidar benchmark across multiple performance measures, both in pure detection performance and as part of a JIPDA-based tracking system.

TI Radar sensor based machine learning approach for precise vehicle

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

DT Article
ID TRACKING
AB Estimating vehicles' position precisely is essential in Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs) for their safe, autonomous, and reliable operation. The conventional approaches used for vehicles' position estimation, like Global Positioning System (GPS) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), pose significant data delays and data transmission errors, which render them ineffective in achieving precision in vehicles' position estimation, especially under dynamic environments. Moreover, the existing radar-based approaches proposed for position estimation utilize the static values of range and azimuth, which make them inefficient in highly dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose a radar-based relative vehicle positioning estimation method. In the proposed method, the dynamic range and azimuth of a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave radar is utilized to precisely estimate a vehicle's position. In the position estimation process, the speed of the vehicle equipped with the radar sensor, called the reference vehicle, is considered such that a change in the vehicle's speed changes the range and azimuth of the radar sensor. For relative position estimation, the distance and relative speed between the reference vehicle and a nearby vehicle are used. To this end, only those vehicles are considered that have a higher possibility of coming in contact with the reference vehicle. The data recorded by the radar sensor is subsequently utilized to calculate the precision and intersection Over Union (IOU) values. You Only Look Once (YOLO) version 4 is utilized to calculate precision and IOU values from the data captured using the radar sensor. The performance is evaluated under various real-time traffic scenarios in a MATLAB-based simulator. Results show that our proposed method achieves 80.0% precision in position estimation and obtains an IOU value up to 87.14%, thereby outperforming the state-of-the-art.

AB The careless activity of drivers in logistics transportation is a primary reason inside the vehicle during road accidents. This research aims to reduce the number of accidents caused by a failure of the driver in logistics transportation by incorporating an autonomous system. We propose a convolutional neural network -based architecture to recognize and classify different positions which cause road accidents. The proposed system is evaluated with the State Farm Distracted Driver Database, which included examples illustrating ten different driving positions like reaching behind and talking to the passenger, making up, safe driving, talking on the phone, clothing, checking right/left hand, right/left hand, and running the radio. The proposed approach has also been tested against recent algorithms and evaluated. Our model has obtained 98.98% accuracy compared to other types of approaches with different descriptors and classification techniques

AB This study deals with fault tree analysis algorithms based on an ontology-based approach in a fuzzy environment. We extend fuzzy fault tree analysis by embedding ontology-based fault tree structures. The ontology-based approach allows conducting advanced analyses grounded on rich domain knowledge. Two approaches as the conventional approach and rule-based method are applied for the calculations of failure probability and analysis of the fault tree. Collision and grounding of an autonomous ship are investigated in two scenarios. The structural design, probability calculations, and sensitivity analyses prove that the proposed system is applicable, robust, accurate and reliable. Thus, the propounded ontology-based fault tree algorithms fill a gap in safety engineering by its capability of comprehensiveness.

AB This paper explores the efficiency of a novel merging system based on a cooperative late merge strategy (CLMS) to mitigate the capacity reduction in work zones due to lane closure. Cooperative late merge strategies in connected vehicles (CV) and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) environments are formulated to enhance throughput by reducing gaps and increasing the synchronized speed in the work zone. We propose decentralized and centralized systems based on vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. The decentralized CLMS incorporates a modified lane-changing model to reflect the cooperative feature under the CV environment. The centralized CLMS is developed to further optimize the work zone throughput based on gap reduction and speed harmonization features enabled by CAV. The results prove that the decentralized CLMS outperforms other systems by increasing throughput as well as reducing delay and queue length. The centralized CLMS demonstrated substantial improvements compared to other systems. The simulation results prove that the decentralized CLMS improves capacity by 17% and the centralized CLMS by 45%, when compared to a traditional work zone system.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) are unmanned underwater vehicles widely used in marine environments. Establishing an efficient obstacle avoidance approach in underwater environments remains a challenge for these vehicles. Most studies have relied on simulated results; few have been conducted with vehicles in a real environment. This study used an ROV equipped with a scanning sonar as an experimental platform and applied fuzzy logic control to solve nonlinear and uncertain problems, which are difficult to address using conventional control theory. Using data from the depth and inertial sensors, fuzzy logic control can output defuzzification command values that are passed through a fuzzy inference engine to control ROV motion. Fuzzy logic control was used to evaluate depth and heading degrees in navigation experiments. In heading navigation, scanning sonar was used to detect obstacles in the scanning range. An optimum navigation strategy was also developed to calculate appropriate headings to safely and stably navigate during a mission to attain a predetermined destination. The results indicated that the ROV with fuzzy logic control had superior control stability and obstacle avoidance in an underwater environment.

AB Since vehicles are not restricted by lane lines when driving inside intersections, they travel freely and their paths have many possibilities, which are related to the traffic order of other road users. It is necessary to understand and describe vehicle paths through intersections. Previous studies on modeling vehicle paths through intersections have predominantly been limited to vehicles turning in one single direction or specific intersections, ignoring the application universality. This study set out to establish a unified model to describe non-conflict paths of vehicles through intersections. An entrance lane-based coordinate system with geometric parameters was established to describe the position relationships of entrance and exit lanes. Three-order Bezier curves with control parameters were used to describe vehicle paths. By extracting the parameter values from driving simulator-based experiments, the entrance and exit lane-based vehicle path model was proposed to represent the relationship between geometric and control parameters. Actual path data captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle were used for model validation, and results show the validity of the proposed model with a mean Root Mean Square Error of 0.4613 m between observed and fitted paths. More validation considering position distributions of path origins and destinations and angle deviations when entering and leaving intersections was performed. Cases from HighD open dataset also demonstrated the model's potential for lane-changing scenarios. This study provides an exciting opportunity to commonly describe vehicle paths without conflicts at geometrically regular and irregular intersections and is hoped to have the possibility of planning local paths for autonomous vehicles.

AB With the anticipated introduction of self-driving vehicles, new challenges arise for urban transport- and planning authorities. This study contributes to the efforts of formulating the potential opportunities and threats stemming from the introduction of larger fleets of self-driving vehicles to our cities, and what action could be taken by transport authorities to shape this introduction beneficially. In particular, the focus is put on the impact different parking management strategies can have on the performance of a fleet of shared automated vehicles providing on-demand transport services. This analysis focuses on aspects of service efficiency, externalities and service provision equity.
   The selected parking management strategies are tested in a large-scale activity-based simulation of a case study based on the city of Amsterdam, in which the parking facilities for SAV are digitally mapped throughout the city for different parking scenarios. The vehicles of the fleet aim at relocating to zones with high future demand, which can lead to bunching of vehicles at demand-hotspots. Parking management in the form of restricting parking facilities forces idle vehicles to spread out more evenly in the network. We show that this can reduce average passenger waiting times, increase service provision equity, cause less congestion and even can reduce the necessary fleet size. However, this comes at the cost of an increase in vehicle-kilometres-travelled, which reduces fleet efficiency and causes more undesired service externalities. Parking management is thus a simple, yet effective way for transport authorities to (a) determine where idle self-driving vehicles operating an on-demand transport service will be parked and (b) influence the performance of said transport service.

DT Article
ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
AB This paper proposes an optimal trajectory planning model for automated on-ramp merging. The minimum cost path based on the optimal control theory is selected as the optimal trajectory of the on-ramp merging vehicle, which could avoid potential collisions and satisfy the kinematic constraints on the vehicle motion. Moreover, an optimal control strategy is presented to solve the trajectory planning problem of the facilitating vehicle. An analytical closed-form solution is derived by using the Hamiltonian analysis and the path information of the merging vehicle. Particularly, the proposed planning process also considers the lateral movement of the on-ramp merging, which is more efficient in the application. Owing to the location and time that the on-ramp vehicle merges into the mainline can be obtained endogenously by its planning process, the model has high adaptation to various on-ramp environments. Solutions to the above two optimal methods are implemented in a model predictive control framework to cope with possible external disturbances. Several numerical simulations and PreScan-Simulink Co-Simulation illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Furthermore, this methodology is compared with a typical CACC strategy to demonstrate its potential to reduce fuel consumption, as well as improve passenger comfort.

AB Lane change and crash risk prediction are critical technologies for autonomous driving. An attention-based LSTM model is proposed in this paper for lane change behavior prediction in highways, considering both the surrounding vehicles' information around the target vehicle at the current time and the historical trajectory data of the vehicle, and it shows higher accuracy and better interpretability than other models. There are two sections in this prediction model, including a pre-judgment model based on the C4.5 decision tree and bagging ensemble learning, and a multi-step lane change prediction model of LSTM with attention mechanism. In addition, the model is applied in the NGSIM datasets to test practicability and accuracy, and the precision of left lane change and right lane change is 98% and 94% respectively 1 second before the vehicle changes lane. Finally, to judge the safety of vehicles in the driving process, a crash risk prediction model based on Time-To-Collision is proposed, which further verifies the effectiveness of the method.

AB With the development of autonomous driving and the Internet of Vehicles, vehicle data communication and data security become more and more important. Blockchain which has transparency, decentralization and immutability nature is treated as a promising approach to support intelligent vehicle systems. However, due to the high data update overhead, vulnerable raw data storage policy and inflexible consensus algorithm, traditional blockchain technologies are not suitable in modern vehicular systems. Hence, we propose, a blockchain data storage system that supports incremental data updating. Specifically, the system reduces the re-uploaded data size through smart contract and data partition to decrease the overhead. Besides, data replica and multi-data source addressing of index on the chain enhance the data reliability. In addition, an adaptive proof-of-work algorithm is developed, whose execution cost is dynamically adjusted based on nodes' behavior. It greatly improves the data record and updating efficiency. Comprehensive experimental results show that BUS can effectively improve the data updating efficiency with low overhead and fewer resources in intelligent vehicle scenarios.

AB Autonomous ground vehicle convoys heavily rely on wireless communications to perform leader-follower operations, which make them particularly vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks such as jamming. To mitigate the effects of jamming on autonomous convoys, this paper proposes a behavior-based architecture, called the Behavior Manager, that utilizes layered costmaps and vector field histogram motion planning to implement motor schema behaviors. Using our proposed Behavior Manager, multiple behaviors can be created to form a convoy controller assemblage capable of continuing convoy operations while under a jamming attack. To measure the performance of our proposed solution to jammed autonomous convoying, simulated convoy runs are performed on multiple path plans under different types of jamming attacks, using both the assemblage and a basic delayed follower convoy controller. Extensive simulation results demonstrated that our proposed solution, the Behavior Manager, can be leveraged to dramatically improve the robustness of autonomous convoys when faced with jamming attacks and can be further extended due to its modular nature to combat other types of attacks through the development of additional behaviors and assemblages. When comparing the performance of the Behavior Manager convoy to that of the basic convoy controller, improvements were seen across all jammer types and path plans, ranging from 13.33% to 86.61% reductions in path error.

AB Vehicle platooning control is a key-point for smart roads and cooperative-intelligent transport systems (C-ITS), being able to reduce the risk of rear-end collisions and improve road safety and traffic fluidity. To deal with constraints deriving from the surrounding environment, such as safety distance and speed limits, platooning technologies can benefit from advanced and distributed control strategies based on the model predictive control (MPC), suitable to provide adaptive behavior against variations of environmental and meteorological parameters provided by the Smart Road. Since platooning technologies are based on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) communications, the control strategy needs to be robust with respect to communication delays. This article performs a robustness analysis against such delays using a real-time and low-cost hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed based on Raspberry Pi boards. The testbed emulates a platooning architecture featured by three vehicles, managed by a distributed MPC strategy, and a road infrastructure manager (IM). Results show good robustness of the proposed control strategy with respect to communication delays, considering a variable transmission delay in the range 100, 400 ms and two scenarios: urban and suburban. The obtained results pave the way to real-road tests, considering connected vehicles equipped with Internet of Things (IoT) Gateways based on Raspberry Pi hardware.

AB Object detection and recognition of road scenes are crucial tasks of the autonomous driving environmental perception system. The low inference speed and accuracy in object detection models hinder the development of autonomous driving technology. Searching for improvement of detection accuracy and speed is still a challenging task. For solving these problems, we proposed an MCS-YOLO algorithm. Firstly, a coordinate attention module is inserted into the backbone to aggregate the feature map's spatial coordinate and cross-channel information. Then, we designed a multiscale small object detection structure to improve the recognition sensitivity of dense small object. Finally, we applied the Swin Transformer structure to the CNN to enable the network to focus on contextual spatial information. Conducting ablation study on the autonomous driving dataset BDD100K, MCS-YOLO algorithm achieves a mean average precision of 53.6% and a recall rate of 48.3%, which are 4.3% and 3.9% better than the YOLOv5s algorithm respectively. In addition, it can achieve real-time detection speed of 55 frames per second in a real scene. The results show that the MCS-YOLO algorithm is effective and superior in the task of automatic driving object detection.

AB The "driver's dilemma"presents an ethical conundrum in Highly Automated Vehicles (HAVs), where a decision is made between saving ten pedestrians or the vehicle's passengers in life-or -death situations. This study delves into the driver's dilemma by assessing respondents' beliefs on whether passengers should be sacrificed to save pedestrians, as well as their willingness to purchase such vehicles. We conducted an original survey that collected approximately 7,000 responses, taking into account factors such as ethical identities, technology familiarity, and practical HAV benefits. Using structural equation models, our findings emphasize the driver's dilemma, with utilitarianism and co-ridership significantly affecting the decision. Altruists generally favor saving pedestrians; however, altruistic individuals who believe that saving family members in vehicles over ten pedestrians is ethical are more inclined to purchase HAVs that prioritize their family members' safety, even if it means sacrificing pedestrians. Nonetheless, the majority view protecting pedestrians as the ethical choice, and our results indicate that a social consensus on pedestrian safety could encourage the adoption of ethical HAVs. Our study underlines the need to balance individual preferences with socially desirable outcomes in HAV policy.

AB In the recent past, platooning evolved into an attractive cooperative driving technology, broadly discussed in research and practice. Vehicles in platoons use cooperative adaptive cruise control to drive at close distances to each other. Platooning (i) increases the capacity of the street by a factor of 2; (ii) reduces the fuel consumption and emissions by up to 20%; and (iii) has social implications as it increases driver comfort and safety. As platooning research progresses, platooning coordination becomes a major research focus. The coordination of platoons, including the assignment of vehicles to platoons, the management of inter- and intra-platoon interactions, and the coordination of interactions with other vehicles is an important step towards an effective usage of platooning in practice. Based on a literature review of 1,600 papers, this survey provides an overview of state of the art in platooning coordination research for both cars and trucks. In this paper, we present a novel taxonomy for platooning coordination and classify existing approaches. We use the results of the literature review to discuss challenges and outline avenues for future work such as multi-objectiveness and individualisation.

ID ANOMALY DETECTION
AB The deep neural networks (DNNs)-based autonomous driving systems (ADSs) are expected to reduce road accidents and improve safety in the transportation domain as it removes the factor of human error from driving tasks. The DNN-based ADS sometimes may exhibit erroneous or unexpected behaviours due to unexpected driving conditions which may cause accidents. Therefore, safety assurance is vital to the ADS. However, DNN-based ADS is a highly complex system that puts forward a strong demand for robustness, more specifically, the ability to predict unexpected driving conditions to prevent potential inconsistent behaviour. It is not possible to generalize the DNN model's performance for all driving conditions. Therefore, the driving conditions that were not considered during the training of the ADS may lead to unpredictable consequences for the safety of autonomous vehicles. This study proposes an autoencoder and time series analysis-based anomaly detection system to prevent the safety-critical inconsistent behaviour of autonomous vehicles at runtime. Our approach called DeepGuard consists of two components. The first component- the inconsistent behaviour predictor, is based on an autoencoder and time series analysis to reconstruct the driving scenarios. Based on reconstruction error (e) and threshold (theta), it determines the normal and unexpected driving scenarios and predicts potential inconsistent behaviour. The second component provides on-the-fly safety guards, that is, it automatically activates healing strategies to prevent inconsistencies in the behaviour. We evaluated the performance of DeepGuard in predicting the injected anomalous driving scenarios using already available open-sourced DNN-based ADSs in the Udacity simulator. Our simulation results show that the best variant of DeepGuard can predict up to 93% on the CHAUFFEUR ADS, 83% on DAVE-2 ADS, and 80% of inconsistent behaviour on the EPOCH ADS model, outperforming SELFORACLE and DeepRoad. Overall, DeepGuard can prevent up to 89% of all predicted inconsistent behaviours of ADS by executing predefined safety guards.

AB Vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) is a critical component of the autonomous driving perception system, and research in this area has accelerated in recent years. However, there is yet no perfect solution to the vehicle re-identification issue associated with the car's surround-view camera system. Our analysis identifies two significant issues in the aforementioned scenario: (1) It is difficult to identify the same vehicle in many picture frames due to the unique construction of the fisheye camera. (2) The appearance of the same vehicle when seen via the surround vision system's several cameras is rather different. To overcome these issues, we suggest an integrative vehicle Re-ID solution method. On the one hand, we provide a technique for determining the consistency of the tracking box drift with respect to the target. On the other hand, we combine a Re-ID network based on the attention mechanism with spatial limitations to increase performance in situations involving multiple cameras. Finally, our approach combines state-of-the-art accuracy with real-time performance. We will soon make the source code and annotated fisheye dataset available.

AB The testing and evaluation system has been the key technology and security with its necessity in the development and deployment of maturing automated vehicles. In this research, the physics-intelligence hybrid theory-based dynamic scenario library generation method is proposed to improve system performance, in particular, the testing efficiency and accuracy for automated vehicles. A general framework of the dynamic scenario library generation is established. Then, the parameterized scenario based on the dimension optimization method is specified to obtain the effective scenario element set. Long-tail functions for performance testing of specific ODD are constructed as optimization boundaries and critical scenario searching methods are proposed based on the node optimization and sample expansion methods for the low-dimensional scenario library generation and the reinforcement learning for the high-dimensional one, respectively.

AB In the coming decades, it is a universal consensus that autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles will share the traffic roads. Trajectory planning of AVs has been extensively studied from the perspective of driving safety and riding comfort. However, human-like trajectory planning has rarely been studied. In this paper, we characterize and model human driving trajectories using real vehicle field test data collected on five two-way and two-lane urban curved roads with 20 experienced drivers and 3 experimental vehicles. A differential global positioning system (GPS) and an inertial navigation system (INS) are used to measure the vehicle positions and velocities in high precision. We study the trajectory characteristics of experienced drivers on curved two-lane roads, especially the relationships between the vehicle trajectories on bidirectional two lanes. Based on long short-term memory neural network (LSTM NN), we develop a data-driven trajectory model to generate human-like driving trajectories. By comparing with other three modeling methods, the LSTM NN model was validated and tested in various cases with promising performance.

AB The near-future deployment of high-level automation vehicles (AVs) can render promising opportunities to solve ongoing hindrances in modern safety-related research. Monitoring fatigued drivers on any road section is one of these challenges. Vehicle trajectory big data, monitored throughAVs, include key information with which to monitor fatigued drivers on roads. To mine this upcoming opportunity, a new data-driven approach which allows the direct monitoring of fatigued drivers on road segments is proposed here for the first time. A feasible study was conducted using big vehicle trajectory data and real-life traffic accident data. The results showed that fatigued drivers on a target road section can be successfully surveyed using the driving durations from departure locations to the target road section. It was found that, with a statistical correlation of 0.90, an index for fatigued drivers has strong explanatory power about the traffic accident rate. This finding indicates that the proposed method will be a promising means by which to monitor fatigued drivers at road locations in the upcoming era of autonomous vehicles. In addition, the method is immediately practicable if vehicle trajectory data are available.

AB Threat assessment evaluates the situational criticality and helps guarantee the driving safety of intelligent vehicles. Many critical metrics have been proposed for threat assessment, and it is essential to choose a suitable critical metric to address specific driving tasks under different driving conditions. This study presents a comparative overview of the state-of-the-art critical metrics based on real-world driving data validations. The critical metrics are categorized into five groups, i.e., time-based metrics, kinematics-based metrics, statistics-based metrics, potential field-based metrics, and unexpected driving behavior-based metrics. Benefits and limitations of the critical metrics are compared and validated based on the real-world data from naturalistic driving study, field operational test, and numerical simulations. Three typical driving scenarios, i.e., car-following, cut-in, and pedestrian-crossing, are extracted to evaluate the effectiveness of the critical metrics. Challenges and future researches of the critical metrics are also highlighted. This comprehensive and comparative overview is expected to assist with a system-level design for threat assessment of intelligent vehicles.

AB In recent years, intelligent transportation systems, which provide safety and autonomous services on the road using the Internet and cellular technologies, have become increasingly important. Vehicles are equipped with sensors that can transmit data to other vehicles or infrastructure according to different types of services. In order to ensure robust connectivity for safety services, the transmission among vehicles requires low latency, high reliability, and high packet delivery ratio. With the increased number of vehicles, more frequency resources are needed to establish fast and reliable services. In the area of high vehicle density, the demand of frequency resources is increasing to establish stable connectivity in a short time. However, the amount of frequency resources is limited; the resource allocation scheme (RAS) should effectively assign a resource block to each user to ensure the quality of service. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of RASs for the 5G-based vehicular networks known as 5G V2X. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities for resource allocation in modern vehicular networks and present numerous promising future research directions.

AB A novel integrated navigation algorithm, multi-model EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) integrated navigation algorithm, is presented in this paper for the deep water autonomous underwater vehicle. When a deep water vehicle is performing tasks in the deep sea, the navigation error will accumulate over time, if it relies solely on its own inertial navigation system. In order to get a more accurate position for the deep water vehicle online, an integrated navigation system is constructed by adding the acoustic navigation system. And because it is difficult to establish the kinematic model and the measurement model accurately for the deep water vehicle in the underwater environment, we propose the Multi-model EKF integrated navigation algorithm, and estimate the measurement errors of beacons online. Then we can estimate the position of the deep water vehicle more accurately. The new algorithm has been tested by both analyses and field experiment data (the lake and sea trial data), and results show that the multi-model EKF integrated navigation algorithm proposed in this paper significantly improves the navigation accuracy for the deep water vehicle.

AB Lane keeping assistance system (LKAS) is critical components of autonomous driving technologies, and their reliable operation is crucial to ensure passenger safety and maintain traffic flow. The validation of LKAS's safety and performance requires extensive testing using diverse and representative test scenarios. However, identifying the most critical test scenarios from a large data is a significant challenge. Inspired by Scenarios Engineering, the present study introduces a novel approach that includes being the first to combine analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and hierarchical clustering (HC) to identify critical test scenarios for the comprehensive evaluation of LKAS. The proposed approach first utilizes the AHP to rank the key factors that contribute to the failure of the LKAS. Then, by taking the key factors as clustering parameters, the HC method is employed to cluster LKAS failure scenarios with similar characteristics. The experimental results suggest that our method is capable of effectively clustering 200 LKAS failure scenarios into 9 categories of critical, reasonable, and reliable LKAS test scenarios. Furthermore, these 9 categories of critical test scenarios can provide guidance for the development and testing of autonomous driving and serve as a foundation for establishing a testing and evaluation system for LKAS in China and around the world.

AB Connected vehicles in vehicular networks will lead to a smart and autonomous transportation system. These vehicles have a large number of applications that require wireless connectivity by using cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X). The infrastructure of C-V2X comprises multiple roadside units (RSUs) that provide direct connectivity with the on-road vehicles. Vehicular traffic applications are mainly categorized into three major groups such as emergency response traffic, traffic management and infotainment traffic. Vehicles have limited processing capabilities and are unable to process all tasks simultaneously. To process these offloaded tasks in a short time, fog servers are placed near the RSUs. However, it is sometimes not possible for the fog computing server to process all offloaded tasks. In this work, a utility function for the RSU to process these offloaded tasks is designed. In addition, a knapsack-based task scheduling algorithm is proposed to optimally process the offloaded tasks. The results show that the proposed scheme helps fog nodes to optimally scrutinize the high-priority offloaded tasks for task execution resulting in more than 98% of emergency tasks beingprocessed by fog computing nodes.

AB The connected powertrain control, which uses intelligent transportation system information, has been widely researched to improve driver convenience and energy efficiency. The vehicle state prediction on decelerating driving conditions can be applied to automatic regenerative braking in electric vehicles. However, drivers can feel a sense of heterogeneity when regenerative control is performed based on prediction results from a general prediction model. As a result, a deceleration prediction model which represents individual driving characteristics is required to ensure a more comfortable experience with an automatic regenerative braking control. Thus, in this paper, we proposed a deceleration prediction model based on the parametric mathematical equation and explicit model parameters. The model is designed specifically for deceleration prediction by using the parametric equation that describes deceleration characteristics. Furthermore, the explicit model parameters are updated according to individual driver characteristics using the driver's braking data during real driving situations. The proposed algorithm was integrated and validated on a real-time embedded system, and then, it was applied to the model-based regenerative control algorithm as a case study.

DT Article
ID MOTION ESTIMATION; RECONSTRUCTION; VALIDATION
AB This article describes a method for compressing position and identification data for files containing comprehensive trajectory records of all vehicles traversing the same roadway segment over an arbitrary time period, in such a way that no loss of information content occurs. Such complete trajectory records are important for the study of traffic flow theory and could become increasingly relevant as test data against which to study the behavior of autonomous vehicles in a mixed traffic environment. Compression steps include differential encoding, motion prediction, and parsimonious binary storage, plus steps that are unique to the context of vehicle trajectories, including vehicle ID numbers and lane occupancy. The effectiveness of the compression is due, in part, to the strong correlations between positions (and speeds) of vehicles traveling near each other, as well as recognition that certain trajectory artifacts change with spatial and temporal frequencies much lower than the sampling rates. The algorithm is demonstrated on two sets of publicly available complete trajectory records, and compression performance statistics are given. Compression ratios in the range 10:1 to more than 20:1 are achieved for the sample files.

AB The motion of an underwater vehicle is prone to be affected by time-varying model parameters and the actuator limitation in control practice. Adaptive control is an effective method to deal with the general system dynamic uncertainties and disturbances. However, the effect of disturbances control on transient dynamics is not prominent. In this paper, we redesign the L-1 adaptive control architecture (L1AC) with anti-windup (AW) compensator to guarantee robust and fast adaption of the underwater vehicle with input saturation and coupling disturbances. To reduce the fluctuation of vehicle states, the Riccati-based AW compensator is utilized to compensate the output signal from L1AC controller via taking proper modification. The proposed method is applied to the pitch channel of REMUS vehicle's six Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) model with strong nonlinearities and compared with L1AC baseline controller. Simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy compared to the original L1AC. Besides, the fluctuation in roll channel coupled with pitch channel is suppressed according to the performances of control tests.

ID AUTOMATED VEHICLES
AB On-ramp merging is one of the important V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) applications and is critical for both driving safety and traffic efficiency. The ramp vehicle needs to get information about the surrounding vehicles through V2X communications, and calculate the control strategy. But the communication performance issues of connected autonomous vehicles, such as communication delay and packet loss, will lead to instability and poor trajectory tracking accuracy of the control system, which can even affect the safety and efficiency of vehicle driving. However, vehicle communication performance issues in on-ramp merging scenarios are rarely taken into account. In this paper, we first analyze the delay and packet dropout problems in V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) communication. Then, we propose a metric to measure the channel performance in the on-ramp environment called Exponentially Weighted Average Age-of-Information (E-AoI). And a reinforcement learning based algorithm for on-ramp merging control adaptive to communication performance is proposed. Lastly, we conduct simulation experiments with the traffic software SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) and the V2V channel model to evaluate the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that in the process of on-ramp merging in which the communication performance is considered, vehicle safety, comfort, and efficiency are guaranteed effectively by our proposed algorithm. In the case of persistent packet loss and delay due to channel congestion, our algorithm improves the security and efficiency of on-ramp merging compared to the basic DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) algorithm and the DDPG algorithm combined with MPC (Model Predictive Control) security constraints.

ID QUALITY
AB Underwater autonomous driving devices, such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), rely on visual sensors, but visual images tend to produce color aberrations and a high turbidity due to the scattering and absorption of underwater light. To address these issues, we propose the Dense Residual Generative Adversarial Network (DRGAN) for underwater image enhancement. Firstly, we adopt a multi-scale feature extraction module to obtain a range of information and increase the receptive field. Secondly, a dense residual block is proposed, to realize the interaction of image features and ensure stable connections in the feature information. Multiple dense residual modules are connected from beginning to end to form a cyclic dense residual network, producing a clear image. Finally, the stability of the network is improved via adjustment to the training with multiple loss functions. Experiments were conducted using the RUIE and Underwater ImageNet datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed DRGAN can remove high turbidity from underwater images and achieve color equalization better than other methods.

AB Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) is one of the popular connected and automated vehicle (CAV) applications for cooperative driving automation with combined connectivity and automation technologies to improve string stability. This study aimed to derive the string stability conditions of a CACC controller and analyze the impacts of CACC on string stability for both a fleet of homogeneous CAVs and for heterogeneous traffic with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), connected vehicles (CVs) with connectivity technologies only, and autonomous vehicles (AVs) with automation technologies only. We mathematically analyzed the impact of CACC on string stability for both homogeneous and heterogeneous traffic flow. We adopted parameters from literature for HDVs, CVs, and AVs for the heterogeneous traffic case. We found there was a minimum constant time headway required for each parameter design to ensure stability in homogeneous CACC traffic. In addition, the constant time headway and the length of control time interval had positive correlation with stability, but the control parameter had a negative correlation with stability. The numerical analysis also showed that CACC vehicles could maintain string stability better than CVs and AVs under low HDV market penetration rates for the mixed traffic case.

AB Knowledge of tire-road friction coefficient (TRFC) is valuable for autonomous vehicle control and design of active safety systems. This paper investigates TRFC estimation on the basis of longitudinal vehicle dynamics. A two-stage TRFC estimation scheme is proposed that limits the disturbances to the vehicle motion. A sequence of braking pressure pulses is designed in the first stage to identify desired minimal pulse pressure for reliable estimation of TRFC with minimal interference with the vehicle motion. This stage also provides a qualitative estimate of TRFC. In the second stage, tire normal force and slip ratio are directly calculated from the measured signals, a modified force observer based on the wheel rotational dynamics is developed for estimating the tire braking force. A constrained unscented Kalman filter (CUKF) algorithm is subsequently proposed to identify the TRFC for achieving rapid convergence and enhanced estimation accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is evaluated through CarSim (TM)-MATLAB/Simulink (TM) co-simulations considering vehicle motions on high-, medium-, and low-friction roads at different speeds. The results suggest that the proposed two-stage methodology can yield an accurate estimation of the road friction with a relatively lower effect on the vehicle speed.

AB This study investigates the often overlooked impact of on-board crowding on operational and user costs in public transit systems, specifically within a many-to-many bus transit line with varying demand patterns. While previous research has used mathematical programming for similar problems, this paper employs analytical approaches to offer deeper insights and address fundamental questions. First, we propose an approach to determine optimal bus capacities, factoring in in-vehicle crowding costs, assuming a fixed headway. Second, we explore the optimal dispatching policy for buses with fixed capacities, considering crowding costs. Third, we optimize both headway and vehicle capacity simultaneously. Our findings reveal that optimal vehicle capacity correlates with average passenger trip length and the square root of crowding-discomfort costs, especially when crowding increases linearly with load factor. When both headway and capacity are variable, smaller vehicles with shorter headways are favored, particularly in moderate-demand scenarios, especially with cost-effective staff models like autonomous fleets.

AB It is known that the techniques under the topic of Soft Computing have a strong capability of learning and cognition, as well as a good tolerance to uncertainty and imprecision. Due to these properties they can be applied successfully to Intelligent Vehicle Systems; ITS is a broad range of technologies and techniques that hold answers to many transportation problems. The unmanned control of the steering wheel of a vehicle is one of the most important challenges facing researchers in this area. This paper presents a method to adjust automatically a fuzzy controller to manage the steering wheel of a mass-produced vehicle; to reach it, information about the car state while a human driver is handling the car is taken and used to adjust, via iterative genetic algorithms an appropriated fuzzy controller. To evaluate the obtained controllers, it will be considered the performance obtained in the track following task, as well as the smoothness of the driving carried out. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Imaging lidar is an important sensor for use in vehicle environment perception systems, and its field of view (FOV) and instantaneous field of view (IFOV) determine the system's spatial coverage and the spatial resolution of detection, respectively. A smaller IFOV indicates that lidar can recognize a target over a greater distance. The FOV and the IFOV of conventional array-type lidar systems are constrained by the detector and cannot increase their target recognition distance while maintaining the same spatial coverage. To solve this problem, an imaging vehicle-mounted lidar system with a nonuniform IFOV distribution is proposed. By reducing the central IFOV while maintaining the same detection space, the system effectively doubles the available range for target discovery and recognition. Simultaneously, the central FOV has a larger entrance pupil, which matches the characteristic required to allow the central FOV to detect targets at greater distances. The proposed lidar system can recognize vehicle information at a longer range than conventional systems, and can play an important role in the 3D environmental perception field for intelligent vehicles.

AB This paper proposes a hybrid robust-adaptive learning-based control scheme based on Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) for the tracking control of autonomous ship maneuvering. We adopt a Time-Delay Control (TDC) approach, which is known as a simple, practical, model free and roughly robust strategy, combined with an Actor-Critic Approximate Dynamic Programming (ACADP) algorithm as an adaptive part in the proposed hybrid control algorithm. Based on this integration, Actor-Critic Time-Delay Control (AC-TDC) is proposed. It offers a high-performance robust-adaptive control approach for path following of autonomous ships under deterministic and stochastic disturbances induced by the winds, waves, and ocean currents. Computer simulations have been conducted under two different conditions in terms of the deterministic and stochastic disturbances and all simulation results indicate an acceptable performance in tracking of paths for the proposed control algorithm in comparison with the conventional TDC approach.

AB Increasing application areas and depths of autonomous systems in logistics provide a new level of challenge for the analysis and design of human-machine interaction concepts. Due to scarce high-skilled personnel in several regions and the objectives of efficiency and sustainability improvement, logistics operators have to pursue technological progress like automation with all means. In order to distinguish between more or less performing human-artificial collaboration systems in logistics ex ante for investment decision purposes, a multi-dimensional conceptual framework is developed. A comprehensive case study regarding automated truck driving in logistics is provided in order to test the concept concerning practical implications. Results include the notion of four distinctive and increasing resistance levels before finally an efficient trusted' collaboration between human operators and artificial intelligence systems can be achieved. This is important for the design of many automated systems in logistics, among others for driving and piloting professions regarding autonomous driving supervision.

ID GUIDANCE
AB This article studies the autonomous game control problem for spacecraft rendezvous by using the adaptive perception and interaction. The rendezvous mission involves two spacecraft (named by autonomous spacecraft a, and the other spacecraft o, respectively), in which the control strategy of spacecraft o is determined by only itself and cannot be intervened, but the control law of spacecraft a needs to be designed to achieve the rendezvous under the condition that only the relative position and velocity of spacecraft in the rendezvous system are available. By formulating the rendezvous system as a two-player linear quadratic differential game with unknown intent of spacecraft o, an autonomous game control method is proposed for spacecraft a by using the adaptive perception and interaction. This game control approach removes the requirement for knowing the intent of spacecraft o, relaxes the persistent excitation condition in traditional adaptive estimation methods, and guarantees the asymptotic stability of the rendezvous system. Furthermore, the intent (i.e., the weighting matrix in the cost function) of spacecraft o is inferred by solving a residual minimization problem. Finally, a simulation study is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the developed autonomous game control strategy.

ID TAKEOVER REQUESTS; PERFORMANCE; VEHICLES; SAFETY
AB Partially automated driving releases the driver from controlling the vehicle, but the driver still needs to monitor the driving situation steadily and be able to take over the control in critical situations when needed. In such a situation, problems arise as to how and when should the driver be informed and how to make sure the driver understands the general situation and specifically also the intention of the system correctly. Driver-vehicle interfaces (DVIs) present the necessary information to the driver. Many studies focusing on the time for Takeover-request (TOR) and the takeover time of the driver are performed leading to various results. The question: "Can a general conclusion about upper and lower limits of these two variables be drawn, which is applicable for all drivers in all situations?" should be answered. In the situation in which the driver should take over the control of the vehicle, multiple driving modes are involved. Mode error or confusion may happen when the vehicle has multiple modes. This leads to another question to be discussed in this contribution: Is it possible to use one DVI to show the status of several autonomous driving levels and corresponding functionalities to avoid mode error or confusion? To answer these questions, two DVIs are designed considering multiple autonomous driving levels and their functionalities to increase the situation/mode awareness of the driver. A simulator study with 38 participants was conducted to study the takeover time and behavior of drivers under different critical situations as well as to compare the usability. Results show that the takeover time depends upon the sequence of experiencing the TOR and the complexity of the takeover situation. Furthermore, two proposed interfaces could contribute to increasing the situation awareness of the driver. The limits and trends of developing the TOR are concluded based on the literature review and the experiments performed. It is concluded that using an average TOR time for every individual driver in all critical situations is not appropriate. Discussion with respect to TOR to ensure a safe takeover regarding non-driving-related tasks and takeover experiences is derived from the performed experiments.

AB As vehicles become more autonomous, there is a greater need for reliable and accurate information about neighbouring vehicles. In the V2V environment, information about nearby vehicles plays a significant role in predicting traffic flow behavior and this information becomes more effective during passing. To better understand how a driver's attention can impact the average velocity of their vehicle and those around them, an improved car-following model has been developed with a passing effect. The stability condition of the model is obtained via linear stability analysis, moreover, nonlinear analysis is used to determine the mKdV equation, which describes the evolution properties of the traffic density wave in the jammed region. The numerical and analytical results are discussed for smaller as well as larger rates of passing. It is found that for a smaller rate of passing, the phase transition occurs between the kink jam and the free flow. In the kink jam region, the initial perturbations are evolved in the form of a kink-antikink wave which moves in a backward direction and the amplitude of the headway profile decreases with an increase in the value of the driver's attention coefficient. While for the higher rate of passing, the phase change is between the uniform to the kink jam zone through the chaotic jam zone. In the chaotic region, the behavior of the headway waves is chaotic which band with one another, break up and propagate in the backward direction. Moreover, it has been observed that with the driver's increased attention on the average speed of any nearby vehicles, the unstable region is reduced for any rate of passing. Also, numerical findings are in accordance with theoretical results and noticed that this model is successful in increasing the efficiency of vehicle movement, reducing congestion, and improving safety on roads. To reduce collision accidents, the improved model can be implemented as active safety technology.

AB We propose an approach to synthesize control protocols for autonomous systems that account for uncertainties and imperfections in interactions with human operators. As an illustrative example, we consider a scenario involving road network surveillance by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that is controlled remotely by a human operator but also has a certain degree of autonomy. Depending on the type (i.e., probabilistic and/or nondeterministic) of knowledge about the uncertainties and imperfections in the human-automation interactions, we use abstractions based on Markov decision processes and augment these models to stochastic two-player games. Our approach enables the synthesis of operator-dependent optimal mission plans for the UAV, highlighting the effects of operator characteristics (e.g., workload, proficiency, and fatigue) on UAV mission performance. It can also provide informative feedback (e.g., Pareto curves showing the trade-offs between multiple mission objectives), potentially assisting the operator in decision-making. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach via a detailed UAV mission planning case study.
   Note to Practitioners-This paper is motivated by the problem of synthesizing operator-dependent optimal mission plans for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that take into account a variety of operator performance characteristics (e.g., workload, proficiency, and fatigue). While the proposed approach is demonstrated in the domain of human-automation UAV mission planning, in general it can be applied towards the design of control protocols (i.e., behaviors taken in response to external inputs) for any autonomous system that interacts with human operators. The benefit of this approach is that it directly considers human factors in the synthesis of autonomous control protocols, while existing approaches either synthesize control protocols without considering human factors or treat human-automation interactions as a post-design concern. In order to take human factors into consideration, the proposed approach uses abstractions that represent the effects of human performance characteristics on human-automation interactions. These abstractions are then integrated with formal models of the autonomous system under consideration, and reactive synthesis techniques are applied to generate autonomous control protocols given a specification for overall performance. To demonstrate this concept, we: 1) develop an example scenario based on a UAV road surveillance mission; 2) propose a hypothetical model for human operator behavior and performance that takes into account characteristics such as workload, proficiency, and fatigue; and 3) synthesize UAV control protocols and perform numerical experiments using tools for probabilistic model checking and two-player stochastic games. Based on the example scenario and hypothetical human model, experimental results suggest that this approach may be feasible for synthesizing control protocols for autonomous systems that account for uncertainties and imperfections in interactions with human operators.

AB Mobile manipulators have the potential to revolutionize modern agriculture, logistics and manufacturing. In this work, we present the design of a ground-based mobile manipulator for automated structure assembly. The proposed system is capable of autonomous localization, grasping, transportation and deployment of construction material in a semi-structured environment. Special effort was put into making the system invariant to lighting changes, and not reliant on external positioning systems. Therefore, the presented system is self-contained and capable of operating in outdoor and indoor conditions alike. Finally, we present means to extend the perceptive radius of the vehicle by using it in cooperation with an autonomous drone, which provides aerial reconnaissance. Performance of the proposed system has been evaluated in a series of experiments conducted in real-world conditions.

ID BILATERAL TELEOPERATION; AVOIDANCE; MOTION
AB Velocity obstacles (VO) are one of the most successful methods to compute collision-free trajectory for multi-agent systems. VO provide for each autonomous robot the set of velocities that avoids collisions with other robots (sharing or not the same motion policy) and with moving or static obstacles in the environment. In this paper we will focus on a particular efficient implementation of the VO paradigm available in the literature, called optimal reciprocal collision avoidance. After highlighting and solving a couple of deadlock situations that the current implementation cannot manage, we extend this approach to two challenging applications: (1) the landing of a UAV onto a UGV in crowded environments, and (2) the generation of force feedback for teleoperated vehicles. The theoretical outcomes are validated in simulated scenarios using V-REP as a virtual robot development tool.

ID ARCHITECTURE
AB In this article, we show how 4D/RCS incorporates and integrates multiple types of disparate knowledge representation techniques into a common, unifying architecture. The 4D/RCS architecture is based on the supposition that different knowledge representation techniques offer different advantages, and 4D/RCS is designed in such a way as to combine the strengths of all of these techniques into a common unifying architecture in order to exploit the advantages of each. In the context of applying the architecture to the control of autonomous vehicles, we describe the procedural and declarative types of knowledge that have been developed and applied and the value that each brings to achieving the ultimate goal of autonomous navigation. We also look at symbolic versus iconic knowledge representation and show how 4D/RCS accommodates both of these types of representations and uses the strengths of each to strive towards achieving human-level intelligence in autonomous systems.

DE Shape completion; 3D vehicle monitoring; Point clouds; Deep learning;
   Urban scene
AB As a dynamic and essential component in the road environment of urban scenarios, vehicles are the most popular investigation targets. To monitor their behavior and extract their geometric characteristics, an accurate and instant measurement of vehicles plays a vital role in traffic and transportation fields. Point clouds acquired from the mobile laser scanning (MLS) system deliver 3D information of road scenes with unprecedented detail. They have proven to be an adequate data source in the fields of intelligent transportation and autonomous driving, especially for extracting vehicles. However, acquired 3D point clouds of vehicles from MLS systems are inevitably incomplete due to object occlusion or self-occlusion. To tackle this problem, we proposed a neural network to synthesize complete, dense, and uniform point clouds for vehicles from MLS data, named Vehicle Points Completion-Net (VPC-Net). In this network, we introduce a new encoder module to extract global features from the input instance, consisting of a spatial transformer network and point feature enhancement layer. Moreover, a new refiner module is also presented to preserve the vehicle details from inputs and refine the complete outputs with fine-grained information. Given sparse and partial point clouds as inputs, the network can generate complete and realistic vehicle structures and keep the fine-grained details from the partial inputs. We evaluated the proposed VPC-Net in different experiments using synthetic and real-scan datasets and applied the results to 3D vehicle monitoring tasks. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed VPC-Net and show state-of-the-art results.

AB The objective of this paper is to develop online risk models that can be updated as conditions change, using risk as one metric to control an autonomous ship in operation. This paper extends and integrates the System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) and Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) with control systems for autonomous ships to enable supervisory risk control. The risk metric is used in a Supervisory Risk Controller (SRC) that considers both risk and operational costs when making decisions. This enables the control system to make better and more informed decisions than existing ship control systems. The novel control system is tested in a case study where the SRC can change: (i) which machinery system is active; (ii) which control mode to run the ship in; and (iii) which speed reference to follow. The SRC is able to choose the optimum machinery, control mode, and speed reference to maintain safe control of the ship over a route in changing conditions.

ID OBJECT DETECTION; VISION
AB The deep learning object detection algorithms have become one of the powerful tools for road vehicle detection in autonomous driving. However, the limitation of the number of high-quality labeled training samples makes the single-object detection algorithms unable to achieve satisfactory accuracy in road vehicle detection. In this paper, by comparing the pros and cons of various object detection algorithms, two different algorithms with a different emphasis are selected for a weighted ensemble. Besides, a new ensemble method named the Soft-Weighted-Average method is proposed. The proposed method is attenuated by the confidence, and it "punishes" the detection result of the corresponding relationship by the confidence attenuation, instead of by deleting the output of a certain model. The proposed method can further reduce the vehicle misdetection of the target detection algorithm, obtaining a better detection result. Lastly, the ensemble method can achieve an average accuracy of 94.75% for simple targets, which makes it the third-ranked method in the KITTI evaluation system.

AB A Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy for motorway traffic management, which takes into account both conventional control measures and control actions executed by vehicles equipped with Vehicle Automation and Communication Systems (VACS), is presented and evaluated using microscopic traffic simulation. A stretch of the motorway A20, which connects Rotterdam to Gouda in the Netherlands, is taken as a realistic test bed. In order to ensure the reliability of the application results, extensive speed and flow measurements, collected from the field, are used to calibrate the site's microscopic traffic simulation model. The efficiency of the MPC framework, applied to this real sizable and complex network under realistic traffic conditions, is examined for different traffic conditions and different penetration rates of equipped vehicles. The adequacy of the control application when only VACS equipped vehicles are used as actuators, is also considered, and the related findings underline the significance of conventional control measures during a transition period or in case of increased future demand.

AB A growing body of Human-Computer-Interaction research and the automotive industry has identified that understanding user needs and creating positive user experience (UX) is crucial in order to successfully introduce Autonomous Driving (AD) vehicles to the market. AD research is commonly undertaken to provide user insights by studying the individual-technology experiences in lab settings or by forecasting attitudes and acceptability through large surveys. However, these approaches base their knowledge on people's past or present expectations and limited real life experiences of AD. To better understand upcoming individual user needs and to enable new innovations beyond acceptability forecasts and UX lab tests, we need to identify new concepts through alternative methodologies that can generate user foresights based on users' evolving anticipations of AD in their everyday lives. We propose an ethnographic approach with iterative speculative scenarios, which we demonstrate through a study undertaken with participants from five families who were introduced to evolving levels of AD, in real-life situations. To demonstrate the methodology, we draw on empirical findings which reveal anticipatory experiences, which we abstract through the concepts of confidence, hope and being-in-the-moment. We show how these concepts structured our user foresights, and outline the implications of engaging them in innovation processes.

ID IMPACT
AB The law of vehicle movement has long been studied under the umbrella of microscopic traffic flow models, especially the car-following (CF) models. These models of the movement of vehicles serve as the backbone of traffic flow analysis, simulation, autonomous vehicle development, etc. Two-dimensional (2D) vehicular movement is basically stochastic and is the result of interactions between a driver's behavior and a vehicle's characteristics. Current microscopic models either neglect 2D noise, or overlook vehicle dynamics. The modeling capabilities, thus, are limited, so that stochastic lateral movement cannot be reproduced. The present research extends an intelligent driver model (IDM) by explicitly considering both vehicle dynamics and 2D noises to formulate a stochastic 2D IDM model, with vehicle dynamics based on the stochastic differential equation (SDE) theory. Control inputs from the vehicle include the steer rate and longitudinal acceleration, both of which are developed based on an idea from a traditional intelligent driver model. The stochastic stability condition is analyzed on the basis of Lyapunov theory. Numerical analysis is used to assess the two cases: (i) when a vehicle accelerates from a standstill and (ii) when a platoon of vehicles follow a leader with a stop-and-go speed profile, the formation of congestion and subsequent dispersion are simulated. The results show that the model can reproduce the stochastic 2D trajectories of the vehicle and the marginal distribution of lateral movement. The proposed model can be used in both a simulation platform and a behavioral analysis of a human driver in traffic flow.

AB With the increase of vehicle activities and adverse weather under the background of modernization and global warming, more attention should be paid to vehicle emissions reduction in such circumstances for environmental protection and sustainable transportation. Different from some typical measures, e.g., relevant government policies, improvement of vehicle hardware technologies, and optimization of traffic management, this paper develop a new method based on emergency path optimization to evaluate and reduce pollutant emissions of logistic transportation under adverse weather. Firstly, we establish a calculation model of pollutant emissions (LT-PE model) to calculate the amount of vehicle pollutant emissions produced under adverse weather. Then, a co-evolving path optimization (CEPO) method-based ripple-spreading algorithm is proposed in order to reduce pollutant emissions. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, this paper selects fruit logistics transportation affected by typhoon in China's Hainan Island as a case study. The results show that total vehicle pollutant emissions from the fruit transportation of 35 farms under the typhoon are 28.1% more than when there is no typhoon. The proposed method can reduce pollutant emissions by 21.2% compared with the traditional methods under typhoon.

AB Under the application of cooperative vehicle infrastructure technology, vehicles can drive more safely and efficiently in urban traffic environments. This paper presents a behavior decision model composed of a situation assessment module and decision process module to make a decision on lane selection and velocity control. Different common traffic elements are considered, such as surrounding obstacles, traffic lights, lane lines, and road velocity limits, to ensure the model outputs safe and legal behaviors. A green-wave passage strategy is also proposed to allow vehicles to pass through traffic intersections at a smoother velocity and to improve driving efficiency. To verify the correctness and rationality of the model, a Prescan/Simulink co-simulation platform including multiple common urban driving scenarios is established. The results show that the model can output correct behaviors with safety and legitimacy in different scenarios and realize vehicles meeting at intersections, vehicle-following, queuing at intersections with traffic lights, lane-changing for obstacle avoidance, and so forth. Compared with the general decision model without the green-wave passage strategy, the driving time is reduced by an average of 8.53%, and the standard deviation of the driving velocity is reduced by an average of 65.42%, which means that the model can reduce the variation of velocity and improve driving efficiency. The model has a certain practical application value.

AB Roundabouts promise potential safety and efficiency benefits in the homogenous environment of conventional vehicles. However, their performance can deteriorate if high and/or imbalanced traffic exists. The advent of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) has provided great opportunities to make transportation infrastructures more efficient. The purpose of this study is to develop a model to optimally control CAVs at roundabouts under a fully CAV environment. A two-stage optimization model is proposed to optimize vehicle trajectories. At the first stage, a mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated that optimizes vehicle arrival time at the roundabout. Then the optimal arrival time is fed to the second stage model to optimize vehicle trajectories, which is a non-linear programming model. CAVs are guaranteed to pass the roundabout safely without stops. Simulation tests are carried out with different demand levels and turning ratios. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, delay and throughput are compared with a conventional strategy in which the roundabout is controlled by the yielding rules. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the impact of control zone length and roundabout diameters. The results show the advantages of the proposed model in terms of delay and throughput in both high and imbalanced traffic.

   traversability analysis
ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES; MOTION
AB Traversability analysis, previously developed for ground robots, is extended to be performed by a group of marine vehicles over ocean flow fields. To enable distributed path planning against flow, a systematic method is developed to determine a flow map that is significant for sharing among vehicles. Using traversability analysis, each vehicle finds a set of support vectors to approximate the boundary of flow regions with strong average flow speed. These support vectors, together with the parameters determined by the traversability analysis, are then shared over the communication links. The shared information is used by each vehicle to construct a flow map that supports path planning algorithms running on each vehicle. Underwater communication limits the amount of information contained in a map that can be shared among vehicles. A novel method for information reduction is developed so that only reduced flow maps are shared. The length of the data packets can be adjusted through an optimization process that balance between the fidelity of the approximated boundary and the number of bits that need to be transmitted. Simulation results demonstrate that the flow maps constructed from the shared information can have sufficient quality to allow near-optimal paths to be generated.

AB A small autonomous vehicle is required for automatic spraying, carrying, harvesting etc in greenhouse production areas and small open vegetable fields. This study uses simple structural guidance using horticultural cultivating materials to develop an automatic guided vehicle. The developed vehicle has four wheels: two front steering wheels and two rear driven wheels. The vehicle has a detection unit, a steering unit and a control unit. The detection unit has two extension rollers and a potentiometer, whose function is to detect the distance from the vehicle to the guided material. The control method is used for adjusting the ON/OFF control of the front wheel steer by detecting the distance between the object material and the vehicle. The driving tests were conducted on a plastic film covered soil surface of a greenhouse isle, the concrete surface of a greenhouse central mad, and in the open field. The results of the straight driving control displayed absolute maximum errors of 35 mm, 23 mm, and 29 mm on the covered soil path, concrete path, and in the open field, respectively. The test results proved that the straight driving control of the developed system was sufficiently accurate to be used for spraying and carrying operations.

AB The purpose of this study is to control the position of an underactuated underwater vehicle manipulator system (U-UVMS). It is possible to control the end-effector using a regular 6-DOF manipulator despite the undesired displacements of the underactuated vehicle within a certain range. However, in this study an 8-DOF redundant manipulator is used in order to increase the positioning accuracy of the end-effector. The redundancy is resolved according to the criterion of minimal vehicle and joint motions. The underactuated underwater vehicle redundant manipulator system is modeled including the hydrodynamic forces for the manipulator in addition to those for the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The shadowing effects of the bodies on each other are also taken into account when computing the hydrodynamic forces. The Newton-Euler formulation is used to derive the system equations of motion including the thruster dynamics. In order to establish the endeffector trajectory tracking control of the system, an inverse dynamics control law is formulated. The effectiveness of the control law even in the presence of parameter uncertainties and disturbing ocean currents is illustrated by simulations.

AB We present a new vision-based localization system applied to an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with limited sensing and computation capabilities. The traditional EKF-SLAM approaches are usually expensive in terms of execution time; the approach presented in this paper strengthens this method by adopting a trajectory-based schema that reduces the computational requirements. The pose of the vehicle is estimated using an extended Kalman filter (EKF), which predicts the vehicle motion by means of a visual odometer and corrects these predictions using the data associations (loop closures) between the current frame and the previous ones. One of the most important steps in this procedure is the image registration method, as it reinforces the data association and, thus, makes it possible to close loops reliably. Since the use of standard EKFs entail linearization errors that can distort the vehicle pose estimations, the approach has also been tested using an iterated Kalman filter (IEKF). Experiments have been conducted using a real underwater vehicle in controlled scenarios and in shallow sea waters, showing an excellent performance with very small errors, both in the vehicle pose and in the overall trajectory estimates.

AB The Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue (CRASAR (R)) deployed a customized AEOS man-portable unmanned surface vehicle and two commercially available underwater vehicles (the autonomous YSI EcoMapper and the tethered VideoRay) for inspection of the Rollover Pass bridge in the Bolivar peninsula of Texas in the aftermath of Hurricane Ike. A preliminary domain analysis with the vehicles identified key tasks in subsurface bridge inspection (mapping of the debris field and inspecting the bridge footings for scour), control challenges (navigation under loss of GPS, underwater obstacle avoidance, and stable positioning in high currents without GPS), possible improvements to human-robot interaction (having additional display units so that mission specialists can view and operate on imagery independently of the operator control unit, incorporating 2-way audio to allow operator and field personnel to communicate while launching or recovering the vehicle, and increased state sensing for reliability), and discussed the cooperative use of surface, underwater, and aerial vehicles. The article posits seven milestones in the development of a fully functional UMV for bridge inspection: standardize mission payloads, add health monitoring, improve teleoperation through better human-robot interaction, add 3D obstacle avoidance, improve station-keeping, handle large data sets, and support cooperative sensing.

AB This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based motion control method to provide unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with additional flexibility while flying across dynamic unknown environments autonomously. This method is applicable in both military and civilian fields such as penetration and rescue. The autonomous motion control problem is addressed through motion planning, action interpretation, trajectory tracking, and vehicle movement within the DRL framework. Novel DRL algorithms are presented by combining two difference-amplifying approaches with traditional DRL methods and are used for solving the motion planning problem. An improved Lyapunov guidance vector field (LGVF) method is used to handle the trajectory-tracking problem and provide guidance control commands for the UAV. In contrast to conventional motion-control approaches, the proposed methods directly map the sensorbased detections and measurements into control signals for the inner loop of the UAV, i.e., an end-to-end control. The training experiment results show that the novel DRL algorithms provide more than a 20% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art DRL algorithms. The testing experiment results demonstrate that the controller based on the novel DRL and LGVF, which is only trained once in a static environment, enables the UAV to fly autonomously in various dynamic unknown environments. Thus, the proposed technique provides strong flexibility for the controller.

AB Nowadays, an autonomous car driver scheme (ACDS) plays a significant role in accessing vehicles. Due to its high rate of complexity, the performance based on risk evaluation requires additional software functions along with the electronic controlling unit. Consequently, these operations are more complex for identification and classification regarding the safety facility. So to overcome such shortcomings, an IoT based ACDS system is employed in controlling the precise and secure operation of the cars. The proposed IoT-ACDS approach employs in demonstrating the risk evaluation under three different phases namely hazard identification, hazard classification, and determination of ASIL. The hazard classification utilizes the integration of ANFIS-BWO along with the IoT-ACDS device thereby providing a systematic and autonomous process for accessing complex operations. In addition to this, two different types of operational testing protocols namely EuroNCAP testing protocols and NHTSA testing protocol and their performances are discussed by employing three different constraints such as severity (S-V), exposure (E-X) as well as controllability (C-R). Then the graph is plotted for various approaches namely the proposed ANFIS-BWO approach with several other Metaheuristic algorithms such as BWO, PSO and GA. Finally, the experimental analysis reveals that the proposed ANFIS-BWO provides better performances when compared with all other approaches.

AB Traditional adaptive cruise control (ACC) would choose to follow when encountering low-speed cars in front, but this may lead to low driving efficiency. This paper proposes a controller of enhanced adaptive cruise control with lane-change assistance (LCACC) for an articulated vehicle. A two-layer hierarchical control structure is adopted in this study. The upper determines high-level commands, while the bottom consisting of two modified deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) networks, controls the steering wheel and throttle/brake, respectively, according to the commands made by the upper layer. The vehicle's lateral and longitudinal control are decoupled and controlled by two modified DDPG networks. Through proper design of the state and reward function, the actions of the articulated vehicle such as steering and acceleration/braking are closer to those of humans, thus ensuring ride comfort. Compared with traditional ACC, the LCACC proposed in this study increases the driving efficiency of the articulated vehicle by an average of 16% when there is a low-speed lead car.

AB Modern intelligent road transportation system raises new requirements for advanced vehicle control technology of automated heavy commercial vehicle (HCV). This paper develops a novel output feedback-based linear parameter varying (LPV)/H-infinity control paradigm for automated HCV to achieve multi-objective dynamic coordinated control. The proposed control paradigm aims at keeping vehicle centered with respect to the lane boundaries while achieving better roll stability by applying appropriate steering action. The main idea is to schedule tracking performance and roll stability by adjusting steering action according to HCV rollover risk evaluated by the rollover index (RI) estimator during automatic path tracking. This novel control paradigm allows a seamless multi-objective self-scheduling control to be reached and ensures robustness and stability of the closed-loop control system. Based on Simulink & TruckSim Co-Simulation as well as hardware in loop (HIL) implementation, a comparison study between the proposed (LPV)/H-infinity control strategy and a classical linear time-invariant (LTI)/H-infinity controller is conducted, which confirms the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB Micro aerial vehicles equipped with high-resolution cameras can be used to create aerial reconstructions of an area of interest. In that context automatic flight path planning and autonomous flying is often applied but so far cannot fully replace the human in the loop, supervising the flight on-site to assure that there are no collisions with obstacles. Unfortunately, this workflow yields several issues, such as the need to mentally transfer the aerial vehicle's position between 2D map positions and the physical environment, and the complicated depth perception of objects flying in the distance. Augmented Reality can address these issues by bringing the flight planning process on-site and visualizing the spatial relationship between the planned or current positions of the vehicle and the physical environment. In this paper, we present Augmented Reality supported navigation and flight planning of micro aerial vehicles by augmenting the user's view with relevant information for flight planning and live feedback for flight supervision. Furthermore, we introduce additional depth hints supporting the user in understanding the spatial relationship of virtual waypoints in the physical world and investigate the effect of these visualization techniques on the spatial understanding.

AB In recent years, the research on object detection and tracking is becoming important for the development of advanced driving assistance systems (ADASs) and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) aiming to improve safety for all road users involved. Intersections, especially in urban scenarios, represent the portion of the road where the most relevant accidents take place; therefore, this work proposes an I2V warning system able to detect and track vehicles occupying the intersection and representing an obstacle for other incoming vehicles. This work presents a localization algorithm based on image detection and tracking by a single camera installed on a roadside unit (RSU). The vehicle position in the global reference frame is obtained thanks to a sequence of linear transformations utilizing intrinsic camera parameters, camera height, and pitch angle to obtain the vehicle's distance from the camera and, thus, its global latitude and longitude. The study brings an experimental analysis of both the localization accuracy, with an average error of 0.62 m, and detection reliability in terms of false positive (1.9%) and missed detection (3.6%) rates.

AB In recent times, Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) have been gaining popularity and have already begun to revolutionize the transport industry, mainly using real-time monitoring, analysis and exchange of data through In-Vehicle Networks (IVN). IVN can also interact with the outside world and roadside infrastructures. With all these advantages, certain weaknesses also creep in as the communication in IVN lacks proper security measures like encryption and authentication. These lack of security measures in IVN makes CAVs vulnerable to cyber-attacks which may have fatal consequences. The de facto standard for communication in IVN is known as Controller Area Network or CAN, and it also lacks said security features to protect CAN from outside threats like cyber attacks, sensor tempering etc. Realtime intrusion detection with minimal computational resources is the need of the hour to prevent disruptive consequences and fatal crashes. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection method based on Logical Analysis of Data (LAD) which facilitates real-time intrusion detection in CAVs using minimal computational resources. LAD is a two-class classification technique which uses the concept of a partially defined Boolean function (pdBf) to extract different rules for classification from a historical dataset consisting of CAN messages only. Usually, the normal behaviour of any CAV is specified using the extracted rules, and any unusual behaviour that does not conform with the extracted rules is treated as an anomaly. In this paper, we have extracted rules for anomaly and treated all behaviours that do not conform with these extracted rules as normal. The proposed method outperforms many state-of-the-art approaches, which include other rule-based methods, machine learning and deep learning methods both in terms of F 1 score and detection time. For CarChallenge 2020 dataset, the proposed method requires lesser than 47.5 & mu;s for detection using a Raspberry Pi device, which is far less than the average time difference between two consecutive CAN messages and thus can be considered as real-time intrusion detection. Real-time intrusion detection is important in preventing any untoward incidents in CAVs.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper is concerned with the distributed containment maneuvering for a fleet of under-actuated unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) guided by multiple virtual leaders moving along multiple parameterized paths with a formation. Each USV is subject to model uncertainties and ocean disturbances caused by wind, waves and ocean currents. Distributed containment maneuvering controllers are constructed for under-actuated USVs based on an auxiliary variable approach, an extended state observer, a linear tracking differentiator, and a path maneuvering design. The proposed controllers drive the vehicle fleet to converge to a convex combination of multiple virtual leaders regardless of the model uncertainties and ocean disturbances. The input-to-state stability of the closed loop system is analyzed via Lyapunov theory and the containment maneuvering errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. Simulation results show that the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed distributed containment maneuvering controllers for the under-actuated USVs.

AB In human-computer gaming scenarios, the autonomous decision-making problem of an unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) is a complex sequential decision-making problem involving multiple decision-makers. In this paper, an autonomous maneuver decision-making method for UCAV that considers the partially observable states of Human (the adversary) is proposed, building on a game-theoretic approach. The maneuver decision-making process within the current time horizon is modeled as a game of Human and UCAV, which significantly reduces the computational complexity of the entire decision-making process. In each established game decision-making model, an improved maneuver library that contains all possible maneuvers (called the continuous maneuver library) is designed, and each of these maneuvers corresponds to a mixed strategy of the established game. In addition, the unobservable states of Human are predicted via the Nash equilibrium strategy of the previous decision-making stage. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by some adversarial experiments.

AB Continuous and reliable positioning anywhere anytime is one of the critical technologies for autonomous driving, whereas it is challenging yet, especially in urban environments. Due to the presence of buildings, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is not reliable for degraded positioning accuracy and availability. With the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approach, Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has been widely used by autonomous driving vehicles for localization and environmental perception. However, LiDAR odometry (LO) or SLAM is not accurate enough for autonomous driving as it suffers from accumulative errors. This study proposes a GNSS/LiDAR/Map integrated positioning solution to provide ubiquitous positioning for autonomous driving, especially in urban areas, including urban canyons and underground, where GNSS is blocked partly or even fully. Matching LiDAR scans with a 3D map, named 3D map-based global localization (MGL), can provide an absolute positioning solution with respect to the map. A drift error model of LiDAR odometry is proposed to improve the accuracy of LiDAR odometry, and its model parameters are estimated online using either GNSS or MGL absolute locations. Using the graph optimization approach, GNSS and/or MGL precise absolute positioning are integrated with LO relative positioning to provide continuous and reliable positioning even when GNSS is degraded. The proposed solution is validated using the NCLT public dataset, which contains LiDAR data for building 3D maps and 3D map-based global localization, respectively. Based on the NCLT dataset, we simulate three typical urban scenarios to verify the performance of ubiquitous positioning. The experiments show that the proposed drift error correction method decreases accumulated error of LiDAR odometry by 35.5%, and the proposed GNSS/LiDAR/Map solution can provide continuous positioning with the availability of 100%, and improves the positioning accuracy by 49.8%, compared to the state-of-the-art approach of GNSS/LO fusion.

AB Automated Vehicles (AVs) can drop off passengers at predetermined destinations and relocate to less expensive, remote parking facilities, which offers the potential to repurpose valuable urban land near activity centers for alternative uses beyond vehicle storage. While some researchers believe AVs are the core element to solving parking problems, relieving urban land use, and enabling low-emission travel, others contend that AVs could incentivize increased Vehicles Miles Traveled (VMT) and exacerbate congestion. To bridge these disparate perspectives, this study endeavors to elucidate the environmental ramifications of AVs on parking through a comprehensive literature review. Based on an initial sample of 299 retrieved papers, 52 studies were selected as the result of the selection criteria detailed in the paper. The selected papers were categorized into five gradual parts to answer the raised research questions. As a principal finding of this study, our research provides city planners, traffic operators, and scholars with full-picture insights and trustworthy guidance, emphasizing the pivotal role of AVs in deciphering the sustainable impact on the urban environment.

AB Hybrid underwater vehicles have increasingly been deployed in ocean observation and monitoring. This study presents a novel multi-mode underwater vehicle (MUV) motivated by integrating maneuvering efficiency, endurance, and vertical continuous observation capacity. It can switch freely among three operation modes, including vertical diving and floating mode (VDF mode) like the Argo profiling float (APF), steady gliding mode (SG mode) similar to the underwater glider (UG), and propeller-rudder propulsion mode (PRP mode) such as the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The generalized theory of mode switching through extreme pitch angle adjustment is emphasized, mainly to achieve smooth switching between VDF mode and SG mode (or PRP mode) with the critical design principles of the attitude and buoyancy subsystems. Mathematical models describing the motion of three operation modes are developed, particularly considering the actuators' dynamic characteristics. Simulations are performed to verify the mobility performance of the vehicle, especially considering the influence of actuator dynamics on mode switching. Real-time prototype experiments demonstrate the desired performance of various modes and, in particular, confirm the necessity of the mentioned design criteria for mode switching.

ID AVOIDANCE
AB The Frenet frame is commonly used in motion planning for its superiority of reshaping nonconvex curving boundaries and decoupling lateral and longitudinal behaviors. Nevertheless, such frame is not friendly for describing vehicle-related characteristics such as body shape and classical dynamic models. By contrast, the Cartesian frame facilitates straightforward modeling of vehicle dynamics, but confronts nonconvex constraints on curving lanes. For purpose of combining the complementary superiority of both frames, this letter proposes a joint Cartesian-Frenet MPC planning method based on a locally linear intermediary connection which is updated along with solving iterations. The augmented Cartesian-Frenet state space is constrained by a Cartesian vehicle control model that stands for tracking feasibility, a set of Frenet road constraints that account for driving safety, and a Cartesian-Frenet transformation that connects both frames. The final optimization is solved iteratively, where each iteration formulates into a quadratic programming problem with help of the apriori trajectory solved by the previous iteration. A comparative simulation and a 5-month-long real-vehicle test prove that the proposed method can produce a feasible and smooth trajectory within a safe area efficiently in complex real-world scenarios.

AB Motor speed reference generators have been recently presented in the literature for the cruise control of electric vehicles powered by centralized electric motors. Steady-state operation at a safe tire longitudinal slip is guaranteed to be achieved in the presence of uncertain external conditions. In this paper, a generalization of the aforementioned result to electric vehicles that make use of two in-wheel motors and are required to perform a bend manoeuvre is provided. A new cruise and lateral control is presented. The two in-wheel rear motors provide propulsion, while being capable of acting as a rear differential. The key point relies on the definition of suitable references for the two motor speeds, so that motor speed control algorithms can be directly inherited from the electric machine control literature, while intrinsically robust motor speed control loops can be additionally incorporated. Both CarSim simulations and experiments are included to illustrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Autonomous navigation for High Earth Orbits satellites such as GEO is challenged due to the limitation of the uses of the existing onboard navigation solutions such as GPS/GNSS, celestial navigation. XNAV Navigation for spaceships using X-ray pulsars shows potential to be the ultimate natural UPS system as an interstellar navigation tool. It indicates that XNAV could assist these to overcome this challenge, an algorithm for satellite autonomous navigation using X-ray navigation and GNSS is presented. X-ray Navigation also known as XNAV is a novel celestial navigation method for aerospace vehicle time, position and attitude determination. X-ray navigation is a GPS-like location technique. GPS/GNSS is demonstrated as an efficient navigation method for GEO. This method utilized an onboard GPS/GNSS receiver to determine the position. The state-of-the-art shows the onboard multi-GNSS will be most likely to be utilized in the earliest real autonomous navigation application. The algorithm is based on a federal Kalman filter and processes X-ray phase measurements and GNSS pseudo-range. Simulation indicates that the integration of X-ray navigation and GNSS achieves position and velocity accuracy better than the performance of single system. Accordingly, the reliability of the entire navigation system can be enhanced through the integration that renders the system especially attractive for future highly autonomous satellite missions.

AB This article presents the essential abilities and limitations of various sensors used for object recognition in the operation environment of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). The use of autonomous and unmanned vehicles for reconnaissance and logistics purposes has attracted attention in many countries. There are many different applications of mobile platforms in both civilian and military fields. Herein, we introduce a newly developed manned-unmanned high-mobility vehicle called TAERO that was designed for public roads and off-road operation. Detection for unmanned mode is required in both on-road and off-road environments, but the approach to identify drivable pathway and obstacles around a mobile platform is different in each environment. Dense vegetation and trees can affect the perception system of the vehicle, causing safety risks or even collisions. The main aim was to define the limitations of the perception system in off-road environments, as well as associated challenges and possible future directions for practical applications, to improve the performance of the UGV in all-terrain conditions. Recorded datasets were used to verify vision and laser-based sensors in practical application. The future directions of work to overcome or minimize the indicated challenges are also discussed.

AB This article presents a distributed synchronization strategy for connected and automated vehicles in traffic networks. The strategy considers vehicles traveling from one intersection to the next as waves. The phase angle and frequency of each wave map to its position and velocity, respectively. The goal is to synchronize traffic such that intersecting traffic waves are out of phase at every intersection. This ensures the safe collective navigation of intersections. Vehicles share their phase angles through the V2X infrastructure, and synchronize these angles using the Kuramoto equation. This is a classical model for the self-synchronization of coupled oscillators. The mapping between phase and location for vehicles on different roads is designed such that Kuramoto synchronization ensures safe intersection navigation. Each vehicle uses a constrained optimal control policy to achieve its desired target Kuramoto phase at the upcoming intersection. The overall outcome is a distributed traffic synchronization algorithm that simultaneously tackles two challenges traditionally addressed independently, namely: coordinating crossing at an individual intersection, and harmonizing traffic flow between adjacent intersections. Simulation studies highlight the positive impact of this strategy on fuel consumption and traffic delay time, compared to a network with traditional traffic light timing.

AB Road vehicles include more and more assistance systems that perform tasks to facilitate driving and make it safer and more efficient. However, the automated vehicles currently on the market do not exceed SAE level 2 and only in some cases reach level 3. Nevertheless, the qualitative and technological leap needed to reach level 4 is significant and numerous uncertainties remain. In this sense, a greater knowledge of the environment is needed for better decision making and the role of the driver changes substantially. This paper proposes the combination of cooperative systems with automated driving to offer a wider range of information to the vehicle than on-board sensors currently provide. This includes the actual deployment of a cooperative corridor on a highway. It also takes into account that in some circumstances or scenarios, pre-set or detected by on-board sensors or previous communications, the vehicle must hand back control to the driver, who may have been performing other tasks completely unrelated to supervising the driving. It is thus necessary to assess the driver's condition as regards retaking control and to provide assistance for a safe transition.

AB The integrity and accuracy of positioning are crucial factors in vehicle safety. This article proposes an enhanced real-time array calibration (ERAC) technique based on real-time array error calibration with the Beidou Navigation Satellite System (BDS). Through fixed-point positioning tests and road tests, it is found that the ERAC method is superior to the traditional methods in terms of accuracy, stability, confidence, and the time required to reconstruct reliable points. The performance of the tested receiver is better than that of a commercial receiver with standard single-point positioning (SSP) in the context of multipath interference. Furthermore, the ERAC method meets the requirements for autonomous vehicle (AV) monitoring and public safety, especially in terms of the lane-level accuracy indicator, and its integrity indicators are greater than 95% to 97%. Additionally, the ERAC method has the potential to become an alternative solution for automatic vehicle safety monitoring in certain scenarios. This technique also has the ability to meet the wide positioning requirements of various vehicles and scenarios by adjusting its technical details.

AB Recently, there has been significant interest in developing underwater vehicles inspired by jellyfish. One of these notable efforts includes the artificial Aurelia aurita (Robojelly). The artificial A. aurita is able to swim with similar proficiency to the A. aurita species of jellyfish even though its deformation profile does not completely match the natural animal. In order to overcome this problem, we provide a systematic finite element model (FEM) to simulate the transient behavior of the artificial A. aurita vehicle utilizing bio-inspired shape memory alloy composite (BISMAC) actuators. The finite element simulation model accurately captures the hyperelastic behavior of EcoFlex (Shore hardness-0010) room temperature vulcanizing silicone by invoking a three-parameter Mooney-Rivlin model. Furthermore, the FEM incorporates experimental temperature transformation curves of shape memory alloy wires by introducing negative thermal coefficient of expansion and considers the effect of gravity and fluid buoyancy forces to accurately predict the transient deformation of the vehicle. The actual power cycle used to drive artificial A. aurita vehicle was used in the model. The overall profile error between FEM and the vehicle profile is mainly due to the difference in initial relaxed profiles.

AB To integrate driver experience and heterogeneous vehicle platform characteristics in a motion-planning algorithm, based on the driver-behavior-based transferable motion primitives (MPs), a general motion-planning framework for offline generation and online selection of MPs is proposed. Optimal control theory is applied to solve the boundary value problems in the process of generating MPs, where the driver behaviors and the vehicle motion characteristics are integrated into the optimization in the form of constraints. Moreover, a layered, unequal-weighted MP selection framework is proposed that utilizes a combination of environmental constraints, nonholonomic vehicle constraints, trajectory smoothness, and collision risk as the single-step extension evaluation index. The library of MPs generated offline demonstrates that the proposed generation method realizes the effective expansion of MP types and achieves diverse generation of MPs with various velocity attributes and platform types. We also present how the MP selection algorithm utilizes a unique MP library to achieve online extension of MP sequences. The results show that the proposed motion-planning framework can not only improve the efficiency and rationality of the algorithm based on driving experience but can also transfer between heterogeneous vehicle platforms and highlight the unique motion characteristics of the platform.

AB Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) will change the modes of road safety and traffic management, especially at intersections without traffic lights, namely unsignalized intersections. Existing researches focus on vehicle control within a small area around an unsignalized intersection. This paper expands the control domain to a large area with multiple intersections. In particular, a Multi-intersection Vehicular Cooperative Control (MiVeCC) is proposed to enable cooperation among vehicles in a large area with multiple unsignalized intersections. Firstly, a vehicular end-edge-cloud computing framework is proposed to facilitate end-edge-cloud vertical cooperation and horizontal cooperation among vehicles. Under the framework, a two-stage reinforcement learning is implemented to obtain the optimal policy for vehicle control. To support RL in the proposed framework, a multi-vehicle state representation method and a safety-oriented value representation method are designed. The former structures the collected vehicle information, and the latter evaluates the traffic condition. A multi-intersection simulation platform is developed to evaluate the proposed scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed MiVeCC can improve travel efficiency at multiple intersections by up to 4.59 times without collision compared with benchmark methods.

AB Previous work has shown that Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) can improve traffic flow by raising the critical vehicular density at which congestion first appears. However, these works also indicate that traffic with medium-to-high penetration of ACC-equipped vehicles is more susceptible to the formation of self-organized phantom traffic jams induced by perturbations in vehicular demographics. In this work, we propose a congestion-aware Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) algorithm as an alternative to address the trade-off between competing goals of raising the critical density, and reducing susceptibility to congestion observed at higher penetration rates of ACC-equipped vehicles. The congestion-aware CACC algorithm is modeled after the General Motor's car-following models, wherein the driver sensitivity is altered based on the prevailing congestion state (or traffic jam size) downstream of the connected vehicle. The dynamics of the self-organized traffic jam are modeled using a master equation. Results indicate that the congestion-aware CACC algorithm can increase the effective critical density leading to higher traffic flows, while also reducing the susceptibility to perturbations in vehicle demographics in the density range that adversely affects ACC-equipped vehicles.

AB Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) is a self-configuring decentralized dynamic network connects the vehicles through wireless links. Hence during the life time of vehicles, VANET may experience frequent link breaks, demands an efficient routing mechanism for networking of data packets among high speed vehicles with less delay. In this paper based on, cross layer autonomous route recovery (CLARR) mechanism, a new cross layer cluster based routing (CCBR) protocol is proposed. The major objective is to set up stable clusters to improve the routing path lifetime by decreasing the link breaks for better multimedia data dissemination. This is achieved by introducing clustering concept into the existing CLARR using mobility metric, then finding reliable relay vehicles to the destination by measuring relative distances among them. Performance of proposed scheme is evaluated through simulation experiments using network simulator-2.34 for different vehicle velocities and compared with existing cross layer based on demand routing protocol, CLARR. Simulation results indicate that the proposed CCBR routing algorithm outperforms over existing CLARR in terms of throughput, energy consumption per vehicle and reliability. Additionally, due to improved reliability, overall delay is reduced to 60% in proposed CCBR for different vehicle velocity and density.

   detection; vehicle-to-infrastructure cooperation
AB With the development of autopilot, the performance of intelligent vehicles is constrained by their inability to perceive blind and beyond visual range areas. Vehicle-to-infrastructure cooperative perception has become an effective method for achieving reliable and higher-level autonomous driving. A vehicle-to-infrastructure cooperative beyond visual range and non-blind area method, based on heterogeneous sensors, was proposed in this study. Firstly, a feature map receptive field enhancement module with spatial dilated convolution module (SDCM), based on spatial dilated convolution, was proposed and embedded into the YOLOv4 algorithm. The YOLOv4-SDCM algorithm with SDCM module achieved a 1.65% mAP improvement in multi-object detection performance with the BDD100K test set. Moreover, the backbone of CenterPoint was improved with the addition of self-calibrated convolutions, coordinate attention, and residual structure. The proposed Centerpoint-FE (Feature Enhancement) algorithm achieved a 3.25% improvement in mAP with the ONCE data set. In this paper, a multi-object post-fusion matching method of heterogeneous sensors was designed to realize the vehicle-to-infrastructure cooperative beyond visual range. Experiments conducted at urban intersections without traffic lights demonstrated that the proposed method effectively resolved the problem of beyond visual range perception of intelligent vehicles.

DE Bluetooth; vehicular; I2V; R2V; test-bed
AB It is very common to rule out Bluetooth as a suitable technology for vehicular communications. The reasons behind this decision usually result from misconceptions such as accepting that Bluetooth has a short application range, or assuming its connection setup is not fast enough to allow communication which involves high speed moving nodes. This paper refutes those assertions and proposes the use of Bluetooth not only for Infrastructure-to-Vehicle (I2V) or Road-to-Vehicle (R2V) communications, but also for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) or Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications. This novel proposal is based on using the remote name request procedure of the standard, combined with an adjustment and optimization of the parameters present in the inquiry and page procedures. The proposed modifications reduce the information exchange delay, thus making Bluetooth a suitable technology for high-speed vehicle communications. The feasibility of the proposed scheme has been validated through experimental tests conducted in different scenarios: laboratory, a real highway and a racing test circuit. There, the communication system was installed in a vehicle circulating at speeds of up to 250 km/h, whereas autonomous devices were disseminated throughout the road path to communicate with the on board devices obtaining satisfying results.

AB The air-ground cooperative emergency networks can assist with the rapid reconstruction of communication in the disaster area, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are deployed as base stations. The trajectory optimization of emergency base stations is of vital importance to the communication performance, which is related to the timeliness and effectiveness of rescue. In this paper, federated multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (F-MADDPG) based trajectory optimization algorithm is proposed to maximize the average spectrum efficiency. Specifically, the property of MADDPG is inherited to jointly control of multiple vehicles and federated averaging (FA) is utilized to eliminate the isolation of data to accelerate the convergence. Distributed F-MADDPG (DF-MADDPG) is further designed to reduce the communication overhead with a distributed architecture. The simulation results indicate that the proposed F-MADDPG and DF-MADDPG based algorithms significantly outperform the existing trajectory optimization algorithms, in terms of the average spectrum efficiency and the speed of convergence.

AB The quality of sonar seabed mapping performed using autonomous underwater vehicles depends on the accuracy of the vehicle trajectory estimation. To reduce the accumulated pose estimation errors from dead reckoning, bathymetry observations from sonar sensors are often exploited within the framework of pose graph optimization, while the submaps of the seafloor are used to add loop-closure constraints to the pose graph by iterative closest point. However, matching with the submaps suffers from local minima because the seafloor is mostly flat and featureless. To resolve this issue, we regularized the sub-maps to enhance the spatial variations in the vertical direction; thus, we realized improved matching accuracy. Given these constraints, the pose graph can be optimized in real time and provide a corrected trajectory. The performance of the proposed method is validated through experiments using a surface vessel where the same navigation and sonar systems as used in the underwater vehicles are installed, in addition to a GPS receiver for ground truth acquisition.

AB Vehicular networks play a key role in building intelligent transport systems for smart cities. For the purpose of achieving traffic efficiency, road safety, and traveler comfort, vehicles communicate and collaborate with each other as well as with the fixed infrastructure. In practice, not all vehicles are trustworthy. A faulty or malicious vehicle may forward or share inaccurate or bogus information, which may cause adverse things, such as, road accidents and traffic congestion. Therefore, it is very important to evaluate risk before a vehicle takes any decision. Various risk-based decision systems have already been proposed in the literature. The fuzzy risk-based decision model of vehicular networks is one of them. In this paper, we have proposed various extensions in the fuzzy risk-based decision model to achieve higher robustness, reliability, and completeness. We have presented the theoretical and simulation-based analysis and evaluation of the proposed scheme in a comprehensive manner. In addition, we have analytically cross verified the theoretical and simulation-based results. Qualitative comparison of the proposed scheme has also been presented in this work.

AB We analyse the sources of economies and diseconomies of scale in On-Demand Ridepooling (ODRP), disentangling three effects: when demand grows, average costs are reduced due to i) a larger fleet that diminishes waiting and walking times (Mohring Effect), and ii) matching users with more similar routes (Better-matching Effect). A counter-balance force (Extra-detour Effect), occurs when iii) the number of passengers per vehicle increases and users face longer detours. At low demand levels, there is little sharing and the Mohring effect prevails; as demand grows, more passengers per vehicle push for the Extra-detour Effect to dominate; eventually, vehicles run at capacity, and the Better-matching Effect prevails. The last two effects are specific to ODRP as the routes are not fixed but adapted online. Our simulations show that considering both users' and operators' costs, scale economies prevail, and that ODRP with human-driven vehicles and walks allowed has total costs similar to door-to-door systems with driverless vehicles.

AB We evaluate performance of four different operational policies to control an automated mobility on-demand system with sequential vehicle-sharing in one public open-source-accessible, agent based, high fidelity simulation environment. Detailed network dynamics on a road level of precision are taken into account. The case study is conducted in a simulation scenario of Zurich city. The results indicate that automated vehicles' shared mobility systems can provide approximately six times higher occupancy rates than conventional private cars, but that their costs in Switzerland are considerably higher than those of subsidized public transport or private cars in the short term. However, these services are predicted to be considerably cheaper than the full costs of owning and using a private car, which makes the long-term adoption of automated taxi services likely. Simulations demonstrate that choice of fleet operational policy determining customer-vehicle assignment and repositioning of empty vehicles (rebalancing) heavily influences system performance, e.g., wait times and cost. This aspect must thus be regarded as an important factor in the interpretation of existing and future simulation studies.

AB Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is a remote sensing technology widely used in many areas ranging from making precise medical equipment to creating accurate elevation maps of farmlands. In transportation, although it has been used to assist some design and planning works, the application has been predominantly focused on autonomous vehicles, regardless of its great potential in precise detection and tracking of all road users if implemented in the field. This paper explores fundamental concepts, solution algorithms, and application guidance associated with using infrastructure-based LiDAR sensors to accurately detect and track pedestrians and vehicles at intersections. Based on LiDAR data collected in the field, investigations were conducted in the order of background filtering, object clustering, pedestrian and vehicle classification, and tracking. The results of the analysis include accurate and real-time information of the presence, position, velocity, and direction of pedestrians and vehicles. By studying the data from infrastructure-mounted LiDAR sensors at intersections, this paper offers insights into some critical techniques that are valuable to both researchers and practitioners toward field implementation of LiDAR sensors.

AB The capability of 'demand-responsive transport', particularly in autonomous shared form, to better facilitate road-based mobility is considered a significant advantage because improved mobility leads to enhanced quality of life and wellbeing. A central point in implementing a demand-responsive transit system in a new area is adapting the operational concept to the respective structural and socioeconomic conditions. This requires an extensive analysis of the users' needs. There is presently limited understanding of public perceptions and attitudes toward the adoption of autonomous demand-responsive transport. To address this gap, a theory-based conceptual framework is proposed to provide detailed empirical insights into the public's adoption intention of 'autonomous shuttle buses' as a form of autonomous demand-responsive transport. South East Queensland, Australia, was selected as the testbed. In this case study, relationships between perceptions, attitudes, and usage intention were examined by employing a partial least squares structural equation modeling method. The results support the basic technology acceptance model casual relationships that correspond with previous studies. Although the direct effects of perceived relative advantages and perceived service quality on usage intention are not significant, they could still affect usage intention indirectly through the attitude factor. Conversely, perceived risks are shown to have no association with perceived usefulness but can negatively impact travelers' attitudes and usage intention toward autonomous shuttle buses. The research findings provide implications to assist policymakers, transport planners, and engineers in their policy decisions and system plans as well as achieving higher public acknowledgment and wider uptake of autonomous demand-responsive transport technology solutions.

AB For autonomous driving without high-definition maps, we present a model capable of generating multiple plausible paths from egocentric images for autonomous vehicles. Our generative model comprises two neural networks: feature extraction network (FEN) and path generation network (PGN). The FEN extracts meaningful features from an egocentric image, whereas the PGN generates multiple paths from the features, given a driving intention and speed. To ensure that the paths generated are plausible and consistent with the intention, we introduce an attentive discriminator and train it with the PGN under a generative adversarial network framework. Furthermore, we devise an interaction model between the positions in the paths and the intentions hidden in the positions and design a novel PGN architecture that reflects the interaction model for improving the accuracy and diversity of the generated paths. Finally, we introduce ETRIDriving, a dataset for autonomous driving, in which the recorded sensor data are labeled with discrete high-level driving actions, and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed model on ETRIDriving in terms of accuracy and diversity.

AB In the new agricultural scenarios, the interaction between autonomous tractors and a human operator is important when they jointly perform a task. Obtaining and exchanging accurate localization information between autonomous tractors and the human operator, working as a team, is a critical to maintaining safety, synchronization, and efficiency during the execution of a mission. An advanced localization system for both entities involved in the joint work, i.e., the autonomous tractors and the human operator, provides a basis for meeting the task requirements. In this paper, different localization techniques for a human operator and an autonomous tractor in a field environment were tested. First, we compared the localization performances of two global navigation satellite systems' (GNSS) receivers carried by the human operator: (1) an internal GNSS receiver built into a handheld device; and (2) an external DGNSS receiver with centimeter-level accuracy. To investigate autonomous tractor localization, a real-time kinematic (RTK)-based localization system installed on autonomous tractor developed for agricultural applications was evaluated. Finally, a hybrid localization approach, which combines distance estimates obtained using a wireless scheme with the position of an autonomous tractor obtained using an RTK-GNSS system, is proposed. The hybrid solution is intended for user localization in unstructured environments in which the GNSS signal is obstructed. The hybrid localization approach has two components: (1) a localization algorithm based on the received signal strength indication (RSSI) from the wireless environment; and (2) the acquisition of the tractor RTK coordinates when the human operator is near the tractor. In five RSSI tests, the best result achieved was an average localization error of 4 m. In tests of real-time position correction between rows, RMS error of 2.4 cm demonstrated that the passes were straight, as was desired for the autonomous tractor. From these preliminary results, future work will address the use of autonomous tractor localization in the hybrid localization approach.

TI SAV Operations on a Bus Line Corridor: Travel Demand, Service Frequency,

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE; TRANSIT; SYSTEM
AB Before shared automated vehicles (SAVs) can be widely adopted, they are anticipated to be implemented commercially in confined regions or fixed routes where the benefits of automation can be realized. SAVs have the potential to operate in a traditional transit corridor, replacing conventional transit vehicles, and have frequent interactions with riders and other vehicles sharing the same right of way. This paper microsimulates SAVs' operation on a 6.5-mile corridor to understand how vehicle size and attributes of such SAV-based transit affect traffic, transit riders, and system costs. The SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) platform is employed to model microscopic interactions among SAVs, transit passengers, and other traffic. Results show that the use of smaller, but more frequent, SAVs leads to reduced passenger waiting times but increased vehicle travel times. More frequent services of smaller SAVs do not, in general, significantly affect general traffic due to shorter dwell times. Overall, using smaller SAVs instead of the large 40-seat SAVs can reduce system costs by up to 4% while also reducing passenger waiting times, under various demand levels and passenger loading factors. However, the use of 5-seat SAVs does not always have the lowest system costs.

AB This paper proposes two new approaches based on the Supervisory Control Theory (SCT) of Discrete Event Systems (DES) for autonomous navigation of multiple robots with single-robot tasks being assigned by a centralized scheduler. The two planning strategies differ regarding their implementation, which can be centralized or distributed. Nevertheless, both approaches share the central objective of considering the scheduler and robots as DES, allowing the use of SCT to model and control the behavior of the whole multi-robotic system. Particularly, SCT is used to gather deliberative and reactive motion planning algorithms through a structured procedure, aiming to safely navigate in cluttered, dynamic, partially-known environments. The open-loop behavior of the autonomous navigation system is modeled for both approaches. Moreover, standard supervisors are obtained for the centralized planning approach. In addition, the supervisor localization method is considered to allow a distributed planning approach. Furthermore, as a case study, real experiments considering mobile robots are carried out to corroborate the proposed framework.

AB Automated industrial vehicles are taking an imposing place by transforming the industrial operations, and contributing to an efficient in-house transportation of goods. They are expected to bring a variety of benefits towards the Industry 4.0 transition. However, Self-Guided Vehicles (SGVs) are battery-powered, unmanned autonomous vehicles. While the operating durability depends on self-path design, planning energy-efficient paths become crucial. Thus, this paper has no concrete contribution but highlights the lack of energy consideration of SGV-system design in literature by presenting a review of energy-constrained global path planning. Then, an experimental investigation explores the long-term effect of battery level on navigation performance of a single vehicle. This experiment was conducted for several hours, a deviation between the global trajectory and the ground-true path executed by the SGV was observed as the battery depleted. The results show that the mean square error (MSE) increases significantly as the battery's state-of-charge decreases below a certain value.

AB Vehicle teleoperation has the ability to bridge the gap between completely automated driving and manual driving by remotely monitoring and operating autonomous vehicles when their automation fails. Among many challenges related to vehicle teleoperation, the considered ones in this work are variable time delay, saturation of actuators installed in vehicle, and environmental disturbance, which together limit the teleoperation performance. State-of-the-art predictive techniques estimate vehicle states to compensate for the delays, but the predictive states do not account for sudden disturbances that the vehicle observes, which makes the human-picked steer inadequate. This inadequacy of steer deteriorates the path-tracking performance of vehicle teleoperation. In the proposed successive reference-pose-tracking (SRPT) approach, instead of transmitting steering commands, the reference trajectory, in the form of successive reference poses, is transmitted to the vehicle. This paper introduces a method of generation of successive reference poses with a joystick steering wheel and compares the human-in-loop path-tracking performance of the Smith predictor and SRPT approach. Human-in-loop experiments (with 18 different drivers) are conducted using a simulation environment that consists of the integration of a real-time 14-DOF Simulink vehicle model and Unity game engine in the presence of bidirectional variable delays. Scenarios for performance comparison are low adhesion ground, strong lateral wind, tight corners, and sudden obstacle avoidance. Result shows significant improvement in reference tracking and in reducing human effort in all scenarios using the SRPT approach.

AB With heterogeneous traffic agents moving at unprotected phase, severe crossing conflicts are witnessed at mixed-flow intersections, especially when left-turning vehicles are confronted with motorcycles. However, for modelling vehicle turning behaviour, potential conflicts involving diagonal-crossing motorcycles are seldom investigated in existing studies. To explore these scenes, we present a novel interaction-aware deep-learning framework. Firstly, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based network is employed to encode vehicle historical motion features. Secondly, each vehicle's potential target lanes are identified with a probabilistic method, followed by a pooling module that extracts and summarizes intention features. Thirdly, Graph Attention Network (GAT) and a synthesized network are introduced to model vehicle-vehicle interaction and vehicle-motorcycle interaction respectively. Finally, multiple kinds of obtained features are sent to a LSTM based decoder module, where both future displacement and body orientation of vehicles are predicted. In short-time simulation experiments, average displacement error is reduced by 47.7% and 20.0% compared to baseline and state-of-the-art methods, with ablation studies conducted to quantify the efficacy of each kind of feature. Moreover, regarding recursive simulation, our model shows availability of reproducing lane-selecting and motorcycle-evasive behaviours. Distributions of post-encroachment time further indicate that the proposed framework can serve as a promising method to realize reliable motion planning for autonomous vehicles.

DE Driving environment perception; Cooperative vehicle-infrastructure;

AB Driving environment perception technology is a key issue for driving assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. Driving environment information collection and information fusion and representation are two important contents of this technology. On-board sensors such as camera, radar, lidar, etc., are popularly used to collect relevant information. However, when using these on-board sensors, uncertainty arises from ignorance and errors, where ignorance is usually caused by vehicle occlusion, and errors is caused by imprecise pose estimation and noisy measurements. Increasing sensor number would decrease such uncertainty, but complexity and cost is also increased in this way. In this paper, we present a V2I (vehicle-infrastructure) based urban driving environment collection method achieved only by two sensors, i.e., a Road Side Unit camera (RSU camera) and vehicle GPS. RSU camera is used to extract lane marking information, including position and type, and vehicle position information. Vehicle GPS provide position information of vehicle. A credibility map is proposed as the compact representation of urban environment, and accept those information from RSU camera and vehicle GPS. In order to hand uncertainty caused by sensors, Dempster-Shafer theory is employed to estimate the credibility of each cell, fuse the credibility root in the information provided by RSU camera and vehicle GPS, and map onto the credibility map. The performance of this method has been validated with real-world urban traffic data. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB The "asymmetry" between spatiotemporally varying passenger demand and fixed-capacity transportation supply has been a long-standing problem in urban mass transportation (UMT) systems around the world. The emerging modular autonomous vehicle (MAV) technology offers us an opportunity to close the substantial gap between passenger demand and vehicle capacity through station-wise docking and undocking operations. However, there still lacks an appropriate approach that can solve the operational design problem for UMT corridor systems with MAVs efficiently. To bridge this methodological gap, this paper proposes a continuum approximation (CA) model that can offer near-optimal solutions to the operational design for MAV-based transit corridors very efficiently. We investigate the theoretical properties of the optimal solutions to the investigated problem in a certain (yet not uncommon) case. These theoretical properties allow us to estimate the seat demand of each time neighborhood with the arrival demand curves, which recover the "local impact" property of the investigated problem. With the property, a CA model is properly formulated to decompose the original problem into a finite number of subproblems that can be analytically solved. A discretization heuristic is then proposed to convert the analytical solution from the CA model to feasible solutions to the original problem. With two sets of numerical experiments, we show that the proposed CA model can achieve near-optimal solutions (with gaps less than 4% for most cases) to the investigated problem in almost no time (less than 10 ms) for large-scale instances with a wide range of parameter settings (a commercial solver may even not obtain a feasible solution in several hours). The theoretical properties are verified, and managerial insights regarding how input parameters affect system performance are provided through these numerical results. Additionally, results also reveal that, although the CA model does not incorporate vehicle repositioning decisions, the timetabling decisions obtained by solving the CA model can be easily applied to obtain near-optimal repositioning decisions (with gaps less than 5% in most instances) very efficiently (within 10 ms). Thus, the proposed CA model provides a foundation for developing solution approaches for other problems (e.g., MAV repositioning) with more complex system operation constraints whose exact optimal solution can hardly be found with discrete modeling methods.

AB LiDAR-based Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a critical technology employed in various autonomous systems, including self-driving vehicles and autonomous delivery robots. In this paper, a novel LiDAR-based 3D MOT approach is introduced. The proposed method was built upon the Tracking-by-Detection (TbD) paradigm and incorporated multi-level associations that exploit an object's short-term and long-term relationships with the existing tracks. Specifically, the short-term association leverages the fact that objects do not move much between consecutive frames. In contrast, the long-term association assesses the degree to which a long-term trajectory aligns with current detections. The evaluation of the matching between the current detection and the maintained trajectory was performed using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Furthermore, an inactive track was maintained to address the issue of incorrect ID switching for objects that have been occluded for an extended period. The proposed method was evaluated on the KITTI benchmark MOT tracking dataset and achieved a Higher-Order Tracking Accuracy (HOTA) of 75.65%, marking a 5.66% improvement over the benchmark method AB3DMOT, while also accomplishing the number of ID switches of 39, 74 less than AB3DMOT. These results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach in diverse road environments.

AB The contemporary market creates a demand for continuous improvement of production, service, and management processes. Increasingly advanced IT technologies help designers to meet this demand, as they allow them to abandon classic design and design-testing methods in favor of techniques that do not require the use of real-life systems and thus significantly reduce the costs and time of implementing new solutions. This is particularly important when re-engineering production and logistics processes in existing production companies, where physical testing is often infeasible as it would require suspension of production for the testing period. In this article, we showed how the Digital Twin technology can be used to test the operating environment of an autonomous mobile robot (AMR). In particular, the concept of the Digital Twin was used to assess the correctness of the design assumptions adopted for the early phase of the implementation of an AMR vehicle in a company's production hall. This was done by testing and improving the case of a selected intralogistics task in a potentially "problematic" part of the shop floor with narrow communication routes. Three test scenarios were analyzed. The results confirmed that the use of digital twins could accelerate the implementation of automated intralogistics systems and reduce its costs.

AB In this paper, we describe a method for using Bayesian inference to create probabilistic point correspondences in video sequences. Using state prior distribution information from the on-board Kalman filter found in most unmanned aerial vehicles, we derive an accurate normal approximation for the movement of points in image space. It is then a direct application of Bayesian inference to find the probability that a feature point found in the current image is the same feature point found in a previous image. The biggest advantage of this method is that it does not require the use of feature descriptors, which can be computationally expensive to compute. The algorithm is tested in two scenarios. The first uses data and images collected from a sample flight to evaluate velocity estimation performance, which is critical for achieving good control. When compared to using a standard matching algorithm based on ORB (oriented FAST and rotate BRIEF) descriptors, our algorithm provides both improved efficiency and accuracy. We then implement the algorithm for online testing as well as develop a simple visual odometry method based on probabilistic correspondences for full state estimation. Flight tests demonstrate fully autonomous indoor hover using only the sensors embedded in the onboard smartphone and sonar.

AB This paper reviews the state of the art in traffic signal control methods that are based on data coming from onboard smartphones or connected vehicles. The review of the state of the art is carried out by applying analytical scientometric tools (topic visualization, co-citation analysis to establish influential journals and references, country analysis based on coauthorship, trending-topics analysis carried out by overlay visualization). The introduction of autonomous and connected vehicles will allow city management organizations to introduce new intersection management systems that rely on real-time positional data coming from instrumented vehicles. Traditional vehicles also could benefit from these new technologies by profiting from better-regulated intersections. This paper using a scientometric approach frames all the scientific contributions aimed at the field of traffic signal methods and experiments based on connected vehicles and floating car data. The applied scientometric approach reveals trending ideas and concepts and identifies the relevant documents that can be consulted in order for scientists and professionals to develop further this field with the implementation of new traffic signal control systems that can "give the green light" to drivers.

AB Automated driving emerges as a potential technology for safe, convenient, and efficient transportation systems. In order to assist autonomous vehicles with large-volume data dissemination such as high definition (HD) map, cellular network becomes more inevitable to provide vehicles with the ability of accessing Internet. However, due to the bottleneck of wireless bandwidth and the high mobility of vehicles, efficient data dissemination assisted by cellular network is a challenging task. In this work, we investigate the large-volume data dissemination problem for cellular-assisted automated driving within given delay limit. Firstly, a data dissemination scheme is designed that transmits data from the base stations to the target vehicle via a collection of relay vehicles. Secondly, a novel user satisfaction model is derived by considering the vehicular mobility patterns and erasure coding, and the data dissemination is formulated into an optimization problem. Then, to solve this NP-hard problem, a low-complexity dynamic programming based data dissemination solution with edge intelligence is proposed. Finally, by carrying out extensive simulation, the effectiveness of proposed data dissemination scheme for cellular-assisted automated driving is demonstrated, in comparison with the optimal solution based on CPLEX as well as other conventional schemes.

AB Nowadays, connected vehicles have a major role in enhancing the driving experience. Connected vehicles in the network share their knowledge with the help of the network known as the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). However, connection through the network comes with risks ranging from privacy concerns to security vulnerabilities in the network. Inside vehicles, many sensors and Electronic Control Units (ECUs) are connected via specific network protocols, known as Intra-Vehicle communications, to assist the driver in tasks such as autonomous driving. Communicating through different protocols results in security openness for attackers to disturb the normal functioning of sensors and ECUs, which sometimes has detrimental effects. Moreover, in IoV, there is active communication between vehicles and other vehicles or road infrastructures alongside the network, known as Inter-Vehicle communications. InterVehicle communications can also be an open vulnerability to intruders. Motivated by the mentioned security problems, many research initiatives have elaborated on building Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to detect malicious behavior threatening the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity of IoV. In this survey, we first provide a structured classification of IoV environment, its components, and the vulnerabilities of inter/intra-vehicle networks. Then, we provide a comprehensive literature review regarding numerous proposed IDS for IoV networks. Further, we discuss IDS criteria with a focus on essential areas that should be taken into account while assessing IoV network security, which can be related to IDS implementation constraints or further privacy requirements.

AB An antenna's radiation pattern is dependent on its geometrical characteristics and its antenna's surroundings, materials, and geometries. As such, to predict the antenna's performance in complex environments, such as that of small antennas on large vehicles, it is necessary to obtain a model that represents such a full scenario, so that the simulation may be accomplished in the process of antenna design and placement. Due to the complex and electrically large nature of some electromagnetic problems, the detailed representation, even for a simplified model, may imply a large computational effort, both in terms of time and memory, is needed to perform the simulation. This paper evaluates how machine learning models can be used to mitigate the computational effort required to predict the behavior of antennas requiring complex modeling. It is proposed to start from a more simplified model of the electromagnetic structure to obtain a prediction for the correct solution, without needing to simulate the full structure in every iteration, and to combine this with prediction algorithms to obtain the solution of the full problem. The proposed solution uses convolutional neural networks (U-Net) of a certain accuracy to help with the correct placement of small antennas on autonomous vehicles. The standard approach requires the simulation of a full model at each test position, requiring high computational time and memory. With this new proposal, it is possible to analyze more positions and radiation patterns in a much shorter time, and with less memory, when compared with the solution from the full model. Along with this methodology for each simulation, a Bayesian optimizer is proposed to improve the search process for the best location, leading to a reduction in the required steps. This methodology was applied to support the correct positioning of a GNSS antenna with reference to a set of performance indicators required for autonomous vehicles, but it can be also applied to larger and more complex structures, allowing one to reduce the simulation time of a large electromagnetic structure and the search time for the optimum location.

AB Discretionary lane change is an essential part of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) on freeway segments. Most existing studies were conducted to optimise the individual decision of discretionary lane change of CAVs. However, the effects of motion states and discretionary lane change decisions from the surrounding vehicles via vehicle to vehicle communication were ignored. To address such a problem, a game theory-based lane change strategy is proposed to collaborate and optimise decisions of discretionary lane change between the CAVs. The payoff functions are formulated for three types of decision games and the payoff of each decision is quantitatively calculated considering the state information of surrounding vehicles. The Nash equilibrium is applied to find the optimal decision set for players. A simulation platform of a CAV environment built is used to conduct the simulation experiments. Various metrics are employed to evaluate the proposed strategy, such as total travel delay, surrogate safety measurement and wave number. The results show that the proposed lane change strategy using a game-theoretical approach can effectively improve traffic operation, safety and oscillations compared to the baseline strategy. The proposed lane change strategy can further benefit the implementations of the CAVs.

AB This paper presents an optimization algorithm for freeway operations at merge zones that maximizes the average speed of the segment in the presence of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-operated (i.e., conventional) vehicles. This research assumes that CAVs have the capability to communicate with each other and with the infrastructure and to execute the recommended trajectories. The proposed system receives arrival information as input and generates optimal trajectories for CAVs while predicting the behavior of conventional vehicles and accounting for deviation from expected behavior. The necessary algorithms are developed to simulate and carry out the merging operations on a two-lane freeway (one mainline and one ramp lane) and tested under a variety of scenarios considering demand level, demand splits, and CAV penetration rate. Results suggest that the proposed algorithm can efficiently manage the traffic at freeway merge zones and reduce the average total travel time (or increase average speed). The results indicate that a minimum of 25% CAV penetration rate is required to observe improvements in operational conditions.

AB In recent years, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become a reality within society, by providing benefits and solutions to the conduction. With the aim of contributing with the development of the ITS, the present work describes a hybrid cooperative framework for the validation of maneuvers between multiple vehicles (virtual and real), in order to reduce cost, time and risks associated with the controllers adjustment. For its validation three case of studies are presented. The first one consists of using two virtual vehicles to perform an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) with trajectory tracker. The second one, in using a real car as the follower and a virtual vehicle as the lider to perform a Stop & Go. And finally, two real cars are used to carry out an ACC. The tracker algorithms employed for the cooperative maneuvers are based in fuzzy logic controllers. The results show the versatility of the proposed framework, which was able to correctly execute the maneuvers in each of the test environments.

SO VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Vehicle dynamics; vehicle control; collision avoidance; active safety;
   stability control
AB This paper considers the problem of collision avoidance for road vehicles, operating at the limits of friction. A two-level modelling and control methodology is proposed, with the upper level using a friction-limited particle model for motion planning, and the lower level using a nonlinear 3DOF model for optimal control allocation. Motion planning adopts a two-phase approach: the first phase is to avoid the obstacle, the second is to recover lane keeping with minimal additional lateral deviation. This methodology differs from the more standard approach of path-planning/path-following, as there is no explicit path reference used; the control reference is a target acceleration vector which simultaneously induces changes in direction and speed. The lower level control distributes vehicle targets to the brake and steer actuators via a new and efficient method, the Modified Hamiltonian Algorithm (MHA). MHA balances CG acceleration targets with yaw moment tracking to preserve lateral stability. A nonlinear 7DOF two-track vehicle model confirms the overall validity of this novel methodology for collision avoidance.

AB An identification method based on support vector machines (SVM) is proposed for modeling nonlinear dynamics of underwater vehicles (UVs), and a typical torpedo-shaped autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is employed for the purpose of validation. To obtain the hydrodynamic derivatives of the vehicle and the dynamical models of the thruster and fins, a series of hydrodynamic experiments are conducted by using vertical planar motion mechanism (PMM) and circulating water channel (CWC). Maneuvering simulation is carried out by using the hydrodynamic model obtained from experiments, and SVM is applied to identify the damping terms together with Coriolis and centripetal terms by analyzing the simulation data. By using the identified nonlinear model and experiment-based hydrodynamic model respectively, maneuvering simulations and control applications are implemented. The results are compared to verify the proposed method, and the effectiveness and good generalization performance of SVM in modeling the nonlinear dynamics of UVs are demonstrated.

Thus, this study proposes a simulation testing system based on hardware-in-the-loop simulation technology. This system can enable data exchange between hardware systems as well as replicate and evaluate the algorithmic operations of the equipment under laboratory conditions. The system can integrate scenario simulation software with MATLAB to evaluate algorithm performance. The vehicle formation control system is tailored for collaborative vehicle formation management scenarios and tested in the simulation test system. The findings display the functional integrity of the vehicle formation control system, the reliability of lane changing and the stability and safety of cruising. It additionally demonstrates that the simulation testing system has the ability to recreate cooperative vehicle arrangement management situations and assess their functionality and performance. In forthcoming research, comprehensive functional and performance assessments will be executed on various typical scenarios for advanced autonomous driving applications in order to authenticate the simulation test system's applicability.

ID QUADRATIC PROGRAMS; BARRIER
AB State constraints and uncertain vehicle dynamics severely affect control stability and performance of connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV). To this end, this study puts forward a safe and sub-optimal longitudinal control protocol for CAV platoon with uncertain vehicle dynamics and state constraints. For platoon leader, a second order disturbance observer with L-2 stability is presented to estimate lumped uncertainty coupled in vehicle dynamics. By iteratively utilizing control barrier functions and control Lyapunov function, state constraints and speed trajectory tracking stability condition are encoded into control constraints. Based on disturbance observer and encoded constraints, an extended quadratic programming is established as trajectory control law for platoon leader. For platoon followers, backstepping method and disturbance observer accounting for forward communication network are synthesized as formation control law. Besides, conditions of individual vehicle stability and string stability for formation control law are analyzed. Simulation results show that the leader of platoon can automatically switch its drive mode between speed cruising and safe headway keeping, respectively. Furthermore, each follower in platoon can follow its predecessors coordinatively and precisely. (c) 2022 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID ADAPTIVE IDENTIFICATION
AB A semi-autonomous unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV), named LAURS, is being developed at the Laboratory of Sensors and Actuators at the University of Sao Paulo. The vehicle has been designed to provide inspection and intervention capabilities in specific missions of deep water oil fields. In this work, a method of modeling and identification of yaw motion dynamic system model of an open-frame underwater vehicle is presented. Using an on-board low cost magnetic compass sensor the method is based on the utilization of an uncoupled 1-DOF (degree of freedom) dynamic system equation and the application of the integral method which is the classical least squares algorithm applied to the integral form of the dynamic system equations. Experimental trials with the actual vehicle have been performed in a test tank and diving pool. During these experiments, thrusters responsible for yaw motion are driven by sinusoidal voltage signal profiles. An assessment of the feasibility of the method reveals that estimated dynamic system models are more reliable when considering slow and small sinusoidal voltage signal profiles, i.e. with larger periods and with relatively small amplitude and offset.

AB This article describes how swarm intelligence can be applied to an array of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for strategic deployment. In emergency or disaster-stricken areas, telecommunications and geospatial surveillance are strictly critical for situational control. Base stations may fail to work due to natural disasters. To be rapidly deployed, lightweight drones with multirotors that provide stability are used as mobile stations. An autonomous learning approach, "self-organizing maps (SOMs)," which can automatically and adaptively coordinate a large array of autonomous drones-self-organizing UAV array-based on requests from end users (EUs) is embedded inside the array. The size and the topology of a UAV array can be dynamically changed in response to various terrains and relocation of EUs. Moreover, with swarm intelligence, the UAV array is capable of reconfiguring its planar topology into a hierarchical one. Such a hierarchical topology divides the entire UAV array into subarrays and creates isolated heterogeneous networks. Thus, the UAV array can cope with diverse situations across geographical barriers by forming a flying ad hoc network.

ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE; VEHICLES
AB In this paper, integration of steering and braking are studied for collision avoidance from the standpoint of optimal control theory. First, the collision avoidance by braking, steering, and steering with braking maneuvers are theoretically investigated. By some assumptions, such as, the point mass vehicle model and constant resultant vehicle force in all directions, the selection of the best maneuver for collision avoidance is represented by the regions on a 2-D diagram. The nondimensionalized axes of this diagram stand for all required vehicle state and geometrical conditions, more specifically, the remaining distance, longitudinal vehicle velocity, lane width, and friction coefficient. Second, a two-point boundary value problem derived for the integrated control is reduced to a single equation with an unknown via algebraic simplifications, and the bisection method turns out to be the most appropriate among the algorithms that have been tested. It turned out that the efficient and precise solution of the optimal control problem is guaranteed, including the cases in which the intervention has been initiated. Consequently, this paper realizes the efficient identification of the theoretically reliable reference maneuver of single lane change with the minimum collision avoidance distance in the framework of feedback control.

AB Emerging autonomous vehicles (AV) can either supplement the public transportation (PT) system or compete with it. This study examines the competitive perspective where both AV and PT operators are profit-oriented with dynamic adjustable supply strategies under five regulatory structures regarding whether the AV operator is allowed to change the fleet size and whether the PT operator is allowed to adjust headway. Four out of the five scenarios are constrained competition while the other one focuses on unconstrained competition to find the Nash Equilibrium. We evaluate the competition process as well as the system performance from the standpoints of four stakeholders-the AV operator, the PT operator, passengers, and the transport authority. We also examine the impact of PT subsidies on the competition results including both demand-based and supply-based subsidies. A heuristic algorithm is proposed to update supply strategies for AV and PT based on the operators' historical actions and profits. An agent-based simulation model is implemented in the first-mile scenario in Tampines, Singapore. We find that the competition can result in higher profits and higher system efficiency for both operators compared to the status quo. After the supply updates, the PT services are spatially concentrated to shorter routes feeding directly to the subway station and temporally concentrated to peak hours. On average, the competition reduces the travel time of passengers but increases their travel costs. Nonetheless, the generalized travel cost is reduced when incorporating the value of time. With respect to the system efficiency, the bus supply adjustment increases the average vehicle load and reduces the total vehicle kilometers traveled measured by the passenger car equivalent (PCE), while the AV supply adjustment does the opposite. The results suggest that PT should be allowed to optimize its supply strategies under specific operation goals and constraints, and AV operations should be regulated to reduce their system impacts, including potentially limiting the number of licenses, operation time, and service areas, which makes AV operate in a manner more complementary to the PT system. Providing subsidies to PT results in higher PT supply, profit, and market share, lower AV supply, profit, and market share, and increased passenger's generalized cost and total system PCE.

TI Roadside Sensing Information Enabled Horizontal Curve Crash Avoidance
   System Based on Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Technology
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID SPEED
AB Horizontal curves are a major cause of road departure crashes that lead to fatal and severe injuries. Existing curve crash avoidance systems are typically enabled by displaying safety messages via in-vehicle heads-up/down display. However, these systems just pass the information to drivers. The final decision to reduce or maintain speed in response to the safety message is still the human driver's. Because of the involvement of the human factor, there is potential for road departure crashes to happen if human drivers do not respond to safety messages appropriately. Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology targets elimination of human error in driving through an automated driving system. In this context, this paper proposes a conceptual prototype of a connected and AV-based horizontal curve crash avoidance system (CAV-HCCAS), aiming at achieving a permanent solution to horizontal curve safety by excluding human error through automated driving. In CAV-HCCAS, a roadside sensor detects pavement wetness level at the horizontal curve and communicates it to the vehicle via dedicated short-range communication. By processing the pavement wetness information, the AV applies a safe curve travel speed that reflects the real-time pavement conditions. An automated driving simulation experiment was performed to prove the concept. Dry and wet pavement conditions were simulated for a horizontal curve. Lane deviation data and the resulting lane departure conflicts were measured as safety performance measures. Results indicate a significant reduction of lane departure conflicts when CAV-HCCAS is implemented under both dry and wet pavement conditions, which reflects a substantial safety benefit.

AB RGB-D cameras provide both color images and per-pixel depth estimates. The richness of this data and the recent development of low-cost sensors have combined to present an attractive opportunity for mobile robotics research. In this paper, we describe a system for visual odometry and mapping using an RGB-D camera, and its application to autonomous flight. By leveraging results from recent state-of-the-art algorithms and hardware, our system enables 3D flight in cluttered environments using only onboard sensor data. All computation and sensing required for local position control are performed onboard the vehicle, reducing the dependence on an unreliable wireless link to a ground station. However, even with accurate 3D sensing and position estimation, some parts of the environment have more perceptual structure than others, leading to state estimates that vary in accuracy across the environment. If the vehicle plans a path without regard to how well it can localize itself along that path, it runs the risk of becoming lost or worse. We show how the belief roadmap algorithm (prentice an Roy 2009), a belief space extension of the probabilistic roadmap algorithm, can be used to plan vehicle trajectories that incorporate the sensing model of the RGB-D camera. We evaluate the effectiveness of our system for controlling a quadrotor micro air vehicle, demonstrate its use for constructing detailed 3D maps of an indoor environment, and discuss its limitations.

The U-net model has been selected as the prediction kernel to generate future visual representations of the scene using an image-to-image regression approach. A method has been implemented to extract vehicle positions from the generated graphical representations to achieve subpixel resolution. The method has been trained and evaluated using the PREVENTION dataset, an on-board sensor dataset. Different network configurations and scene representations have been evaluated. This study found that U-net with 6 depth levels using a linear terminal layer and a Gaussian representation of the vehicles is the best performing configuration. The use of lane markings was found to produce no improvement in prediction performance. The average prediction error is 0.47 and 0.38 meters and the final prediction error is 0.76 and 0.53 meters for longitudinal and lateral coordinates, respectively, for a predicted trajectory length of 2.0 seconds. The prediction error is up to 50% lower compared to the baseline method.

AB As the research and development activities of automated vehicles have been active in recent years, developing test scenarios and methods has become necessary to evaluate and ensure their safety. Based on the current context, this study developed an automated vehicle test scenario derivation methodology using traffic accident data and a natural language processing technique. The natural language processing technique-based test scenario mining methodology generated 16 functional test scenarios for urban arterials and 38 scenarios for intersections in urban areas. The proposed methodology was validated by determining the number of traffic accident records that can be explained by the resulting test scenarios. That is, the resulting test scenarios are valid and represent a matching rate between the test scenarios and the increased number of traffic accident records. The resulting functional scenarios generated by the proposed methodology account for 43.69% and 27.63% of the actual traffic accidents for urban arterial and intersection scenarios, respectively.

AB With recent advances in mobile robotics, autonomous systems, and artificial intelligence, there is a growing expectation that robots are able to solve complex problems. Many of these problems require multiple robots working cooperatively in a multi-robot system. Complex tasks may also include the interconnection of task-level specifications with robot motion-level constraints. Many recent works in the literature use multiple mobile robots to solve these complex tasks by integrating task and motion planning. We survey recent contributions to the field of combined task and motion planning for multiple mobile robots by categorizing works based on their underlying problem representations, and we identify possible directions for future research. We propose a taxonomy for task and motion planning based on system capabilities, applicable to multi-robot and single-robot systems.

AB To gather hydrological measurements is a difficult task for Autonomous Surface Vessels. It is necessary for precise navigation considering underwater obstacles, shallow and fast water flows, and also mitigate misreadings due to disturbs caused by their propulsion system. To deal with those problems, this paper presents a new topology of an Autonomous Surface Vessel (ASV) based on a catamaran boat with an aerial propulsion system with azimuth control. This set generates an over-actuated 3 Degree of Freedom (DoF) ASV, highly maneuverable and able of operating over the above-mentioned situations. To deal with the high computational cost of the over-actuated control allocation (CA) problem, this paper also proposes a Fast CA (FCA) approach. The FCA breaks the initial nonlinear system into partially-dependent linear subsystems. This approach generates smaller connected systems with overlapping solution spaces, generating fast and robust convergence, especially attractive for embedded control devices. Both proposals, i.e., ASV and FCA, are assessed through mathematical simulations and real scenarios.

AB This article presents research on the subject of autonomous underwater robot manipulation. Ongoing research in underwater robotics intends to increase the autonomy of intervention operations that require physical interaction in order to achieve social benefits in fields such as archaeology or biology that cannot afford the expenses of costly underwater operations using remote operated vehicles. Autonomous grasping is still a very challenging skill, especially in underwater environments, with highly unstructured scenarios, limited availability of sensors and adverse conditions that affect the robot perception and control systems. To tackle these issues, we propose the use of vision and segmentation techniques that aim to improve the specification of grasping operations on underwater primitive shaped objects. Several sources of stereo information are used to gather 3D information in order to obtain a model of the object. Using a RANSAC segmentation algorithm, the model parameters are estimated and a set of feasible grasps are computed. This approach is validated in both simulated and real underwater scenarios.

AB In the case of autonomous orchard navigation, researchers have developed algorithms that utilize features, such as trunks, canopies, and sky in orchards, but there are still various difficulties in recognizing free space for autonomous navigation in a changing agricultural environment. In this study, we applied the Naive Bayesian classification to detect the boundary between the trunk and the ground and propose an algorithm to determine the center line of free space. The naive Bayesian classification requires a small number of samples for training and a simple training process. In addition, it was able to effectively classify tree trunk's points and noise points of the orchard, which are problematic in vision-based processing, and noise caused by small branches, soil, weeds, and tree shadows on the ground. The performance of the proposed algorithm was investigated using 229 sample images obtained from an image acquisition system with a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) Image Sensor (CIS) camera. The center line detected by the unaided-eye manual decision and the results extracted by the proposed algorithm were compared and analyzed for several parameters. In all compared parameters, extracted center line was more stable than the manual center line results.

AB For autonomous landing objective of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), environmental interaction can be improved with pose estimation and motion planning. In this paper, using an onboard camera, an autonomous dynamic landing system is designed with respect to a UAV platform, which contains a comprehensive framework and is integrated on an onboard computer. Specifically, pose estimation for the monocular camera is conducted based on visual-inertial localisation algorithms, and target detection algorithms are utilised for landing target recognition. A pose transformation algorithm is designed and target information is conversed, and landing trajectories are generated and even regenerated with respect to moving targets by motion planning with provided state information. An outer-loop geometric tracking controller for the UAV is integrated to complete landing tasks by calculating the required thrust and attitude. To construct a capable and extendible experimental platform, a comprehensive flight system is designed above the robot operating system (ROS) including the landing objective, and the feasibility of the proposed method is verified by experiments for both static and dynamic landing targets.

One of the objectives of this work is to develop a low-cost platform to conduct research in robotics, such as on perception, path finding, remote control, vehicle motion control, and so on. To realize this integrated mobile robot system, the project consists of a host computer, a mobile robot, and a remote link between the two subsystems. The mobile robot, equipped with a perception system and navigation system, can travel in a new environment by means of an autonomous navigation agent or a tele-operating supervisory system. In addition, it can travel under the control of the human supervisory system. For autonomous navigation, the robot mainly uses a sonar ranging system, infrared ranging system, and electronic compass to receive data from its environment. Then, the robot is guided by the autonomous agent (Auto-agent) based on the information from these two subsystems as it travels around the environment.

AB With the development of communication technology and artificial intelligence technology, intelligent vehicle has become a very important part of Internet of Things technology. At present, the single-vehicle intelligence is gradually improved, and more and more unmanned vehicles appear on the road. In the future, these individual intelligence applications need to be transformed into collective intelligence to give full play to the greater advantages of unmanned driving. For example, individual intelligence is self-interest. If there is no collective cooperation, it may affect the whole traffic flow for its own speed. Although the vehicle ad hoc network technology provides a guarantee for the communication between vehicles and makes cooperation between vehicles possible, there are still challenges in how to adapt to coordination learning. Coordination reinforcement learning is one of the most promising methods to solve the multiagent coordination optimization problems. However, existing coordinative learning approaches that usually rely on static topologies cannot be easily adopted to solve the vehicle coordination problems in the dynamic environment. We propose a dynamic coordination reinforcement learning to help vehicles make their driving decisions. First, we apply driving safety field theory to construct the dynamic coordination graph (DCG), representing the dynamic coordination behaviors among vehicles. Second, we design reinforcement learning techniques on our DCG model to implement the joint optimal action reasoning for the multivehicle system and eventually derive the optimal driving policy for each vehicle. Finally, compared with other multiagent learning methods, our method has a significant improvement in security and speed, which is about 1% higher than other multiagent learning methods, but its training speed is also significantly improved about 8%.

AB Self-driving vehicles, combining automobiles with autopilot systems, enable intelligent and safe driving. Self driving vehicles can achieve accurate automatic navigation, trajectory tracking, and automatic overtaking by using GPS, radars, and inertial measurement unit (IMU). Among them, overtaking is essential in order to avoid excessive waiting time and improve the traffic efficiency. When following a large truck or bus, the self-driving vehicle cannot ensure the safe overtaking because the line-of-sight (LOS) range detected by the radar and camera is blocked, thus unable to perceive the surrounding environment accurately. A commonly adopted mitigation is to follow the truck or bus at a reduced speed, at the cost of reduced traffic efficiency and more traffic jams. To mitigate this deficiency, this paper develops an auxiliary sensing system using edge computing to locate nearby vehicles for self-driving vehicles, called ECASS. Specially, infrastructure deployed along the road like servers are utilized to accurately locate vehicles according to GPS and wireless information such as WiFi or DSRC. Subsequently, the server will transmit the localization information of nearby vehicles to the self-driving vehicle, based on which it can determine the driving state for the next moment despite of the obstruction. Extensive simulations verify that ECASS based trajectory is much closer to the real trajectory than GPS. Especially when GPS error is set within 10 m, ECASS can reduce the mean absolute localization error from more than 7 m to about 3 m.

AB This letter reports an investigation into the problem of rapid identification of a channel that crosses a body of water using one or more unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). A new algorithm called Proposal Based Adaptive Channel Search (PBACS) is presented as a potential solution that improves upon current methods. The empirical performance of PBACS is compared to that of lawnmower surveying and Markov decision process (MDP) planning with two state-of-the-art reward functions: Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Maximum Value Information (MVI). The performance of each method is evaluated through a comparison of the time it takes to identify a continuous channel through an area using one, two, three, or four USVs. The performance of each method is compared across ten simulated bathymetry scenarios and one field area, each with different channel layouts. The results from simulations and field trials indicate that on average multi-vehicle PBACS outperforms lawnmower, UCB, and MVI-based methods, especially when at least three vehicles are used.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) bring new risks and safety benefits to future road transport. This paper explores the impacts and consequences of CAVs on the organizational, governance and knowledge practices of vehicle accident investigation (VAI). A focus on these practices of VAI draws attention to its politics, a key aspect behind accident investigations that receives little attention. We do so through three lines of inquiry. First, we read the accident investigation and safety science literature to list the characteristics of a state-of-the-art ideal-typical VAI organization. Second, we draw from the literature to identify seven challenging characteristics from CAVs to existing VAI designs and practices: automation, mixed traffic, connectivity (including cyber security), data, regulatory gaps, safety culture and international connections. Lastly, we describe the current state of affairs of VAI in the United Kingdom, Japan and the United States, highlighting differences and commonalities. In the conclusion, we bring these lines of inquiry together, conclude that there is a need for further governance work on VAI and CAVs, and list several avenues of future study.

AB In a typical mobile-sensing scenario, multiple autonomous vehicles cooperatively navigate to maximize the spatial-temporal coverage of the environment. However, as each vehicle can only make decentralized navigation decisions based on limited local observations, it is still a critical challenge to coordinate the vehicles for cooperation in an open, dynamic environment. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that incorporates consensual communication in multi-agent reinforcement learning for cooperative mobile sensing. At each step, the vehicles first learn to communicate with each other, and then, based on the received messages from others, navigate. Through communication, the decentralized vehicles can share information to break through the dilemma of local observation. Moreover, we utilize mutual information as a regularizer to promote consensus among the vehicles. The mutual information can enforce positive correlation between the navigation policy and the communication message, and therefore implicitly coordinate the decentralized policies. The convergence of this regularized algorithm can be proved theoretically under certain mild assumptions. In the experiments, we show that our algorithm is scalable and can converge very fast during training phase. It also outperforms other baselines significantly in the execution phase. The results validate that consensual communication plays very important role in coordinating the behaviors of decentralized vehicles.

AB This paper studies the dynamic stability of a positively buoyant Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) in vertical plane for a level flight. Dynamic stability of underwater vehicles is estimated by using the linearized equations of motion about an equilibrium position. AUV is a slow moving and positively buoyant vehicle that enhances the stabilizing effect of the restoring forces. Hence a more general approach is required for the evaluation of stability. A 3 dof model for trajectory simulation for level depth trajectories is used to study the effect of positive buoyancy on vehicle trajectory at different speeds. The relative importance of the damping, restoring and control forces acting on the vehicle is established. The stability analysis is undertaken using linearized equations of motion considering the nonlinearities due to positive buoyancy. Numerical studies are carried out to estimate the fixed points of the system and eigenvalues at different forward speeds, metacentric heights and positive buoyancy for a level depth. The study shows that the stability changes from oscillatory to a steady node at a transition speed that depends on the metacentric height. The positive buoyancy has marginal effect on the transition speed but influences the stemplane angles and pitch of the vehicle.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles will influence the future of the surface transportation system by enhancing safety, improving mobility, reducing energy consumption, and controlling emissions. The real-time information provided by connected vehicles technology allows drivers to become more aware of the surrounding traffic conditions and to maneuver safely and more efficiently. Furthermore, when coupled with onboard sensing technologies, the connected vehicles technology can improve the efficiency and the reliability of a driverless transportation network. This paper presents a comprehensive simulation framework to model driver behavior in a connected driving environment with connected vehicles. The framework, which consists of a microscopic traffic simulator integrated with a discrete-event communications network simulator, Network Simulator 3, forms a basis for exploration of the properties of the resulting traffic systems and assessment of the system-level impacts of these technologies. Furthermore, the connectivity of a vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications network was investigated with the FHWA Next Generation Simulation: US-101 Highway data set (to represent vehicular movements in a highway environment). It was found that signal interference can result in information loss and partial connectivity. Finally, through the implementation of a speed harmonization algorithm, the paper discusses the importance of consideration of telecommunications along with vehicular movements to investigate the effects of connected vehicle applications on mobility and emissions.

AB Emerging autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to bring about a revolution in both the automotive industry and transportation systems. Introducing AVs into the existing mobility system with human-driven vehicles (HVs) yields mixed traffic with the following new features: in-vehicle compensation on value of time for AV users, distinct road capacities for pure AV and HV flows, and stochastic road capacity for the inseparable AV-HV traffic pattern. In this paper, we aim to investigate equilibrium traffic dynamics for the morning commuting problem where AVs and HVs coexist in a transportation corridor by considering these new features, and also explore several novel mixed AV-HV traffic management strategies. The AV-HV traffic pattern could be either separable (i.e., pure AV flow and pure HV flow depart from home in different periods) or inseparable, depending on the user profile condition. In addition to deriving departure time equilibriums for scenarios with separable traffic flows, significant effort is put into the scenario with an inseparable AV-HV traffic pattern, where stochastic road capacity is taken into account. Based on these equilibrium traffic analyses, we propose and explore some new traffic management strategies, including AV certificate of entitlement management scheme for scenarios with separable traffic flows and departure-period management (DPM) scheme and lane management policies for the scenario with an inseparable AV-HV traffic pattern. Eligibilities for applying these strategies are analytically derived and extensively discussed, and numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate our theoretical findings and reveal the underlying impacts of road capacity randomness. Some lessons learned from the numerical experiments are (i) overlooking the impact of road capacity uncertainty will lead to an overestimation of system performance and even yield biased policymaking, (ii) the full dedicated-lane policy is the preferred option for the medium-level AV situation and partial dedicated-lane policies are more attractive choices for the early AV era or a market with a high AV share, and (iii) the DPM scheme could be a better substitute for partially dedicated-lane policies.

AB Empirical studies show that autonomous vehicles can contribute to sustainability goals when rides are shared. However, sharing rides with strangers in shared autonomous mobility-on-demand systems (SAMODSs) might impede the adoption of these systems. The present study addresses the research question whether a comprehensive information provision about fellow passengers could increase acceptability of the shared rides in SAMODSs. A discrete choice experiment (N = 154) assessed the potential of different levels of information on fellow passengers: (1) no information, (2) name, (3) picture, (4) rating, (5) combination of name, picture and rating. The results show that the overall compensation demands for sharing a ride was a reduction of approximately 25% of the nonshared reference price. The provision of detailed information about fellow travelers proved beneficial for reducing the compensation demands of travelers while the provision of a name only resulted in higher compensation demands. A significant effect of the fellow passengers' gender indicated that male gender information was related to a higher refusal rate than female gender information. This was particularly relevant when only names were presented. The study provides first empirical insights into the psychological factors concerning the emerging trend of shared mobility.

AB Accurately discovering hazards and issuing appropriate warnings to drivers in advance or performing autonomous control is the core of the Collision Avoidance (CA) system used to solve traffic safety problems. More comprehensive environmental awareness, diversified communication technologies, and autonomous control can make the CA system more accurate and effective, thereby improving driving safety. In addition, the assistance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology can make the CA system adapt to the environment and facilitate fast and accurate decisions. Considering the current lack of a thorough survey of driving safety with sensing, vehicular communications, and AI-based collision avoidance, in this paper, we survey existing researches for state-of-the-art data-driven CA techniques. Firstly, we discuss the major steps of CA and key research issues. For each step, we review the existing enabling techniques and research methods for CA in detail, including sensing and vehicular communication for safe driving, as well as CA algorithm design. Particularly, we present a comparison between the most common AI algorithms for different functions in the CA system. Testbeds and projects for CA are summarized next. Finally, several open challenges and future research directions are also outlined.

AB With the development of artificial intelligence and autonomous driving technology, the vehicle-road cooperative control system combined with artificial intelligence technology can provide more effective and adaptive traffic control solutions for intelligent transportation systems. Existing research works are confronted with two kinds of challenges. For one thing, traditional recurrent neural networks-based methods cannot model the long-time dependent information in traffic flow sequences. For another, the large sample correlation makes it difficult to optimize the trained strategies. In this paper, we propose a Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL)-based intelligent vehicle cooperative control method to deal remedy current gaps. To this end, a closed-loop control system of self-driving vehicles and signal controllers is used as the research object to achieve dynamic scheduling of traffic flow by MADRL. After designing relevant experimental validation, the feasibility of the method is verified in terms of both scheme comparison and operational effect analysis, which is a good aid to traffic signal timing. The simulation results show that the proposal can be well utilized to realize collaborative control of smart vehicles, and there is some performance improvement compared with several typical methods.

AB Autonomous Modular Buses (AMBs) with in-motion transfer capability can be more effective in preventing bus bunching than strategies available with conventional buses, such as bus-holding and/or stop-skipping. We previously proposed bus-splitting, a novel alternative to stop-skipping that directs a modular bus to decouple into individual units when it experiences a longer than normal headway. Despite outperforming stop-skipping, bus-splitting alone cannot eliminate bunching completely since it cannot increase short headways. Therefore, we now propose an integrated strategy that combines bus-splitting with bus-holding so that headways that are both shorter or longer than required can be corrected. We conduct a macroscopic simulation based on a bus route in Hangzhou, China, to compare our combined strategy with standalone bus-splitting as well as stop-skipping combined with bus-holding. Our strategy outperforms the others in terms of reducing both the average travel cost and its variation, limiting the overhead of bus bunching to below 10% under realistic system utilization levels. A bus service adopting the proposed strategy would therefore be more cost-effective, reliable, and attractive for commuters, potentially increasing its ridership and reducing the mode share of private vehicles.

AB In this study, the authors propose an effective real-time approach for intersection detection and recognition during autonomous driving in an unknown urban environment. The authors approach use point cloud data acquired by a three-dimensional laser scanner mounted on the vehicle. Intersection detection and recognition are formulated as a classification problem whereby roads are classified as segments or intersections and intersections are subclassified as T-shaped or +-shaped. They first construct a novel model called a virtual cylindrical scanner for efficient feature-level representation of the point cloud data. Then they use support vector machine classifiers to resolve the classification problem according to the features extracted. A series of experiments on real-world data sets and in a simulation environment demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the authors approach, even in highly dynamic urban environment. They also performed simulation experiments to investigate effects of several critical factors on their proposed approach, such as other vehicles on the road and the advance detection distance.

AB In this paper, the fuel economy benefit of a vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) algorithm called Pass-at-Green (PaG) was analysed and compared with different speed profile characteristics. The fuel-optimal speed profile calculated offline using Dynamic Programming (DP) was used for benchmarking. Manual Driving Speed Profile was included in the analysis as the human driver. Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), whose parameters were modified to model cautious, normal and aggressive behaviour, was also used for comparison. The state-of-the-art connected and autonomous driving Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) setup enabled the use of Electronic Horizon (eHorizon), which provided localisation and detailed map information to the simulated test vehicle. An eHorizon Informed Manual Driving speed profile, where the eHorizon HIL system provided upcoming STOP sign location information, was also modelled. The results showed that having V2I capability in the longitudinal speed control of a vehicle has potential for substantial fuel consumption reduction while navigating through signalised and non-signalised intersections.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles systems can provide a safe and convenient transportation solution through wireless communication between vehicles and roadside communication infrastructure. The vehicle's ability to establish its location plays an important role in such systems. This article presents an efficient localisation framework by combining physics-based wireless propagation models and fingerprint localisation algorithms. To that end, a parabolic wave equation (PWE)-based wireless channel simulator is utilised to obtain the direction of arrival (DOA) values that construct the fingerprint dataset. A detailed procedure on how to obtain the DOA information using PWE, as well as analysis and guidelines on the selection of the key parameters of the localisation framework are provided. Numerical results are compared with theoretical data in terms of accuracy, and the selection of parameters during the localisation process is investigated in actual road tunnel cases. Besides, various numbers of wireless access points and schemes of fingerprinting algorithms have been studied, showing the capability of the proposed approach to be employed for the pre-design of wireless communication systems.

AB Unlike lane-based traffic where each driver has a distinct leader, the subject driver in disorderly traffic may interact with multiple vehicles in-front. The existence of lateral interactions among the vehicles in-front adds even more complexity to modeling the human-driving process. Utilizing trajectory data extracted from an instrumented vehicle study, this research attempts to propose a gated recurrent unit neural network model to predict responses of vehicles interacting with two leading vehicles simultaneously. The recurrent neural network model can illustrate realistic human-like following behavior of drivers, much better than the classical optimal velocity-based models in terms of trajectory reproducing accuracy. The model can also explain the closing-in, shying-away behavior and local stability properties. Results of the study provide insights into the driving behavioral phenomena of disorderly traffic flows and can contribute to the development of a realistic microsimulation model, smarter autonomous systems, and in-traffic safety evaluation as well.

AB Because of increasing traffic in urban areas, public transport has to become more attractive and efficient by introducing computer-aided dynamic passenger information and on-line vehicle location. The tram location pilot system described makes vehicle scheduling and control systems independent of expensive location infrastructure (e.g. beacons). It uses on-board autonomous DGPS positioning with dead reckoning and a radio link to the control centre. The evaluation of the measured vehicle positions clearly demonstrates that operational accuracy requirements for public transport applications are met. The whole Tramway Location System (TLS) is structured into the 3 segments: on-board equipment, components of the operation centre and roadside equipment. The trial set-up for dynamic real-time measurements of the positioning accuracy is described, and the results of the evaluation of more than 7300 position fixes at 15 geodetically measured reference points along the tramway are presented. The conclusions indicate that, during runs in city environments, DGPS combined with dead reckoning achieves vehicle positioning precise enough to enable a reliable, improved and up-to-date passenger information service at the stops.

AB Landing an unmanned aerial vehicle unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on top of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) in harsh open waters is a challenging problem, owing to forces that can damage the UAV due to a severe roll and/or pitch angle of the USV during touchdown. To tackle this, we propose a novel model predictive control (MPC) approach enabling a UAV to land autonomously on a USV in these harsh conditions. The MPC employs a novel objective function and an online decomposition of the oscillatory motion of the vessel to predict, attempt, and accomplish the landing during near-zero tilt of the landing platform. The nonlinear prediction of the motion of the vessel is performed using visual data from an onboard camera. Therefore, the system does not require any communication with the USV or a control station. The proposed method was analyzed in numerous robotics simulations in harsh and extreme conditions and further validated in various real-world scenarios.

AB The aim of current research work on micro air vehicles is to realize their autonomous control, i.e. building a library for a lookup table that would apply to micro electronics. In doing so, comprehensive flight tests need to be carried out. In this study, a four-wing flapping MAV is built and a multi-discipline approach is used to design the MAV model. Precision manufacturing technology is introduced here. The finished micro air vehicle has a weight of 8 g and is tested for flight by remote control. The micro air vehicle can perform both hovering and forward flight with high maneuverability. Forward flight is investigated first in this paper. Particle image velocimetry system is employed to examine unsteady aerodynamic performance in selected flight conditions. The study reveals that the micro air vehicle model will provide enough lift at a 30 degrees angle of attack and flapping frequency of 12 Hz, which is consistent with real-life forward flight observations.

AB Advances in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology provide an opportunity for geohazards monitoring in harsh environments, thereby reducing man-hours and corresponding risks. Due to the limited duration, UAV can hardly visit all the scattered geohazard sites (GSs) in one trip. Therefore, GSs with higher emergency priorities should be monitored first in earlier trips. In this article, we formulate a multiperiod UAVs path planning problem with dynamic emergency priorities for monitoring GSs, in which the emergency levels of GSs change dynamically according to the latest disaster information. An effective solution strategy for this problem selects GSs that must be monitored and accesses more optional GSs within the limited UAV's duration time, after distinguishing them according to emergency priorities. We therefore propose a heuristic algorithm based on the adaptive large neighborhood search. We finally present a real-world case for demonstration and validation.

ID DESIGN
AB Tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles have attracted increasing attention due to their ability to perform vertical take-off and landing and their high-speed cruising abilities, thereby presenting broad application prospects. Considering portability and applications in tasks characterized by constrained or small scope areas, this article presents a compact tricopter configuration tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle with full modes of flight from the rotor mode to the fixed-wing mode and vice versa. The unique multiple modes make the tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle a multi-input multi-output, non-affine, multi-channel cross coupling, and nonlinear system. Considering these characteristics, a control allocation method is designed to make the controller adaptive to the full modes of flight. To reduce the cost, the accurate dynamic model of the tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle is not obtained, so a full-mode flight strategy is designed in view of this situation. An autonomous flight test was conducted, and the results indicate the satisfactory performance of the control allocation method and flight strategy.

AB The article presents a navigation system that utilizes a semantic map created on a hexagonal grid. The system plans the path by incorporating semantic and metric information while considering the vehicle's dynamic constraints. The article concludes by discussing a low-level control algorithm used in the system. This solution's advantages include using a semantic map on a hexagonal grid, which enables more efficient and accurate navigation. Creating a map of allowable speeds based on the semantic map provides an additional layer of information that can help optimize the vehicle's trajectory. Incorporating both semantic and metric information in the path-planning process leads to a more precise and tailored navigation solution that accounts for the vehicle's capabilities and the environment it is operating in. Finally, the low-level control algorithm ensures that the vehicle follows the planned trajectory while considering real-time sensor data and other factors affecting its movement. Through this article, we aim to provide insights into the cutting-edge advancements in path planning techniques and shed light on the potential of combining hexagonal grids, vehicle dynamics constraints, and semantic awareness. These innovations have the potential to revolutionize autonomous navigation systems, enabling vehicles to navigate complex environments with greater efficiency, safety, and adaptability.

AB Recently, the number of vehicles equipped with the Lane Keeping Assistance System (LKAS) is increasing. Therefore, safety evaluation to validate the LKAS has become more important. However, the actual vehicle test for safety evaluation has disadvantages such as the need for professional manpower, the use of expensive equipment, and environmental constraints. Therefore, we attempted to solve this problem using the dual cameras system with only inexpensive and accessible cameras. The optimal position of the dual cameras, image and focal length correction, and lane detection methods proposed in previous studies were used, and a theoretical equation for calculating the distance from the front wheel of the vehicle to the driving lane was proposed. For the actual vehicle testing, LKAS safety evaluation scenarios proposed in previous studies were used. According to the test results, the maximum error was 0.17 m, which indicated the reliability of the method because all errors in the tested scenarios exhibited similar trends and values. Therefore, through the use of the proposed theoretical equations in conjunction with inexpensive cameras, it is possible to reduce time, cost, and environmental problems in the development, vehicle application, and safety evaluation of LKAS components.

AB A survey on biometry for cognitive automotive systems is presented in this paper, specially those biometric systems used for high tech security access, law enforcement and/or commercial transactions. In general, biometric systems can be expensive due to the amount of sensors and processing resources involved. Efforts have been made to integrate these systems to vehicles mostly for security purposes and user authentication. Until now, most of the systems do not go beyond using facial and fingerprint data to start the engine or access the car; however, new generations demand more personalization plus the vehicle making decisions based on their physiological characteristics. Although this kind of technology is considered a luxury feature in general, actually it could help users and save their lives. Indeed, biometry is the way to make the human-vehicle relationship happen, whether the biometric devices are embedded inside the vehicle, used as an accessory or wearables. By using as input not only the sensors inside the vehicle but also data from outside, the vehicle could adapt and/or learn new information to make the best possible decision. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In addition to decentralized controllers, the information flow among vehicles can significantly affect the dynamics of a platoon. This paper studies the influence of information flow topology on the internal stability and scalability of homogeneous vehicular platoons moving in a rigid formation. A linearized vehicle longitudinal dynamicmodel is derived using the exact feedback linearization technique, which accommodates the inertial delay of powertrain dynamics. Directed graphs are adopted to describe different types of allowable information flow interconnecting vehicles, including both radar-based sensors and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. Under linear feedback controllers, a unified internal stability theorem is proved by using the algebraic graph theory and Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion. The theorem explicitly establishes the stabilizing thresholds of linear controller gains for platoons, under a large class of different information flow topologies. Using matrix eigenvalue analysis, the scalability is investigated for platoons under two typical information flow topologies, i.e., 1) the stability margin of platoon decays to zero as 0(1/N-2) for bidirectional topology; and 2) the stability margin is always bounded and independent of the platoon size for bidirectional-leader topology. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the results.

AB In this paper, we present friendly jamming for secure location verification of vehicles in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). In friendly jamming confidential information is obscured from eavesdroppers through the use of opportunistic jamming on the part of the parties engaged in communication. Secure location verification enables the infrastructure in an ITS to verify the position claims of a vehicle in an adversarial setting. We present a method for effectively using friendly jamming and distance bounding together to verify the location and velocity of vehicles, and detect any deviation of claims by a "prover" vehicle that is trying to prove its position and velocity to the infrastructure. The technique can be used to verify velocity and position claim of a vehicle, while keeping the feasible velocity and position lie by an attacker in a negligible range. Our analysis shows that in realistic traffic, friendly jamming is an improvement over comparable work, reducing position falsification by 86.66% to 92% for a typical attacker. The proposed technique also outperforms existing localization techniques for multiple colluding attackers, providing security against up to three colluding attackers, where colluders coordinate their movement and report information to help a single attacker achieve its goal.

AB A digital road map provides partial knowledge about the operating environment for a road vehicle. If a road vehicle is equipped with a video camera, machine vision approaches can provide knowledge about the actual traffic environment around the vehicle. Experiences with a combination of two such approaches during the commissioning of a van for automatic driving on a private road network are reported, including experiences gathered during subsequent driving experiments on public roads and several improvement cycles for hardware and software. Based on these experiences, a second generation vehicle for automatic driving-a sedan-has been designed and commissioned. It is currently evaluated on public roads.
   This equipment provides an experimental platform for studying driver-vehicle interactions with the option to automatically evaluate actual traffic situations around the vehicle in real-time. Our equipment thus offers an approach to record and disentangle the multitude of factors which influence the-often subconscious-reactions of a driver. It is our working hypothesis that only an automatic, in-depth understanding of the actual traffic situation facilitates the design of a driver support system which is competent and flexible enough to win acceptance by a wide spectrum of users.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of blind spot monitoring systems in preventing police-reported lane-change crashes.Methods: Poisson regression was used to compare crash involvement rates per insured vehicle year in police-reported lane-change crashes in 26U.S. states during 2009-2015 between vehicles with blind spot monitoring and the same vehicle models without the optional system, controlling for other factors that can affect crash risk.Results: Crash involvement rates in lane-change crashes were 14% lower (95% confidence limits -24% to -2%) among vehicles with blind spot monitoring than those without.Discussion: Blind spot monitoring systems are effective in preventing police-reported lane-change crashes when considering crashes of all severities. If every U.S. vehicle in 2015 were equipped with blind spot monitoring that performed like the study systems, it is estimated that about 50,000 crashes could have been prevented.

AB This article proposes a visual inertial navigation algorithm intended to diminish the horizontal position drift experienced by autonomous fixed-wing UAVs (unmanned air vehicles) in the absence of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) signals. In addition to accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers, the proposed navigation filter relies on the accurate incremental displacement outputs generated by a VO (visual odometry) system, denoted here as a virtual vision sensor, or VVS, which relies on images of the Earth surface taken by an onboard camera and is itself assisted by filter inertial estimations. Although not a full replacement for a GNSS receiver since its position observations are relative instead of absolute, the proposed system enables major reductions in the GNSS-denied attitude and position estimation errors. The filter is implemented in the manifold of rigid body rotations or SO(3) in order to minimize the accumulation of errors in the absence of absolute observations. Stochastic high-fidelity simulations of two representative scenarios involving the loss of GNSS signals are employed to evaluate the results. The authors release the C++ implementation of both the visual inertial navigation filter and the high-fidelity simulation as open-source software.

AB The technology of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increasingly become part of many civil and research applications in recent years. UAVs offer high-quality aerial imaging and the ability to perform quick, flexible and in-depth data acquisition over an area of interest. While navigating in remote environments, UAVs need to be capable of autonomously landing on complex terrains for security, safety and delivery reasons. This is extremely challenging as the structure of these terrains is often unknown, and no prior knowledge can be leveraged. In this study, we present a vision-based autonomous landing system for rotor wing UAVs equipped with a stereo camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The landing site detection algorithm introduces and evaluates several factors including terrain's flatness, inclination and steepness. Considering these features we compute map metrics that are used to obtain a landing-score map, based on which we detect candidate landing sites. The 3D reconstruction of the scene is acquired by stereo processing and the pose of the UAV at any given time is estimated by fusing raw data from the inertial sensors with the pose obtained from stereo ORB-SLAM2. Real-world trials demonstrate successful landing in unknown and complex terrains such as suburban and forest areas.

AB Image processing applications in real-time systems have become a popular topic in recent years. Deep learning methods, one of the sub-branches of artificial intelligence, and image processing algorithms used in the field of object detection from images can be used together. In this way, applications are developed in many areas such as autonomous cars, autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles, assist robot technologies, assistant technologies for disabled and elderly individuals. This study aims to detect the tactile paving surfaces with deep learning methods in order to design an assistive technology system that can be used by visually impaired individuals, autonomous vehicles and robots. Contrary to traditional image processing algorithms, deep learning methods and image processing algorithms are used together in this study. The YOLO-V3 model, which is one of the best methods of object detection, is combined with the DenseNet model to create the YOLOV3-Dense model. YOLO-V2, YOLO-V3 and YOLOV3-Dense models were trained on the Marmara Tactile Paving Surface (MDPY) dataset, which was created by the researchers and included 4580 images and their performances were compared with each other on the test dataset. It was observed that YOLOV3-Dense model is better than other models in detecting tactile paving surface with 89% F1-score, 92% mean average Precision(mAP) and 81% IoU values.

AB Autonomous mobile robots have been used in outdoor delivery services. Delivery robots have to cope with dynamic obstacles and various environmental conditions. Although several successful technological solutions are available for indoor applications, there are still plenty of unsolved problems in outdoor environments. In this study, we concentrate on three technological challenges hindering the development of campus delivery robots. The first challenge is robust localization in various dynamic outdoor environments. Localization results obtained using lidars and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) sensors show complementary advantages and disadvantages. The proposed localization strategy efficiently combines information from multiple sensors. The second challenge is safe navigation based on the detection of the traversable region. The presented terrain traversability analysis provides clear, real-time positive and negative obstacle information. The third challenge is the requirement of an effective path planning strategy to reduce the risk of collisions or deadlocks. We collected the appearance history of regional dynamic obstacles in the map. The resultant path was carefully generated to avoid crowded areas. Experimental verifications have been successfully conducted on the Korea University campus. The presented results clearly indicate that the proposed methods are essential to achieve safe and reliable navigation in dynamic, real-world environments.

ID DESIGN; CALIFORNIA
AB The coastal ocean is a dynamic and complex environment due to the confluence of atmospheric, oceanographic, estuarine/riverine, and land-sea interactions. Yet it continues to be undersampled, resulting in poor understanding of dynamic, episodic, and complex phenomena such as harmful algal blooms, anoxic zones, coastal plumes, thin layers, and frontal zones. Often these phenomena have no viable biological or computational models that can provide guidance for sampling. Returning targeted water samples for analysis becomes critical for biologists to assimilate data for model synthesis. In our work, the scientific emphasis on building a species distribution model necessitates spatially distributed sample collection from within hotspots in a large volume of a dynamic field of interest. To do so, we propose an autonomous approach to sample acquisition based on an online calculation of sample utility. A series of reward functions provide a balance between temporal and spatial scales of oceanographic sampling and do so in such a way that science preferences or evolving knowledge about the feature of interest can be incorporated in the decision process. This utility calculation is undertaken onboard a powered autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with specialized water samplers for the upper water column. For validation, we provide experimental results using archival AUV data along with an at-sea demonstration in Monterey Bay, CA.

AB The growing interest in the subject of moral judgment in driver and autonomous vehicle behavior highlights the importance of investigating the suitability of sacrificial dilemmas as experimental tools in the context of traffic psychology. To this aim a set of validated sacrificial trolley problems and a new set of trolley-like driving dilemmas were compared through an online survey experiment, providing normative values for rates of participants' choices; decision times; evaluation of emotional valence and arousal experienced during the decision process; and ratings of the moral acceptability. Results showed that while both sets of dilemmas led to a more frequent selection of utilitarian outcomes, the driving-type dilemmas seemed to enhance faster decisions mainly based on the utilitarian moral code. No further differences were observed between the two sets, confirming the reliability of the moral dilemma tool in the investigation of moral driving behaviors. We suggest that as moral judgments and behaviors become more lifelike, the individual's moral inclination emerge more automatically and effectively. This new driving-type dilemma set may help researchers who work in traffic psychology and moral decision-making to approach the complex task of developing realistic moral scenarios more easily in the context of autonomous and nonautonomous transportation.

TI Autonomous Landing of a Micro Aerial Vehicle on a Moving Platform Using
   a Composite Landmark
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB In the existing vision-based autonomous landing systems for micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) on moving platforms, the limited range of landmark localization, the unknown measurement bias of the moving platform (such as wheel-slip or inaccurate calibration of encoders), and landing trajectory knotting seriously affect system performance. To overcome the above shortcomings, an autonomous landing system using a composite landmark is proposed in this paper. In the proposed system, a notched ring landmark and two-dimensional landmark are combined as an R2D landmark to provide visual localization over a wide range. In addition, the wheel-slip and imprecise calibration of encoders are modeled as the unknown measurement bias of the encoders and estimated online via an extended Kalman filter. The landing trajectory is planned by a solver as a convex quadratic programming problem in each control cycle. Meanwhile, an iterative algorithm for adding equality constraints is proposed and used to verify whether the planned trajectory is feasible or not. The simulation and actual landing experiment results verify the following: the visual localization with the R2D landmark has the advantages of wide localization range and high localization accuracy, the pose estimation result of the moving platform with unknown encoder measurement bias is continuous and accurate, and the proposed landing trajectory planning algorithm provides a continuous trajectory for reliable landing.

AB Sea turtles inhabiting coastal environments routinely encounter anthropogenic hazards, including fisheries, vessel traffic, pollution, dredging, and drilling. To support mitigation of potential threats, it is important to understand fine-scale sea turtle behaviors in a variety of habitats. Recent advancements in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) now make it possible to directly observe and study the subsurface behaviors and habitats of marine megafauna, including sea turtles. Here, we describe a "smart" AUV capability developed to study free-swimming marine animals, and demonstrate the utility of this technology in a pilot study investigating the behaviors and habitat of leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea). We used a Remote Environmental Monitoring UnitS (REMUS-100) AUV, designated "TurtleCam," that was modified to locate, follow and film tagged turtles for up to 8 h while simultaneously collecting environmental data. The TurtleCam system consists of a 100-m depth rated vehicle outfitted with a circular Ultra-Short Baseline receiver array for omni-directional tracking of a tagged animal via a custom transponder tag that we attached to the turtle with two suction cups. The AUV collects video with six high-definition cameras (five mounted in the vehicle nose and one mounted aft) and we added a camera to the animal-borne transponder tag to record behavior from the turtle's perspective. Since behavior is likely a response to habitat factors, we collected concurrent in situ oceanographic data (bathymetry, temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-a, turbidity, currents) along the turtle's track. We tested the TurtleCam system during 2016 and 2017 in a densely populated coastal region off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA, where foraging leatherbacks overlap with fixed fishing gear and concentrated commercial and recreational vessel traffic. Here we present example data from one leatherback turtle to demonstrate the utility of TurtleCam. The concurrent video, localization, depth and environmental data allowed us to characterize leatherback diving behavior, foraging ecology, and habitat use, and to assess how turtle behavior mediates risk to impacts from anthropogenic activities. Our study demonstrates that an AUV can successfully track and image leatherback turtles feeding in a coastal environment, resulting in novel observations of three-dimensional subsurface behaviors and habitat use, with implications for sea turtle management and conservation.

AB Most autonomous vehicles build their perception systems on expensive sensors, such as LIDAR, RADAR, and high-precision Global Positioning System (GPS). However, cameras can provide richer sensing at a considerably lower cost, this makes them a more appealing alternative. A driving assistance system (DAS) based on monocular vision has gradually become a research hotspot, and inter-vehicle distance estimation based on monocular vision is an important technology in DAS. There are still constrains in the existing methods for estimating the inter-vehicle distance based on monocular vision, such as low accuracy when distance is larger, unstable accuracy for different types vehicles, and significantly poor performance on distance estimation for severely occluded vehicles. To improve the accuracy and robustness of ranging results, this study proposes a monocular vision end-to-end inter-vehicle distance estimation method based on 3D detection. The actual area of the rare view of the vehicle and the corresponding projection area in the image are obtained by 3D detection method. An area-distance geometric model is then established on the basis of the camera projection principle to recover distance. Our method shows its potential in complex traffic scenarios by testing the test set data provided on the real-world computer vision benchmark, KITTI. The experimental results have superior performance than the existing published methods. Moreover, the accuracy of occluded vehicle ranging results can reach approximately 98%, while the accuracy deviation between vehicles with different visual angles is less than 2%.

TI 6DoF-3D: Efficient and accurate 3D object detection using six

SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DE 3D object detection; Autonomous driving; Degrees-of-freedom;

AB With the advancement of automobile industry, autonomous driving has become an integral component of contemporary vehicles. In this context, the 3D spatial perception of vehicles plays a crucial role. The complexity of 3D object detection dramatically increased due to the explosion of degrees-of-freedom for 3D bounding boxes. Therefore, current 3D detection algorithms struggle to achieve high accuracy and efficiency simultaneously. To address this problem, we introduce a single-stage, LiDAR-based, and efficiency-accuracy balanced 3D object detector named 6DoF-3D. The proposed network architecture comprises a backbone of CSPDarknet53, a multi-scale feature fusion neck, and a detection head. We transform 3D point clouds into pseudo-images, with critical spatial features retained. 6DoF-3D presents a novel encoding strategy to prune the redundant degree-of-freedom in 3D detection, resulting in a lightweight network architecture. We put forward a 2.5D Euler-Region-Proposal network for precise classification and regression of 2.5D bounding boxes. The pruned dimension is compensated with a geometric transformation decoder. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that 6DoF-3D achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 89.62% for 3D car detection at the moderate level. Additionally, the mean average precision reaches 66.72% at the while maintaining a real-time performance of 33.21 FPS for cars, pedestrians, and cyclists.

AB The traditional methods of overhead power transmission line inspections are mostly unsuited as the height of transmission towers is too high and wide. Detection and inspection of insulators in aerial images with cluttered backgrounds is a challenging task for autonomous inspections. This manuscript mainly focuses on the development of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV/Quadcopter) that can hover over the transmission towers and capture images and videos by following pre-determined waypoints. To accomplish this, authors propose a new autonomous vision-based inspection that uses a Quadcopter as primary source of data, aerial images as the main source of information, and Deep Learning (DL) as the backbone analysis for inspection and focused on (i) insufficient training data, (ii) detection of insulators and their defects. A medium sized dataset of insulators for training and detection is created to overcome data insufficiency. The experimental results shows that the proposed deep learning architecture successfully identifies the anomalies of insulator such as, cracks, missing top caps and broken disk etc. The detection accuracy of the proposed deep learning algorithm can reach up to 93.5% with a detection speed of 58.2 frames/sec. The proposed DL algorithm has a promising potential towards smart inspection of insulators in power grids.

AB Autonomous vehicles were experiencing rapid development in the past few years. However, achieving full autonomy is not a trivial task, due to the nature of the complex and dynamic driving environment. Therefore, autonomous vehicles are equipped with a suite of different sensors to ensure robust, accurate environmental perception. In particular, the camera-LiDAR fusion is becoming an emerging research theme. However, so far there has been no critical review that focuses on deep-learning-based camera-LiDAR fusion methods. To bridge this gap and motivate future research, this article devotes to review recent deep-learning-based data fusion approaches that leverage both image and point cloud. This review gives a brief overview of deep learning on image and point cloud data processing. Followed by in-depth reviews of camera-LiDAR fusion methods in depth completion, object detection, semantic segmentation, tracking and online cross-sensor calibration, which are organized based on their respective fusion levels. Furthermore, we compare these methods on publicly available datasets. Finally, we identified gaps and over-looked challenges between current academic researches and real-world applications. Based on these observations, we provide our insights and point out promising research directions.

AB The use of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is becoming more and more likely as they offer promising solutions to improve urban mobility. They have the potential to reduce energy consumption and traffic jams. As a result, they could replace a significant part of other modes of transport and provide more dynamic services to users. This paper examines the level of receptiveness of AVs while considering their adoption time, user attitudes, and their intention to share AV-trips. We explore the results of a stated-preferences survey, conducted among 600 people in Palaiseau, a city south of Paris. Collected data is analyzed using a reduced dimensional space that is dedicated to the field of multifactorial analysis (MFA) in order to apply a hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and to segment the surveyed population. Five classes were identified on the basis of (i) socio-demographic criteria of the respondents; (ii) their mobility habits; and (iii) how they use AV cars. The classes were entitled: Conservatives (22% of the sample), Sceptics (14%), Late adopters (21%), Early Adopters (25%) and Explorers (18%). The results of an economic analysis indicate the implications for operators and public policies designed to encourage optimal forms of adoption in terms of fare and level of service.

AB The potential impacts of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) on society are receiving increased attention owing to the rapid growth of these technologies during the fourth industrial revolution. Thus, a detailed analysis of the positive implications and drawbacks of AI technology in human society is necessary. The development of AI technology has created new markets and employment opportunities in vital industries, including transportation, health, education, and the environment. According to experts, the rapidly increasing improvements in AI will continue. As part of humankind's continual efforts to create more prosperous technological growth, automation and AI are changing people's lives and are widely considered to be game-changers in a variety of industries. This study presents a review of how automation and AI may affect businesses and jobs. To determine some of the prospective long-term consequences of AI on human civilisation, this study investigates a variety of connected primary impacting potentials, including job losses, employees' well-being, dehumanisation of jobs, fear of AI, and examples of autonomous technology developments, such as autonomous-vehicle challenges. A diverse methodology of narrative review and thematic pattern was used to add to transdisciplinary or multidisciplinary work, particularly in the theoretical development of AI technologies.

AB Driver monitoring systems play an important role in lower to mid-level autonomous vehicles. Our work focuses on the detection of cognitive load as a component of driver-state estimation to improve traffic safety. By inducing single and dual-task workloads of increasing intensity on 51 subjects, while continuously measuring signals from multiple modalities, based on physiological measurements such as ECG, EDA, EMG, PPG, respiration rate, skin temperature and eye tracker data, as well as behavioral measurements such as action units extracted from facial videos, performance metrics like reaction time and subjective feedback using questionnaires, we create ADABase (Autonomous Driving Cognitive Load Assessment Database) As a reference method to induce cognitive load onto subjects, we use the well-established n-back test, in addition to our novel simulator-based k-drive test, motivated by real-world semi-autonomously vehicles. We extract expert features of all measurements and find significant changes in multiple modalities. Ultimately we train and evaluate machine learning algorithms using single and multimodal inputs to distinguish cognitive load levels. We carefully evaluate model behavior and study feature importance. In summary, we introduce a novel cognitive load test, create a cognitive load database, validate changes using statistical tests, introduce novel classification and regression tasks for machine learning and train and evaluate machine learning models.

AB This paper proposes a simulation-based optimization framework for an autonomous electric taxi (AET) to achieve economic optimization by determining the optimal operations in the operating time horizon. The operating time horizon of the AET is equally divided into a set of consecutive time slots. For each time slot, there are four possible operations: driving, cruising, parking, and charging. To reduce the computational complexity, instead of solving the scheduling problem for the whole operating time horizon as a single problem, the whole problem is decomposed into a set of subproblems that are built for a one-day period. From an integrated electric vehicle simulation model, which simulates the AET operation based on the optimal schedule determined by the optimization problem, precise battery status parameters, such as the state of charge, capacity loss and battery temperature, are derived and used as the initial values for the optimization problem with rolling horizon implementation. A case study on NYC is presented, and the results show that the proposed framework can extend the battery life by 3%, and also increase the daily profit by 3% and 520%, compared to the 24hr rule-based strategy and 8hr rule-based strategy, respectively.

AB Monocular vision-based 3D scene understanding has been an integral part of many machine vision applications. Always, the objective is to measure the depth using a single RGB camera, which is at par with the depth cameras. In this regard, monocular vision-guided autonomous navigation of robots is rapidly gaining popularity among the research community. We propose an effective monocular vision-assisted method to measure the depth of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) from an impending frontal obstacle. This is followed by collision-free navigation in unknown GPS-denied environments. Our approach deals upon the fundamental principle of perspective vision that the size of an object relative to its field of view(FoV) increases as the center of projection moves closer towards the object. Our contribution involves modeling the depth followed by its realization through scale-invariant SURF features. Noisy depth measurements arising due to external wind, or the turbulence in the UAV, are rectified by employing a constant velocity-based Kalman filter model. Necessary control commands are then designed based on the rectified depth value to avoid the obstacle before collision. Rigorous experiments with SURF scale-invariant features reveal an overall accuracy of 88.6% with varying obstacles, in both indoor and outdoor environments.

AB The working environment of construction machinery is harsh, and some operations are highly repetitive. The realization of intelligent construction machinery helps to improve economic efficiency and promote industrial development. Construction machinery is different from ordinary passenger vehicles. Aiming at the fact that the existing environmental perception data set cannot be directly applied to construction machinery, this paper establishes the corresponding data set in combination with the specific working conditions of construction machinery and carries out training based on the PointPillars network to realize the environmental perception function applicable to the working conditions of construction machinery. Most construction machinery runs on unstructured roads, and the existing passenger vehicle path planning algorithm is not applicable to construction machinery. Based on this, this paper uses a hybrid A* algorithm to achieve path planning that meets the kinematics of construction machinery and realizes real-time obstacle detection and avoidance. At the same time, this paper combines environmental perception with a path planning algorithm to provide a method of autonomous path finding and obstacle avoidance for construction machinery. Based on the improved pure pursuit algorithm, the high-precision motion control and established trajectory tracking of construction machinery are realized, which lays a certain foundation for the follow-up research and development of related intelligent technologies of construction machinery.

AB In this paper, an easy to apply and computationally efficient energy management system (EMS) for microgrids of building prosumers is proposed. It is based on a hierarchical multi-agent system (MAS), aiming to minimize the operation cost of a microgrid comprising a group of buildings, renewable energy sources (RES), energy storage systems (ESS) and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). The optimization problem is suitably set up to ensure low computation requirements and it is solved with particle swarm optimization (PSO). Optimal operation scheduling for grid-connected and autonomous operation of microgrids of building prosumers, considering their thermal and electrical systems, integrated RES, conventional and dynamic ESS is proposed. The models used are not computationally demanding, allowing the application to complex systems and they are not being limited to one building scale which is the case for the majority of relative research. Another innovative feature of the proposed algorithm, among others, is that it ensures autonomous operation at certain time periods without the use of any emergency generator sets. Detailed simulation results of different operation scenarios, showed that cost savings in range of 11% can be achieved while a large number of operation and technical constraints are satisfactorily met in grid-connected and autonomous operation.

AB Current self-driving cars can perform precise localization and generate collision-free trajectories using high definition (HD) maps which provide accurate road information. Therefore, keeping HD maps up to date is important for safe autonomous driving. In general, automotive HD maps are built by the use of expensive mapping systems. In addition, a lot of manual modifications are required in many cases. The conventional HD mapping cannot be frequently carried out due to the high cost. In this letter, we used a large amount of road data collected by crowdsourcing devices. Crowdsourcing devices consist of low-cost sensors. The devices are mounted on repeatedly traveling vehicles such as buses. Although collected data shows high uncertainty and low accuracy, a large amount of data can be obtained in a short time with low expense. We present a solution that keeps HD maps up to date by using crowdsourced data. The developed solution concentrates on landmark information among crowdsourced data and HD maps. By using uncertainty information, we chose reliable observations for map updating. Observation learner algorithms were carefully designed under the consideration of differences between discrete and continuous landmarks. The triggering condition for the map update can be adjusted by the proposed update mode selection strategy. The proposed map updating scheme has been experimentally verified by the use of crowdsourced data collected from real road environments.

AB In this paper we address the problem of localizing active hydrothermal vents on the seafloor using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The plumes emitted by hydrothermal vents are the result of thermal and chemical inputs from submarine hot spring systems into the overlying ocean. The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Autonomous Benthic Explorer (ABE) AUV has successfully localized previously undiscovered hydrothermal vent fields in several recent vent prospecting expeditions. These expeditions utilized the AUV for a three-stage, nested survey strategy approach (German et al. in Deep Sea Res. I 55:203-219, 2008). Each stage consists of a survey flown at successively deeper depths through easier to detect but spatially more constrained vent fluids. Ideally this sequence of surveys culminates in photographic evidence of the vent fields themselves. In this work we introduce a new adaptive strategy for an AUV's movement during the first, highest-altitude survey: the AUV initially moves along pre-designed tracklines but certain conditions can trigger an adaptive movement that is likely to acquire additional high value data for vent localization. The trigger threshold is changed during the mission, adapting the method to the different survey profiles the robot may find. The proposed algorithm is vetted on data from previous ABE missions and measures of efficiency presented.

AB This paper presents a path and speed planner for automated public transport vehicles in unstructured environments. Since efficiency and comfort are two of the key issues in promoting this kind of transportation system, they are dealt with explicitly in the proposed planning algorithm. To that end, a global path planner has been designed with bounded continuous curvature and bounded curvature derivative to ensure smooth driving. This will allow the public transport system to know a priori which is the shortest path within a selected area that guarantees lateral accelerations and steering wheel speeds below given pre-set thresholds. A closed-form speed profiler uses semantic information provided by the path planner to set a continuous velocity reference that takes into account not only bounds on lateral and longitudinal accelerations consistent with comfort, but also a bound on longitudinal jerk. The suitability of the above two features was compared to manual driving in a real instrumented public transport vehicle on a test track. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although autonomous shipping has attracted increasing interest, its further development requires innovative solutions to operate autonomous ships without the direct intervention of human operators. This study aims to develop a health-aware energy management (HAEM) approach for ship hybrid power plants, integrating the health monitoring information from reliability tools with the energy management tools. This approach employs the equivalent consumption minimisation strategy (ECMS) along with a Dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), as well as the utopia decision-making method and a model for the ship hybrid power plant. The HAEM approach is demonstrated for a parallel hybrid power plant of a pilot boat considering realistic operating profiles. The results demonstrate that by employing HAEM approach for the investigated ship power plant operating for 300 h re-duces its failure rate almost fourfold at the cost of fuel consumption increase of around 1.5%, compared to the respective operation with the ECMS. This study is expected to contribute towards the development of supervisory control of autonomous power plants.

ID STABILITY
AB Many innovative applications of vehicle control involve trajectory following while avoiding collisions, respecting actuator and dynamic limits, and using complex nonlinear dynamics. Additionally, these vehicle controllers must operate in the presence of difficult-to-model and uncertain dynamic forces which are often a function of the environment. To solve these problems, we present a design and experimental validation of neural network model predictive control (NNMPC), a method that uses vehicle operation data to construct a neural network model which is efficiently implemented in MPC. By learning a neural network model with a history of states and controls, NNMPC is capable of predicting vehicle dynamics in changing and complex operating conditions. We challenge NNMPC with the difficult task of automated racing near the friction limits without prior knowledge of the road-tire friction coefficient. The experimental results on an automated test vehicle demonstrate the capability of NNMPC to follow a trajectory near the limits on both high- and low-friction test courses. Furthermore, NNMPC outperforms a physics-based benchmark MPC on both the courses where the environmental latent state of road-tire friction is explicitly considered.

AB The recent advancement in autonomous robotics is directed toward designing a reliable system that can detect and track multiple objects in the surrounding environment for navigation and guidance purposes. This paper aims to survey the recent development in this area and present the latest trends that tackle the challenges of multiple object tracking, such as heavy occlusion, dynamic background, and illumination changes. Our research includes Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) methods incorporating the multiple inputs that can be perceived from sensors such as cameras and Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR). In addition, a summary of the tracking techniques, such as data association and occlusion handling, is detailed to define the general framework that the literature employs. We also provide an overview of the metrics and the most common benchmark datasets, including Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute (KITTI), MOTChallenges, and University at Albany DEtection and TRACking (UA-DETRAC), that are used to train and evaluate the performance of MOT. At the end of this paper, we discuss the results gathered from the articles that introduced the methods. Based on our analysis, deep learning has introduced significant value to the MOT techniques in recent research, resulting in high accuracy while maintaining real-time processing.

AB Braking and steering are common maneuvers performed by drivers during driving. This paper presents a hierarchy control strategy to coordinate the braking and steering performance for in-wheel motor drive electric vehicles (IWMD EVs). A particle swarm optimization-based nonlinear predictive control (PSO-NMPC) scheme is proposed to calculate the required longitudinal force, lateral force and yaw moment of the vehicle in the upper controller. In the lower controller, the PSO algorithm is again utilized to realize the required forces and yaw moment through optimal torque allocation and brake actuator regulation while maintaining vehicle stability and maximizing the regenerative braking recovery. A fault-tolerance mechanism is also incorporated to enhance the robustness of the proposed method. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is examined under various braking execution scenarios through the Carmaker-Simulink co-simulation. The results show that the proposed scheme outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in all-round aspects. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Shared mobility on demand (MoD) services are receiving increased attention as many high-volume ride-hailing companies are offering shared services (e.g. UberPool, LyftLine) at an increasing rate. Also, the advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) promises further operational opportunities to benefit from these developments as AVs enable a centrally operated and fully connected fleet. There are two fundamental tasks for a shared MoD service: ride-matching and vehicle-rebalancing. Traditionally, these two tasks are optimized sequentially and independently. The paper formulates an integrated ride-matching and vehicle-rebalancing problem for shared MoD services which simultaneously optimizes these two tasks. We propose a graph-based methodology to solve the integrated ride-matching and vehicle-rebalancing problem with a novel rebalancing cost term quantifying supply contributions of vehicle scheduling to zonal supply deficit balances (deviations from the desired supply level) in the network. The integrated model performance is validated using a large-scale empirical shared MoD dataset by comparing with state-of-the-art sequential models. Generally, the integrated model improves the level of service and sustainability performance compared to the sequential model. The detailed analysis shows that the vehicle rebalancing in the integrated model is replaced by a more effective ride-matching and penalizing singly served trips in the integrated model can further improve its sustainability performance.

AB Autonomous vehicles are expected to significantly enhance the human mobility. However, recently researchers have discovered and demonstrated some attacks on vehicles, which have caused a panic among the public. Furthermore, these attacks have demonstrated that the security issue is still one of the major challenges of vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel edge computing based anomaly detection, coined edge computing based vehicle anomaly detection (EVAD), which exploits edge based sensor data fusion to identify the anomaly events. The time domain property, i.e., the correlation between different intra-vehicle sensors, and the frequency domain property of sensor data are utilized to judge whether an anomaly has occurred within the vehicle. Especially, to reduce the computation overhead and improve the performance, multiple sensors will be organized as ring architecture, which is a tradeoff of detection accuracy and complexity. In addition, the major components (e.g., anomaly detection module) of EVAD are embedded in edge computing devices, which make the anomaly detection be more efficient and privacy preserving. Meanwhile, a more appropriate model is generated on the cloud server, of which computation overhead maybe heavy for edge computing devices. This paper evaluates the performance of EVAD under different scenarios, and the experimental results demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency. The average true positive rate achieves 99.5% with 1% false positive rate.

AB In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed for the motion planning and path following automated cars with the incorporation of a collision avoidance strategy. This approach is aligned with an optimal reinforcement learning (RL) coupled with a new risk assessment approach. For this purpose, a probabilistic function-based collision avoidance strategy is developed, and the proposed RL approach learns the probability distributions of the adjacent and leading vehicles. Subsequently, the nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) algorithm approximates the optimal steering input and the required yaw moment to follow the safest and shortest path through the optimal RL-based probabilistic risk function framework. Additionally, it is attempted to maintain the travel speed for the ego vehicle stable such that the ride comfort is also offered for the vehicle occupants. For this purpose, the steering system dynamics are also incorporated to provide a thorough understanding of the vehicle dynamics characteristic. Different driving scenarios are employed in the present paper to evaluate the proposed algorithm's effectiveness.

AB This paper addresses the modeling of an autonomous underwater vehicle using quaternion formulation for angular position description and Lagrange method to compute the equations of motion. As the four parameters are dependent and generate a constraint, Lagrange multipliers are used with Baumgarte method to solve and stabilize the system. The dynamic model includes underwater effects like added mass and inertia, hydrodynamic damping, buoyancy and propeller forces. Moreover, a quaternion-based line of sight guidance algorithm is derived to avoid any use of trigonometric function and compute directly the orientation error of the underwater vehicle and the desired attitude in terms of quaternions. Motion control is achieved with a quaternion-based adaptive sliding mode controller rejecting model uncertainties and water current. The simulation results, where the vehicle follows a sequence of way-points including vertical diving motion demonstrate that the proposed guidance algorithm and motion control are deeply relevant both in terms of effectiveness and robustness for this particular type of vehicle and orientation formulation.

AB In this paper, we consider the problem of a kind of consensus problem among a collection of vehicles performing a shared task with 2-D Fornasini-Marchesini second local state-space (LSS) dynamical model by using intervehicle communication and output feedback themselves in which the weights of the corresponding edges are considered as the control variables. Firstly, it is shown that under certain conditions, the stability of a collection of N identical vehicles can be equivalently transferred into the stability analysis of a single vehicle with the same dynamics, modified by only a scalar, representing the interconnection, that takes values according to the eigenvalues of the weights matrix. Then, two types of networks, star-shaped networks and globally coupled networks, are studied in details. Secondly, the general description are presented for such consensus problem via the block diagram of information flow. Finally, a collection of vehicles with different 2-D LSS dynamical model is investigated.

AB The objective of this work is to optimize control strategy of a vehicle which leads to low fuel consumption. A specialized car developed especially to take part in the Shell Ecomarathon competition is considered. At first a general first principle model of the vehicle is discussed, its parameters are tuned taking into account the data obtained experimentally and the model is validated using real measurements. Next, the optimization problem leading to low fuel consumption is discussed. The engine usage continuous-time control strategy is parametrized by means of 4 methods in order to reduce computational complexity. Since the resulting constrained optimization problem is nonlinear, as many as 5 evolutionary algorithms are examined in terms of quality of the final result and computational efficiency. Inefficiency of a classical gradient-based optimization method is demonstrated. Finally, a complete decision system which can act as an autonomous vehicle engine controller is discussed.

AB The safety of drivers has become increasingly important in today's rapidly evolving transportation landscape, especially with the rise of autonomous and smart vehicles. This paper proposes a safety-oriented framework for sound event detection in smart vehicles using deep learning models. The goal of this framework is to increase driver awareness, prevent accidents, and provide acoustic forensic analysis. To achieve this, a meaningful taxonomy of event classes in a driving scenario is introduced, taking into account the event classes that are known to be related to major driving distractors. Based on this taxonomy, a dataset has been created to train and evaluate a fully-convolutional sound event detection model that was inspired by the well-known YOLO vision model. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed model offers competitive results, outperforming a state-of-the-art baseline using recurrent connections. This comprehensive framework for sound event detection in smart vehicles aligns with the recommended directions for future mobility scenarios and has the potential to significantly improve the safety and performance of smart vehicles.

AB The lateral position control of the vehicle is analyzed in the presence of time delay. To compensate the negative effects of dead time, the predictor control approach called finite spectrum assignment is applied. This controller includes a linear model of the plant and uses the solution of this model over the delay interval to predict the current system states. The focus of the article is whether to include tire dynamics in the predictive model of the controller. Although the more detailed model should improve control performance, the additional parameters (e.g., tire stiffnesses and yaw moment of inertia) are difficult to determine accurately. The effects of parameter mismatches are analyzed in detail, and recommendations are given to ensure safe control of the vehicle. It is shown that the inclusion of tire dynamics in the predictive model vastly improves control performance even in the presence of large parameter errors, but in certain cases, the inaccuracies may lead to instability.

AB Localization is an important component of autonomous vehicles, as it enables the accomplishment of tasks, such as path planning and navigation. Although vehicle position can be obtained by GNSS devices, they are susceptible to errors and satellite signal unavailability in urban scenarios. Several map- aided localization solution methods have been proposed in the literature, but mostly for indoor environments. Maps used for localization store relevant environmental features that are extracted by a detection method. However, many feature detection methods do not consider the presence of dynamic obstacles or occlusions in the environment, which can impair the localization performance. In order to detect curbs even in occluding scenes, we developed a method based on ring compression analysis and least trimmed squares. For road marking detection, we developed a modified version of the Otsu thresholding method to segment road painting from road surfaces. Finally, the feature detection methods were integrated with a Monte Carlo localization method to estimate the vehicle position. Experimental tests in urban streets have been used to validate the proposed approach with favorable results.

AB This paper proposes a saturated tracking controller for underactuated autonomous marine surface vehicles with limited torque. First, a second-order open-loop error dynamic model is developed in the actuated degrees of freedom to simplify the design procedure. Then, a saturated tracking controller is designed by utilizing generalized saturation functions to reduce the risk of actuator saturation. This, in turn, improves the transient performance of the control system. A multi-layer neural network and adaptive robust control techniques are also employed to preserve the controller robustness against unmodeled dynamics and environmental disturbances induced by waves and ocean currents. A Lyapunov stability analysis shows that all signals of the closed-loop system are bounded and tracking errors are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, simulation results are provided for a hovercraft vehicle to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller as a qualified candidate for real implementations in offshore applications.

AB In recent years, the development of autonomous surface vehicles has been afield of increasing research interest. There are two major areas in this field: control theory and path planning. This study focuses on path planning, and two objectives are discussed: path planning for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) and implementation of path planning in a real map. In this paper, satellite thermal images are converted into binary images which are used as the maps for the Finite Angle A* algorithm (FAA*), an advanced A* algorithm that is used to determine safer and suboptimal paths for US Vs. To plan a collision-free path, the algorithm proposed in this article considers the dimensions of surface vehicles. Furthermore, the turning ability of a surface vehicle is also considered, and a constraint condition is introduced to improve the quality of the path planning algorithm, which makes the traveled path smoother This study also shows a path planning experiment performed on a real satellite thermal image, and the path planning results can be used by an USV.

AB Accurate estimation of slip is essential in developing autonomous navigation strategies for mobile vehicles operating in unstructured terrain. This paper presents an accurate and robust technique for the estimation of slip parameters of a tracked vehicle. The technique uses a sliding mode observer (SMO) with sprocket wheel angular velocities and vehicle trajectory as inputs and estimates slip parameters by minimizing the errors between the predicted trajectory and the measured trajectory. The error dynamics is proven to converge after a finite time from any arbitrary point in error space and remains in the neighbourhood of the sliding motion. Slip estimation schemes using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and direct mathematical inversion of the kinematic equations are also presented for comparison purposes. It is shown that the non-linear SMO is more accurate than the other two methods. The robustness and superior performance of the SMO are demonstrated using both simulation and experimental results. A specially designed test rig is used for accurate control and measurement of track slips during the experimental validation of the proposed observer.

AB Connected and Automated vehicles (CAVs) are transforming road-transport. Within this transformation, motor vehicle insurers are one of the key involved stakeholders. This paper explores car insurers' expectations, chal-lenges and activities around the development of CAVs. It draws on a literature review and 31 semi-structured interviews with insurers and other experts in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The analysis confirms challenging, simultaneous local and international, discussions about 1) the shift in liability from drivers to automated driving systems, 2) a commercial conflict over in-vehicle data access and 3) the future of shared mobility. Interviewees anticipate that the outcome of these discussions will affect their underwriting, risks, claims processes, business models, product offerings and competitive strategies. Simultaneously, insurers respond to these challenges and affect them as they move forward, thereby helping shape the regulatory frameworks of future CAV mobility. They do so in various ways, which differ across countries and insurers, yet generally can be classified into three typical activities: (non) participation in pilot-projects, lobbying and learning. The paper concludes with a number of political and scholarly reflections.

TI Local area navigation using sonar feature extraction and model-based
   predictive control
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper demonstrates a method to navigate an autonomous underwater vehicle in a local area using an acoustic sensor for position information derived from feature detection. A dynamic model of the vehicle response is used for control between location updates. Favorable results have been found using this approach, and precision positioning of the vehicle to centimeters has been accomplished. Another part of the problem is the need to provide a high-frequency update of vehicle position in order to close the positioning servo loops. Using sonar image feature extraction is necessarily time consuming and therefore is performed in a tactical level process providing asynchronous data to the tactical navigator. It follows that some form of fast dead reckoning must be performed in the execution level either by INS-Doppler or by water speed and heading data or by a model-based predictor. This paper deals with the use of model-based predictor technique where knowledge of the dynamic model of the vehicle provides state information to the vehicle positioning control function. The model uncertainty provides errors of course, but these are corrected through asynchronous updates from the feature extracted positions in the tactical level sonar manager. This concept has been verified by both simulation studies and by experimental validation with the Naval Postgradual School Phoenix vehicle.

ID EVOLUTION
AB An analogy between an agent (e.g., an autonomous vehicle) and a biological forager is extended to a social environment by viewing a communication network as implementing interagent sociality. We first describe engineering design within an evolutionary game-theoretic framework. We then explain why sociality may emerge in some environments and for some agent objectives. Next, we derive the evolutionarily stable design strategy for an agent manufacturer: 1) choosing whether the agent it produces should cooperate with other agents in a search problem and 2) choosing the group size of a multiagent system tasked with a cooperative search problem. We show the impact of "agent relatedness" a measure of common descent between two agents based on their underiying manufacturers, on the choices in scenarios 1) and 2). Our predictions are evaluated in an autonomous vehicle simulation testbed. The results illustrate a new methodology for manufacturers to make robust, optimal choices for multiagent system design for a given set of objectives and domain of operation.
   Note to Practitioners-The design of autonomous multirobot systems with various applications, such as in parts production or search and destroy operations in a military environment, is of growing importance. Here, we integrate economic and technical issues into an unified engineering design framework for the manufacturers of robots. Our approach leads to manufacturer design decisions that are robust relative to the market for a manufacturer's products. Robot component aspects, such as sensors and communications as well as mission performance aspects, can be captured and coupled into the design process. We use the design of intervehicle cooperation and robot group size to illustrate this approach. The practical significance lies in the fact that we take a broad perspective on engineering design, one closer to the real world, due to the considerations of marketplace economics. Moreover, the approach provides a framework to study design choices that escape systematic analysis in other frameworks (e.g., group size).

AB Several studies have been conducted on collision avoidance (CA) and path planning for maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS) based on artificial potential field (APF) and electronic navigation chart (ENC) data. However, to date, accurate, highly efficient, and automatic modelling of complicated geometry environment potential fields (EPFs) has not been realised. In this study, an accurate EPF model is established using ENC data to describe different types of obstacles, navigable areas, and non-navigable areas. The implicit equations of complex polygons are constructed based on the R-function theory, and the discrete-convex hull method is introduced to realise the automatic modelling of EPF. Moreover, collaborative CA and obstacle avoidance (OA) experiments are designed and conducted in a simulated environment and based on the ENC data. The results show that the proposed EPF modelling method is accurate, reliable, and time-efficient even with numerous ENC data and complex shapes owing to the R-function representation for geometric objects and discrete-convex hull method. The combination of improved APF and EPF models is proven to be effective for CA and OA. This paper presents a practical EPF modelling approach for APF-based ship path planning.

ID TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM; IMPACT
AB During recent years, several companies have introduced small autonomous delivery robots and evidenced their technical applicability in field studies. However, a holistic planning framework for routing and utilizing these robots is still lacking. Current literature focuses mainly on logistical performance of delivery using autonomous robots, ignoring real world limitations, and does not assess the respective impact on total delivery costs. In contrast, this paper presents an approach to cost-optimal routing of a truck-and-robot system for last-mile deliveries with time windows, showing how to minimize the total costs of a delivery tour for a given number of available robots. Our solution algorithm is based on a combination of a neighborhood search with cost-specific priority rules and search operators for the truck routing, while we provide and evaluate two alternatives to solve the robot scheduling subproblem: an exact and a heuristic approach. We show in numerical experiments that our approach is able to reduce last-mile delivery costs significantly. Within a case study, the truck-and-robot concept reduces last-mile costs by up to 68% compared to truck-only delivery. Finally, we apply sensitivity analyses to provide managerial guidance on when truck-and-robot deliveries can efficiently be used in the delivery industry.

AB Path planning is an important problem in autonomous control technology. This paper aims to overcome the shortcomings of the wolf pack algorithm (WPA), such as slow rate of convergence and low convergence precision, by improving the three intelligent behaviors of the WPA, namely, scouting, summoning, and beleaguering. To improve the scouting behavior, interactive scouting is proposed to increase the interactivity among wolf pack. Furthermore, to improve the summoning behavior, a prey-based adaptive step model is established to improve the searching ability. Finally, calculation rules of new beleaguering behavior are designed, which enhance the local fine search ability considerably. A fast path planning method based on dubins path was proposed, which applied the dubins path planning to meet angle control constraint and tunes the turning radius to meet control constraint. The dubins path planning method based on the modified WPA is proposed by establishing the underwater environment threat model under the condition of autonomous underwater vehicle constraint. The path between the path points is the shortest, the threat is minimal, and the energy consumption is the least without the consideration of ocean current. Simulation results show that the modified WPA has a high rate of convergence and good local search capability in the high-precision, high-dimensional, and multi-peak function; moreover, it does not converge prematurely.

LA English
DT Article
DE Unmanned air vehicles; Vision based guidance; Proportional navigation;
   Road following
AB This paper describes a new approach for autonomous road following for an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) using a visual sensor. A road is defined as any continuous, extended, curvilinear feature, which can include city streets, highways, and dirt roads, as well as forest-fire perimeters, shorelines, and fenced borders. To achieve autonomous road-following, this paper utilizes Proportional Navigation as the basis for the guidance law, where visual information is directly fed back into the controller. The tracking target for the Proportional Navigation algorithm is chosen as the position on the edge of the camera frame at which the road flows into the image. Therefore, each frame in the video stream only needs to be searched on the edge of the frame, thereby significantly reducing the computational requirements of the computer vision algorithms. The tracking error defined in the camera reference frame shows that the Proportional Navigation guidance law results in a steady-state error caused by bends and turns in the road, which are perceived as road motion. The guidance algorithm is therefore adjusted using Augmented Proportional Navigation Guidance to account for the perceived road accelerations and to force the steady-state error to zero. The effectiveness of the solution is demonstrated through high-fidelity simulations, and with flight tests using a small autonomous UAV.

AB The arrival of new technologies and innovations on mobility, such as automated vehicles, creates opportunities to tackle urban challenges. The evaluation of the impacts of these innovations on the mobility system requires a comprehensive set of criteria and parameters. This article proposes a method to measure the impacts of Shared Automated Electric Vehicles (SAEV) on mobility through a sustainability assessment. Based on an integrative literature study and on the context of AVENUE, a European project deploying automated shuttles in the public transport of European cities, a set of indicators is defined. These mobility indicators assess the social, environmental, economic, governance, and technical impacts of SAEV. The multiple dimensions of the mobility indicators contribute to filling gaps of knowledge about the performance of SAEV. The proposed method allows an evaluation and comparison of SAEV to other means of transport and thus strengthens scientifically based recommendations for transportation policies.

AB Carsickness is associated with a mismatch between actual and anticipated sensory signals. Occupants of automated vehicles, especially when using a display, are at higher risk of becoming carsick than drivers of conventional vehicles. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of positioning of in-vehicle displays, and subsequent available peripheral vision, on carsickness of passengers. We hypothesized that increased peripheral vision during display use would reduce carsickness. Seated in the front passenger seat 18 participants were driven a 15-min long slalom on two occasions while performing a continuous visual search-task. The display was positioned either at 1) eye-height in front of the windscreen, allowing peripheral view on the outside world, and 2) the height of the glove compartment, allowing only limited view on the outside world. Motion sickness was reported at 1-min intervals. Using a display at windscreen height resulted in less carsickness compared to a display at glove compartment height.

AB Pedestrians' trust in automated vehicles (AVs) needs to be analyzed and deconstructed to update it from its current broad concept into several lower-level attributes for assessment and measurement. In this study, we have employed virtual reality (VR) and scenario-based interviews to examine the trust of pedestrians toward AVs, based on the attributes of trust and trustworthiness. A hybrid approach of inductive and deductive thematic analysis of the responses of 36 participants was undertaken. Eight such attributes emerged from the analysis, including statistical reliability and dependability, competence, predictability, familiarity, authority/subversion, liberty/ oppression, care/harm, and sanctity/degradation. The first four are objective attributes concerning automation trustworthiness and human trust in automation, while the remaining four are subjective attributes, analogous to properties of human morality. The findings of this study provide an empirical grounding for trust theories. Specifically, we have highlighted the importance of subjective qualities in constituting pedestrian-AV trust, including "automation morality" and "care/harm".

AB On campus, the complexity of the environment and the lack of regulatory constraints make it difficult to model the environment, resulting in less efficient motion planning algorithms. To solve this problem, HD-Map-guided sampling-based motion planning is a feasible research direction. We proposed a motion planning algorithm for autonomous vehicles on campus, called HD-Map-guided rapidly-exploring random tree (HDM-RRT). In our algorithm, A collision risk map (CR-Map) that quantifies the collision risk coefficient on the road is combined with the Gaussian distribution for sampling to improve the efficiency of algorithm. Then, the node optimization strategy of the algorithm is deeply optimized through the prior information of the CR-Map to improve the convergence rate and solve the problem of poor stability in campus environments. Three experiments were designed to verify the efficiency and stability of our approach. The results show that the sampling efficiency of our algorithm is four times higher than that of the Gaussian distribution method. The average convergence rate of the proposed algorithm outperforms the RRT* algorithm and DT-RRT* algorithm. In terms of algorithm efficiency, the average computation time of the proposed algorithm is only 15.98 ms, which is much better than that of the three compared algorithms.

AB Alertness mechanism of unmanned monitoring vehicles to environment is important. Especially, the vigilance modeling of underground security robots has a particularly significance because the underground is a dangerous environment. However, there is no a mature methodology for the alertness computation. In this work, four parts of the alertness estimation are focused. First, an autonomous robot alertness mechanism framework is proposed by using the deep reinforcement learning model of the human alertness mechanism. Second, a fast K-T filtering algorithm is developed to eliminate the multiple noises of the electroencephalograph (EEG) signals by the blind source separation and the adjustable Q factor wavelet transform. Third, the description problem of the directed interaction stability of the cortical EEG signals is solved by the ensemble empirical mode decomposition and the directional transfer function. Fourth, the human alertness estimation is explored by using the support vector regression of the dynamically spatial-temporal brain network connection parameters. Experiments show that, the mean square error and the determination coefficient of the explored alertness estimation are respectively 0.115 and 0.8337. Compared with the scalp EEG alertness estimation, it has a better performance because the mean square error is decreased by 0.0684, and the determination coefficient is increased by 0.023.

AB To reveal impacts of tight-platoon on connected vehicle (CV) merging, a merging advisory model is proposed to account for mainline random length tight-platoon. The tight-platoon is modeled by a consensus based algorithm with constant spacing under looking forward communication topologies, and string stabilities are analyzed to ensure robustness against gap disturbances. To ensure traffic safety, a floating merging point speed advisory model (FMP-SAM) based on finite state machine and virtual vehicle mapping is proposed to address merging conflicts. Besides, a rolling horizon control is employed in FMP-SAM to smooth speed trajectory of merging leader during gap adaption. Simulations results indicate that encouraging CV to drive in tight-platoon can improve safety, enhance mobility, conserve fuel consumption, reduce congestion and improve road capacity at higher traffic demand. Besides, FMP-SAM can improve FE performance greatly without sacrificing other performance metrics when compared with baseline merging advisory model. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As the automotive industry moves forward, security of vehicular networks becomes increasingly important. Controller area network (CAN bus) remains as one of the most widely-used protocols for in-vehicle communication. In this work, we study an intrusion detection system (IDS) which detects anomalies in vehicular CAN bus traffic by analyzing message identifier sequences. We collected CAN bus data from a heavy-duty truck over a period of several months. First, we identify the properties of CAN bus traffic which enable the described approach, and demonstrate that they hold in different datasets collected from different vehicles. Then, we perform an experimental study of the IDS, using the collected CAN bus data and procedurally generated attacks. We analyze the performance of the IDS, considering various attack types and hyperparameter values. The analysis yields promising sensitivity and specificity values, as well as very fast decision times and acceptable memory footprint.

AB This paper elucidates the impacts of vehicle heterogeneity on traffic dynamics and throughput of mixed traffic consisting of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and regular vehicles (RVs). The main premise is that the heterogeneity in preferred acceleration rate, desired speed, and carfollowing (CF) behavior (e.g., reaction pattern and sensitivity to a traffic disturbance) will change traffic properties in ways that can undermine traffic flow throughput. This paper first decomposes the mechanism into two elements - one driven by acceleration and one by time-varying CF response to disturbances - and then investigates their compounded effect. This paper also provides unifying frameworks to analyze the behavior of RVs and CAVs to facilitate analytical investigations. The results reveal how heterogeneous acceleration and CF behavior may create persistent voids and diminish traffic throughput. Integrating all the elements, throughput reduction is quantified via numerical simulations.

AB Edge intelligence (EI) migrates data and artificial intelligence (AI) to the "edge " of a network, enhancing the high-bandwidth and low-latency of wireless data transmission with the multiplier effect of 5G and AI, greatly improving the edges' processing speed. Through integrating EI and computer vision technology, video surveillance systems in ITS can improve the processing capability of traffic information, which improves traffic efficiency and ensures traffic safety. Accordingly, first, we propose an edge intelligence-based improved-YOLOv4 vehicle detection algorithm, introducing an efficient channel attention (ECA) mechanism and a high-resolution network (HRNet) to enhance vehicle detection ability. Second, an edge intelligence-based improved DeepLabv3+ image segmentation algorithm is proposed, replacing the original backbone network with MobileNetv2 and using the softpool method, thus reducing the network size while improving the segmentation accuracy. Experimental results show that our proposed model has a higher average precision (AP) and can improve vehicle detection accuracy from 82.03% to 86.22%. The mean intersection over union (mIOU) of the image segmentation model improves from 73.32% to 75.63%.

ID PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS; IEEE-802.11; NETWORKS
AB The media access control (MAC) layer of the vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) is designed to provide fast and reliable vehicles to vehicles (V2V) or vehicles to infrastructures (V2I) access. With the development of autonomous driving and intelligent transportation, many sensor information in large-scale vehicles require efficient and reliable transmission with V2V and V2I technologies. In recent years, the demand for various services in VANETs is growing rapidly, which poses great challenges to the design of the MAC protocol. An adaptive scheme for channel frame structure can enhance channel access flexibility to cope with the changing network topologies in vehicular environments. In this paper, we adopt an adaptive frame scheme on the control channel and the service channels, which mainly improves two aspects of channel access performance: improved time slot utilization of the broadcasting period as much as possible while ensuring the vehicle can access the control channel quickly; and increasing the throughput of the service channels without generating excessive overhead. Analysis and simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed mechanism.

ID MODEL
AB GPS-based maneuvering target localization and tracking is a crucial aspect of autonomous driving and is widely used in navigation, transportation, autonomous vehicles, and other fields.The classical tracking approach employs a Kalman filter with precise system parameters to estimate the state. However, it is difficult to model their uncertainty because of the complex motion of maneuvering targets and the unknown sensor characteristics. Furthermore, GPS data often involve unknown color noise, making it challenging to obtain accurate system parameters, which can degrade the performance of the classical methods. To address these issues, we present a state estimation method based on the Kalman filter that does not require predefined parameters but instead uses attention learning. We use a transformer encoder with a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract dynamic characteristics, and estimate the system model parameters online using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, based on the output of the attention learning module. Finally, the Kalman filter computes the dynamic state estimates using the parameters of the learned system, dynamics, and measurement characteristics. Based on GPS simulation data and the Geolife Beijing vehicle GPS trajectory dataset, the experimental results demonstrated that our method outperformed classical and pure model-free network estimation approaches in estimation accuracy, providing an effective solution for practical maneuvering-target tracking applications.

AB The underground intelligent load-haul-dump vehicle (LHD) is a product of the deep integration of traditional LHD with information network technology, automatic controlling and artificial intelligence technology. It gathers the functions of environmental perception, autonomous driving and fault diagnosis in one machine and exhibits higher safety and greater efficiency than traditional LHD. Hence, it is a particularly important piece of underground mining equipment for building green, safe and smart mines. Taking the studies about intelligent LHD collected by CNKI and WOS databases from 1980 to 2022 as a sample data source, employing Citespace visual analysis software for key feature extraction from the documents, statistical analysis was conducted to clarify the current research progress and the frontier topics of the intelligent LHD academia in the past 40 years, in relation to the future development trends. The development history and application status of underground intelligent LHD was expounded in this article, summarizing the research status at home and abroad from four aspects: ore heap perception and modeling technology, trajectory planning method of bucket shoveling, autonomous navigation technology, real-time monitoring and intelligent fault diagnosis technology. The demerits and merits of the technologies were reviewed as well, with future developing and researching trends of the underground intelligent LHD concluded.

AB Ocean velocity defines ocean circulation, yet the available observations of subsurface velocity are under-utilized by society. The first step to address these concerns is to improve visibility of and access to existing measurements, which include acoustic sampling from ships, subsurface float drifts, and measurements from autonomous vehicles. While multiple programs provide data publicly, the present difficulty in finding, understanding, and using these data hinder broader use by managers, the public, and other scientists. Creating links from centralized national archives to project specific websites is an easy but important way to improve data discoverability and access. A further step is to archive data in centralized databases, which increases usage by providing a common framework for disparate measurements. This requires consistent data standards and processing protocols for all types of velocity measurements. Central dissemination will also simplify the creation of derived products tailored to end user goals. Eventually, this common framework will aid managers and scientists in identifying regions that need more sampling and in identifying methods to fulfill those demands. Existing technologies are capable of improving spatial and temporal sampling, such as using ships of opportunity or from autonomous platforms like gliders, profiling floats, or Lagrangian floats. Future technological advances are needed to fill sampling gaps and increase data coverage.

AB We explore the potential to control terrain vehicles using deep reinforcement in scenarios where human operators and traditional control methods are inadequate. This letter presents a controller that perceives, plans, and successfully controls a 16-tonne forestry vehicle with two frame articulation joints, six wheels, and their actively articulated suspensions to traverse rough terrain. The carefully shaped reward signal promotes safe, environmental, and efficient driving, which leads to the emergence of unprecedented driving skills. We test learned skills in a virtual environment, including terrains reconstructed from high-density laser scans of forest sites. The controller displays the ability to handle obstructing obstacles, slopes up to 27 degrees, and a variety of natural terrains, all with limited wheel slip, smooth, and upright traversal with intelligent use of the active suspensions. The results confirm that deep reinforcement learning has the potential to enhance control of vehicles with complex dynamics and high-dimensional observation data compared to human operators or traditional control methods, especially in rough terrain.

AB Autonomous driving systems have emerged with the promise of preventing accidents. The first critical aspect of these systems is perception, where the regular practice is the use of top-view point clouds as the input; however, the existing databases in this area only present scenes with 3D point clouds and their respective labels. This generates an opportunity, and the objective of this work is to present a database with scenes directly in the top-view and their labels in the respective plane, as well as adding a segmentation map for each scene as a label for segmentation work. The method used during the creation of the proposed database is presented; this covers how to transform 3D to 2D top-view image point clouds, how the detection labels in the plane are generated, and how to implement a neural network for the generated segmentation maps of each scene. Using this method, a database was developed with 7481 scenes, each with its corresponding top-view image, label file, and segmentation map, where the road segmentation metrics are as follows: F1, 95.77; AP, 92.54; ACC, 97.53; PRE, 94.34; and REC, 97.25. This article presents the development of a database for segmentation and detection assignments, highlighting its particular use for environmental perception works.

AB In this study, the hydrodynamic characteristics of the Autonomous Underwater Helicopter surging near the seabed are studied by numerical simulation and experiment. The influence from the cruising velocity, altitudes as well as the inclination angle of the seabed are considered. For the condition of flat seabed, the simulation shows that the seafloor mainly affects the flow field at the bottom and rear part of the AUH, which changes the pressure resistance, and consequently affects the total resistance. In addition, bulges at the top and bottom of the AUH are the cause of the abnormal lift force. For the condition of sloping seabed, at the same surging velocity and cruising height, the resistance of AUH is more than twice of the one over flat seabed, and the irregular eddy current intensity at the tail of AUH increases with the increasing slope angle. The hydrodynamic performance from simulation agrees with the findings from the water-channel experiment with the adoption of a scaled model of the vessel. It is further discovered that hydrodynamic characteristics of AUH change more obviously with the angle of attack when it is more close to the seabed. Therefore, the hydrodynamic performance of AUH near the sloping seabed can be improved by adjusting the angle of attack.

   Perimeter security of stationary aircraft on a landing strip; autonomous vehicle navigation with dynamic obstacles.
   Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) has made significant strides in the last decade and is now beginning to increase coverage of the system life cycle and in the process generating many more digital artifacts. The MBSE community today recognizes the need for a flexible framework to efficiently organize, access, and manage MBSE artifacts; create and use digital twins for verification and validation; facilitate comparative evaluation of system models and algorithms; and assess system performance. This paper presents progress to date in developing a MBSE experimentation testbed that addresses these requirements. The current testbed comprises several components, including a scenario builder, a smart dashboard, a repository of system models and scenarios, connectors, optimization and learning algorithms, and simulation engines, all connected to a private cloud. The testbed has been successfully employed in developing an aircraft perimeter security system and an adaptive planning and decision-making system for autonomous vehicles. The testbed supports experimentation with simulated and physical sensors and with digital twins for verifying system behavior. A simulation-driven smart dashboard is used to visualize and conduct comparative evaluation of autonomous and human-in-the-loop control concepts and architectures. Key findings and lessons learned are presented along with a discussion of future directions.

AB Leveraging the mobility of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to collect and deliver data among different underwater devices enables numerous underwater Internet-of-Things (UW-IoT) applications. However, the most versatile underwater acoustic communications (UACs) may not be suitable in the AUV-assisted UW-IoT scenarios, considering the high cost and high power consumption of acoustic transducers, as well as high error rates of UACs due to the complex underwater acoustic channel conditions. Alternatively, we propose to apply the low-power magnetic induction (MI)-based wireless communications for AUV data dissemination and collection. Due to the mobility of AUVs and the underwater turbulence, MI channels between AUVs and other underwater devices are no longer stable and static, which poses great challenges to establish reliable MI links. To tackle this problem, we investigate the dynamic MI wireless communications in this article. We first mathematically characterize the dynamic MI channel when an AUV approaches its target for data collection. Based on this dynamic channel model, the dynamic communication range and available bandwidth of MI are derived. We also build an MI wireless communication system that can work within a dynamic range. The communication performances are evaluated through numerical simulations as well as underwater experiments.

ID TARGET TRACKING
AB In this article, the problem of tracking vehicles using lidar sensors mounted on an ego-vehicle is addressed. Due to line-of-sight limitations, the back (or front) of a vehicle as seen by the lidar on the ego-vehicle behind (or ahead of) it is often modeled as L-shaped. In this article, an L-shape-based vehicle tracking algorithm with joint kinematic and geometric estimation is presented. By feeding back tracking results to L-shape fitting, an L-shape detection method that is robust to outliers is proposed. In the L-shape tracker currently available in the literature, the kinematic and geometric states of the L-shape model are separately estimated and maintained. However, the kinematic and geometric states are not independent since the orientation of a vehicle influences its velocity. Also, the dependence between the kinematic and the geometric states is caused by anchor-point (the closest point on the vehicle being tracked) switching, which is required during changes in the relative position between vehicles. To address this limitation, the proposed L-shape tracker exploits this dependence and estimates the kinematic and geometric states jointly. The proposed L-shape-model-based tracking algorithm is evaluated and compared with the original algorithm using the real traffic data from the KITTI datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the original algorithm in terms of L-shape detection and tracking accuracies.

AB Self-driving vehicles have become increasingly popular in recent years. Because of this, the information fusion sensing method using radar and cameras has been widely adopted in vehicles. We use the vehicle camera sensor and robust image segmentation technology to solve its inherent shortcomings. The images used for image segmentation are obtained under adverse weather conditions, or the image object's color and texture resemble the background. For such images, using the convolutional layer model for image segmentation as a feature extraction method usually leads to error. Any highly robust algorithms for image enhancement for self-driving operation will help alleviate problems related to driving safety. To ensure that the final image segmentation achieves the desired effect and reduces the error rate, we propose a new segmentation-twice method, which correctly classifies the object's label. The test results of the simulation described in this paper show that this experiment correctly classifies the object's label. It can provide accurate environmental perception information for autonomous vehicles, improve the segmentation effect of similar fusion background images, and reduce the error rate.

AB This paper discusses the detailed vehicle design, control system development/implementation, and autonomous hover flight testing of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) prototype utilizing cycloidal rotors (or cyclorotors), which is a horizontal-axis rotary wing concept. The present vehicle configuration has a gross weight of 800 g (2 ft x 2 ft x 1.5 ft in dimension) and uses four cyclorotors in an axi-symmetric plus-shaped configuration where each rotor axis is mutually orthogonal to the adjacent one. The vehicle is designed such that the magnitude and direction of the thrust vector for each of the cyclorotors could be independently varied using rotor rotational speed and thrust vectoring capability, which are inherent to this concept. An attitude control strategy has been developed for the present aircraft (quad-cyclocopter), where pitch and roll control is through differential rotational speed control of the rotors, whereas yaw control is through thrust vectoring. Controlling pitch and roll through rotational speed control couples pitch and roll dynamics for the present configuration and therefore requires adjustment of all four rotor speeds appropriately for either pure pitch or roll motions. The control strategy is implemented using a 3-g autopilot, which autonomously stabilizes the vehicle using a feedback proportional-derivative controller.

AB Automated driving motion planning algorithms require a high degree of real-time performance. In a closed structured road environment, making full use of the road information helps to reduce the computational effort and improve the real-time performance of the algorithm. Therefore, this paper proposes a real-time automated driving motion planning process suitable for closed structured road environments. Based on the environmental information of the structured road, the key factors affecting the motion decision are extracted. The scenarios are classified according to the key factors, and decision rules are established for the vehicle based on the headway. In addition, based on a pure tracking algorithm, a motion planning method based on dynamic target points is proposed, which takes into account both single-cycle trajectory planning and vehicle motion continuity. Finally, a real-vehicle test is conducted under two typical driving scenarios. The results show that the proposed motion planning process has a good real-time performance and adaptability in real traffic scenarios.

AB This paper presents a model-predictive approach for trajectory generation of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) combined with a tire model. An optimal tracking problem while avoiding collision with obstacles is formulated in terms of cost minimization under constraints. Information on obstacles is incorporated online in the nonlinear model-predictive framework as they are sensed within a limited sensing range. The overall problem is solved online with nonlinear programming. For the local path regeneration upon detecting new obstacles, the cost function is augmented using the obstacle information in two methods. The first method uses the distance from the UGV to the nearest detected obstacle, and the second method uses the parallax information from the vehicle about the detected obstacles. Simulation results in cluttered and dynamic environments show that the modified parallax method effectively reflects the threat of the obstacles to the UGV considering the dimension and state variables of the vehicle, showing clear improvements over the distance-based methods.

AB This article proposes a low-computation framework for on-board calculation of energy-optimal cruising speed, and uses the framework to investigate the critical parameters for energy-optimal cruising speed determination. The main features of the proposed framework are as follows: first, inclusion of all internal and external vehicle losses, particularly the accessory loads, which have a large impact on optimal cruising speed and have not been investigated in other works, second, use of accurate motor/inverter loss look-up-tables rather than approximated polynomial models, and, third, no requirement for connected data or knowledge of the future route, as the optimal cruising speed is calculated precisely for the current state of the vehicle and surroundings. To validate the framework, three electric vehicle models are developed in MATLAB/Simulink and tuned to match real-world data for a Chevrolet Bolt, Chevrolet Spark, and Tesla Model S. Furthermore, an algorithm is developed to determine near-optimal speed transitions when the optimal cruising speed changes.

AB Vehicle tracking in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) videos is a fundamental but vital computer vision task. It mainly consists of two key components, that is, detection and reidentification (ReID). Recently, one-shot trackers, which integrate detection and ReID in a unified network, have received significant attention for their fast-tracking speed. However, existing one-shot trackers typically utilize local information to distinguish the detected targets. Due to the lack of global relations, which are key cues for tracking, these methods struggle to identify targets in UAV videos accurately. To alleviate the above issue, we deliberately design an ReID head that combines nonlocal blocks and the transformer layer to capture the global semantic relation in this letter. First, we propose a novel pyramid fusion network (PFN) to obtain the pixel-wise relations of features at multiple levels and aggregate them into features with richer semantic information. Then, we present a channel-wise transformer enhancer (CTE) to model the dependencies among the channels of the feature map and predict fine-grained identity embeddings. Extensive experiments on VisDrone2021 and UAVDT benchmarks demonstrate that our tracker, namely global context embedding for vehicle tracking (GCEVT), achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance.

DE Autonomous driving control; Articulated bus; Bus Rapid Transit (BRT);
   Inner model; Model Predictive Control (MPC)
AB This research suggests an autonomous driving control algorithm for Bus Rapid Transit (BRT, articulated bus). The control algorithm is composed of an integration of MPC (model Predictive Control) and PI control algorithms because vehicles have a lot of delayed systems. Specifically, an MPC algorithm is used as a lateral controller, and a PI control algorithm is used as a longitudinal controller in parallel. To develop the MPC algorithm, path information (path planning) and an inner model is necessary. Thus, the path information is defined as the road center since the BRT is traveling a certain path, and the inner model is defined from the bicycle model of vehicle dynamics. The wheel steering input is controlled based on the predicted lateral movement using the inner model. To develop the PI algorithm, brake pressure and throttle position inputs are controlled based on the longitudinal velocity error. As a result, the integrated control algorithm of MPC and PI is developed in commercial tool Matlab/Simulink with a plant model which is developed in commercial tool TruckSim. In conclusion, the integrated control algorithm is verified in the simulation environment with a standard of ISO-11270 which is to test a Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS).

AB Artificial intelligence methods based on machine learning or artificial neural networks have become indispensable in camera-based driver assistance systems, and also represent an essential building block for future autonomous driving. However, the great successes of these evaluation methods in environment perception and also driving planning are accompanied by equally great challenges in the validation and verification of these systems. One of the essential aspects for this is the required guaranteed safety of the functions under mass production conditions of the vehicles. This article explains this point of view using a detailed example from the field of camera-based driver assistance systems: the determination of inspection limits at the end of the production line. The camera is one of the most important sensor modalities for vehicle environment sensing and as such, the quality of the camera systems plays a key role in the safety argumentation of the overall system. Several illustrative application examples (role of simulations, calibration, influence of the windshield) will be presented. The basic ideas presented can be well transferred to the other sensor modalities (lidar, radar, ToF, etc.). The investigations/evidence show that doubts are allowed whether or how fast autonomous driving on level L4/5 will take hold as robotaxis or - even more challenging - in private ownership on a larger scale.

AB Accurate and real-time object detection is crucial for autonomous vehicles. For in-vehicle computing platforms, a giant model is difficult to achieve in real time and also increases the hardware cost. Moreover, a lightweight model built from a lot of depth-wise separable convolution layers cannot achieve the accuracy required for autonomous driving. We introduce Large Kernel Attention (LKA) technology to decouple the large kernel convolutions. It can combine high accuracy with small computational cost. Furthermore, we use LKA as the basis for designing a new module (Res-VAN) that can be used to build backbone networks. This study focuses on how the Res-VAN module can be deployed to improve the YOLOv5 in order to reduce the computational effort of the model, but maintain its accuracy. We named the model "LKA-YOLO" and validated it on PASCAL VOC dataset, MS COCO 2017 dataset and VirDrone2019 datasets. Experimental results show that LKA-YOLO reduces the computation of YOLOv5 by 57.5% (16 GFLOPs vs. 6.8 GFLOPs). And the feature extraction ability of LKA-YOLO is stronger than YOLOv5 on small datasets. The results on VirDrone2019 dataset show that our proposed method has a great advantage in dealing with tiny objects. Meanwhile, comparing with YOLO family on the COCO 2017 dataset, the metrics of LKA-YOLO are also outstanding.

AB The articles in this special section focus on current applications and innovations of artificial intelligence and machine learning in aerospace. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) play an increasingly important role in aerospace applications and serve various military, commercial aviation, and space exploration sectors to ensure safety, dependability, and customer loyalty. AI/ML contributes to provide various automated systems used in aviation, such as fuel efficiency, smart maintenance, smart air traffic management, pilot training, passenger identification, threat identification, remote sensing, and fully autonomous aerial vehicles among other systems. AI/ML is concerned with algorithms and techniques that allow systems to "learn" and "reason" based on algorithms and techniques employing computational and statistical methods. It can significantly enhance speed, efficiency, workload, and safety to enable the integrating of more complex technologies, such as autonomous visionbased navigation and data ecosystems. Recently advanced data analytics provided the aviation industry a way to respond to COVID and advise airlines on when to swap aircraft for bigger or smaller planes and how the global health restrictions may change flight schedules. While there are many other innovative use cases of AI/ML in aviation and aerospace, the overarching conclusion is that the implementation must be driven by safety.

AB The publish/subscribe system over the autonomous vehicular networks (AVNs) enables the content providers to obtain more profits from a flexible notification system. However, few of current works focus on flexible brokers suitable for AVNs. In this paper, we propose a truck platoon aided secure publish/subscribe system based on smart contract in AVNs. Firstly, the truck platoons are utilized to be the brokers of the publish/subscribe system to realize a more efficient and secure publish/subscribe system. Secondly, a vehicular blockchain is established for the publish/subscribe system to record the transactions between brokers and publishers/subscribers to guarantee the complete and safe implementation of the smart contracts. Next, a contract based on the principal-agent problem is designed between the publisher and broker to maximize their utilities and stimulate the broker to be more active in the contents subscribing service. Furthermore, a smart contract is also designed between the subscriber and broker by the cloud server to achieve higher utilities and match an appropriate broker for the subscriber by considering its type. Finally, we carry out extensive numerical results to evaluate the performances of the proposed contracts, while the results also demonstrate that the proposal outperforms the conventional schemes.

AB Self-driving vehicles are increasingly vital for various environmental tasks, such as data gathering, remote sensing, and mapping. They are particularly important in transportation, where advanced robotic vehicles can operate effectively without human oversight in challenging conditions. One exciting application is using collaborative autonomous robotic vehicles to locate specific points of interest like accidents, congestion, rain, fog, or icy roads. This article explores multi-robot systems for transportation tasks, considering interference that may impact the robot group's performance. A mathematical model is analysed to quantify the influence of interference and transformed into a dimensionless form for analysis. The system is studied numerically, and a neural soft computing technique, LMA-NN, is proposed. The technique is established on a neural network. For performance evaluation of the LMA-NN technique, different performance benchmarks such as mean square error and absolute error with reference solution are employed. The results are also presented graphically.

AB There is a growing body of literature that recognizes the importance of Multi-Robot coordination and Modular Robotics. This work evaluates the secure coordination of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) via a drone simulation in Unity and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) as a rover. Each robot is equipped with sensors to gather information to send to a cloud server where all computations are performed. Each vehicle is registered by blockchain ledger-based network security. In addition to these, relevant information and alerts are displayed on a website for the users. The usage of UAV-UGV cooperation allows for autonomous surveillance due to the high vantage field of view. Furthermore, the usage of cloud computation lowers the cost of microcontrollers by reducing their complexity. Lastly, blockchain technology mitigates the security issues related to adversarial or malicious robotic nodes connecting to the cluster and not agreeing to privacy rules and norms.

AB Simulation test beds serve as a cost-effective and safe way to evaluate the system performance of various real world systems. With the rising concerns in the security of sensitive and critical systems, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), a software simulation test bed is clearly the best choice given that the environment and various system components are modeled correctly. This becomes critical given the recently developed autonomous aerial vehicles. We therefore evaluate several available simulation test beds and use the most promising test bed to analyze the impact of Global Positioning System (GPS)-related attacks on navigation of UAVs. We also introduce a novel technique for GPS spoofing, attack detection, and mitigation. This paper presents GPS spoofing and GPS jamming attacks with their anatomy, design, and impact evaluation on navigation as well as a novel GPS spoofing mitigation and detection technique for UAVs, using UAVSim: an open source simulation test bed.

AB This paper describes a sensorless fault-tolerant control (FTC) for a high-performance induction motor drive that propels an electric-vehicle (EV). The effect of the fault on the induction motor (IM) can be modeled by an exogenous signal from a stable autonomous system. An additive term is added to the nominal offset and serves to control the effect of the defect (FTC aspect). The proposed sensorless FTC for IM is realized in presence of both rotor and stator electrical faults. Consequently, the extended kalman filter (EKF) is proposed to estimate the rotor flux and the rotor speed using the measured stator currents and voltages. Therefore, a classical EV traction system is studied using an induction motor drive. Indeed, the induction motor based powertrain is coupled to DC machine-based load torque emulator taking into account the electric vehicle mechanics and aerodynamics. Simulation and experimental results confirm widely the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed FTC of IM based SMC in the electric vehicle application.

AB Modern-day Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) with more than 100 million code lines, running up-to a hundred Electronic Control Units (ECUs) will create and exchange digital information with other vehicles and intelligent transport networks. Consequently, ubiquitous internal and external communication (controls, commands, and data) within all CAV-related nodes is inevitably the gatekeeper for the smooth operation. Therefore, it is a primary vulnerable area for cyber-attacks that entails stringent and efficient measures in the form of "cybersecurity". There is a lack of systematic and comprehensive review of the literature on cyber-attacks on the CAVs, respective mitigation strategies, anticipated readiness, and research directions for the future.
   This study aims to analyse, synthesise, and interpret critical areas for the roll-out and progression of CAVs in combating cyber-attacks. Specifically, we described in a structured way a holistic view of potentially critical avenues, which lies at the heart of CAV cybersecurity research. We synthesise their scope with a particular focus on ensuring effective CAVs deployment and reducing the probability of cyber-attack failures. We present the CAVs communication framework in an integrated form, i.e., from In-Vehicle (IV) communication to Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2X) communication with a visual flowchart to provide a transparent picture of all the interfaces for potential cyber-attacks. The vulnerability of CAVs by proximity (or physical) access to cyber-attacks is outlined with future recommendations. There is a detailed description of why the orthodox cybersecurity approaches in Cyber-Physical System (CPS) are not adequate to counter cyber-attacks on the CAVs. Further, we synthesised a table with consolidated details of the cyber-attacks on the CAVs, the respective CAV communication system, its impact, and the corresponding mitigation strategies. It is believed that the literature discussed, and the findings reached in this paper are of great value to CAV researchers, technology developers, and decision-makers in shaping and developing a robust CAV-cybersecurity framework.

AB In Alleyne (1996) several vehicle control options were considered for Unintended Roadway Departure (URD) prevention and conclusions were drawn as to the efficacy of each method. This companion paper investigates the use of several different inputs for the control of a vehicle, in the context of Obstacle Avoidance for autonomous vehicles. In this investigation, the goal of the controller is to provide an intervention in the event of the vehicle detecting an obstacle in its path. The five types of inputs that will be considered are (i) Four Wheel Steering; (ii) Front Wheel Steering; (iii) Four Wheel Brake Steering; (iv) Front Wheel Brake Steering; and (v) Rear Wheel Brake Steering. The controller design is an LQ controller based on the simplified dynamics of a 2 degree of freedom bicycle model. However, the analysis of the different strategies are performed on a more complete, nonlinear vehicle model. A key contribution of this paper is the quantitative evaluation of the relative efficiencies of each of these input strategies being examined. Unlike most control schemes, an important metric of performance is the ratio of peak tire force used versus available tire force. The conclusions reached in this paper shed additional light on appropriate input actuator methods for vehicle guidance and control.

AB Landmark navigation is a common positioning method of material handling vehicles operating in industrial environments. The position is calculated based on relative measurements to landmarks, the locations of which are known in advance. This paper presents a nonlinear optimization model used to determine the position of the minimum number of beacons required by a shop floor to guarantee accurate and reliable performance of AGVs. This position is based on guidelines developed by a previous error analysis study. The model is later converted to a binary linear programming model which is used as a lower bound to a heuristic solution procedure. Finally, two examples are used to illustrate the procedure.

TI Development of the high angular resolution 360° LiDAR based on scanning

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) using various operational principles has been applied in many fields, e.g., robotics navigation, autonomous vehicles, unmanned aerial flyers, land surveying, etc. The multichannel LiDAR system is of great importance in the field of autonomous driving due to its larger field of view (FoV). However, the number of transceivers limits the vertical angular resolution of multichannel LiDAR systems and makes them costly. On the other hand, the emergence of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) mirrors may provide a highly promising solution to a low-cost, high angular resolution LiDAR system. We have demonstrated a MEMS mirror-based 360 degrees LiDAR system with high angular resolution and will present the detailed design process and obtained experimental results in this paper. With the combination of the MEMS mirror and a rotation platform for the LiDAR system, a 360 degrees x 8.6 degrees (horizontal x vertical) FoV was achieved. Compared with existing commercial multichannel 360 degrees LiDAR systems, our system has 13.8 times better angular resolution than the Velodyne HDL-64 LiDAR sensor. The experimental results verified an excellent performance of 0.07 degrees x 0.027 degrees (horizontal x vertical) angular resolution, which enhances the panoramic scanning and imaging capability of the LiDAR system, potentially providing more accurate 3D scanning applications in areas such as autonomous vehicles, indoor surveying, indoor robotics navigation, etc.

AB With the development of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) technologies, traffic flow on the road is converting into the heterogeneous traffic flow, which consists of CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Considering the function of CAVs would degrade when following HDVs in heterogeneous traffic flow. Moreover, the reaction time of degraded CAVs would be different with CAVs or HDVs. This paper deduces and analyzes the linear stability of such heterogeneous traffic flow based on CAVs degradations and reaction time diversity. Firstly, considering the degradations of CAVs, the vehicle types and their ratios in heterogeneous traffic flow are analyzed. Secondly, the car-following model and the reaction time of three types of vehicles are discussed. Then, the linear stability condition of heterogeneous traffic flow is proposed. Finally, the impact factors on the stability condition are illustrated through numerical analysis. The results show that the high penetration rate of CAVs and the short reaction time can improve the linear stability of heterogeneous traffic flow. Besides, when the penetration rate of CAVs increases to 65%, the stability of heterogeneous traffic flow is not affected by speed. Furthermore, the analysis shows that CAVs degradations also has a negative effect on linear stability. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems are increasingly offered in new vehicles in the market today, and they form a core building block for future full autonomous driving. ACC systems allow vehicles to maintain a desired headway to a leading vehicle automatically. Recent research demonstrates that (1) shorter headways lead to higher throughput, and (2) the effective use of ACC can improve traffic flow by adapting the desired time headway in response to changing traffic conditions. In this paper we show that, although shorter headways result in higher capacity, flow breakdown still occurs if traffic densities at bottlenecks are allowed to exceed the critical density. Therefore, dynamic traffic control near bottlenecks is still necessary to avoid bottleneck activation and capacity loss. We propose an adaptive reinforcement learning (RL) headway controller that uses ACC headways to optimize traffic flow and minimize delay. Based on state measurements, the controller dynamically assigns an optimal headway value for each freeway section within a control cycle. In a freeway simulation example, we first demonstrate that different nondynamic headway assignment strategies failed to avoid congestion and traffic breakdown. We then present a dynamic headway control strategy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that adapts the desired headway according to the changing traffic conditions on both the freeway and the ramp to effectively maximize traffic flow and minimize system delay. We quantitatively demonstrate that our DRL dynamic headway control strategy improved traffic and reduced system delay by up to 57% compared with the examined nondynamic headways.

AB The advent of autonomous driving technologies has created a crucial need for upgrading conventional traffic control and lane management strategies in large cities. In this research, we design an optimal lane management strategy for corridors with a heterogeneous demand of human-driven, autonomous, and communicant autonomous vehicles (HVs, AVs, and CAVs). In a monocentric city setting, we dynamically control the inflow of the network by optimizing the size of CAV platoons in the corridors based on the instantaneous condition of the integrated system. These corridors can potentially have three types of lanes for vehicles with different levels of automation technology. We model the multiple lane type corridors as sets of parallel bottlenecks with general distributions of multiclass demand. The dynamics of the congestion in the network is also modeled using the macroscopic network fundamental diagram (MNFD). To study the impacts of the rise in the penetration rate of AVs and CAVs on the performance of the system, we derive a closed-form representation of the model. We show that the increase of the delay in the network with the rise in the penetration rate of AVs and CAVs can have a stable, an unstable, or a hybrid pattern. To optimize the system, we minimize a weighted summation of the experienced delay in the corridors and the total travel time in the urban network by optimizing the number of lanes of each type and the dynamic size of the CAV platoons. The results of the San Francisco case study show that implementing an optimal lane management strategy can reduce the experienced delay in the corridors up to 78% with a rise in the AV/CAV penetration rate. By dynamically controlling the size of the CAV platoons in the automated highway of the Bay Bridge, we limit the increase of the travel time in the downtown network as low as 5%.

AB Traditionally, autonomous cars treat human-driven vehicles like moving obstacles. They predict their future trajectories and plan to stay out of their way. While physically safe, this results in defensive and opaque behaviors. In reality, an autonomous car's actions will actually affect what other cars will do in response, creating an opportunity for coordination. Our thesis is that we can leverage these responses to plan more efficient and communicative behaviors. We introduce a formulation of interaction with human-driven vehicles as an underactuated dynamical system, in which the robot's actions have consequences on the state of the autonomous car, but also on the human actions and thus the state of the human-driven car. We model these consequences by approximating the human's actions as (noisily) optimal with respect to some utility function. The robot uses the human actions as observations of her underlying utility function parameters. We first explore learning these parameters offline, and show that a robot planning in the resulting underactuated system is more efficient than when treating the person as a moving obstacle. We also show that the robot can target specific desired effects, like getting the person to switch lanes or to proceed first through an intersection. We then explore estimating these parameters online, and enable the robot to perform active information gathering: generating actions that purposefully probe the human in order to clarify their underlying utility parameters, like driving style or attention level. We show that this significantly outperforms passive estimation and improves efficiency. Planning in our model results in coordination behaviors: the robot inches forward at an intersection to see if can go through, or it reverses to make the other car proceed first. These behaviors result from the optimization, without relying on hand-coded signaling strategies. Our user studies support the utility of our model when interacting with real users.

AB Deep learning-based marker detection for autonomous drone landing is widely studied, due to its superior detection performance. However, no study was reported to address non-uniform motion-blurred input images, and most of the previous handcrafted and deep learning-based methods failed to operate with these challenging inputs. To solve this problem, we propose a deep learning-based marker detection method for autonomous drone landing, by (1) introducing a two-phase framework of deblurring and object detection, by adopting a slimmed version of deblur generative adversarial network (DeblurGAN) model and a You only look once version 2 (YOLOv2) detector, respectively, and (2) considering the balance between the processing time and accuracy of the system. To this end, we propose a channel-pruning framework for slimming the DeblurGAN model called SlimDeblurGAN, without significant accuracy degradation. The experimental results on the two datasets showed that our proposed method exhibited higher performance and greater robustness than the previous methods, in both deburring and marker detection.

AB A variety of stakeholders have put forth automated vehicle (AV) deployment timeline predictions over the past decade. To synthesize these predictions, we performed a systematic literature review of past and current AV deployment timeline predictions in the United States from different stakeholder groups, including private stakeholders, government organizations, and research organizations. Our analysis revealed that none of the AV mass deployment timelines from any stakeholder group have been met. It also shows discrepancies between timelines put forth by private and public stakeholders, with the private sector being more optimistic in their predictions. Accurate timelines are needed so regulators are able to create appropriate public policies and comprehensive budgets, and private stakeholders can make better informed decisions. More specifically, the mass deployment of AVs is anticipated to affect many transportation-related jobs which reinforces the impor-tance of accurate AV deployment timelines to prepare the workers who may be displaced and for the develop-ment of workforce education and training initiatives.

AB Vision algorithms were implemented on an field programmable gate array to provide additional information to supplement the insufficient data of a standard inertial measurement unit in order to create a previously unrealized completely onboard vision system for micro-unmanned aerial vehicles. The onboard vision system is composed of an field programmable gate array board, and a custom interface daughterboard which allow it to provide data regarding drifting movements of the micro-unmanned aerial vehicle not detected by inertial measurement units. The algorithms implemented for the vision system include a Harris feature detector, template matching feature correlator, similarity-constrained homography by random sample consensus, color segmentation, radial distortion correction, and an extended Kalman filter with a standard-deviation outlier rejection technique. This vision system was designed specifically for use as an onboard vision solution for determining movement of micro-unmanned aerial vehicles that have severe size, weight, and power limitations. Results show that the vision system is capable of real-time onboard image processing with sufficient accuracy to allow a micro-unmanned aerial vehicle to control itself without power or data tethers to a groundstation.

AB Autonomous and connected vehicles are expected to enable new tolling mechanisms, such as auction-based tolls, for allocating the limited roadway capacity. This research examines the public perception of futuristic auction-based tolling systems, with a focus on the public acceptance of such systems over current tolling practices on highways (e.g., dynamic and fixed tolling methodologies). Through a stated-preference survey, responses from 159 road-users residing in Virginia are elicited to understand route choice behavior under a descending price auction implemented on a hypothetical two-route network. Analysis of the survey data shows that there is no outright rejection of the presented auction-based tolling among those who are familiar with the current tolling methods. While males strongly support the new method, no clear pattern emerges among other demographic variables such as income and education level, and age. While high income respondents and regular commuters are more likely to pay higher tolls, no statistical significance between different genders, age groups, household sizes, and education levels is found. Based on the modeling results and the hypothetical road network, it is found that descending price tolling method yields higher average toll rates, and generates at least 70% more revenue when travel time saving is 30 min, and improves capacity utilization of the toll road significantly compared to fixed tolls.

DE Autonomous vehicle navigation; motion and path planning; deep learning

AB Accurate prediction is important for operating an autonomous vehicle in interactive scenarios. Prediction must be fast, to support multiple requests from a planner exploring a range of possible futures. The generated predictions must accurately represent the probabilities of predicted trajectories, while also capturing different modes of behaviour (such as turning left vs continuing straight at a junction). To this end, we present DiPA, an interactive predictor that addresses these challenging requirements. Previous interactive prediction methods use an encoding of k-mode-samples, which under-represents the full distribution. Other methods optimise closest-mode evaluations, which test whether one of the predictions is similar to the ground-truth, but allow additional unlikely predictions to occur, over-representing unlikely predictions. DiPA addresses these limitations by using a Gaussian-Mixture-Model to encode the full distribution, and optimising predictions using both probabilistic and closest-mode measures. These objectives respectively optimise probabilistic accuracy and the ability to capture distinct behaviours, and there is a challenging trade-off between them. We are able to solve both together using a novel training regime. DiPA achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and NGSIM datasets, and improves over the baseline (MFP) when both closest-mode and probabilistic evaluations are used. This demonstrates effective prediction for supporting a planner on interactive scenarios.

AB Many achievements toward unmanned surface vehicles have been made using artificial intelligence theory to assist the decisions of the navigator. In particular, there has been rapid development in autonomous collision avoidance techniques that employ the intelligent algorithm of deep reinforcement learning. A novel USV collision avoidance algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning theory for real-time maneuvering is proposed. Many improvements toward the autonomous learning framework are carried out to improve the performance of USV collision avoidance, including prioritized experience replay, noisy network, double learning, and dueling architecture, which can significantly enhance the training effect. Additionally, considering the characteristics of the USV collision avoidance problem, two effective methods to enhance training efficiency are proposed. For better training, considering the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea and USV maneuverability, a complete and reliable USV collision avoidance training system is established, demonstrating an efficient learning process in complex encounter situations. A reward signal system in line with the USV characteristics is designed. Based on the Unity maritime virtual simulation platform, an abundant simulation environment for training and testing is designed. Through detailed analysis, verification, and comparison, the improved algorithm outperforms the pre-improved algorithm in terms of stability, average reward, rules learning, and collision avoidance effect, reducing 26.60% more accumulated course deviation and saving 1.13% more time.

AB This work addresses an operational problem of a logistics service provider that consists of finding an optimal route for a vehicle carrying customer parcels from a central depot to selected facilities, from where autonomous devices like robots are launched to perform last-mile deliveries. The objective is to minimize a tardiness indicator based on the customer delivery deadlines. This article provides a better understanding of how three major tardiness indicators can be used to improve the quality of service by minimizing the maximum tardiness, the total tardiness, or the number of late deliveries. We study the problem complexity, devise a unifying Mixed Integer Programming formulation and propose an efficient branch-and-Benders-cut scheme to deal with instances of realistic size. Numerical results show that this novel Benders approach with a tailored combinatorial algorithm for generating Benders cuts largely out-performs all other alternatives. In our managerial study, we vary the number of available facilities, the coverage radius of autonomous robots and their speed, to assess their impact on the quality of service and environmental costs.

AB This study addresses the problem of non-stop passage by vehicles at intersections based on special processing of data from a road camera or video detector. The basic task in this article is formulated as a forecast for the release time of a controlled intersection by non-group vehicles, taking into account their classification and determining their number in the queue. To solve the problem posed, the YOLOv3 neural network and the modified SORT object tracker were used. The work uses a heuristic region-based algorithm in classifying and measuring the parameters of the queue of vehicles. On the basis of fuzzy logic methods, a model for predicting the passage time of a queue of vehicles at controlled intersections was developed and refined. The elaborated technique allows one to reduce the forced number of stops at controlled intersections of connected vehicles by choosing the optimal speed mode. The transmission of information on the predicted delay time at a controlled intersection is locally possible due to the V2X communication of the road controller equipment, and in the horizontally scaled mode due to the interaction of HAV-the Digital Road Model.

AB Collaborative driving is a growing domain of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) which aim to navigate traffic both efficiently and safely. Cooperation between vehicles heavily rely on the comprehensive information collected. With the development of vehicular communication technologies, information can be shared between vehicles or infrastructures through Vehicle to -Vehicle (V2V)/Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) data exchange. By taking advantage of data sharing between vehicles, this paper proposes an Artificial Potential Field (APF) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) combined controller to implement collaborative driving in complex environments. Firstly, an APF model containing three components is developed to describe the mutual effect and collaboration properties between vehicles and surrounding environments. Afterwards, a MPC cost function for optimized control, considering both kinematic characteristics and environmental effect conveyed by APF, is presented to address the problem of collaborative driving. Such controller is designed from the perspective of multi-objective and multi-constraint optimization which takes the vehicle motion constraints, safety and comfort requirements into consideration. The prominent advantage of the proposed approach is that it can deal with the problems of route planning and manipulating simultaneously. To validate the proposed approach, a variety of scenario simulations are conducted in MATLAB, and the performance of the proposed method are verified. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous aircraft are the key enablers of future urban services, such as postal and transportation systems. Digital twins (DTs) are promising cutting-edge technologies that can transform the future transport ecosystem into an autonomous and resilient system. However, since DT is a data-driven solution based on AI, proper data management is essential in implementing DT as a service (DTaaS). One of the challenges in DT development is the availability of real-life data, particularly for training algorithms and verifying the functionality of DT. The current article focuses on data augmentation through synthetic data generation. This approach can facilitate the development of DT in case the developers do not have enough data to train the machine learning (ML) algorithm. The current twinning approach provides a prospective ideal state of the engine used for proactive monitoring of the engine's health as an anomaly detection service. In line with the track of unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs) for urban air mobility in smart city applications, this paper focuses specifically on the common hybrid turbo-shaft in drones/helicopters. However, there is a significant gap in real-life similar synthetic data generation in the UAV domain literature. Therefore, rolling linear regression and Kalman filter algorithms were implemented on noise-added data, which simulate the data measured from the engine in a real-life operational life cycle. For both thermal and hybrid models, the corresponding DT model has shown high efficiency in noise filtration and a certain amount of predictions with a lower error rate on all engine parameters except the engine torque.

AB In this paper, a visual navigation method based on binocular vision and a deep learning approach is proposed to solve the navigation problem of the unmanned aerial vehicle autonomous aerial refueling docking process. First, to meet the requirements of high accuracy and high frame rate in aerial refueling tasks, this paper proposes a single-stage lightweight drogue detection model, which greatly increases the inference speed of binocular images by introducing image alignment and depth-separable convolution and improves the feature extraction capability and scale adaptation performance of the model by using an efficient attention mechanism (ECA) and adaptive spatial feature fusion method (ASFF). Second, this paper proposes a novel method for estimating the pose of the drogue by spatial geometric modeling using optical markers, and further improves the accuracy and robustness of the algorithm by using visual reprojection. Moreover, this paper constructs a visual navigation vision simulation and semi-physical simulation experiments for the autonomous aerial refueling task, and the experimental results show the following: (1) the proposed drogue detection model has high accuracy and real-time performance, with a mean average precision (mAP) of 98.23% and a detection speed of 41.11 FPS in the embedded module; (2) the position estimation error of the proposed visual navigation algorithm is less than & PLUSMN;0.1 m, and the attitude estimation error of the pitch and yaw angle is less than & PLUSMN;0.5 & DEG;; and (3) through comparison experiments with the existing advanced methods, the positioning accuracy of this method is improved by 1.18% compared with the current advanced methods.

AB The path tracking system is a crucial component in fully autonomous vehicles. While many methods provide state-of-the-art tracking performance, they tend to emphasize tracking accuracy for safety, at the price of ride quality. Although methods based on a dynamic model and optimization theory guarantee improved tracking performance, a high-fidelity model is unavailable in most autonomous systems, and the complex optimization process may increase the computational burden. Therefore, for practical, real-life systems, it is urgent to develop a tracking method with a simple, effective control framework for real-time implementation. Moreover, the tracking approach should adaptively balance between tracking accuracy and the passenger experience. With that in mind, a simple tracking scheme with adaptive lateral and longitudinal control approaches is proposed. For lateral control, a pure pursuit (PP) geometric controller is used as a basic tracking framework to design the steering method. Adetailed analysis shows that PP inefficiently reduces the lateral error. APID controller is integrated with PP by a customized reinforcement learning model to better deal with tracking error by trading off between PP and PID. Moreover, a rough-to-fine velocity adaptation method is proposed to adjust the speed according to the geometry of the predefined path and the real-time tracking feedback. The proposed controlling approach is tested in different path tracking scenarios. The results showthat the approach can adaptively change the weights ofPPand PID tomaintain a balance between tracking error (within +/- 0.5 m) and jerk (within +/- 0.5 m/s(3)), and can adapt to high-speed scenarios (up to 80 km/h). Finally, a field test is carried out to validate the practicability.

AB The world is moving towards a fully connected digital world, where objects produce and consume data, at a sultry pace. Autonomous vehicles will play a key role in bolstering the digitization of the world. These connected vehicles must communicate timely data with their surrounding objects and road participants to fully and accurately understand their environments and eventually operate smoothly. As a result, the hugely exchanged data would scramble the network traffic that, at a given point, would no longer increase the awareness level of the vehicle. In this paper, we propose a vision-based approach to identify connected vehicles and use it to optimize the exchange of collective perception messages (CPMs), in terms of both the CPM generation frequency and the number of generated CPMs. To validate our proposed approach, we created a Cartery framework that integrates SUMO, Carla, and OMNeT++. We also compared our solution with both baselines and European Telecommunications Standards Institute solutions, considering three main KPIs: the channel busy ratio, environmental awareness, and the CPM generation frequency. Simulation results show that our proposed solution exhibits the best trade-off between the network load and situational awareness.

AB Undulating propulsion is promising solution for underwater vehicles used in subsea security systems, especially due to its low noise, better energetic efficiency, low water turbulence and living animals mimicry. The design of the biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicle (BAUV) for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), built in the SABUVIS project, is presented in the paper. The shape of the vehicle hull was inspired by living fish. Key aspects of the design and construction of BAUV needed to achieve tasks required to be performed by the robot are described. Two research questions are stated in the paper: how big drag forces act on a biomimetic underwater vehicle and how mechanical design influences the noise level generated by the vehicle. To answer these questions vehicle forward velocity, hull drag, added mass and generated noise were investigated. Forces acting on the BAUV hull while being pulled forward and sideways were measured. Noise generated by the vehicle was also measured for two types of propulsors' drives in order to select those with the lower sound pressure level. Quantitative results of drag and noise obtained in the research are important for designers of mechanical structures of useful, full scale biomimetic underwater robots and their control subsystems.

AB Visual perception plays an important role in autonomous driving. One of the primary tasks is object detection and identification. Since the vision sensor is rich in color and texture information, it can quickly and accurately identify various road information. The commonly used technique is based on extracting and calculating various features of the image. The recent development of deep learning-based method has better reliability and processing speed and has a greater advantage in recognizing complex elements. For depth estimation, vision sensor is also used for ranging due to their small size and low cost. Monocular camera uses image data from a single viewpoint as input to estimate object depth. In contrast, stereo vision is based on parallax and matching feature points of different views, and the application of Deep learning also further improves the accuracy. In addition, Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM) can establish a model of the road environment, thus helping the vehicle perceive the surrounding environment and complete the tasks. In this paper, we introduce and compare various methods of object detection and identification, then explain the development of depth estimation and compare various methods based on monocular, stereo, and RGB-D sensors, next review and compare various methods of SLAM, and finally summarize the current problems and present the future development trends of vision technologies.

AB Semantic segmentation is paramount for autonomous vehicles to have a deeper understanding of the surrounding traffic environment and enhance safety. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable performances in semantic segmentation. However, training such a DNN requires a large amount of labeled data at the pixel level. In practice, it is a labor-intensive task to manually annotate dense pixel-level labels. To tackle the problem associated with a small amount of labeled data, deep domain adaptation (DDA) methods have recently been developed to examine the use of synthetic driving scenes so as to significantly reduce the manual annotation cost. Despite remarkable advances, these methods, unfortunately, suffer from the generalizability problem that fails to provide a holistic representation of the mapping from the source image domain to the target image domain. In this article, we, therefore, develop a novel ensembled DDA to train models with different upsampling strategies, discrepancy, and segmentation loss functions. The models are, therefore, complementary with each other to achieve better generalization in the target image domain. Such a design does not only improves the adapted semantic segmentation performance but also strengthens the model reliability and robustness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiorities of our approach over several state-of-the-art methods.

ID TARDINESS BOUNDS; GLOBAL EDF; TRACKING
AB Autonomous vehicles often employ computer-vision (CV) algorithms that track the movements of pedestrians and other vehicles to maintain safe distances from them. These algorithms are usually expressed as real-time processing graphs that have cycles due to back edges that provide history information. If immediate back history is required, then such a cycle must execute sequentially. Due to this requirement, any graph that contains a cycle with utilization exceeding 1.0 is categorically unschedulable, i.e., bounded graph response times cannot be guaranteed. Unfortunately, such cycles can occur in practice, particularly if conservative execution-time assumptions are made, as befits a safety-critical system. This dilemma can be obviated by allowing older back history, which enables parallelism in cycle execution at the expense of possibly affecting the accuracy of tracking. However, the efficacy of this solution hinges on the resulting history-vs.-response time-vs.-accuracy trade-off that it exposes. In this paper, this trade-off is explored in depth through both a study of response-time bounds of synthetic task systems and an experimental study conducted using the open-source CARLA autonomous-driving simulator. Somewhat surprisingly, easing away from always requiring immediate back history proved to have only a marginal impact on accuracy, while greatly reducing analytical response-time bounds.

AB Privately-owned automated vehicles (PAVs) can relocate themselves elsewhere after arriving at destinations, thereby inducing empty vehicle mile traveled (VMT) and more greenhouse gas emissions. This paper examines travelers' preferences for PAV relocation, using stated preference surveys distributed in the Seattle and Kansas City regions in the U.S. Model results suggest that trip purpose, individual socio-economic and household characteristics, and local contexts influence PAV relocation decisions. Additionally, a willingness-to-relocate (WTR) metric is defined to represent how much time travelers would be willing to spend to relocate PAVs to save $1 in parking costs. The WTR estimates in both regions indicate the potential of induced VMT due to PAV parking relocation. Furthermore, travelers' awareness of fuel/energy costs associated with PAV relocation does not necessarily relate to a lower WTR, depending on the region. To curb excessive empty VMT from PAV relocation, explicit disincentives, such as a VMT fee, may be needed.

DE UAV; flight zone; geofence; dynamic vector fields; aerodynamics
AB This work addresses the issue of finding an optimal flight zone for a side-by-side tracking and following Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV) adhering to space-restricting factors brought upon by a dynamic Vector Field Extraction (VFE) algorithm. The VFE algorithm demands a relatively perpendicular field of view of the UAV to the tracked vehicle, thereby enforcing the space-restricting factors which are distance, angle and altitude. The objective of the UAV is to perform side-byside tracking and following of a lightweight ground vehicle while acquiring high quality video of tufts attached to the side of the tracked vehicle. The recorded video is supplied to the VFE algorithm that produces the positions and deformations of the tufts over time as they interact with the surrounding air, resulting in an airflow model of the tracked vehicle. The present limitations of wind tunnel tests and computational fluid dynamics simulation suggest the use of a UAV for real world evaluation of the aerodynamic properties of the vehicle's exterior. The novelty of the proposed approach is alluded to defining the specific flight zone restricting factors while adhering to the VFE algorithm, where as a result we were capable of formalizing a locally-static and a globally-dynamic geofence attached to the tracked vehicle and enclosing the UAV.

AB Using turn signals to convey a driver's intention to change lanes provides a direct and unambiguous way of communicating with nearby drivers. Nonetheless, past research has indicated that drivers may not always use their turn signals before starting a lane change. In this study, realistic driving data are analyzed to investigate turn signal usage during lane changes on highways in and around Gothenburg, Sweden. Turn signal usage is examined and factors that influence it are identified by employing Bayesian hierarchical modelling. The study found that drivers used their turn signal before changing lanes in 60% of cases, after starting the lane change in 33% of cases, and did not use it at all in 7% of cases. The Bayesian hierarchical modelling results indicate that various factors, such as the speed and direction of lane changes and the presence of surrounding vehicles, influence the usage of turn signals. The study concludes that understanding the factors affecting turn signal usage is crucial for improving traffic safety in current and future mixed traffic with autonomous vehicles. The study discusses the implications of findings concerning increasing turn signal compliance through general policy-making, improving existing in-vehicle technologies and including turn signal usage in Pay-As-You-Drive insurances.
   This paper examines human drivers' turn signal behaviour in real-world driving scenarios during lane changes. The results indicate that drivers may not always use turn signals properly, and various factors influence their use.image

ID HUMAN-ROBOT COLLABORATION; MOBILE ROBOTS
AB Human contact is a key issue in social interactions for autonomous systems since robots are increasingly appearing everywhere, which has led to a higher risk of conflict. Particularly in the real world, collisions between humans and machines may result in catastrophic accidents or damaged goods. In this paper, a novel stop strategy related to autonomous systems is proposed. This control method can eliminate the vibrations produced by a system's movement by analysing the poles and zeros in the model of autonomous vehicles and goods. Using the pole placement technique, the motion of a system is guaranteed to be more stable, more flexible and smoother. Moreover, several control profiles are employed in the switching mechanism to choose the proper vibration-free effect. The main contributions of this paper are (i) the recommendation of an active stopping planner using different smooth generators from a modelling study, (ii) the validation of their physical characteristics and (iii) the launching of a switching algorithm based on the socially aware navigation framework of a robot. This theoretical work is based on the virtual environment of MATLAB, and the experiment is implemented in the practical platform of an automated guided vehicle. From these results, it can be seen that the proposed approach is robust, effective and feasible for applications in storehouse management, public transportation or factory manufacturing.

AB Traditional methods for autonomous driving are implemented with many building blocks from perception, planning and control, making them difficult to generalize to varied scenarios due to complex assumptions and interdependencies. Recently, the end-to-end driving method has emerged, which performs well and generalizes to new environments by directly learning from expert-provided data. However, many existing methods on this topic neglect to check the confidence of the driving actions and the ability to recover from driving mistakes. In this paper, we develop an uncertainty-aware end-to-end trajectory generation method based on imitation learning. It can extract spatiotemporal features from the front-view camera images for scene understanding, and then generate collision-free trajectories several seconds into the future. The experimental results suggest that under various weather and lighting conditions, our network can reliably generate trajectories in different urban environments, such as turning at intersections and slowing down for collision avoidance. Furthermore, closed-loop driving tests suggest that the proposed method achieves better cross-scene/platform driving results than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end control method, where our model can recover from off-center and off-orientation errors and capture 80% of dangerous cases with high uncertainty estimations.

AB There have been significant advances in technology and automated systems that will eventually see the use of autonomous cars as commonplace on our roads. Various systems are already available that provide the driver with different levels of decision support. This paper highlights the key human factors issues associated with the interaction between the user and an autonomous system, including assistive decision support and the delegation of authority to the automobile. The level of support offered to the driver can range from traditional automated assistance, to system generated guidance that offers advice for the driver to act upon, and even more direct action that is initiated by the system itself without driver intervention. In many of these instances the role of the driver is slowly moving towards a supervisory role within a complex system rather than one of direct control of the vehicle. Different paradigms of interaction are considered and focus is placed on the partnership that takes place between the driver and the vehicle. Drawing on the wealth of knowledge that exists within the aviation domain and research literature that examines technology partnerships within the cockpit, this paper considers important factors that will assist the automotive community to understand the underlying issues of the human and their interaction within complex systems.

AB Increased on-road testing and market availability of partially automated vehicles (AV) offers researchers and developers the opportunity to evaluate the AV's performance. The occurrence of new types of accidents involving AV's has sparked questions in regard to who is actually in control over and responsible for AV control. In this contribution, we suggest a potential discrepancy in AV control with the review of recently documented accidents involving AV's. The identification of a gap in control is performed using a recently formulated moral philosophical framework of Meaningful Human Control (MHC). This shows a discrepancy between the attribution of responsibility and the ability of a human to fulfil the role assigned to them. While a gap in control is not evident from the viewpoint of operational control, it requires the more intricate concept of MHC to expose it. Recommendations are further made that AV developers and vehicle approval authorities should consider control from a MHC perspective to avoid future gaps in control with the resulting consequences.

AB This study examines the effects of on-demand mobility services on sustainability in terms of emissions and traffic volume. According to our simulations, implementing on-demand mobility services is recommendable only as a supplement to public transport in both urban and rural regions since there are positive effects in terms of CO2 emissions. However, in urban areas, there is a negative impact on the traffic volume in terms of additional vehicle kilometres since the bundled public transport demand is replaced by less bundled on-demand vehicles. In rural areas, the increase in vehicle kilometres plays less of a role due to generally low demand. The negative effects per vehicle kilometre are slightly higher in rural areas due to higher empty kilometres and lower bundling rates, but the negative effects per km(2) in dense cities are much more serious. Authorities need to consider these effects according to the spatial context when implementing such services.

AB Ground autonomous mobile robots have important applications, such as reconnaissance, patrol, planetary exploration, and military applications. In order to accomplish tasks on rough terrain, control and planning methods must consider the physical characteristics of the vehicle and of its environment. Failure to understand these characteristics could lead to vehicle endangement and consequent mission failure. This paper describes recent and current work at the Politecnico of Bari in collaboration with the University of Lecce in the area of deformable terrain mobility and sensing. A cylindrical mobile robot is presented and its rolling motion on terrain is studied from a theoretical and experimental prospect. A comprehensive model is developed taking into account the interaction of the vehicle with the terrain and the related dynamic ill effects, such as rolling resistance and slip, and it is experimentally validated. An unconventional application of the vehicle serving as a tactile sensor is discussed and experimental results are presented showing the effectiveness of the cylindrical mobile robot in estimating the properties of homogeneous, deformable terrain, which in turn can be used to assess the vehicle traversability.

AB Platooning control of connected and automated vehicles relies on the collected information via onboard sensors and wireless vehicle-to-vehicle communication. However, sensing delay arises from perception and fusion of multiple onboard sensors, and communication delay arises from transmission intermittencies. Two types of time delays may compromise the stability of platoon systems. In this paper, we study the effects of sensing delay and communication delay on stability of the platoons, where multiple vehicles move in a closed roadway. Each vehicle utilizes the delay-based bidirectional asymmetric control to regulate individual longitudinal behaviours, in which nonidentical asymmetry factors between the direct front and back adjacent vehicles are used for the feedback gains of position, velocity, and acceleration information. The platoon system with three weighted Laplacian matrices is decomposed into a finite number of linear spatial modes. Based on a geometric analysis approach for two constant time delays, we obtain the region of stability preservation in the delays plane, as well as the threshold values of sensing delay and communication delay. Numerical calculations show that, in terms of stability margin with respect to time delays, the platoon system tends to have a higher tolerance for sensing delay than for communication delay, especially for small asymmetric level.

AB Heterogeneous vehicle platoons, consisting of a human-driven vehicle (HDV) as the leader and connected automated vehicles (CAVs) as followers, present a promising solution to address various challenges arising from fully autonomous driving. In this paper, we propose a novel LSTM-based distributed model predictive control (DMPC) platooning method. Initially, we develop and train a vehicle acceleration prediction model based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network using real-world driving data. Subsequently, the predicted acceleration sequence of the leading HDV is integrated into the DMPC-based platoon control model for the following CAVs. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct simulation experiments using real-world driving data. The results demonstrate that, with a time headway of 1 s, the maximum speed error and maximum spacing error of the heterogeneous vehicle platoon using the proposed LSTM-based DMPC are reduced by at least 5.8% and 5.9%, respectively, compared to the traditional DMPC method. Furthermore, the LSTM-based DMPC outperforms the Transformer-based DMPC method, resulting in a 1.0% reduction in maximum speed error and a 0.7% reduction in maximum spacing error. The proposed method effectively dampens oscillation caused by the leading HDV and enhances tracking accuracy.

AB In this paper, an ecological driving (eco-driving) algorithm considering queue effects is proposed for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) at unsaturated intersections in order to reduce fuel consumption and travel time. Firstly, after the traffic flow parameters are obtained using vehicle-to-infrastructure communication technology, the kinematic shockwave model is used to predict the vehicle queue length at the saturated intersections. Secondly, to decrease fuel consumption, a fuel-saving optimization problem is formulated using the estimated queue length, and for real-time control, the formulated optimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems depending on whether the CAV will stop to queue. Then, to reduce fuel consumption and travel time simultaneously, the eco-driving algorithm is designed, where the trajectory re-optimization process is implemented in order not to block the upstream vehicles. Finally, extensive simulations are carried out on VISSIM to demonstrate the control performance of the proposed eco-driving algorithm on CAVs and on the entire traffic flow. Simulation results show that the proposed eco-driving algorithm can significantly decrease the fuel consumption and travel time of both CAVs and the traffic flow, and higher market penetration rate of CAVs can result in better control performance.

AB For accurate object vehicle estimation using radar, there are two fundamental problems: measurement uncertainties in calculating an object's position with a virtual polygon box and latency due to commercial radar tracking algorithms. We present a data-driven object vehicle estimation scheme to solve measurement uncertainty and latency problems in radar systems. A radar accuracy model and latency coordination are proposed to reduce the tracking error. We first design data-driven radar accuracy models to improve the accuracy of estimation determined by the object vehicle's position. The proposed model solves the measurement uncertainty problem within a feasible set for error covariance. The latency coordination is developed by analyzing the position error according to the relative velocity. The position error by latency is stored in a feasible set for relative velocity, and the solution is calculated from the given relative velocity. Removing the measurement uncertainty and latency of the radar system allows for a weighted interpolation to be applied to estimate the position of the object vehicle. Our method is tested by a scenario-based estimation experiment to validate the usefulness of the proposed data-driven object vehicle estimation scheme. We confirm that the proposed estimation method produces improved performance over the conventional radar estimation and previous methods.

AB For autonomous driving research, using a scaled vehicle platform is a viable alternative compared to a full-scale vehicle. However, using embedded solutions such as small robotic platforms with differential driving or radio-controlled (RC) car-based platforms can be limiting on, for example, sensor package restrictions or computing challenges. Furthermore, for a given controller, specialized expertise and abilities are necessary. To address such problems, this paper proposes a feasible solution, the Ridon vehicle, which is a spacious ride-on automobile with high-driving electric power and a custom-designed drive-by-wire system powered by a full-scale machine-learning-ready computer. The major objective of this paper is to provide a thorough and appropriate method for constructing a cost-effective platform with a drive-by-wire system and sensor packages so that machine-learning-based algorithms can be tested and deployed on a scaled vehicle. The proposed platform employs a modular and hierarchical software architecture, with microcontroller programs handling the low-level motor controls and a graphics processing unit (GPU)-powered laptop computer processing the higher and more sophisticated algorithms. The Ridon vehicle platform is validated by employing it in a deep-learning-based behavioral cloning study. The suggested platform's affordability and adaptability would benefit broader research and the education community.

AB In the current transition to a smarter and more efficient transportation system, battery electric vehicle mileage and the time required for charging are still two main constraints that need to be overcome to enable a larger penetration of electric vehicles. Moreover, the few charging stations available are a consequence of the "supply and demand" problem. Consequently, wireless dynamic recharging can be a complementary solution to address the problems of light-duty electric mobility and an added-value towards autonomous vehicles. Consequently, this paper presents an innovative approach based on real world mobility patterns collected for a sample in the city of Lisbon, Portugal, to assess users' electric vehicle feasibility by assessing different recharging scenarios, comparing stationary and dynamic recharging scenarios. The results indicate that at least 15 % more drivers would be eligible to own an electric vehicle if wireless charging was available. Moreover, wireless charging reduces the range of battery used, with stationary charging requiring circa 3.2 times more battery range. The developed approach confirms that wireless dynamic recharging can significantly change the framework of current electric mobility limitations, reducing range anxiety issues, contributing to redesign electric vehicle battery capacity and overcome barriers in stationary charging deployment and availability.

AB A hybrid model predictive control (HMPC) strategy is proposed in this paper to autonomously regulate intelligent vehicle longitudinal velocity considering nonlinear tire dynamics. Since the tire longitudinal dynamics, which has significant influence on vehicle longitudinal velocity control performance, exhibits highly nonlinear dynamical behaviors, the piecewise affine (PWA) identification is conducted firstly based on experimental data to accurately model the tire longitudinal dynamics. On this basis, due to that the intelligent vehicle needs to be operated in two distinct modes (drive and brake) for autonomous velocity regulation and because of the affine submodel switching behaviors of the PWA-identified tire model, the intelligent vehicle longitudinal dynamics control process considered in this work can be regarded as a hybrid system with both continuous variables and discrete operating modes. Thus, the mixed logical dynamical framework is further used to model the intelligent vehicle longitudinal dynamics, and a HMPC controller, which allows us to optimize the switching sequences of the operation modes (binary control inputs) and the torques acted on the wheels (continuous control inputs), is tuned based on online mixed-integer quadratic programming. Simulation results finally demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HMPC controller for intelligent vehicle longitudinal velocity regulation under typical driving conditions.

AB In this article, we propose a resource allocation scheme for air slicing in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted cellular vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. We consider a scenario, where multiple flexible UAVs are deployed as the aerial base station (BS) to assist terrestrial BS for providing service to vehicular users with the objective of maximizing the bandwidth efficiency while concurrently guaranteeing the transmission rate and the latency by adopting network slicing. Due to the uncertainty of the stochastic environment in the scenario, we formulate the optimization problem to be a stochastic game, which is an extension of game theory to Markov decision process-like environments for the case of multiple adaptive agents are involved to compete goals simultaneously. Nevertheless, the dynamic nature of both UAVs and vehicles pose the difficulty of perceiving and interacting with the unknown environment, the long short-term memory algorithm is used for extracting the features of the observation and making forecast on the mobility of UAVs and vehicles. Simulation results adduce the validity of the proposed scheme as compared with two benchmark schemes: Deep Q-network and deep deterministic policy gradient.

AB The ability to predict the motion of vehicles is essen-tial for autonomous vehicles. Aiming at the problem that existing models cannot make full use of the external pa-rameters including the outline of vehicles and the lane, we proposed a model to use the external parameters thor-oughly when predicting the trajectory in the straight-line and non-free flow state. Meanwhile, dynamic sensitive area is proposed to filter out inconsequential surround-ing vehicles. The historical trajectory of the vehicles and their external parameters are used as inputs. A shared Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell is proposed to en-code the explicit states obtained by mapping historical trajectory and external parameters. The hidden states of vehicles obtained from the last step are used to ex-tract latent driving intent. Then, a convolution layer is designed to fuse hidden states to feed into the next pre-diction circle and a decoder is used to decode the hidden states of the vehicles to predict trajectory. The experi-ment result shows that the dynamic sensitive area can shorten the training time to 75.86% of the state-of-the -art work. Compared with other models, the accuracy of our model is improved by 23.7%. Meanwhile, the model's ability of anti-interference of external parameters is also improved.

AB Fuzzy logic control, due to its simple control structure, easy and cost-effective design, has been successfully employed to the application of guidance and control in robotic fields. This paper aims to review fuzzy-logic-based guidance and control in an important branch of robots-marine robotic vehicles. First, guidance and motion forms including the maneuvering, path following, trajectory tracking, and position stabilization are described. Subsequently, the application of three major classes of fuzzy logic control, including the conventional fuzzy control (Mamdani fuzzy control and Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy control), adaptive fuzzy control (self-tuning fuzzy control and direct/indirect adaptive fuzzy control), and hybrid fuzzy control (fuzzy PID control, fuzzy sliding mode control, and neuro-fuzzy control) are presented. In particular, we summarize the design and analysis process of direct/indirect adaptive fuzzy control and fuzzy PID control in marine robotic fields. In addition, two comparative results between hybrid fuzzy control and the corresponding single control are provided to illustrate the superiority of hybrid fuzzy control. Finally, trends of the fuzzy future in marine robotic vehicles are concluded based on its state of the art.

   Virtual Traffic Light
AB Among the key goals of urban policies, the reduction of traffic congestion and pollutant emissions surely tops the list. Although solutions leveraging vehicular communication, such as GLOSA, have been proposed to smooth traffic at regulated intersections, cities normally have a large number of unregulated intersections where queues can build up, worsening emissions caused by the stop-and-go motion of vehicles. The problem is further compounded by the future presence of self-driving cars, where the need to coordinate with other autonomous cars at intersections will be even greater. In this paper, we propose (VTL)-T-3, a Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Virtual Traffic Light system for infrastructure-less unregulated crossroads. We aim at providing a low-complexity, yet effective, algorithm and communication protocol to let vehicles at an unregulated intersection decide if a virtual traffic light is needed and, in that case, self-organize to establish one. Our results highlight significant improvements compared to both unregulated and traffic light-based intersections. We tested the performance of V3TL in different, realistic scenarios (isolated or consecutive three-and four-way junctions, in single-and multi-lane configuration) and different vehicle generation rates, obtaining improvements in terms of number of passing vehicles per minute, number of stop-and-go maneuvers and scheduling fairness, when compared to unregulated or traffic-light regulated junctions.

TI Modeling Autonomous Vehicles' Altruistic Behavior to Human-Driven

DT Article
AB To explore the impact of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on human-driven vehicles (HDVs), a solution for AV to coexist harmoniously with HDV during the car following period when AVs are in low market penetration rate (MPR) was provided. An extension car following framework with two possible soft optimization targets was proposed in this article to improve the experience of HDV followers with different following strategies by deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The pretreated Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset was used for the experiments. 1027 car following events with being redefined were extracted from it, in which 600 of the events were used for training and 427 of the events were used for testing. The different driving strategies obtained from the classical car following models were embedded into virtual environment built by OpenAI gym. The reward function combined safety, efficiency, jerk, and stability was used to encourage the agent with DDPG algorithm to maximize it. The final result reveals that disturbance of HDV followers decreases by 2.362% (strategy a), 8.184% (strategy b), and 13.904% (strategy c), respectively. The disturbance of HDV follower decreases by 14.961% (strategy a), 12.020% (strategy b), and 13.425% (strategy c), respectively. HDV followers with different strategies get less jerk in both soft optimizations. AV passengers get a loss on jerk and efficiency, but safety is enhanced. Also, AV car following performs better than HDV car following in both soft and brutal optimizations. Moreover, two possible solutions for harmonious coexistence of HDVs and AVs when AVs are in low MPR are proposed.

AB This paper analyzes the lateral control technology of autonomous semi-trailer trucks. Existing researches on the lateral control algorithm of semi-trailer trucks focus on making the head-truck or trailer follow a track well while ignoring the motion characteristics during the turning process, leading to specific security issues. Meanwhile, it is difficult to cope with the complex and uncertain factors influencing lateral control effect, such as the curvature of the desired trajectory, the load, and the velocity of the semi-trailer truck. This paper proposes a parametric self-learning model predictive control (MPC) based on the Proximal Policy Optimization of One Step (OSPPO) method to solve these problems. After modeling the kinematics of the semi-trailer truck, a lateral motion controller for the relationship between the head-truck and trailer based on the MPC method is established. The traditional MPC method has difficulty in adapting to the changeable influencing factors. Thus, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm named OSPPO is introduced to improve the flexibility of the MPC method. OSPPO establishes the nonlinear mapping relationship between the critical parameter of the MPC method and the factors influencing control effect by self-learning, avoiding a large amount of labeled data for training. In simulations, Trucksim and Matlab were used to conduct co-simulation to verify the usefulness of the control method. The method was implemented on an autonomous semi-trailer truck for many outdoor scenes. The actual experimental results showed the validity and advantages of the proposed method.

AB The autonomous ground vehicle's successful navigation with a high level of performance is dependent on accurate state estimation, which may help in providing excellent decision-making, planning, and control tasks. Outside factors like air bias and multipath effects have an impact on the GPS data, obtaining accurate pose estimation remains challenging. To obtain a highly precise pose estimation, the authors propose using an end-to-end simultaneous localization and mapping architecture based on scan matching and an extended Kalman filter to perform a successful prediction using lidar, GNSS and IMU data sensor fusion. In terms of pose estimation efficiency, the obtained results from EKF are compared to the UKF filter in different sequences on the Kitti dataset to more thoroughly evaluate our designed approach. The EKF filter has a good improvement, with approximately 0.29, 0.31, 0.24, 0.34, and 0.27 of the mean RMSE error of the trajectories 09_30_drive_0018, 09_30_drive_0020, 09_30_drive_0027, 10_03_drive_0033, and 10_03_drive_0034, respectively. The proposed approach was evaluated not only on KITTI dataset but also using our data recording platform called KONA Platform.

ID TORT-LIABILITY; FEDERALISM; COMPETITION
AB Autonomous vehicles are now driving people around in cities from San Francisco to Phoenix. But how to regulate the safety risks from these autonomous driving systems (ADS) remains uncertain. While state tort law has traditionally played a fundamental role in controlling car crash risks, this Note argues that the development of novel data tracking and simulation tools by the ADS industry has led to a regulatory paradigm shift: By leveraging these tools for regulatory analysis, the fedadapt and improve its regulatory standards after each crash. While many scholars have advanced proposals for how state products liability can adapt to ADS crashes, this Note is the first to propose such a model of "crash-adaptive regulation" for NHTSA and to show that this model will prove superior to tort liability in controlling ADS crash risks. In presenting this new regulatory model, this Note engages with two rich theoretical debates. First, it compares the efficacy of tort liability and agency regulation in controlling ADS crash risks. Second, it evaluates whether ADS safety standards should be set at the federal level or at the state level. It concludes that ADS' technical characteristics call for an agency regulatory scheme at the federal level and urges NHTSA to build the technological and operational expertise necessary to operate a crash-adaptive regulatory regime.

AB One of the primary tasks undertaken by autonomous vehicles (AVs) is object detection, which comes ahead of object tracking, trajectory estimation, and collision avoidance. Vulnerable road objects (e.g., pedestrians, cyclists, etc.) pose a greater challenge to the reliability of object detection operations due to their continuously changing behavior. The majority of commercially available AVs, and research into them, depends on employing expensive sensors. However, this hinders the development of further research on the operations of AVs. In this paper, therefore, we focus on the use of a lower-cost single-beam LiDAR in addition to a monocular camera to achieve multiple 3D vulnerable object detection in real driving scenarios, all the while maintaining real-time performance. This research also addresses the problems faced during object detection, such as the complex interaction between objects where occlusion and truncation occur, and the dynamic changes in the perspective and scale of bounding boxes. The video-processing module works upon a deep-learning detector (YOLOv3), while the LiDAR measurements are pre-processed and grouped into clusters. The output of the proposed system is objects classification and localization by having bounding boxes accompanied by a third depth dimension acquired by the LiDAR. Real-time tests show that the system can efficiently detect the 3D location of vulnerable objects in real-time scenarios.

AB The aim of the manuscript is to access whether the Rate of Collision Avoidance (RCA) will be improved by considering the pedestrian deceleration in the Pedestrian Autonomous Emergency Braking Systems (AEB-P). A vehicle braking method by considering the pedestrian deceleration was proposed firstly, and then through the Monte Carlo optimization algorithm optimal combinations of 7 input parameters were obtained by applying the method to 124 actual collisions, finally the single factor analysis method was used to explore the effects of each parameter on the RCA. Through observation from actual collisions, the interval of pedestrian deceleration was [0.1, 8.2]m/s(2) with a median value of 4.2 m/s(2) in an emergency. The optimal average value of the detection angle, the minimum detection distance, the lateral trigger distance, the pedestrian warning trigger distance, the lag time, the pedestrian deceleration and its reaction time is 60 degrees, 25 m, 3.5 m, 0 m, 0 s, -8 m/s(2) and 0 s, respectively. The maximum RCA = 84.68% was obtained based on optimal combinations. All analyses consistently found that the RCA increases as pedestrian deceleration increases. Results shown that we can consider pedestrian deceleration in the AEB-P to improve the performance of the system and subsequently improve the RCA.

DE automated valet parking; planning under uncertainty; replanning; utility
   theory
AB Autonomous driving helps drivers avoid paying attention to keeping to a lane or keeping a distance from the vehicle ahead. However, the autonomous driving is limited by the need to park upon the completion of driving. In this sense, automated valet parking (AVP) system is one of the promising technologies for enabling drivers to free themselves from the burden of parking. Nevertheless, the driver must continuously monitor the automated system in the current automation level. The main reason for monitoring the automation system is due to the limited sensor range and occlusions. For safety reasons, the current field of view must be taken into account, as well as to ensure comfort and to avoid unexpected and harsh reactions. Unfortunately, due to parked vehicles and structures, the field of view in a parking lot is not sufficient for considering new obstacles coming out of occluded areas. To solve this problem, we propose a method that estimates the risks for unobservable obstacles by considering worst-case assumptions. With this method, we can ensure to not act overcautiously while moving safe. As a result, the proposed method can be a proactive approach to consider the limited visibility encountered in a parking lot. In the proposed method, occlusion can be efficiently reflected in the planning process. The potential of the proposed method is evaluated in a variety of simulations.

ID OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM
AB This paper shows the planning of time-optimal trajectories, which allows an autonomous race car to drive at the handling limits, taking into account locally changing road friction values. For this purpose, the minimum lap time problem is described as an optimal control problem, converted to a nonlinear programme using direct orthogonal Gauss-Legendre collocation and then solved by the interior-point method IPOPT. Reduced computing times are achieved using a curvilinear abscissa approach for track description, algorithmic differentiation using the software framework CasADi, and a smoothing of the track input data by approximate spline regression. The vehicle's behaviour is approximated as a single track and double track model with quasi-steady state tyre load simplification and nonlinear tyre model. The results are used to evaluate which vehicle physics are important for the calculation of the time-optimal trajectory. The novelty of this work is the consideration of wheel-specific tyre-road friction coefficients along the racetrack using a track friction map. It is shown that variable friction coefficients have a significant impact on the trajectory, and therefore significantly improve lap times on inhomogenous racetracks. The proposed trajectory planning has proven its practical suitability in first tests on an autonomous race car and will be used in the coming racing season in the Roborace competition.

AB This paper describes design methods for the plastic hull of an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV), with a particular focus on its cylindrical body and nearly spherical domes at the ends. With the proposed approach, the methodologies reported in the literature were compared, and suitable modifications and improvements were investigated and implemented to extend the classical theories and data to this case study. The investigated underwater vehicle, named FeelHippo, was designed and assembled by the Department of Industrial Engineering of the University of Florence. Its main hull is composed of an extruded PMMA (PolyMethyl MethAcrylate) cylinder and two thermoformed PMMA domes. Breakage of the hull results in destructive phenomena, namely, yielding and buckling. An experimental campaign and FEM (Finite Element Method) analysis were carried out to complete the theoretical study, and the collapse pressures were compared with the derived design values. In conclusion, the proposed innovative method is a lean and effective technique for designing underwater hull domes and predicting the collapse pressures.

ID COLLISION-AVOIDANCE
AB Autonomous emergency braking (AEB) has drawn a lot of attention as an active safety system preventing rear-end collision avoidance when the relative speed between vehicles is slow. To increase the operation range of current AEB system, this paper suggests a collision avoidance strategy using steering and braking simultaneously with nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) method. The NMPC predicts the vehicle's future trajectory with its open-loop dynamics and calculates the error between the predicted and the desired paths. Then NMPC calculates the control inputs such as the wheel steering angle and vehicle acceleration by optimizing the cost function over future receding horizon with predetermined constraints. In this paper, constraints on the wheel steering angle is proposed in consideration of vehicle's predicted lateral acceleration, which should be smaller than the threshold in order to maintain lateral vehicle's stability. To verify the performance of the proposed strategy, two simulation scenarios were tested in MATLAB and CarSim simulation environments.

AB In recent years, a strong push towards driverless mobility solutions can be seen in many transportation sectors including railways. While the European Train Control System already specifies the necessary interfaces to open up the possibility of Automatic Train Operation (ATO) for mainline railway vehicles, required infrastructure-side upgrades of interlocking systems are time-and cost-intensive. Alternatively, a pure vehicle-side Automatic Train Operation solution can be conceptualized that relies on processing the same audio-visual input a human train driver would normally base his decisions on. This would require the vehicle-side detection of track-side railway signals to determine the vehicle's movement authority and allowed maximum speed. Such a signal detection system could furthermore be employed as an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) or support autonomous shunting operations. To enable such a system, this paper presents GERALD, a novel dataset for a neural network based detection approach of railway signals. The dataset contains 5000 images from a wide variety of railway scenes as well as annotations for the most common types of German mainline railway signals. The material was gathered using publicly available cab-view recordings uploaded by railway enthusiasts on YouTube. Using a state of the art neural network architecture for evaluation, we notice promising detection accuracies despite GERALD being a comparably small dataset. The dataset is freely available for research and non-commercial purposes at: https://github.com/ifs-rwth-aachen/ GERALD

AB Usage profiles of shared autonomous fleets will considerably differ from present-day privately owned vehicles. Thus, requirements on powertrain and other vehicle components are expected to change significantly. While there are still no real-world data available, automotive requirement engineering strongly depends on synthetic driving profiles, for example, forwarded by traffic simulation. These simulations, however, are quite challenging as they need to combine multi-modal, large-scale fleet simulations with microscopic traffic modeling to simultaneously produce realistic usage profiles and detailed driving cycles. We aim to combine the two open-source tools MATSim and SUMO to achieve this goal. As an important step in this endeavor, we analyze the consistency of both MATSim and SUMO with regard to traffic dynamics by means of three experiments with an increasing level of complexity: (i) analytically on a homogeneous road segment in the steady-state; (ii) numerically on a homogeneous road segment in the non-stationary state for a synthetic test case; and (iii) numerically for a highly non-linear medium-sized real-world test case in Berlin. We analyze the simulation results with respect to macroscopic flow-density-speed relations. In addition, we also study network impedances for the Berlin test case. We show that the traffic dynamics of MATSim and SUMO behave differently for the various test cases and discuss the implications on our tool-coupling efforts.

AB In recent years, there has been an increased interest in giving verbal commands to self-driving cars. Even though multiple companies have showcased progress towards fully autonomous vehicles, surveys have indicated that people are wary of relinquishing total control of the vehicle to the AI. Thus, a system allowing passengers to control the vehicle's actions would be preferable. Natural language, the most widespread form of communication among humans, presents itself as the most natural control interface, and survey results confirm that the ability to give verbal commands to self-driving vehicles would make the passengers more at ease. In this work, we propose a novel system that predicts which object is referred to by the issued command and the path the car should follow through the immediate surroundings to execute the command. We experiment with different approaches and features to predict the object of interest and show that our simple but effective approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. For predicting the trajectory, we propose a model that relies on a mixture density approach for modeling the distributions of key waypoints of the trajectory in the top-down scene layout. Additionally, we investigate the influence of the two tasks on each other and show that improvements in the prediction of the object of interest lead to improvements in the trajectory prediction task. Finally, we provide the research community with an extension to the Talk2Car dataset, with new trajectory annotations for given commands.

AB This paper proposes a coordinated tracking controller for a tractor-trailer to keep a desired distance and heading angle relative to a combine harvester for the autonomous unloading of harvested crops in automatic agriculture operations. A coordinate transformation and the prescribed performance control (PPC) technique are employed to develop a second-order Euler-Lagrange formulation of the tracking errors. Then, a neural adaptive saturated velocity observer-based controller is proposed to force that the trailer center is exactly placed under the end point of the harvester unloading tube to collect cereal grains. By an effective application of the PPC technique and computing a safe motion boundary, controller non-singularity, collision avoidance and connectivity between two vehicles are preserved continuously. The model uncertainties including unknown vehicle parameters, variable trailer mass and moment of inertia during the crop collection, surface friction, climate and crop conditions and external disturbances are compensated by an effective combination of a neural network and an adaptive robust control law. Lyapunov's direct method is employed to prove that the tracking errors are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded and converge to a neighborhood of the origin with a pre-specified maximum overshoot, convergence rate and steady-state accuracy. Finally, comparative simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller for the crop harvesting operations in a practical perspective.

AB This paper studies the three-dimensional path following control problem for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle in the presence of parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, an appropriate model for the error dynamics was established to solve the path following problem in a moving Serret-Frenet frame. Secondly, an adaptive robust control scheme is proposed through fuzzy logic theory, command filtered backstepping method and an adaptation mechanism. Finally, a suitable Lyapunov candidate function is utilized to verify the stability of the overall control system and demonstrate uniform ultimate boundedness of path following errors. Following novelties are highlighted in this study: (i) The fuzzy method is adopted to solve the problems of model uncertainties, which makes the controller more practical; (ii) to calculate the virtual control derivative, a second-order filter is designed. This reduces the computational effort of the standard backstepping technique. Moreover, the effect of high frequency measurement noise is considerably attenuated via an appropriate filter to attain a more robust control system. (iii) To attain a desired approximation accuracy between the virtual control and the filtered signals, a compensation loop containing the filtered error is established. (iv) An anti-windup design is proposed to solve the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. Finally, comparative simulations are performed to ensure that the presented control scheme has excellent following accuracy and good robustness under multiple uncertainties and external disturbances.

TI A Robust Localization Method for Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV)
   Navigation Using Fuzzy Adaptive Kalman Filtering

   fuzzy logic; multi-sensor data fusion
AB Recently, multi-sensor navigation has emerged as a viable approach in autonomous vehicles' development. Kalman filtering has been widely applied in multi-sensor data fusion, and researchers are trialing variants of the Kalman Filter (KF) to improve the operational robustness of vehicles in a range of environments under varying dynamic constraints. This paper proposes a novel sensor data fusion algorithm employing an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for the autonomous navigation of an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV). Since the navigational sensors on-board the USV are subject to operational uncertainties caused by equipment limitations and environmental disturbances, an improved UKF algorithm with the capability of adaptive estimation, namely fuzzy adaptive UKF data fusion algorithm, has been proposed to obtain reliable navigational information. The conventional UKF is capable of fusing a number of raw sensor measurements and generating relatively accurate estimations with proper a priori knowledge of system noise. To deal with systems that lack such information, a fuzzy adaptive estimation method is introduced to enhance the performance of the conventional UKF, making the algorithm capable of verifying and correcting the associated sensor noise in real time. The proposed fuzzy adaptive UKF data fusion algorithm has been tested and evaluated in different simulations modeled using practical maritime environments and the results are compared with the conventional UKF. The sensor measurements taken from a practical USV trial have also been applied to the proposed algorithm for further validation.

AB This paper presents a learning-based model predictive trajectory planning controller for automated driving in unstructured, dynamic environments with obstacle avoidance. We first address the problem of lacking prior knowledge in unstructured environments by introducing a risk map that maps the density and motion of obstacles and the road to an occupancy risk. Model predictive control is then used to integrate trajectory planning and tracking control into one framework to bridge the gap between planning and control. Meanwhile, we use Gaussian Process (GP) regression to learn the residual model uncertainty for improving the model accuracy. An objective function considering both risks within the feasible region and vehicle dynamics is carefully formulated to obtain collision-free and kinematically-feasible local trajectories. Field experiments are performed on real unstructured environments with our automated vehicle. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for successful obstacle avoidance in various complex unstructured scenarios.

AB Data dissemination and data collection to/from vehicles traveling on city roads are key features to fully enable the advent of Intelligent Transport Systems and Autonomous vehicles. Both Road Side Units and On Board Units need to disseminate different kind of data to vehicles or to collect data sensed by the vehicles themselves and transfer them to road monitoring and control centers. In this work we propose a protocol, named DISCOVER, that disseminates and collects the data of interest in a quite large city area efficiently and timely by using a single network structure, i.e., a multi-hop backbone made up only of vehicles nodes. DISCOVER is distributed and adaptive to the different traffic conditions, i.e., to the different levels of vehicular traffic density. Several numerical results show that it attains very good performance in different type of city maps (New York, Paris, Madrid and Rome) when compared with baseline approaches as well as when compared with a theoretical bound.

AB How to reduce traffic accidents and improve vehicle safety has always aroused widespread concern. Secondary and serial collision accidents can result in more serious hazards as the initial collision can easily destabilize a high-speed vehicle and the driver may fail to maintain effective control due to panic. With this in mind, a planning-integrated active safety control system is developed for post-impact vehicles to avoid subsequent accidents. The vehicle dynamics model is established considering the roll degree of freedom. The constraint equivalent methods based on the octagon and rhombus envelopes are proposed to linearize the road adhesion constraint and the obstacle avoidance constraint, respectively. A planning-integrated model predictive controller (MPC) is developed for post-impact vehicles to achieve the coordination of stability recovery and the avoidance of secondary collision with surrounding vehicles. In the meantime, an obstacle avoidance decision strategy based on the safe braking distance is designed to cope with different traffic scenes. Furthermore, a control allocator based on particle swarm optimization is developed to achieve the high-efficiency allocation of the resultant control output of MPC under post-impact extreme conditions. The proposed scheme is verified under comprehensive driving scenarios through hardware-in-loop tests.

AB In the future civilian Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) and military area, the Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) are supposed to replace humans to conduct various tasks in wide civilian or military applications. This paper aims at improving the overall performance of the All-wheel-independently-actuated (AWIA) UGV. Each wheel of the AWIA UGV is independently driven and steered by the motors with independent active suspension equipped to achieve the great potential of mobility, maneuverability, and controllability. Aiming to improve the performance of AWIA UGV in diagonal steering mode under critical circumstances, a novel integrated control approach is extended in this paper based on robust H-2/H-infinity theory. The major control objective is to generate additional vehicle active moment by full X-by-wire technique to collaboratively control lateral and roll motion of the vehicle to maintain a target diagonal steering performance. A wheel force distribution controller in the control executive layer interfaced to actuators is applied to achieve the resultant active control moment at each wheel corner, by controlling each independent drive motor, independent steer motor, and active suspension actuator. The effectiveness of the proposed control approach is validated by an AWIA UGV testbed by performing the stepsteer experiments.

AB In this study, a new joint formation combined with a two-part underwater towed vehicle (towfish) with multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) was investigated. A triangular structure formation was established based on graph theory, in which the main point is the secondary towed vehicle acting as the leader, and the other two points are AUVs acting as followers. The excellent real-time performance and high flexibility of the towfish is highlighted, and the communication delay and fixed routine of AUVs can be avoided simultaneously. As to the obstacle avoidance, the null-space-based behavioral approach is proposed. On the basis of this approach, the formation task moving to the target is decomposed into different subtasks, and the obstacle avoidance subtask is set as the highest priority. The vector of the low-level task is projected to the null space of the high-level task vector, and the integrated task output is used as the final output function. The low-level task is partially or completely accomplished while handling the higher task; therefore, the mutual conflict between different level targets can be avoided. Moreover, the corresponding task functions are designed in accordance with different subtask priorities. The comprehensive output function of formation motion is deduced and established to ensure that obstacles can be avoided effectively. Furthermore, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method in a complex underwater environment with obstacles.

AB Current advancements in waterborne autonomous systems, together with the development of cloud-based service-oriented architectures and the recent availability of low-cost underwater acoustic modems and long-range above-water wireless devices, enable the development of new applications to support ships and port activities. Autonomous surface vehicles can, for instance, be used to perform bathymetry and environmental data collection tasks to ensure under keel clearance and to monitor the quality of the water. Similarly, remotely operated vehicles can be deployed to inspect ship hulls and typical port infrastructure elements, such as quay and sheet pilling walls. In this article, we present the complete system deployed for the small-scale demonstrations of the Robotic Vessels as-a-Service project, which introduces an on-demand service-based cloud system that dispatches unmanned vehicles capable of performing the required service either autonomously or piloted. These vessels are able to interact with sensors deployed in the port and with the shore station through an integrated underwater and above-water network. The developed system has been validated through sea trials and showcased through an underwater sensor data collection use case. The results of the test presented in this article provide a proof of concept of the system design and indicate its technical feasibility. It also shows the need for further developments for a mature technology allowing on-demand robotic maritime assistance services in real operational scenarios.

AB War game simulations are decision-making tools that may provide quantitative data about the scenario analyzed by stakeholders. They are widely used to develop tactics and doctrines in the military context. Recently, unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) have become a relevant element in these simulations because of their prominent role in contemporary conflicts, surveillance missions, and search and rescue missions. For instance, it is possible to admit aircraft losses from a tactical formation in favor of the victory of a squadron in a given combat scenario. The optimization of the position of UAVs in beyond visual range (BVR) combat has attracted attention in the literature, considering that the distribution of UAVs can be a determining factor in this scenario. This work aims to optimize UAV tactical formations considering enemy uncertainties such as firing distance and position using six metaheuristics and a high-fidelity simulator. A tactical formation often employed by air forces called line abreast was chosen for the RED swarm for a case study. The objective of the optimization is to obtain a tactical formation of the BLUE swarm that wins the BVR combat against the RED swarm. A procedure to confirm the robustness of the optimization is employed, varying the position of each UAV of the RED swarm up to 8 km from its initial configuration and using the war game approach. A tactical analysis is performed to confirm whether the formations found in the optimization are applicable.

AB Understanding changing consumer needs is crucial for a company's survival. Particularly in the context of vehicle autonomy, customer insights lay a significant foundation for strategic decision-making of organizations in the automotive industry. This paper outlines how a German car manufacturer explored customer needs in the context of highly automated vehicles (AVs).(1) by implementing corporate foresight research with visionary customers and how the findings supported the strategic decision-making process of the firm.
   A qualitative pilot study with 29 visionary, trend-receiving customers from Germany, the USA and China identified three innovative use cases for premium highly AVs. A subsequent quantitative online survey with 733 participants from the same three markets confirms the relevance of the use cases for mainstream and innovative consumers. The findings underline that highly AVs are a game changer, transforming future cars into extended living and office spaces, with several implications for practitioners. The findings helped to adapt the organization's business model and branding strategy, provided valuable insights for follow-up studies and shaped corporate communication.
   The contribution of the paper is threefold: It introduces the concept of strategic customer foresight, outlines specifically how organizations can implement customer foresight research as well as how such research benefits the decision-making process of companies. Further, the paper discloses future customer needs in the context of premium highly AVs.

AB The Four Wheel Independent Steering/Driving (4WIS/4WID) electric vehicle has the advantage that the rotation angle and driving torque of each wheel can be independently and accurately controlled. In this paper, a trajectory tracking strategy based on the hierarchical control method is designed. In the path tracking layer, the nonlinear state feedback controller is used, and the neural network Proportion Integration Differentiation (NNPID) controller is designed to track the desired path and to obtain the desired yaw rate. By tracking the desired yaw rate and vehicle speed, the terminal sliding mode controller in vehicle dynamics control layer calculates the desired resultant tire force. In the tire force distribution layer, the multiple optimization objectives, including vehicle stability performance objective, energy-saving performance objective, and tire wear energy consumption objectives are determined and the weight coefficient is adaptive to different working conditions based on fuzzy logic theory. Finally, the wheel steering angle and driving torque of each wheel are calculated by the nonlinear three-degree-of-freedom vehicle model. Simulation results show that it realizes the adaptive control of tire force while tracking the desired trajectory, improves the stability and energy saving of the vehicle, and effectively reduces tire wear.

ID DIMENSIONAL OPTIMIZATION; POSE; UAV
AB Obstacle avoidance represents a fundamental challenge for unmanned aerial vehicle navigation. This is particularly relevant for low altitude flight, which is highly subjected to collisions, causing property damage or even compromise human safety. Autonomous navigation algorithms address this problem and are applied in various tasks. However, this approach is usually overshadowed by unreliable results in uncertain environments. In contrast, human pilots are able to maneuver vehicles in complex situations, in which an algorithm would no offer a reliable performance. This article explores a novel configuration of assisted flying and implements an experimental setup in order to prove its efficacy. The user controls an unmanned aerial vehicle with a force feedback device, where simultaneously an assisted navigation algorithm can manipulate this apparatus to divert the unmanned aerial vehicle from its path. Experiments confirm the authors' hypothesis that the unmanned aerial vehicle is deviated or maintains the same course at the operator's will. Unlike conventional controllers that dictate roll, pitch, and yaw, this implementation uses direct mapping between the position represented by the haptic device and the unmanned aerial vehicle. This configuration applies feedback before the unmanned aerial vehicle has reached the position referenced by the haptic device, providing valuable time for the user to make the necessary path correction.

The absorbed power is the parameter taken into account to establish the entire methodology, to see the impact of the off-road vehicle run on the driver health. The model for absorbed power determination is created in Simulink offering the possibility to be integrated with other software dedicated to vehicle modeling and simulation, not only TruckSim. Due to the low computer resources needed, the new model is very versatile for a driving simulator, for a hardware-in-the-loop scenario or for an autonomous system.

AB Trajectory prediction for traffic participants is a critical task for autonomous vehicles. The long-term trajectory prediction is challenging due to limited data and the dynamic characteristics of traffic participants. This paper presents an innovative interactive multiple model algorithm considering inter-vehicle interaction and driving behavior for the traffic participant's short-term and long-term trajectory prediction. The field experiment is conducted to acquire the human driver data, which is then preprocessed and analyzed with statistical methods. The clustering result of the critical gap is used to include the interactions between them, on which the gap satisfaction probability function is designed and aimed at describing the satisfaction probability of the current lane. The driving behavior is another promising candidate to improve the long-term prediction accuracy. The clustering results of the lane change duration are used to establish the lane changing models considering the driving behavior, the driving behavior probability function is designed based on the probability of each model. Then the two functions are incorporated into the adaptive transition probability matrix, where the quantitative probabilistic relations between the gap satisfaction probability and the driving behavior probability are established. The adaptive transition probability matrix is then used in the interactive multiple model algorithm. Based on the improved interactive multiple model, the personalized trajectory prediction for the traffic participant is obtained. The effectiveness of the framework is validated by simulation and field experiment.

AB High-level autonomous decision making system is one of the key technologies in intelligent transportation networks, it requires the traffic information within a certain range of vehicles in real time. When the traffic roads become congested or the roadside units (RSUs) are unaccessed beyond the communication range, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted vehicular edge computing network (VECN) is considered as a potential solution. In this paper, we propose a learning based channel allocation and task offloading strategy in temporary UAV-assisted VECNs from a user perspective, in which the UAV passing temporarily can serve as the relay and edge computing node to support the decision making system. However, the limited available computation resources and time-varying communication channel states make it critical to process the received computing tasks. To address the above mentioned challenges, we design an efficient data transmission strategy combined the long-term evolution vehicle-to-everything (LTE-V2X) and time-division multiple access (TDMA) technologies firstly, then, we propose a multi-option task processing scheme, a service cost minimization problem is proposed where the integral decisions of channel allocation and task processing mode selection are jointly optimized. Under dynamic computing resources and the current data transmission conditions, the UAV selects an optimal task processing service model based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. Simulation results show the proposed strategy greatly improves the data transmission efficiency.

AB Real-time detection of oncoming vehicle maneuvers at intersections is essential for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to plan safe paths and driving strategies. Most existing methods use supervised learning methods to construct behavior detection models and assume that most data have labels. Real data collected by the onboard sensor as a data stream is unstable, and there are outliers, concept drift, and evolution problems, potentially decreasing the detection accuracy. To this end, we propose a micro-cluster-based online adaptable (MCOA) approach. The framework consists of four parts: initial model construction, new class detection, classification using k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and online update. First, k-means clustering is performed on the maneuvering behavior data, and cluster features are derived to obtain a set of micro-clusters (MCs) to establish the initial model. Second, we analyze the instances stored in the data block to detect new classes and use the k-NN to classify the incoming instances. Finally, the model is updated online using an update strategy based on error-driven representative learning, a time-effect function, and a local decision boundary. A driving simulator is used to collect experimental data consisting of left turns (LT), right turns (RT), and going straight (GS) to establish and evaluate the model. The results show that the proposed model achieves higher detection accuracy for early-stage intersection maneuvers and has stronger adaptability to new classes than benchmark algorithms.

AB This paper presents a state-of-the-art tethered unmanned aerial vehicle (TUAV) for structural integrity assessment of underground stone mine pillars. The TUAV, powered by its tether, works in tandem with an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) that hosts the TUAV batteries, a self-leveled landing platform, and the tether management system. The UGV and the TUAV were named Rhino and Oxpecker, respectively, given that the TUAV stays landed on the UGV while the ensemble moves inside a mine. The mission of Oxpecker is to create, using a LiDAR sensor, 3D maps of the mine pillars to support time-lapse hazard mapping and time-dependent pillar degradation analysis. Given the height of the pillars (7-12 m), this task cannot be executed by Rhino alone. This paper describes the drone's hardware and software. The hardware includes the tether management system, designed to control the tension of the tether, and the tether perception system, which provides information that can be used for localization and landing in global navigation satellite systems (GNSS)-denied environments. The vehicle's software is based on a state machine that controls the several phases of a mission (i.e., takeoff, inspection, and landing) by coordinating drone motion with the tethering system. The paper also describes and evaluates our approach for tether-based landing and autonomous 3D mapping of pillars. We show experiments that illustrate and validate our system in laboratories and underground mines.

AB Model predictive control (MPC) is the mainstream method in the motion control of autonomous vehicles. However, due to the complex and changeable driving environment, the perturbation of vehicle parameters will cause the steady-state error problem, which will lead to the degradation of controller performance. In this paper, the offset-free MPC control method is proposed to solve the steady-state error problem systematically. The core idea of this method is to model the model mismatch, control input offset, and external disturbances as disturbance terms, then use filters to observe these disturbances and finally eliminate the influence of these disturbances on the steady-state error in the MPC solution stage. This paper uses the Kalman filter as an observer, which is integrated into our latest designed MPC solver. Based on state-of-the-art sparse quadratic programming (QP) solver operator splitting solver for quadratic programs (OSQP), an offset free model predictive control (OF-MPC) framework based on disturbance observation and MPC is formed. The proposed OF-MPC solver can efficiently deal with common model mismatch problems such as tire stiffness mismatch, steering angle offset, lateral slope disturbance, and so on. This framework is very efficient and completes all calculations in less than 7 ms when the horizon length is 50. The efficiency and robustness of the algorithm are verified on our newly designed robot operating system (ROS)-Unreal4-carsim real-time cosimulation platform and real vehicle experiments.

AB The marine environment is a hostile setting for robotics. It is strongly unstructured, uncertain, and includes many external disturbances that cannot be easily predicted or modeled. In this work, we attempt to control an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to perform a waypoint tracking task, using a machine learning-based controller. There has been great progress in machine learning (in many different domains) in recent years; in the subfield of deep reinforcement learning, several algorithms suitable for the continuous control of dynamical systems have been designed. We implemented the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, an entropy-regularized deep reinforcement learning algorithm that allows fulfilling a learning task and encourages the exploration of the environment simultaneously. We compared a SAC-based controller with a proportional integral derivative (PID) controller on a waypoint tracking task using specific performance metrics. All tests were simulated via the UUV simulator. We applied these two controllers to the RexROV 2, a six degrees of freedom cube-shaped remotely operated underwater Vehicle (ROV) converted in an AUV. We propose several interesting contributions as a result of these tests, such as making the SAC control and guiding the AUV simultaneously, outperforming the PID controller in terms of energy saving, and reducing the amount of information needed by the SAC algorithm inputs. Moreover, our implementation of this controller allows facilitating the transfer towards real-world robots. The code corresponding to this work is available on GitHub.

AB This article presents the modelling and simulation of the dynamic coupling in an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-manipulator system, used for subsea intervention tasks. Bond graph, a powerful tool in multi-domain dynamic system modelling, is used for the first time to model the coupled dynamics of the AUV-manipulator system. This method enables the development of the system model in a modular form by creating sub-system models and connecting these models together at energy interactions ports, thus overcoming many of the computational difficulties encountered in conventional modelling methods. The effects of gravity, buoyancy, added mass and fluid drag on the dynamics of a 3 degrees of freedom (DoF) manipulator mounted on a 6 DoF AUV are analysed. The manipulator trajectory errors due to the interaction forces and moments between the vehicle and the manipulator have also been investigated and the results are presented. The dynamic model predicts the reaction forces on the vehicle under various operating conditions of the manipulator and their influence on the manipulator trajectory. The percentage errors of manipulator tip trajectory for different initial configurations and operating conditions are analysed. The estimation of resulting errors in the manipulator path due to dynamic coupling effect on the manipulator trajectory helps in the design of suitable trajectory controller for the system. Cartesian space transpose Jacobian controller for trajectory control of manipulator has been implemented and results are presented.

AB This contribution (i) describes an open-source, physics-based simulation infrastructure that can be used to learn and test control policies in off-road navigation; and (ii) demonstrates the use of the simulation platform in an end-to-end learning exercise that relies on simulated sensor data fusion (camera, GPS and IMU). For (i), the 0.5 million lines of open-source code support vehicle dynamics (wheeled/tracked vehicles, rovers), deformable & non-deformable terrains, and virtual sensing. The library has a Python API for interfacing with existing Machine Learning frameworks. For (ii), we use a Gator off-road vehicle to demonstrate how a policy learned on non-deformable terrain performs when used in hilly conditions while navigating around a course of randomly placed obstacles on deformable terrain. The hilly terrain covers an 80 x 80 m patch and the soil can be controlled by the user to assume various behavior, e.g. non-deformable, deformable hard (silt-like), deformable soft (snow-like), etc. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other open-source, physics-based engine that can be used to simulate off-road mobility of autonomous agents operating on deformable terrains.

ID PULSE POSITION MODULATION
AB Crosstalk is the main challenge for active collision avoidance LIDAR. Conventional strategy on static discrimination threshold and unified number of accumulated pulses is not valid against crosstalk with varying number of sources and varying intensity. This paper presents an adaptive strategy to distinguish the target echo from dynamic crosstalk with unknown intensity in the scenario of intelligent vehicles and autonomous ground vehicles. The adaptive strategy is theoretically and experimentally verified to have much better performance on dynamic crosstalk than conventional strategy, and the detection rate is enhanced by 82.4% as well.

AB This paper proposes an algorithm for autonomous strategic mission planning of missions where multiple unhabitated underwater vehicles (UUVs) cooperate in order to solve one or more mission tasks. Missions of this type include multi-agent reconnaissance missions and multi-agent mine sweeping missions. The mission planning problem is posed as a receding horizon mixed-integer constrained quadratic optimal control problem. This problem is subsequently partitioned into smaller subproblems and solved in a parallel and decentralized manner using a distributed Nash-based game approach. The paper presents the development of the proposed algorithm and discusses its properties. An application example is used to further demonstrate the main characteristics of the proposed method.

AB The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors affecting the acceptance and use of autonomous public transport systems (APTS) by potential users. To achieve this, an integrated and expanded user acceptance model is introduced to explain the factors affecting behavioral intention to use APTS. A total of 316 surveys were conducted from 275 participants online and 41 participants by face-to-face interviews. With data acquired from public transportation (PT) users in Istanbul, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) model is modified and performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, he-donic motivation, price value, habit, trust and safety, perceived usefulness, perceived risk, and behavioral in-tention constructs are utilized in the model. Age, gender, and frequency of PT usage are included in the model to examine the moderating effect on the constructs while the model is tested with structural equation modeling (SEM). The proposed model explains 72% of the variances in this study, which proves that the model has stronger predictive power compared with the previous technology acceptance model (TAM) and UTAUT model. Performance expectancy, social influence, habit, and trust and safety constructs are concluded to have significant positive effects on behavioral intention. Public usage and acceptance are necessary for the complete utilization of APTS. The findings of this study can guide decision makers in the PT industry by helping them understand the factors affecting the use and acceptance of autonomous public transport systems.

AB This study presents a vehicle-level distributed coordination strategy to control a mixed traffic stream of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and connected human-driven vehicles (CHVs) through signalized intersections. We use CAVs as mobile traffic controllers during a newly introduced "white phase ", during which CAVs will negotiate the right-of-way to lead a group of CHVs while CHVs must follow their immediate front vehicle. The white phase will not be activated under low CAV penetration rates, where vehicles must wait for green signals. We have formulated this problem as a distributed mixed-integer non-linear program and developed a methodology to form an agreement among all vehicles on their trajectories and signal timing parameters. The agreement on trajectories is reached through an iterative process, where CAVs update their trajectory based on shared trajectory of other vehicles to avoid collisions and share their trajectory with other vehicles. Additionally, the agreement on signal timing parameters is formed through a voting process where the most voted feasible signal timing parameters are selected. The numerical experiments indicate that the proposed methodology can efficiently control vehicle movements at signalized intersections under various CAV market shares. The introduced white phase reduces the total delay by 3.2% to 94.06% compared to cooperative trajectory and signal optimization under different CAV market shares in our tests. In addition, our numerical results show that the proposed technique yields reductions in total delay, ranging from 40.2% -98.9%, compared to those of a fully-actuated signal control obtained from a state-of-practice traffic signal optimization software.

AB Driver assistance control in the cut-in scenarios is challenging, since the controller needs to ensure driving safety and avoid unnecessary intervention, while considering the inter-action with surrounding vehicles. This paper proposes an optimal driver assistance con-troller considering the social behaviors of the surrounding vehicles to assist the drivers in the cut-in scenarios. To model the social behavior of the surrounding vehicle, we first for-mulate the interaction between the semi-autonomous vehicle and the surrounding vehicle as a misinformation game, which is achieved by assuming the surrounding vehicle is in-teracting with a hypothetical vehicle under the framework of non-cooperative game. Then, adaptive dynamic programming theory is utilized to find the Nash equilibrium, which is represented by deep neural networks and solved iteratively. Based on the established so-cial behavior model and the nonlinear driver-vehicle dynamic model, an affine input non-linear system model is obtained for the design of driver assistance controller, and the op-timal assistance control strategy is also derived under the structure of adaptive dynamic programming. Several numerical simulations and driver-in-the-loop simulator experiments are conducted for validation. Results show that the proposed strategy can assist the driver in the cut-in scenario while addressing different social interactions with the surround-ing vehicles. Importantly, by taking into account the surrounding vehicle's social behavior through our established social behavior model, our proposed strategy significantly outper-forms the no-interaction strategy both in terms of driving safety and intervention degree, validating its effectiveness and superiority.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB While automation in public transport has gained new momentum in recent decades, the Autonomous Train (AT) is still in its infancy. To guide the deployment of the AT, it is necessary to study its acceptability by the public. The aim of this study was to investigate for the first time the factors that influence the acceptability of the AT. This qualitative study comprised interviews divided into 3 parts. The first part was devoted to free evocation of the AT, while the following ones asked participants to express themselves on the definition of the AT without a driver but with on-board staff (GoA3) and then without any staff on board (GoA4). Thirty participants were interviewed. The sample was balanced in age, gender, train usage, and living location. The semi-structured interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed according to the method of thematic content analysis. Overall, the results showed a lack of knowledge and an idealized representation of the AT. Participants expressed several concerns inherent in the deployment of ATs. Lastly, the intention to use was more favourable in GoA3 than in GoA4. In fact, the participants expressed rejection of GoA4, due to the absence of on-board staff and lack of trust in remote communication tools and train supervisors. This article is the first to explore the public acceptability of the AT by adopting an interview methodology to avoid priming participants' responses. It thus adds to the field of research on the acceptability of autonomous vehicles the railway world which previously focused on driverless subway and freight trains only and now opens the idea of AT on a regular train service.

AB Public transport lines, especially train lines, have historically played an important role as economic lifelines of rural areas. They are one of the most important factors contributing to economic prosperity as they provide access to mobility for all the inhabitants of these regions. Maintaining such rural public transport lines can be a challenge due to the low utilization inherent to rural areas. Today, with the emergence of fully self-driving cars, on-demand mobility schemes in which autonomous robotic taxis transport passengers, are becoming possible. In this work, we analyze if rural public transport lines with low utilization can be replaced with autonomous mobility-on-demand systems. More specifically, we compare the existing public transportation infrastructure to hypothetical mobility-on-demand systems both in terms of cost and service level. We perform our analysis, which focuses on the operational aspects, using a simulation approach in which unit-capacity robotic taxis are operated in a street network taking into account congestion effects and state-of-the-art control (dispatching and rebalancing) strategies. Our study considers the case of four rural train lines in Switzerland that operate at low utilization and cost coverage. We show that a unit-capacity mobility-on-demand service with self-driving cars reduces both travel times and operational cost in three out of four cases. In one case, even a service with human driven vehicles would provide higher service levels at lower cost. The results suggest that centrally coordinated mobility-on-demand schemes could be a very attractive option for rural areas.

AB The situation in which a vehicle has to avoid a collision with an obstacle can be difficult to realise in optimum conditions when the roads are crowded. This paper uses the advantages of vehicle grouping and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, and proposes a control architecture, which ensures a safe merging between the vehicles from two platoons. The architecture is formed by three layers, with the following tasks: i) to analyse the environment and to decide the best action for a certain vehicle, ii) to plan the new trajectory, and iii) to follow it at an imposed velocity or distance to the vehicle in front. The vehicles are equipped with a trajectory planner designed using two methods: the first one is based on a polynomial equation, and the second one is based on the model predictive control (MPC) algorithm. Each vehicle is also equipped with a trajectory follower, which has a cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) functionality based on a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) formulation. Also, the paper proposes a solution to compensate the data-packet-dropouts that are induced by the wireless communication network used to exchange information between vehicles. Moreover, to accommodate various realistic scenarios in the same control framework, the cost function for the DMPC algorithm was designed to take into account different communication topologies. The proposed architecture was tested in a simulation scenario, in which two platoons have to merge in order to avoid a fixed obstacle and the results show its efficiency.

AB Raising parking charges is a measure that restricts the use of private vehicles. With the introduction of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), the demand for parking has the potential to reduce as CAVs may not park at 'pay to park' areas as they are able to "cruise" or return home. However, it might not be financially feasible for them to return to their origin if the destination region is far away. Therefore, the question is: how could we develop parking policies in the CAVs era? To determine the best parking strategy for CAVs, four scenarios were tested in this paper: (i) enter and park within the destination area, (ii) enter, drop off, and return to the origin, (iii) enter, drop off, and return to outside parking and (iv) enter and drive around. Since real-world parking demand data for CAVs are not available, a simulation model of the road network in Santander (Spain) was employed to collect data on both CAV operations (e.g., conservative versus aggressive behaviors) and parking choices. Multinomial logistic regression model was used to identify the best parking option for CAVs. Performance indicators such as traffic, emissions, and safety were employed to compare the performance of a range of parking alternatives. It was found that the balanced scenario (i.e., combination of all parking choices) performs better with the greatest change in delay (around 32%). With 100% CAV market penetration, traffic crashes were reduced by 67%. This study will help local authorities formulate parking policies so that CAVs can park efficiently.

AB Recent years have witnessed a remarkable growth of micro aerial vehicle (MAV) technologies, which are desirable for many applications, e.g., warehouse inventory management and home entertainment. These indoor needs significantly improve work efficiency while posing fundamental challenges in the design of MAV state estimation. The state includes a vehicle's position, orientation, and velocity, which are fundamental to guide the motor control and adjust that vehicle's actions in autonomous flight. Existing vision-based solutions only work in well-lit texture-rich environments, while laser-based solutions are limited to MAVs' payload and budget. This paper presents WiSion, a robust and low-cost state estimator that leverages ubiquitous WiFi to estimate six-degree-of-freedom states for MAVs. Our observation is that the multipath of WiFi conceals a wealth of information about a vehicle's state, which helps combat the temporal drift of inertial sensors for smooth state estimation. We realize WiSion by an absolute-relative WiFi sensing module and a WiFi-inertial state estimation module. It works without knowing access points' (APs') positions. We implement the prototype with off-the-shelf products and conduct experiments in indoor venues. Our results show that WiSion achieves the position error of 35.25 cm and the attitude error of 2.6(?) with a maximum linear velocity of 1.74 m/s. More-over, WiSion can recover APs' positions and is robust to indoor hindrances such as obstacles and multipath.

AB Multi-sensor fusion for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) is an important issue for autonomous navigation of USVs. In this paper, an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed for real-time autonomous navigation of a USV in real maritime environment. To overcome the conventional PSO's inherent shortcomings, such as easy occurrence of premature convergence and human experience-determined parameters, and to enhance the precision and algorithm robustness of the solution, this work proposes three optimization strategies: linearly descending inertia weight, adaptively controlled acceleration coefficients, and random grouping inversion. Their respective or combinational effects on the effectiveness of path planning are investigated by Monte Carlo simulations for five TSPLIB instances and application tests for the navigation of a self-developed unmanned surface vehicle on the basis of multi-sensor data. Comparative results show that the adaptively controlled acceleration coefficients play a substantial role in reducing the path length and the linearly descending inertia weight help improve the algorithm robustness. Meanwhile, the random grouping inversion optimizes the capacity of local search and maintains the population diversity by stochastically dividing the single swarm into several subgroups. Moreover, the PSO combined with all three strategies shows the best performance with the shortest trajectory and the superior robustness, although retaining solution precision and avoiding being trapped in local optima require more time consumption. The experimental results of our USV demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method for real-time navigation based on multi-sensor fusion.

AB In this study, a method for the generation of tracking trajectory points, detection and positioning of obstacles in agricultural fields have been presented. Our principal contribution is to produce traceable GPS trajectories for agricultural vehicles to be utilized by path planning algorithms, rather than a new path planning algorithm. The proposed system works with minimal initialization requirements, specifically, a single geographical coordinate entry of an agricultural field. The automation of agricultural plantation requires many aspects to be addressed, many of which have been covered in previous studies. Depending on the type of crop, different agricultural vehicles may be used in the field. However, regardless of their application, they all follow a specified trajectory in the field. This study takes advantage of satellite images for the detection and positioning of obstacles, and the generation of GPS trajectories in the agricultural realm. A set of image processing techniques is applied in Matlab for detection and positioning.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL
AB This paper deals with automatic control design for automotive driving with a special focus on the longitudinal control. The automotive vehicle is a complex system characterised by highly nonlinear longitudinal and lateral coupled dynamics. Consequently, the control design for automated driving should deal with both of these dynamic couplings. Indeed, the longitudinal control plays an important role in the automated guidance to ensure safety and comfort of automotive passengers. In this work, a nonlinear cascade longitudinal control based on inner and outer-loops design is proposed. The lateral control is handled following a model predictive approach ensuring the automated steering of the vehicle. Finally, the nonlinear longitudinal control is integrated with the lateral control in a whole architecture to perform a coupled longitudinal and lateral control. The effectiveness of the automated driving strategy is highlighted through simulation results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Three flights are planned, two at Mach 7 and one at Mach 10. The research vehicles will be boosted to the prescribed scramjet engine test point, where they will separate from the booster, stabilize, and initiate engine test. Following more than 5 s of powered flight and 15 s of cowl-open tares, the cowl will close, and the vehicle will fly a controlled deceleration trajectory, which includes numerous control doublets for in-flight aerodynamic parameter identification. The preflight testing activities, wind-tunnel models, test rationale, risk reduction activities, and sample results from wind-tunnel tests supporting the flight trajectory from hypersonic engine test point through subsonic flight termination are reviewed.

AB In this paper, two novel approaches to unmanned underwater vehicle path planning are presented. The main idea of the first approach, referred to as Constrained Optimisation (CO) is to represent the free space of the workspace as a set of inequality constraints using vehicle configuration variables. The second approach converts robot path planning into a Semi-infinite Constrained Optimisation (SCO) problem. The function interpolation technique is adopted to satisfy the start and goal configuration requirements. Mathematical foundations for Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG), Boolean operations and approximation techniques are also presented to reduce the number of constraints, and to avoid local minima. The advantages of these approaches are that the mature techniques developed in optimisation theory which guarantee convergence, efficiency and numerical robustness can be directly applied to the robot path planning problem. Simulation results have been presented.

AB The paper investigates the impacts and barriers posed by connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) for pedestrians with visual impairment. This study uses a customized web-based survey of visually impaired people from Canada and abroad. Collected data are used to estimate econometric models to identify the critical factors that affect the level of trust in CAVs and the preference for using CAVs from the visually impaired individuals' perspective. Separate models are estimated for Canadian and non-Canadian samples, as Canadian and non-Canadian participants show some differences in perception and positive attitude towards CAVs. The models reveal that the majority of the respondents prefer to get feedback and alerts from CAVs. Congenitally blind Canadians are less likely to trust CAVs, but non-Canadian congenital blinds tend to trust CAVs. The models also indicate that the respondents who experienced being near an accident with an electric vehicle (EV) are less likely to choose CAVs. Respondents who rely on mobile applications and technology-based devices for navigating purposes tend to trust CAVs. Blind people who rely on conventional navigation tools (e.g., white cane, guide dog, etc.) are less likely to be the users of CAVs. Gender effect is visible, as the female participants tend not to trust CAVs. In relation to policy recommendations, subsidies should be provided to various advocacy groups to offer orientation and mobility (O&M) training services, which are pivotal to educate how to use technology-based navigational services. Also, automobile manufacturers should be enforced to add acoustic vehicle alert systems (AVAS) to both EVs and CAVs.

TI Real-time visual sensing for task planning in a field navigation vehicle
SO REAL-TIME IMAGING
LA English
DT Article
AB Some agricultural tasks consist of applying chemical treatment to the crops, but the products are applied throughout the field in most cases. In order to automate these tasks, and to apply the products more accurately, an autonomous vehicle can be used. The vehicle is intended to navigate autonomously through a field where plants are arranged in rows, following the crop rows. Its main sensor is a camera which takes perspective images of the area close to and in front of the vehicle. The vehicle is equipped with a treating device consisting of a bar with 30 spray nozzles. When the plants, which have been identified at some distance in front of the vehicle, reach the position of the treating device, the nozzles which are over a plant are switched on, thus applying the treatment. The typical vehicle speed is 1 m/s and the video frame rate is 10 Hz. A distributed system, consisting of several processors interconnected by serial links, is used, where each module accomplishes a different task: vehicle control, guidance information, image segmentation, map building and nozzle switching. The work explained in this paper is mainly focused on the latter parts of the system, map building and nozzle switching, and stresses the methods used to fit the time requirements. Real-time performance is achieved. Some results and time measurements are given. (C) 1998 Academic Press Limited.

AB With the development of artificial intelligence and integrated sensor technologies, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are more and more applied in the air combats. A bottleneck that constrains the capability of UAVs against manned vehicles is the autonomous maneuver decision, which is a very challenging problem in the short-range air combat undergoing highly dynamic and uncertain maneuvers of enemies. In this paper, an autonomous maneuver decision model is proposed for the UAV short-range air combat based on reinforcement learning, which mainly includes the aircraft motion model, one-to-one short-range air combat evaluation model and the maneuver decision model based on deep Q network (DQN). However, such model includes a high dimensional state and action space which requires huge computation load for DQN training using traditional methods. Then, a phased training method, called "basic-confrontation", which is based on the idea that human beings gradually learn from simple to complex is proposed to help reduce the training time while getting suboptimal but efficient results. Finally, one-to-one short-range air combats are simulated under different target maneuver policies. Simulation results show that the proposed maneuver decision model and training method can help the UAV achieve autonomous decision in the air combats and obtain an effective decision policy to defeat the opponent.

AB An auxiliary power module in electric vehicles is a dc/dc converter bridging the high-voltage propulsion battery with a low-voltage auxiliary system. In the coming era of connected and autonomous vehicles, the power rating of such dc/dc converters is expected to surge from 2.5 to 6 kW. In addition, there is the challenge of a wide operating voltage range, e.g., 250-450 V required by the high-voltage propulsion battery and 10-16 V at the low-voltage auxiliary battery. To meet these voltage and power challenges, this article proposes a two-stage bidirectional design, i.e., interleaved buck + dc transformer (DCX) that offers full voltage range coverage, 3.5 kW rated power, and peak power of >6 kW. Experimental results indicated >96% efficiency, owing to the zero-switching loss of DCX. Furthermore, the precharge mode that charges the input dc-bus capacitor with the low-voltage battery is accomplished using the inner phase shift control of the DCX stage. DC-bias blocking capacitors on the low-voltage side are replaced with a simple, unique dc-bias detection circuit that samples and eliminates the dc-current offset of the transformer. Simulation and test results confirm that the proposed method effectively detects and eliminates the dc-bias current.

AB A non-conservative robust Kalman filter (NCRKF) is applied to flight data to identify the aerodynamic derivatives of an unmanned autonomous vehicle (UAV). The NCRKF is formulated using UAV lateral motion data and then compared with results from the conventional Kalman filter (KF) and the recursive least square (RLS) method. A superior performance for the NCRKF is demonstrated by simulation and real flight data. The NCRKF is especially effective in large uncertainties in vehicle modeling and in measuring flight data. Thus, it is expected to be useful in missile and aircraft parameter identification.

AB In this article, we present an efficient planning system for automated vehicles in highly interactive environments (EPSILON). EPSILON is an efficient interaction-aware planning system for automated driving, and is extensively validated in both simulation and real-world dense city traffic. It follows a hierarchical structure with an interactive behavior planning layer and an optimization-based motion planning layer. The behavior planning is formulated from a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), but is much more efficient than naively applying a POMDP to the decision-making problem. The key to efficiency is guided branching in both the action space and observation space, which decomposes the original problem into a limited number of closed-loop policy evaluations. Moreover, we introduce a new driver model with a safety mechanism to overcome the risk induced by the potential imperfectness of prior knowledge. For motion planning, we employ a spatio-temporal semantic corridor (SSC) to model the constraints posed by complex driving environments in a unified way. Based on the SSC, a safe and smooth trajectory is optimized, complying with the decision provided by the behavior planner. We validate our planning system in both simulations and real-world dense traffic, and the experimental results show that our EPSILON achieves human-like driving behaviors in highly interactive traffic flow smoothly and safely without being overconservative compared to the existing planning methods.

This paper develops traversability classifiers for the three-dimensional (3D) point clouds acquired by the mobile robot Andabata on non-slippery solid ground. To this end, different supervised learning techniques from the Python library Scikit-learn are employed. Training and validation are performed with synthetic 3D laser scans that were labelled point by point automatically with the robotic simulator Gazebo. Good prediction results are obtained for most of the developed classifiers, which have also been tested successfully on real 3D laser scans acquired by Andabata in motion.

AB In a platoon of connected vehicles, time headway plays an important role in both traffic capacity and road safety. It is desirable to maintain a lower time headway while satisfying string stability in a platoon, since this leads to a higher traffic capacity and guarantees the disturbance attenuation ability. In this paper, we study a multiple-predecessor following strategy to reduce time headway via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. We first introduce a new definition of desired inter-vehicle distances based on the constant time headway (CTH) policy, which is suitable for general communication topologies. By exploiting lower-triangular structures in a time headway matrix and an information topology matrix, we derive a set of necessary and sufficient conditions on feedback gains for internal asymptotic stability. Further, by analyzing the stable region of feedback gains, a necessary and sufficient condition on time headway is also obtained for the string stability specification. It is proved that a platoon can be asymptotically stable and string stable when the time headway is lower bounded. Moreover, this bound can be reduced by increasing the number of predecessors. These results explicitly highlight the benefits of V2V communication on reducing time headway for platooning of connected vehicles.

AB Modern vehicles, including connected vehicles and autonomous vehicles, nowadays involve many electronic control units connected through intravehicle networks (IVNs) to implement various functionalities and perform actions. Modern vehicles are also connected to external networks through vehicle-to-everything technologies, enabling their communications with other vehicles, infrastructures, and smart devices. However, the improving functionality and connectivity of modern vehicles also increase their vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks targeting both intravehicle and external networks due to the large attack surfaces. To secure vehicular networks, many researchers have focused on developing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that capitalize on machine learning methods to detect malicious cyber-attacks. In this article, the vulnerabilities of intravehicle and external networks are discussed, and a multitiered hybrid IDS that incorporates a signature-based IDS and an anomaly-based IDS is proposed to detect both known and unknown attacks on vehicular networks. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed system can detect various types of known attacks with 99.99% accuracy on the CAN-intrusion-dataset representing the IVN data and 99.88% accuracy on the CICIDS2017 data set illustrating the external vehicular network data. For the zero-day attack detection, the proposed system achieves high F1-scores of 0.963 and 0.800 on the above two data sets, respectively. The average processing time of each data packet on a vehicle-level machine is less than 0.6 ms, which shows the feasibility of implementing the proposed system in real-time vehicle systems. This emphasizes the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed IDS.

AB Adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles are proving to be the first generation of driver-assist enabled vehicles. In order to study the impacts of ACC vehicles on string stability and traffic flow characteristics, accurately calibrating microscopic car following models is crucial to simulate inter-vehicle dynamics. While many car following models have been used to simulate car following behavior, a single, continuous function may not describe both acceleration and braking realistically. We propose an asymmetric model which is based on the symmetric optimal velocity relative velocity (OVRV) model and switch parameters under different conditions to realize and reproduce car following dynamics of ACC vehicles. We conduct an analytical string stability analysis and the string stability criterion is derived. The calibration and simulation results show that the proposed asymmetric ACC model reduces model spacing error by up to 38% compared with the symmetric OVRV model. Compared with other commonly used asymmetric car following models in the transportation community, the proposed asymmetric ACC model can reduce spacing error by 44.8%. Furthermore, we validate the derived string stability criterion with a numerical test simulating with a string of vehicles. We conclude that an asymmetric car following model shows more accurate performance in the capture of ACC car following behavior.

AB In the conventional human driving environment, due to poor traffic information transmission and the inability to actively control vehicles, variable speed limits (VSLs) and ramp metering (RM) strategies often fail to achieve the desired results when dealing with the merging zone of an expressway under high traffic demand. To improve traffic efficiency, an integrated control method for traffic flow in the merging area of expressways is proposed by combining connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) active lane change (LC) technology with traditional VSL and entrance RM strategies. This method uses an upgraded cell transmission model (CTM) to estimate the state of the mainline and ramp input traffic volume and then uses the genetic algorithm (GA) to solve for the optimal combination of the mainline speed limit, number of mainline vehicles changing lanes, and ramp regulation under maximized flow in the merging zone. This integrated control strategy incorporating VSL, LC, and RM (VSL-LC-RM) enables synergistic control of the mainline and ramp traffic entering the merging zone in time-space. Finally, simulation experiments are conducted with the mainline two-lane and on-ramp single-lane expressway merging zone scenarios. The results show that compared with the VSL strategy and the strategy incorporating only VSL and RM (VSL-RM), the proposed VSL-LC-RM strategy can enhance the regulation of traffic flow, improve the flow of merging bottlenecks, and make full use of the road space-time resources.

AB Unmanned vehicles are gaining the attention of professional operators and the general public. The implementation of unmanned vehicles is evident in, among other fields, emergency management, agriculture, traffic monitoring, post-disaster operations, and delivery of goods. Naturally, a group of unmanned vehicles can cooperatively complete operations more proficiently than a single vehicle. However, several issues must be resolved before a stable and reliable group of unmanned vehicles can be generally deployed to solve tasks in civil infrastructures and in industrial facilities. Here, a framework for the guidance of a fleet of unmanned surface vehicles is proposed. The framework utilizes several levels of control, namely Global Planning Level, Local Planning Level, and Low-Level Control. While the individual vehicles are completely autonomous in their operational locomotion and obstacle avoidance (low-level control and local planning), the task assignment for each vehicle (or group of them) is provided by a global planning process, based on the genetic algorithm. The framework provides a concept to solve complex tasks for the fleet of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). This includes, but is not necessarily limited to, a dynamically changing environment, different types of USVs with special abilities, multiple types of areal restrictions and obstacles, different restrictions for individual USVs, cooperation of multiple USVs to solve their subtasks, energy consumption optimization, etc. The framework can be advantageously applied to tasks such as warehouse logistics, surface maintenance, area exploration, etc. At the end of the study, the application of the framework is presented using a simulated example of cooperative problem solving using six vehicles.

AB The uncertainty of the odometry position estimate for a given vehicle can be obtained from the definition of the covariance matrix by using its kinematic model as well as its sensory system data. This communication item extends a previous work in [1] by giving the appropriate guidelines so as to compute the cross-covariance terms between the previous position estimate and the actual increments of position. This is necessary in general because the orientation errors on the robot's previous position will affect the calculation of the actual increments of position.

That UAV's entering into the spiral is such a typical safety issue. To solve this safety problem, a novel recovery control approach is proposed. First, the factors of spiral are analyzed. Then, based on control scheduling of state variables and nonlinear dynamic inversion control laws, the spiral recovery controller is designed to accomplish guidance and control of spiral recovery. Finally, the simulation results have illustrated that the proposed control method can ensure the UAV autonomous recovery from spiral effectively.

AB Guidance and control technology is recognized as an important aspect of the military, civil, and commercial goal of reliable, low-cost, aircraft-type operations into space. Here, several guidance and control methods are extended to enable integration into a single fully adaptive guidance and control system that offers a high degree of mission flexibility, fault tolerance, and autonomy. This paper summarizes the guidance and control system and several research issues related to use of adaptive guidance and control in reusable launch vehicles. Results that demonstrate the ability of the integrated system to plan and fly abort trajectories are also presented.

TI YOLOv4-5D: An Effective and Efficient Object Detector for Autonomous

DT Article
DE Autonomous driving; CSPDarknet53; object detection; Pruning; YOLOv4
AB The use of object detection algorithms has become extremely important in autonomous vehicles. Object detection at high accuracy and a fast inference speed is essential for safe autonomous driving. Therefore, the balance between the effectiveness and efficiency of the object detector must be considered. This article proposes a one-stage object detection framework for improving the detection accuracy while supporting a true real-time operation based on the YOLOv4. The backbone network in the proposed framework is the CSPDarknet53_dcn(P). The last output layer in the CSPDarknet53 is replaced with deformable convolution to improve the detection accuracy. In order to perform feature fusion, a new feature fusion module PAN++ is designed and five scales detection layers are used to improve the detection accuracy of small objects. In addition, this article proposes an optimized network pruning algorithm to solve the problem that the real-time performance of the algorithm cannot be satisfied due to the limited computing resources of the vehicle-mounted computing platform. The method of sparse scaling factor is used to improve the existing channel pruning algorithm. Compared to the YOLOv4, the YOLOV4-5D improves the mean average precision by 4.23% on the BDD data sets and 1.68% on the KITTI data sets. Finally, by pruning the model, the inference speed of YOLOV4-5D is increased 31.3% and the memory is only 98.1 MB when the detection accuracy is almost unchanged. Nevertheless, the proposed algorithm is capable of real-time detection at faster than 66 frames/s (fps) and shows higher accuracy than the previous approaches with a similar fps.

AB A growing literature suggests that widespread travel conducted through driverless connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) accessed as a service, in contrast to those personally owned, could have significant impacts on the sustainability of urban transportation. However, it is unclear how the general public currently considers willingness to travel in driverless vehicles, and if they would be more comfortable doing so in one personally owned or one accessed as a service. To address this, we collected travel survey data by intercepting respondents on discretionary or social trips to four popular destinations in a medium-size U.S. city in the spring of 2017. After collecting data on how the respondent reached the survey site and the trip's origin and destination, survey administrators then asked if respondents would have been willing to make their current trip in either a personally-owned driverless vehicle or through a driverless vehicle service. Over one-third expressed willingness to use both forms, while 31% were unwilling to use either. For those that considered only one, slightly more favored the personally-owned model. Consideration of an existing mobility service was consistently a positive and significant predictor of those that expressed willingness to travel in a driverless vehicle, while traveling downtown negatively and significantly influenced consideration of at least one form of driverless vehicle. These findings highlight the diverse public views about the prospect of integration of CAVs in transportation systems and raise questions about the assumption that travelers to central city locations would be early adopters of automated vehicle mobility services.

DE Semi-autonomous truck platooning; vehicle routing and scheduling; driver
   dispatching; labor and energy cost; lagrangian relaxation
AB Semi-autonomous truck platooning, a futuristic and promising traveling mode of trucks on highways, has received extensive attention as autonomous driving gains more maturity. Under the semi-autonomous platooning mode, rather than requiring a human driver for each truck in the platoon, only one human driver is needed for the leading truck, and all following trucks can be controlled by autonomous driving and wireless communication technology. Therefore, in addition to saving energy, such a technology can help reduce labor costs by using fewer drivers to fulfill the same demand. Compared to traditional truck platooning, the schedules of drivers under semi-autonomous truck platooning may not be exactly the same as trucks, which are usually neglected in recent studies. Therefore, in this paper, we make the first attempt to develop a mathematical modeling framework to optimise the operation plan of drivers and trucks interdependently. To be mentioned, the truck fleet is equipped with the semi-autonomous platooning function and time windows. Specifically, the operation plan will dictate the number of drivers to be dispatched, and traveling routes and time schedules of drivers and trucks interdependently with the objective to minimise the total operation cost, including drivers' fixed dispatch cost, on-road labor cost, and energy consumption cost while fulfilling all delivery demands. To tackle the large-scale problem in a timely manner, a tailored Lagrangian Relaxation approach is proposed to solve the model. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed modeling framework and validate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed solution algorithm.

   Method Using a Multimodal Style Transfer Network for Training Autonomous

DT Article
DE style transfer; autonomous vessels; horizon targeted loss
AB Studies on virtual-to-realistic image style transfer have been conducted to minimize the difference between virtual simulators and real-world environments and improve the training of artificial intelligence (AI)-based autonomous driving models using virtual simulators. However, when applying an image style transfer network architecture that achieves good performance using land-based data for autonomous vehicles to marine data for autonomous vessels, structures such as horizon lines and autonomous vessel shapes often lose their structural consistency. Marine data exhibit substantial environmental complexity, which depends on the size, position, and direction of the vessels because there are no lanes such as those for cars, and the colors of the sky and ocean are similar. To overcome these limitations, we propose a virtual-to-realistic marine image style transfer method using horizon-targeted loss for marine data. Horizon-targeted loss helps distinguish the structure of the horizon within the input and output images by comparing the segmented shape. Additionally, the design of the proposed network architecture involves a one-to-many style mapping technique, which is based on the multimodal style transfer method to generate marine images of diverse styles using a single network. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method preserves the structural shapes on the horizon more accurately than existing algorithms. Moreover, the object detection accuracy using various augmented training data was higher than that observed in the case of training using only virtual data. The proposed method allows us to generate realistic data to train AI models of vision-based autonomous vessels by actualizing and augmenting virtual images acquired from virtual autonomous vessel simulators.

AB As a promising application for autonomous driving, vehicle platooning aims at increasing traffic throughput, improving road safety, and reducing air pollution and fuel consumption. However, frequent traffic perturbations will bring more fuel consumption because vehicles driving in a platoon require more control to ensure safe driving, especially in high-density scenes. In this paper, considering the traffic perturbations and high-density scenes, we integrate communication and control systems to reduce the fuel consumption of a platoon. By obtaining the velocities of multiple vehicles ahead through a long-term evolution-vehicle (LTE-V) network, we propose a modified distributed model predictive control (DMPC) method to smooth traffic perturbations and handle the constraints of vehicle state and control. In addition, considering a limited number of uplink channels that can be reused in the platoon and the uncertainty of wireless channels, a radio resource allocation optimization problem in the LTE-V network is modeled. This problem is solved in two steps including maximum vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) broadcast distance and minimum weight matching. This resource allocation scheme increases the platoon-based V2V broadcast distance while ensuring the ergodic capacity requirement of the cellular user (CUE) uplink communication and the reliability of platoon-based V2V communication. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves fuel efficiency compared to the existing schemes.

AB The objects and events detection tasks are being performed progressively often by robotic systems like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or unmanned surface vehicles (USV). Autonomous operations and intelligent sensing are becoming standard in numerous scenarios such as supervision or even search and rescue (SAR) missions. The low cost of autonomous vehicles, vision sensors and portable computers allows the incorporation of the deep learning, mainly convolutional neural networks (CNN) in these solutions. Many systems meant for custom purposes rely on insufficient training datasets, what may cause a decrease of effectiveness. Moreover, the system's accuracy is usually dependent on the returned bounding boxes highlighting the supposed targets. In desktop applications, precise localisation might not be particularly relevant; however, in real situations, with low visibility and non-optimal camera orientation, it becomes crucial. One of the solutions for dataset enhancement is its augmentation. The presented work is an attempt to evaluate the influence of the training images augmentation on the detection parameters important for the effectiveness of neural networks in the context of object detection. In this research, network appraisal relies on the detection confidence and bounding box prediction accuracy (IoU). All the applied image modifications were simple pattern and colour alterations. The obtained results imply that there is a measurable impact of the augmentation process on the localisation accuracy. It was concluded that a positive or negative influence is related to the complexity and variability of the objects classes.

AB More accurate navigation systems are always required for autonomous unmanned underwater vehicles (AUUV)s under various circumstances. In this paper, a measuring complex of a heavy unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) was investigated. The measuring complex consists of an inertial navigation platform system, a Doppler lag (DL) and an estimation algorithm. During a relatively long-term voyage of an UUV without surfacing and correction from buoys and stationary stations, errors of the measuring complex will increase over time. The increase in errors is caused by an increase in the deviation angles of the gyro platform relative to the accompanying trihedron of the selected coordinate system. To reduce these angles, correction is used in the structure of the inertial navigation system (INS) using a linear regulator. To increase accuracy, it is proposed to take into account the nonlinear features of INS errors; an adaptive nonlinear Kalman filter and a nonlinear controller were used in the correction scheme. Considering that, a modified nonlinear Kalman filter and a regulator in the measuring complex are proposed to improve the accuracy of the measurement information, and modification of the nonlinear Kalman filter was performed through a genetic algorithm, in which the regulator was developed by the State Dependent Coefficient (SDC) method of the formulated model. Modeling combined with a semi-natural experiment with a real inertial navigation system for the UUV demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

AB It is well known that communication is affected by the change in frequency of a signal for an observer that is moving relative to the source. As a result of the motion of either the source or the observer, successive waves are emitted from a position that may get closer or further to the observer. This phenomenon, known as Doppler effect, also affects underwater acoustic waves used for communications between Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), Underwater Sensors (USs) and remote operators. There have been few studies on the impact of Doppler shift in underwater communications. Assuming underwater communications using acoustic waves, in this paper we study the Doppler effect in relation to the half-power bandwidth and distance in the Ultra Low Frequency (ULF) band (i.e., from 0.3 to 3 kHz). We investigate two specific issues. Firstly, the maximum shift that can be expected on underwater links in the ULF band. Secondly, the maximum frequency drift, and associated patterns, that can happen during the reception of data frames. Numeric simulations are conducted. The analysis is based on scenarios that show the existence of significant Doppler effect. More specifically, we show that Doppler effect, under narrow half-power bandwidth, is significant with respect to the half-power bandwidth in the ULF band, for long distance communications. Furthermore, we show that Doppler effect patterns are not necessarily linear.

AB On the grounds that individuals heavily rely on the information that they receive from their peers when evaluating adoption of a radical innovation, this paper proposes a new approach to forecast long-term adoption of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). The concept of resistance is employed to explain why individuals typically tend to defer the adoption of an innovation. We assume that there exists a social network among individuals through which they communicate based on certain frequencies. In addition, individuals can be subject to media advertisement based on certain frequencies. An individual's perceptions are dynamic and change over time as the individual is exposed to advertisement and communicates with satisfied and dissatisfied adopters. We also explicitly allow willingness-to-pay (WTP) to change as a result of peer-to-peer communication. An individual decides to adopt when (i) there is a need for a new vehicles; (ii) his/her WTP is greater than CAV price; and (iii) his/her overall impression about CAVs reaches a cutoff value. Applicability of the proposed approach is shown using a survey of employees of the University of Memphis. Our results show that the automobile fleet will be near homogenous in about 2050 only if CAV prices decrease at an annual rate of 15% or 20%. We find that a 6-month pre-introduction marketing campaign may have no significant impact on adoption trend. Marketing is shown to ignite CAV diffusion but its effect is capped. CAV market share will be close to 100% only if all adopters are satisfied with their purchases; therefore, the probability that an individual becomes a satisfied adopter plays an important role in the trend of adoption. The effect of the latter probability is more pronounced as time goes by and is also more prominent when CAV price reduces at greater rates. Some caveats may be inserted when considering the study results as the findings are subject to sample bias and data limitations.

TI PTP-STGCN: Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction Based on a Spatio-temporal

DE Trajectory prediction; Spatial-temporal graph; Autonomous driving;
   Interaction
AB It is the prerequisite to ensure the safety of road users in traffic scenes for the application of autonomous vehicles. Pedestrians are the main participants in traffic scenes, and reasonable inference and prediction of their future trajectories are crucial for autonomous driving technology and road safety. Pedestrian trajectories are highly dynamic, apparently random, and complex to interact with traffic environment agents; therefore, selective modeling of spatial interaction and temporal dependence of pedestrians is necessary. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel pedestrian trajectory prediction model based on a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (PTP-STGCN). Specifically, a new crowd interaction attention (CIA) function is defined to quantify the interaction information between adjacent pedestrians better. This function captures the spatial interaction features of pedestrians at each time step by a spatial graph convolution network (S-GCN). Meanwhile, the time-series motion features of each pedestrian are extracted by a temporal transformer network (T-transformer), and a spatio-temporal interaction graph of pedestrian features is constructed by the STGCN composed of the S-GCN and T-transformer. Finally, a time-extrapolator convolutional neural network (TXP-CNN) is used to predict pedestrian trajectories in the time dimension of the STGCN. The experimental results on the ETH and UCY datasets show that the proposed model achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art baselines regarding the average displacement error (ADE) and final displacement error (FDE). Due to the excellent performance in pedestrian trajectory prediction, the proposed network achieves more predictive final planned trajectory of an autonomous vehicle, while avoiding unnecessary trajectory changes and collision risk, thus providing a promising solution for practical pedestrian trajectory prediction applications.

AB This paper addresses the problem of autonomous navigation of a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) for inspection and damage assessment inside a constrained shipboard environment, which might be perilous or inaccessible for humans, especially in emergency scenarios. The environment is GPS-denied and visually degraded, containing narrow passageways, doorways, and small objects protruding from the wall. This causes existing two-dimensional LIDAR, vision, or mechanical bumper-based autonomous navigation solutions to fail. To realize autonomous navigation in such challenging environments, we first propose a robust state estimation method that fuses estimates from a real-time odometry estimation algorithm and a particle filtering localization algorithm with other sensor information in a two-layer fusion framework. Then, an online motion-planning algorithm that combines trajectory optimization with a receding horizon control framework is proposed for fast obstacle avoidance. All the computations are done in real time on the onboard computer. We validate the system by running experiments under different environmental conditions in both laboratory and practical shipboard environments. The field experiment results of over 10 runs show that our vehicle can robustly navigate 20-m-long and only 1-m-wide corridors and go through a very narrow doorway (66-cm width, only 4-cm clearance on each side) autonomously even when it is completely dark or full of light smoke. These experiments show that despite the challenges associated with flying robustly in challenging shipboard environments, it is possible to use a MAV to autonomously fly into a confined shipboard environment to rapidly gather situational information to guide firefighting and rescue efforts.

ID COORDINATION; PATTERNS
AB Limitations both for the further development as well as for the actual technical application of autonomous robots arise from the lack of a unifying theoretical language. We propose three concepts for such a language: (1) Behaviors are represented by variables, specific constant values of which correspond to task demands; (2) Behaviors are generated as attractors of dynamical systems; (3) Neural field dynamics lift these dynamic principles to the representation of information. We show how these concepts can be used to design autonomous robots. Because behaviors are generated from attractor states of dynamical systems, design of a robot architecture addresses control-theoretic stability. Moreover, flexibility of the robot arises from bifurcations in the behavioral dynamics. Therefore techniques from the qualitative theory of dynamical systems can be used to design and tune autonomous robot architectures. We demonstrate these ideas in two implementations. In one case, visual sensory information is integrated to achieve target acquisition and obstacle avoidance in an autonomous vehicle minimizing the known problem of spurious states. In a second implementation of the same behavior, a neural dynamic field endows the system with a form of obstacle memory. A critical discussion of the approach highlights strengths and weaknesses and compares to other efforts in this direction.

AB An emergency can occur at any time. To overcome that emergency efficiently, we require seamless movement on the road to approach the destination within a limited time by using an Emergency Vehicle (EV). This paper proposes an emergency vehicle management solution (EVMS) to determine an efficient vehicle-passing sequence that allows the EV to cross a junction without any delay. The proposed system passes the EV and minimally affects the travel times of other vehicles on the junction. In the presence of an EV in the communication range, the proposed system prioritizes the EV by creating space for it in the lane adjacent to the shoulder lane. The shoulder lane is a lane that cyclists and motorcyclists will use in normal situations. However, when an EV enters the communication range, traffic from the adjacent lane will move to the shoulder lane. As the number of vehicles on the road increases rapidly, crossing the EV in the shortest possible time is crucial. The EVMS and algorithms are presented in this study to find the optimal vehicle sequence that gives EVs the highest priority. The proposed solution uses cutting-edge technologies (IoT Sensors, GPS, 5G, and Cloud computing) to collect and pass EVs' information to the Roadside Units (RSU). The proposed solution was evaluated through mathematical modeling. The results show that the EVMS can reduce the travel times of EVs significantly without causing any performance degradation of normal vehicles.

ID AUTONOMOUS MOBILITY; DEMAND; SIMULATION
AB With shared mobility services becoming increasingly popular and vehicle automation technology advancing fast, there is an increasing interest in analysing the impacts of large-scale deployment of shared automated vehicles. In this study, a large fleet of shared automated vehicles providing private rides to passengers is introduced to an agent-based simulation model based on the city of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The fleet is dimensioned for a sufficient service efficiency during peak-hours, meaning that in off-peak hours a substantial share of vehicles is idle, requiring vehicle relocation strategies. This study assesses the performance of zonal pro-active relocation strategies for on-demand passenger transport under constrained curbside parking capacity: (1) demand-anticipation, (2) even supply dispersion and (3) balancing between demand and supply of vehicles. The strategies are analysed in regard to service efficiency (passenger waiting times, operational efficiency), service externalities (driven mileage, parking usage) and service equity (spatial distribution of externalities and service provision). All pro-active relocation strategies are outperformed by a naive remain-at-drop off-location strategy in a scenario where curbside parking capacity is in abundance. The demand-anticipation heuristic leads to the highest average waiting times due to vehicle bunching at demand-hotspots which results in an uneven usage of parking facilities. The most favourable results in regard to service efficiency and equity are achieved with the heuristics balancing demand and supply, at the costs of higher driven mileage due to the relocation of idle vehicles. These results open up opportunities for municipalities to accompany the introduction of large fleets of shared automated vehicles with suitable curbside management strategies that mitigate undesired effects.

AB Autonomous robots in the agri-food sector are increasing yearly, promoting the application of precision agriculture techniques. The same applies to online services and techniques implemented over the Internet, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing, which make big data, edge computing, and digital twins technologies possible. Developers of autonomous vehicles understand that autonomous robots for agriculture must take advantage of these techniques on the Internet to strengthen their usability. This integration can be achieved using different strategies, but existing tools can facilitate integration by providing benefits for developers and users. This study presents an architecture to integrate the different components of an autonomous robot that provides access to the cloud, taking advantage of the services provided regarding data storage, scalability, accessibility, data sharing, and data analytics. In addition, the study reveals the advantages of integrating new technologies into autonomous robots that can bring significant benefits to farmers. The architecture is based on the Robot Operating System (ROS), a collection of software applications for communication among subsystems, and FIWARE (Future Internet WARE), a framework of open-source components that accelerates the development of intelligent solutions. To validate and assess the proposed architecture, this study focuses on a specific example of an innovative weeding application with laser technology in agriculture. The robot controller is distributed into the robot hardware, which provides real-time functions, and the cloud, which provides access to online resources. Analyzing the resulting characteristics, such as transfer speed, latency, response and processing time, and response status based on requests, enabled positive assessment of the use of ROS and FIWARE for integrating autonomous robots and the Internet.

AB Human-driving behavior at signalized intersections may lack efficiency because drivers try to reach their desired speed without the upcoming traffic-signal information. This causes idling time, sharp accelerations, hard braking, traffic congestion, emissions, and energy consumption. Connected vehicles, for example those equipped with a speed advisory system (SAS), can provide prior information to drivers for optimizing their driving behavior while approaching signalized intersections. However, the current literature focuses only on the fuel consumption, emissions, and travel-delay reduction impacts of SASs. This paper evaluates the safety impact of SAS vehicles using the proposed approach that simulates mixed-traffic situations between SAS and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). HDVs in the model follow real vehicle trajectories based on car-following conditions. The study investigates various scenarios including the impact of the different ranks of SAS vehicles in the vehicle group, the lane-changing possibility, and market penetration rates (MPRs). The results suggest that SAS vehicles can reduce rear-end collision risks from 25% MPR. The minimum time to collision increases by 1.2 s and the deceleration rate to avoid crash declines by 0.3 m / s(2) on average for 100% MPR relative to 0%. The study demonstrated that this safety benefit is also strongly related to the rank of SAS vehicles within a vehicle group. In addition, the conflict locations in the approaching lane gradually move away from the intersection up to where the communication range starts as the MPR increases, which would reduce abrupt vehicle speed changes near pedestrian crosswalks.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE; STEERING CONTROL; SYSTEM
AB A new multi-model predictive control (MMPC) algorithm was proposed and applied in an intelligent vehicle lateral tracking control system in this paper, which is better to adapt the intelligent vehicle lateral tracking control under complex multi-conditions. First, the Gustafson-Kessel algorithm was used for the cluster analysis based on the vehicle test data to obtain the clustering center and train the sample data of each typical steering condition. Then, a multi-model structure was constructed by least squares support vector machines, and the sub-models of each category were taken as the prediction model for the application of MPC. Hence, the objective function of multi-objective optimization can be established and the multi-objective optimization problem was solved by the non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm-II algorithm to obtain the optimal control quantity. Finally, the MMPC-based intelligent vehicle lateral tracking control system was used to control the vehicle lateral tracking under three steering conditions, including straight line, normal right turn, and U-turn, through a simulation study in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. By comparing the vehicle trajectory, steering wheel angle, lateral deviation, and lateral angle, the performance of the proposed control method was verified. The experimental analysis results show that the proposed method can track the steering wheel angle of the vehicle reference trajectory under various working conditions. The vehicle lateral deviation value can be controlled in the range of (-1.0 m, 0.5 m). The high-precision lateral tracking control ensures that the yaw rate of the vehicle can track the yaw velocity under the reference driving track and guarantees the driving stability of intelligent vehicles.

AB Research on motion control systems for marine surface vessels has generated a vast academic literature and many industrial applications since the early 20th century. The recent focus on autonomous ships has sparked intensive research and innovation activities of dock-to-dock operations, including the final docking phase. Specifically, automated docking involves systems that enable vessels to dock safely, independently, and energy-efficiently at designated locations with a specific heading. Challenges include managing large sideslip angles, static and dynamic obstacles, and navigation in complex port geometries. Despite its complexity, the docking problem has received less attention compared to dynamic positioning or course-keeping systems. This paper therefore provides a thorough overview of the research on automated docking for marine surface vessels, from 1980 to June 2023. The paper introduces the Docking Characteristic Index (DCI) as a metric to identify the scope and approach of systems addressing various docking challenges, not as an evaluation of their overall quality. Using the calculated DCI-Scores, we discuss some of the works in more detail. The survey reveals a rising trend in publications and an increasing emphasis on experimental verification. Despite advancements, current methodologies exhibit trade-offs and limitations, particularly in handling dynamic obstacles, robustness against external forces, and situational awareness. The paper identifies the need for more comprehensive and integrated solutions to these challenges. As the demand for fully autonomous operations grows, the results suggest that future research should focus on developing holistic and robust docking strategies, that are verified experimentally, to achieve safe, efficient, and effective automated docking systems.

AB Ride-hailing systems with electric autonomous vehicles are recognized as a next-generation development to ease congestion, reduce costs and carbon emissions. In this paper, we consider the operation planning problem involving vehicle dispatching, relocation, and recharging decisions. We model the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to generate the optimal policy that maximizes the total profits. We propose a flexible policy to provide optimal actions according to the reward considering future requests and vehicle availability. We show that our model outperforms the predetermined rules on improving profits. To handle the curse-of-dimensionality caused by the large scale of state space and uncertainty, we develop an asynchronous learning method to solve the problem by approximating the value function. We first draw the samples of exogenous information and update the quality of approximations based on the quality of decisions, then approximate the exact cost-to-go value function by solving an approximation subproblem efficiently given the state at each period. Two variant algorithms are presented for cases with scarce and sufficient information. We also incorporate the state aggregation and post-decision analysis to further improve computational efficiency. We use a set of shared actual data from Didi platform to verify the proposed model in numerical experiments. To conclude, we extract managerial insights that suggest important guidelines for the ride-hailing operations planning problem.

AB The emergence of LiDAR sensors have brought new opportunities for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by advancing navigation safety and computation efficiency. Yet the successful developments of LiDAR-based UAVs must rely on extensive simulations. Existing simulators can hardly perform simulations of real-world environments due to the requirements of dense mesh maps that are difficult to obtain. Therefore, we develop a point-realistic simulator of real-world scenes for LiDAR-based UAVs. The key idea is the underlying point rendering method, where we construct a depth image directly from the point cloud map and interpolate it to obtain realistic LiDAR point measurements. Our developed simulator is able to run on a light-weight computing platform and supports the simulation of LiDARs with different resolution and scanning patterns, dynamic obstacles, and multi-UAV systems. Developed in the ROS framework, the simulator can easily communicate with other key modules of an autonomous robot, such as perception, state estimation, planning, and control. Finally, the simulator provides 10 high-resolution point cloud maps of various real-world environments, including forests of different densities, historic building, office, parking garage, and various complex indoor environments. Evaluation results show that the developed simulator achieves superior performance in terms of time and memory consumption against Gazebo and that the simulated UAV flights highly match the actual one in real-world environments. We believe such a point-realistic and light-weight simulator is crucial to bridge the gap between UAV simulation and experiments and will significantly facilitate the research of LiDAR-based autonomous UAVs in the future.

AB This article develops a novel event-triggered sliding mode control (ETSMC) approach with variable threshold to deal with trajectory tracking matters of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) accompanied by actuator saturation and external disturbances, which can effectively reduce the communication burden between the controller and actuator. The proposed scheme will be very practical when some extreme situations occur. First, the closed-loop system is split into two parts: fixed terms determined by the system itself and nonlinear terms caused by uncertain factors. The nonlinear terms are estimated through adaptive technique. Then the apposite event-triggered mechanism, adaptive laws, and modeled actuator saturation characteristics are designed. The correctness of the presented scheme is illustrated via the stability analysis in the sequel, and the Zeno phenomenon is certificated to be excluded simultaneously. Finally, two different reference motion trajectories are adopted in the simulation experiments, which can indicate that the proposed ETSMC possesses performance superiority and only requires to consume a small amount of communication resources in trajectory tracking control of AUVs.

AB We combine decision theory with fundamental stochastic time-optimal path planning to develop partial-differential-equations-based schemes for risk-optimal path planning in uncertain, strong and dynamic flows. The path planning proceeds in three steps: (i) predict the probability distribution of environmental flows, (ii) compute the distribution of exact time-optimal paths for the above flow distribution by solving stochastic dynamically orthogonal level set equations, and (iii) compute the risk of being suboptimal given the uncertain time-optimal path predictions and determine the plan that minimizes the risk. We showcase our theory and schemes by planning risk-optimal paths of unmanned and/or autonomous vehicles in illustrative idealized canonical flow scenarios commonly encountered in the coastal oceans and urban environments. The step-by-step procedure for computing the risk-optimal paths is presented and the key properties of the risk-optimal paths are analyzed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS

DT Article
ID SOLITONS; SHELF
AB Temperature measured at the Monterey Inner Shelf Observatory (MISO) in southern Monterey Bay reveals frequent solitons and semidiurnal internal tidal bores (ITBs). A field study was undertaken to determine whether these features originate offshore and propagate shoreward over the continental shelf, and to characterize their evolution as they propagate. We developed a new survey method of using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to tightly track the thermocline along a 4.5 km transect, repeated 18 times over 18 hours, thereby measuring the internal-wave induced isotherm displacement at very high resolution. AUV measurements were compared with measurements at MISO, which is closer to shore. Internal waves of various scales were captured. An ITB of amplitude greater than 20 m propagating shoreward from the outer bay was the dominant feature. Rapid changes in stratification, possibly due to horizontal advection, were also observed. Technical challenges, advantages, and future improvements of this new AUV survey method are discussed. This study demonstrates that AUVs are efficient tools for surveying internal tidal waves.

AB This paper presents a study on multi-modal human emotional state detection while riding a powered wheelchair (PMV; Personal Mobility Vehicle) in an indoor labyrinth-like environment. The study reports findings on the habituation of human stress response during self-driving. In addition, the effects of "loss of controllability", change in the role of the driver to a passenger, are investigated via an autonomous driving modality. The multi-modal emotional state detector sensing framework consists of four sensing devices: electroencephalograph (EEG), heart inter-beat interval (IBI), galvanic skin response (GSR) and stressor level lever (in the case of autonomous riding). Physiological emotional state measurement characteristics are organized by time-scale, in terms of capturing slower changes (long-term) and quicker changes from moment-to-moment. Experimental results with fifteen participants regarding subjective emotional state reports and commercial software measurements validated the proposed emotional state detector. Short-term GSR and heart signal characterizations captured moment-to-moment emotional state during autonomous riding (Spearman correlation;. rho= 0.6, p < 0.001). Short-term GSR and EEG characterizations reliably captured moment-to-moment emotional state during self-driving (Classification accuracy; 69.7). Finally, long-term GSR and heart characterizations were confirmed to reliably capture slow changes during autonomous riding and also of emotional state during participant resting state. The purpose of this study and the exploration of various algorithms and sensors in a structured framework is to provide a comprehensive background for multi-modal emotional state prediction experiments and/or applications. Additional discussion regarding the feasibility and utility of the possibilities of these concepts are given.

AB Human drivers are endowed with an inborn ability to put themselves in the position of other drivers and reason about their behavior and intended actions. State-of-the-art driving-assistance systems, on the other hand, are generally limited to physical models and ad hoc safety rules. In order to drive safely amongst humans, autonomous vehicles need to develop an understanding of the situation in the form of a high-level description of the state of traffic participants. This paper presents a probabilistic model to estimate the state of vehicles by considering interactions between drivers immersed in traffic. The model is defined within a probabilistic filtering framework; estimation and prediction are carried out with statistical inference techniques. Memory requirements increase linearly with the number of vehicles, and thus, it is possible to scale the model to complex scenarios involving many participants. The approach is validated using real-world data collected by a group of interacting ground vehicles.

AB There is a drastic increase experienced in the production of vehicles in recent years across the globe. In this scenario, vehicle classification system plays a vital part in designing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) for automatic highway toll collection, autonomous driving, and traffic manage-ment. Recently, computer vision and pattern recognition models are useful in designing effective vehicle classification systems. But these models are trained using a small number of hand-engineered features derived from small datasets. So, such models cannot be applied for real-time road traffic conditions. Recent developments in Deep Learning (DL)-enabled vehicle classification models are highly helpful in resolving the issues that exist in traditional models. In this background, the current study develops a Lightning Search Algorithm with Deep Transfer Learning-based Vehicle Classification Model for ITS, named LSADTL-VCITS model. The key objective of the presented LSADTL-VCITS model is to automatically detect and classify the types of vehicles. To accomplish this, the presented LSADTL-VCITS model initially employs You Only Look Once (YOLO)-v5 object detector with Capsule Network (CapsNet) as baseline model. In addition, the proposed LSADTL-VCITS model applies LSA with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for detection and classification of the vehicles. The performance of the proposed LSADTL-VCITS model was experimentally validated using benchmark dataset and the outcomes were examined under several measures. The experimental outcomes established the superiority of the proposed LSADTL-VCITS model compared to existing approaches.

DE Observer; cyber-attack detection; sensor fault; and connected vehicles
AB This paper focuses on the detection of cyber-attacks on a wireless communication channel and simultaneous radar sensor health monitoring for a connected vehicle. A semi-autonomous adaptive cruise control (SA-ACC) vehicle is considered which has wireless communication with its immediately preceding vehicle in the same lane. The wireless connectivity enables the vehicle to operate at small time-gap distances without creating string instability. However, the reliability of the wireless connectivity is critical for ensuring safe vehicle operation. The presence of two unknown inputs related to both sensor failure and cyber-attack seemingly poses a difficult estimation challenge which is addressed in this paper. The dynamic system is first represented in descriptor system form. An observer with estimation error dynamics decoupled from the cyber-attack signal is developed. The performance of the observer is first extensively evaluated in simulations. The estimation system is able to detect either a fault in the radar or a cyber-attack. Further, the proposed control strategy achieves resilient adaptive cruise control system operation by switching to larger time-gaps and a non-connected controller when a cyber-attack is detected. Finally, experimental data from a real vehicle on the I-94 Highway in Minneapolis, MN, USA is also used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. The fundamental estimation algorithm developed herein can be extended in the future to enable cyber-attack detection in more complex connected vehicle architectures.

ID CAR-FOLLOWING MODELS; VEHICLE INTERACTIONS; BEHAVIOR; DRIVERS
AB Lane changing is a common driving behavior in traffic, and the algorithm of lane-changing maneuver is an indispensable part of the design of autonomous vehicle control and adaptive cruise control. Although extensive research studies focused on modeling drivers' decision mechanism, lane-changing execution (LCE) happening after the lane-changing decision has not attracted much attention, which has a significant impact on driving safety and traffic simulation results. This paper attempts to replicate the real LCE behavior by proposing new LCE models. Depending on whether the lag vehicle on the target lane is considered in an LCE or not, two types of lane-changing execution are defined, namely, the cooperative LCE (CLCE) and the forced LCE (FLCE). The real vehicle trajectory data, i.e., the NGSIM data, are applied to train and test the proposed models. The results illustrate that the proposedmodels have good performance in replicating the CLCE and FLCE behavior and outperform the first LCE model proposed by Moridpour et al. Furthermore, when drivers decide to conduct a lane-changing execution, their considerations of the vehicles on the target lane have happened, and their considerations of the vehicles on the current lane decrease sharply during the LCE. In addition, the driver generally pays more attention to the preceding vehicle than to the lag vehicle on the target lane in an LCE.

AB With the rapid technological advancement in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Vehicles (IoV), we witness exponential growth of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). However, these integrations of IoV with other technologies make the IoV network and its interaction between different network components highly complex. Therefore, ensuring the correct functioning of the firmware and software running on these next-generation vehicles becomes an essential requirement. A feasible method to address the aforementioned security issues is Remote Attestation (RA). However, the advancement in the attackers' approaches and the increased complexity, large network size, and vehicle mobility allow the attacks to bypass these security solutions, making RA less effective. In this paper, we propose LHASIoV, an attestation and healing protocol for IoV. LHASIoV has many features such as competent-wise (treats different entities of the system differently), geographical location-aware (traces forensics of security breaches and eases healing compromised vehicles), gradual healing (via slicing the healing software) of compromised vehicles, and resistance to single-point-of-failure. We provide proof-of-concept implementation and formal operational and security analysis for LHASIoV. To show its practical feasibility and effectiveness, we provide performance analysis by implementing it on the Omnetpp simulator. The simulation results show that for an IoV system that has 100 vehicles moving with a speed range of 15-25 mph, LHASIoV needed only 5.27 seconds to complete the vehicle's attestation. For this number of vehicles and compared to the existing protocols, LHASIoV reduced the communication and storage costs on average by 54.46% and 43.92%, respectively.

AB Purpose
   To reduce the effect of parameter uncertainties and input saturation on path tracking control for autonomous combine harvester, a path tracking controller is proposed, which integrates an adaptive neural network estimator and a saturation-aided system.
   Design/methodology/approach
   First, to analyze and compensate the influence of external factors, the vehicle model is established combining a dynamic model and a kinematic model. Meanwhile, to make the model simple, a comprehensive error is used, weighting heading error and position error simultaneously. Second, an adaptive neural network estimator is presented to calculate uncertain parameters which eventually improve the dynamic model. Then, the path tracking controller based on the improved dynamic model is designed by using the backstepping method, and its stability is proved by the Lyapunov theorem. Third, to mitigate round-trip operation of the actuator due to input saturation, a saturation-aided variable is presented during the control design process.
   Findings
   To verify the tracking accuracy and environmental adaptability of the proposed controller, numerical simulations are carried out under three different cases, and field experiments are performed in harvesting wheat and paddy. The experimental results demonstrate the tracking errors of the proposed controller that are reduced by more than 28% with contrast to the conventional controllers.
   Originality/value
   An adaptive neural network-based path tracking control is proposed, which considers both parameter uncertainties and input saturation. As far as we know, this is the first time a path tracking controller is specifically designed for the combine harvester with full consideration of working characteristics.

In this paper, I propose a new challenge for the AI research community: developing embodied systems that not only explore new environments but also characterize them in scientific terms. Illustrative examples include autonomous rovers on planetary surfaces and unmanned vehicles on undersea missions. I review two relevant paradigms: robotic agents that explore unknown areas and computational systems that discover scientific models. In each case, I specify the problem, identify component functions, describe current abilities, and note remaining limitations. Finally, I discuss obstacles that the community must overcome before it can develop integrated agents of exploration and discovery.

ID CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL
AB In the simulation-based testing and evaluation of autonomous vehicles (AVs), how background vehicles (BVs) drive directly influences the AV's driving behavior and further affects the test results. Most existing simulation platforms use either predetermined trajectories or deterministic driving models to model BV behaviors. However, predetermined BV trajectories cannot react to AV maneuvers, and deterministic models are different from real human drivers because of the lack of stochastic components and errors. Both methods lead to unrealistic traffic scenarios. This paper presents a learning-based stochastic driving model that meets the unique needs of AV testing (i.e., interactive and human-like stochasticity). The model is built based on the long short-term memory architecture. By incorporating the concept of quantile regression into the loss function of the model, the stochastic behaviors are reproduced without prior assumption of human drivers. The model is trained with the large-scale naturalistic driving data (NDD) from the Safety Pilot Model Deployment project and compared with a stochastic intelligent driving model (IDM). Analysis of individual trajectories shows that the proposed model can reproduce more similar trajectories of human drivers than IDM. To validate the ability of the proposed model in generating a naturalistic driving environment, traffic simulation experiments are implemented. The results show that traffic flow parameters such as speed, range, and time headway distribution match closely with the NDD, which is of significant importance for AV testing and evaluation.

The disturbance distribution information can be obtained and used to update the corrective gain vector of the sliding-mode controller. This increases the robustness of the controller and, hence, keeps the system performance within acceptable limits. Proposed method is validated with simulations on a submarine model.

AB The visual environment perception plays an irreplaceable role for autonomous driving. Wider and deeper convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures are explored in most approaches which focus on improving performance. However, for real-world applications, the environment perception need to be accurate enough to ensure safety and fast enough to guarantee prompt control. Toward this goal, we propose a deeply supervised Z-style residual network (DSZRNet) to join object and lane detection via a unified architecture, named DSZRNet, which consists of three main parts: 1) the Z-style structure commits to fuse the feature information of shallow and deep layers for effective and robust representations; 2) the residual net is to gradually improve the location accuracy; and 3) the deeply supervised lane detection branch is grafted on the shared convolutional layers by adding only a little computational burden. Our DSZRNet is simple and can be trained end-to-end. To effectively evaluate the proposed approach, a large-scale China urban traffic (LSCUT) dataset is collected which contains objects that have a large intra-class distance because of the large-scale variance, occlusions, etc, and a variable number of lanes. Besides, the real-world computer vision KITTI dataset is also used for performance evaluation. The experimental results we obtained demonstrate that the DSZRNet gains the best tradeoff between the detection speed and detection accuracy than the other published works, and it is well suited for environment perception for autonomous driving. The download links of the LSCUT dataset will be at: https://github.com/DaiCV/LSCUT.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; DESIGN
AB This paper describes autonomous racing of RC race cars based on mathematical optimization. Using a dynamical model of the vehicle, control inputs are computed by receding horizon based controllers, where the objective is to maximize progress on the track subject to the requirement of staying on the track and avoiding opponents. Two different control formulations are presented. The first controller employs a two-level structure, consisting of a path planner and a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) for tracking. The second controller combines both tasks in one nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) following the ideas of contouring control. Linear time varying models obtained by linearization are used to build local approximations of the control NLPs in the form of convex quadratic programs (QPs) at each sampling time. The resulting QPs have a typical MPC structure and can be solved in the range of milliseconds by recent structure exploiting solvers, which is key to the real-time feasibility of the overall control scheme. Obstacle avoidance is incorporated by means of a high-level corridor planner based on dynamic programming, which generates convex constraints for the controllers according to the current position of opponents and the track layout. The control performance is investigated experimentally using 1: 43 scale RC race cars, driven at speeds of more than 3 m/s and in operating regions with saturated rear tire forces (drifting). The algorithms run at 50 Hz sampling rate on embedded computing platforms, demonstrating the real-time feasibility and high performance of optimization-based approaches for autonomous racing.

AB This article presents a control approach that enables an autonomous operation of fleets of unmanned snow ploughs at large airports. The proposed method is suited for the special demands of tasks of the airport snow shovelling. The robots have to keep a compact formation of variable shapes during moving into the locations of their deployment and for the autonomous sweeping of runways surfaces. These tasks are solved in two independent modes of the airport snow shoveling. The moving and the sweeping modes provide a full-scale solution of the trajectory planning and coordination of vehicles applicable in the specific airport environment. Nevertheless, they are suited for any multi-robot application that requires complex manoeuvres of compact formations in dynamic environment. The approach encapsulates the dynamic trajectory planning and the control of the entire formation into one merged optimization process via a novel Model Predictive Control (MPC) based methodology. The obtained solution of the optimization includes a complete plan for the formation. It respects the overall structure of the workspace and actual control inputs for each vehicle to ensure collision avoidance and coordination of team members. The presented method enables to autonomously design arbitrary manoeuvres, like reverse driving or turning of compact formations of car-like robots, which frequently occur in the airport sweeping application. Examples of such scenarios verifying the performance of the approach are shown in simulations and hardware experiments in this article. Furthermore, the requirements that guarantee a convergence of the group to a desired state are formulated for the formation acting in the sweeping and moving modes.

AB In future smart cities supported by cyber-physical social intelligence, autonomous behavioral decision for vehicular agents is going to become a general demand. Despite much progress achieved in autonomous behavioral decision of vehicular agents, the existing works can just be used in scenarios of short-distance behavioral decision. Naturally, they are not well suitable for long-distance behavioral decision tasks, posing much challenge in realistic cyber-physical environment. To bridge the existing gaps, this article proposes an autonomous behavioral decision framework for vehicular agents using cyber-physical social intelligence. First, it is expected to establish a dynamic planning model with multiple objectives and constraints. This can be embedded into the control unit of a vehicular agent to endow it with proper social intelligence. On this basis, an iterative search algorithm is specifically designed for it to find the optimal solutions from the whole solution space. Finally, two typical situation cases are implemented with use of simulation modeling to display the working architecture of the proposed method. In addition, a universal optimization search algorithm is selected as the baseline to be compared with the proposed method. The comparison results reveal both planning utility and running efficiency of the proposed method.

DE Platooning; MEC; Simulation

AB Platooning of cars or trucks is one of the most relevant applications of autonomous driving, since it has the potential to greatly improve efficiency in road utilization and fuel consumption. Traditional proposals of vehicle platooning were based on distributed architectures with computation on board platoon vehicles and direct vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications (or Dedicated Short Range Communication-DSRC), possibly with the support of roadside units. However, with the introduction of the 5G technology and of computing elements at the edge of the network, according to the multi-access edge computing (MEC) paradigm, the possibility emerges of placing control of platoons on MEC, with several significant advantages with respect to the V2V approach. For this reason, in this article we investigate the feasibility of vehicle platooning in an edge-based scenario where the control of vehicle speed and acceleration is managed by the network through its MEC facilities, possibly with a platooning-as-a-service (PaaS) paradigm. Using a detailed simulator, we show that, with realistic values of latency and packet loss probability, as well as of engines and inertia of vehicles, large platoons can be effectively controlled by MEC hosts. On the one hand, we unveil that platooning on the edge is a viable and robust solution. On the other hand, we also shed light on the necessity to consider realistic characteristics of vehicles and speed profiles, since they can yield severe, yet not critical, performance degradation with respect to simple models.

The realization of autonomous driving of unmanned vehicles requires various technologies, such as localization, mapping, path planning, and obstacle avoidance. Among these technologies, localization is a fundamental component, which can be accomplished through various methods. In this work, we focus on localization based on state estimation, as these algorithms are predominantly applied to unmanned vehicles. This paper provides a comprehensive review of state estimation algorithms commonly used for the localization of unmanned vehicles, from the perspective of control and robotic engineers. First, we provide an overview of localization schemes based on state estimation algorithms. Subsequently, we can categorize the research subjects into eight classes and clarify the principles and features of each type of state estimation algorithm. Furthermore, we examine the recent research trends associated with these algorithms.

ID REDUNDANCY RESOLUTION; DESIGN
AB For autonomous manipulation in water, an underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) should be able to generate trajectori9es for the vehicle and manipulators and track the planned trajectories accurately. In this paper, for trajectory generation, we suggest a performance index for redundancy resolution. This index is designed to minimize the restoring moments of the UVMS during manipulation, and it is optimized without impeding the performance of a given task. As a result, the restoring moments of the UVMS are decreased, and control efforts are also reduced. For tracking control of the UVMS, a nonlinear H similar to, optimal control with disturbance observer is proposed. This control is robust against parameter uncertainties, external disturbances, and actuator nonlinearities. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed coordinated motion control of the UVMS. The results show that control inputs for tracking are reduced, and the UVMS can successfully track generated trajectories. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work proposes the integration of two aiding information sources to enhance the performance of inertial navigation systems (INS), for precise maneuvering of uninhabited air vehicles (UAVs). A new methodology is derived to exploit vehicle dynamics (VD) information by embeding the VD equations directly in an extended Kalman filter architecture. In this technique, the INS estimates are propagated simultaneously using the VD and the INS differential equations, allowing for the estimation of the INS errors. The proposed technique reduces the computational load associated with classical VD aiding, while retaining the same accuracy enhancements. A LASER range finder sensor is also integrated for precise landing and takeoff maneuvers. Simulation results for the nonlinear dynamics of a Vario X-Treme model-scale helicopter are presented, illustrating the contributions of the proposed aiding techniques for precise UAV navigation.

AB This paper focuses on the trajectory tracking problem of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under external disturbances, and a trajectory tracking method that combines model predictive control with dynamic neural networks was proposed. Firstly, the trajectory tracking problem is transformed into a constrained quadratic programming problem using the idea of model predictive control. Then, the kinematic constraints are taken into account, and control increment constraints and relaxation factors are designed in the objective function. A dynamic neural network is introduced to solve this quadratic programming problem in real-time. In addition, a disturbance compensation observer is designed to overcome external disturbances. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to verify that the proposed tracking strategy reduces computational

AB This paper addresses a problem of sweep coverage by deploying a network of autonomous mobile robots. We propose a decentralized control algorithm for the robots to accomplish the sweep coverage. The sweep coverage is achieved by coordinating the robots to move along a given path that is unknown to the vehicles a priori. The motion coordination algorithm is developed based on simple consensus algorithms. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated via numerical simulations. The proposed algorithm would have applications to military and civilian operations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, the Magnus force induced by a disk-type, spinnable autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), i.e., autonomous underwater helicopter (AUH), was predicted to promote the spinning AUH moving away from a deep-sea region with temporary and shockable ocean current. The simulation technique of the ANSYS-CFX solver based on viscous computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was employed to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of the spinning AUH and its high-speed propellers in uniform flow conditions. The behavior of the spinning AUH in currents can obviously alter the pressure distribution on both sides of the disk-shaped hull form, resulting in a differential pressure force in the horizontal plane, i.e., Magnus force. The simulation results show that this induced force can enable an AUH at 1 knot service speed to successfully move away from a sudden, transient, and/or steady, uniform ocean current region with inflow velocities of 1-2 knots in deep-sea conditions. The Magnus force induced by symmetrically configurated propeller couple force can be more efficient and effective at driving the AUH's escape from the current spoiler zone than driving the AUH using the two high-revolution propellers directly. A suitable mechanical power energy-saving matching point integrating the AUH and symmetric propulsion was determined to compare the proposed method and two conventional methods for AUH escape from currents. The comparison results prove that the proposed method is effective and efficient. This study provides a significant reference for the interdependent relationship between the effective spinning speed of an AUH, subject to couple force, controlled propeller revolution, AUH speed, and battery capacity, and the range of ocean currents.

AB Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications will be an essential part of the technology in future autonomous drive decision systems. A fundamental procedure is to establish a robust communication channel between end-to-end devices. Due to the antenna placed at different positions on vehicles, the existing cellular electro-magnetic (EM) wave propagation modelling does not fit properly for V2X direct communication application. In order to figure out a feasible understanding of this problem, this paper focuses on the propagation channel analysis in a rural Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) scenario for vehicular communication with antenna position experiments at different heights. By adopting the ray-tracing algorithm, a rural scenario simulation model is built up via the use of a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) EM modelling software package, that computes the path loss received power and delay spread for a given propagation channel. Next, a real-world vehicle measurement campaign was performed to verify the simulation results. The simulated and measured receiver power was in good agreement with each other, and the results of this study considered two antenna types located at three differ -ent relative heights between the two vehicles. This research provides constructive guidance for the V2V antenna characteristics, antenna placement and vehicle communication channel analysis.

AB Co-optimization of vehicle velocity planning and powertrain control for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) can lead to an optimal energy saving with the help of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. In this study, a real-time hierarchical effective and efficient co-optimization control strategy is designed for automated and connected PHEV to co-optimize vehicle velocity and energy management in urban driving scenarios. In the upper layer, the external traffic disturbance and powertrain characteristics are inte-grated into velocity planning via a Gaussian process (GP) model and a desired acceleration, respectively. In the power allocation layer, a double delayed Q-learning (DDQL) algorithm is employed to instantaneously optimize the power allocation for powertrain system based on the planned velocity. The feasibility and energy-saving effect of the proposed co-optimization strategy is verified through a traffic-in-the-loop simulator under various urban driving scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate that the integration of traffic lights, powertrain characteristics and speed prediction of preceding vehicle into velocity planning of PHEV can make vehicle ve-locity smoother, so as to improve fuel economy, driving comfort and traffic efficiency. As coupled with DDQL algorithm, our proposed co-optimization strategy can reach 97.31% energy economy of typical DP-based strategy but in a real-time framework.

AB Interacting with other roads users is a challenge for an autonomous vehicle, particularly in urban areas. Existing vehicle systems behave in a reactive manner, warning the driver or applying the brakes when the pedestrian is already in front of the vehicle. The ability to anticipate a pedestrian's crossing intention ahead of time will result in safer roads and smoother vehicle maneuvers. The problem of crossing intent forecasting at intersections is formulated in this paper as a classification task. A model that predicts pedestrian crossing behaviour at different locations around an urban intersection is proposed. The model not only provides a classification label (e.g., crossing, not-crossing), but a quantitative confidence level (i.e., probability). The training and evaluation are carried out using naturalistic trajectories provided by a publicly available dataset recorded from a drone. Results show that the model is able to predict crossing intention within a 3-s time window.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are expected to revolutionise transport worldwide and transform urban life. However, there are many unknowns concerning the impacts of these technologies in terms of sustainability, justice, and safety. It has been suggested that CAVs may exacerbate inequities and safety disparities concerning the interaction of vulnerable road users (VRUs) with motorised transport. This paper investigates the justice issues that CAVs policy needs to address concerning VRUs. Our approach to studying CAVs' capabilities and their potential perverse outcomes uses transport justice as an evaluative framework. The justice-related out-comes discussed include: traffic injuries, impact on sharing road responsibilities, loss of on-street space, access to technology, inclusion for disabled and older adults, CAV technological devel-opment, and impact of congestion and air pollution. The paper proposes a future research agenda emphasising areas where CAVs may positively impact VRUs.

AB Aiming at the problem that unmanned surface vehicle (USV) motion planning is disturbed by effects of wind and current, a USV motion planning method based on regularization-trajectory cells is proposed. First, a USV motion mathematical model is established while considering the influence of wind and current, and the motion trajectory is analyzed. Second, a regularization-trajectory cell library under the influence of wind and current is constructed, and the influence of wind and current on the weight of the search cost is analyzed. Finally, derived from the regularization-trajectory cell and the search algorithm, a motion planning method for a USV that considers wind and current effects is provided. The experimental results indicate that the motion planning is closer to the actual trajectory of a USV in complex environments and that our method is highly practicable.

AB This study solves the integration difficulty between scheduling and routing aspects of the multiple Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) problem through the winner determination problem (WDP). Our model reduces the cost of using multiple AGV for logistics and warehousing applications. We show that solving the WDP by the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is inefficient as the assignment of routes is made complicated by the combination of large number of AGVs. We illustrate an efficient approach through our proposed genetic algorithm using knowledge based operators, which decomposes a non-linear combinatorial auction model into a linear model. Simulation results showed the efficacy of MILP, the conventional GA and our proposed GA-based method. However, MILP only works well for small scale data. When the number of routes and AGV increases, the proposed GA method supersedes the other methods as indicated by cost and route flexibilities.

TI Vision Based Navigation for Autonomous Cooperative Docking of CubeSats

DT Article
DE Vision based navigation; Autonomous rendezvous and docking; CubeSat;
   Guidance navigation and control; Translation/rotation coupled dynamics
ID DESIGN
AB A realistic rendezvous and docking navigation solution applicable to CubeSats is investigated. The scalability analysis of the ESA Autonomous Transfer Vehicle Guidance, Navigation & Control (GNC) performances and the Russian docking system, shows that the docking of two CubeSats would require a lateral control performance of the order of 1 cm. Line of sight constraints and multipath effects affecting Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements in close proximity prevent the use of this sensor for the fmal approach. This consideration and the high control accuracy requirement led to the use of vision sensors for the final 10 m of the rendezvous and docking sequence. A single monocular camera on the chaser satellite and various sets of Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs) on the target vehicle ensure the observability of the system throughout the approach trajectory. The simple and novel formulation of the measurement equations allows differentiating unambiguously rotations from translations between the target and chaser docking port and allows a navigation performance better than 1 mm at docking. Furthermore, the non-linear measurement equations can be solved in order to provide an analytic navigation solution. This solution can be used to monitor the navigation filter solution and ensure its stability, adding an extra layer of robustness for autonomous rendezvous and docking. The navigation filter initialization is addressed in detail. The proposed method is able to differentiate LEDs signals from Sun reflections as demonstrated by experimental data. The navigation filter uses a comprehensive linearised coupled rotation/translation dynamics, describing the chaser to target docking port motion. The handover, between GNSS and vision sensor measurements, is assessed. The performances of the navigation function along the approach trajectory is discussed.

AB The mathematical dynamics model of the tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that has nacelle-fixed auxiliary wings (NFAWs) is presented based on computational fluid dynamics analysis using FLUENT and DATCOM. The advantage of the aerodynamic performance of the NFAW is compared to the performance of the original tilt-rotor UAV in a trim analysis as well as simulation. The inner loop and outer loop of the neural network controller are designed for the tilt-rotor and its NFAW variant. In order to improve the control performance of outer loop, pseudo-control hedging (PCH) is applied to the outer loop as well as the inner loop neural network control. The dynamic inversion on a linear model of the original tilt-rotor at hover conditions is used as a baseline. The sigma-pi neural network (SPNN) adaptation minimizes the error of the inversion model. This error typically occurs due to the use of an approximate tilt-rotor model for helicopter mode instead of the NFAW model throughout the flight envelope from helicopter to airplane mode. The waypoint navigation and the automatic hover guidance are applied to the most outer loop of the neural network controller for the autonomous flight, which consists of nacelle conversion and reconversion as well as automatic take-off and landing. The fast dynamic reference commands generated by the autonomous waypoint guidance are inputted to the outer loop control in order to make the PCH of the outer loop effective. Lastly, the nonlinear simulation results are compared under turbulent wind conditions, in which the NFAW is more negatively affected than the original tilt-rotor model.

ID ODOMETRY
AB Interest in autonomous vehicles (AVs) is growing at a rapid pace due to increased convenience, safety benefits and potential environmental gains. Although several leading AV companies predicted that AVs would be on the road by 2020, they are still limited to relatively small-scale trials. The ability to know their precise location on the map is a challenging prerequisite for safe and reliable AVs due to sensor imperfections under adverse environmental and weather conditions, posing a formidable obstacle to their widespread use. Here we propose a deep learning-based self-supervised approach for ego-motion estimation that is a robust and complementary localization solution under inclement weather conditions. The proposed approach is a geometry-aware method that attentively fuses the rich representation capability of visual sensors and the weather-immune features provided by radars using an attention-based learning technique. Our method predicts reliability masks for the sensor measurements, eliminating the deficiencies in the multimodal data. In various experiments we demonstrate the robust all-weather performance and effective cross-domain generalizability under harsh weather conditions such as rain, fog and snow, as well as day and night conditions. Furthermore, we employ a game-theoretic approach to analyse the interpretability of the model predictions, illustrating the independent and uncorrelated failure modes of the multimodal system. We anticipate our work will bring AVs one step closer to safe and reliable all-weather autonomous driving.
   Changing weather conditions pose a challenge for autonomous vehicles. Almalioglu and colleagues use a geometry-aware learning technique that fuses visual, lidar and radar information, such that the benefits of each can be used under different weather conditions.

AB Autonomous control and high-level decision-making for autonomous ships in complex environments are largely dependent on real-time navigational data from sensory systems and nautical charts. Visualization and manipulation of data contained within electronic navigational charts (ENC) or hydro/geographic information systems (HIS/GIS) is generally handled on the application or operations level. However, accessible and open-source application programming interfaces (API) for displaying and managing spatial bathymetry or other related sea-faring data for research and development are scarce. This work presents an open-source ENC visualization and manipulation API implemented in Python, with heavy emphasis on accessibility and simplicity. The current version of the package provides tools for displaying marine polygon data such as ships, ocean depths, reefs, and shallows, using the transverse Mercator projection. Additionally, polygon- and point-based transformation and calculation methods for application development based on spatial geometry, path planning and numerical optimal control are implemented. Usage of the spatial methods are demonstrated by examples involving high-level path or trajectory planning, optimization, and assisted decision-making for autonomous and remote-controlled ships.

ID ATTITUDE; INTEGRATION; SCHEME
AB In the global navigation satellite system denial environment, strap-down inertial navigation system (SINS) has to rely on the body-frame velocity output by autonomous velocity measurement equipment, such as odometer and Doppler velocity log, to implement the in-motion initial alignment. Considering the external velocity noise and the approximation existing in the body-frame velocity aided initial alignment model, the autonomous in-motion alignment for SINS with high precision is a difficult problem. Besides, the position updating of SINS cannot be realized only depending on the body-frame velocity. The position error will negatively impact the precision of the following fine alignment and navigation. In this paper, a backtracking velocity denoising-based autonomous in-motion initial alignment is proposed. Forward compass alignment and backward compass alignment are carried out, respectively, to denoise the external velocity. Body-frame velocity-based and navigation-frame velocity-based attitude determination are implemented, respectively, to gradually realize the attitude alignment. The contributions of the work presented here are twofold. First, vehicle velocity during the whole initial alignment process is accurately denoised and determined based on the backtracking compass alignment. Second, high precision position alignment is achieved during the attitude determination. The validity of the proposed method is verified based on field test data.

AB This paper formulates energy efficient driving of gasoline and electric powered vehicles as optimal control problems of various complexity. We show minimizing aerodynamic drag can maximize utilization of energy available at the wheel and requires low and constant speeds. By employing optimal control theory we show periods of maximal acceleration, maximal braking, and coasting often accompany constant speed cruising to satisfy boundary conditions on the states (bang-singular-bang optimal control). In the case of gasoline engine vehicles, analytical optimal control derivations show that pulse and glide operation of the engine while cruising can further reduce fuel use (chattering optimal control). For electric vehicles (EV), quadratic rather than linear dependence of energy use on control input results in different eco-driving patterns from gasoline engine vehicles. For EVs, analytical solution to the two point boundary value optimal control problem could be obtained after model simplification which is compared to numerical solution based on a more accurate model. We also evaluate optimal control solution in the presence of state constraints for EVs. Several simulation case studies are presented to showcase the energy efficiency gains with proposed eco driving strategies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Perceiving the environment semantically in real-time is challenging for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with limited computational resources. In this article, a real-time instance-aware segmentation and semantic mapping method on small edge devices is proposed. Taking red, green, blue, and the depth (RGB-D) image as input, the presented instance segmentation pipeline is able to run at the speed of 38 frames/s on AGX Xavier. To achieve this, we take a lightweight object detection model as the backbone and reformulate the mask generation problem as threshold regression in depth by a novel designed truncation network. After that, a probability grid map is constructed to integrate the categories of voxels and object-level entities. Objects parameterized by pose, extent, category, and point cloud are tracked and fused across frames by data association. Finally, autonomous exploration experiments of UAVs are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in both simulation and real-world.

AB Technological progress and economic interest are paving the way toward a more densified airspace. Seen as a technical system composed of air vehicles, traffic control, and service providers, the airspace is expected to evolve significantly toward a more digitalized and autonomous version of its current self. In such a future system, connectivity plays a key role, and needs to be dependable and secure. Regulation bodies have already defined a set of requirements, called required communication performance (RCP), against which communication links must be benchmarked. However, these are not well aligned with typically used communication performance metrics. In this article, we give an overview of technical demands originating from novel use cases and requirements put forward by airspace regulation bodies. We discuss the mismatch toward technical performance measures and propose a way to formally transfer RCP into more "communication-friendly" demands. We show with measurements that current technology is not ready to support the high demands of the aerospace industry yet and highlight technological ways forward that could close this gap.

AB Advanced Technologies are transforming the Automotive industry and the pace of innovation is accelerating at a breakneck speed. Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) incorporate many different systems and technologies and their increased computer functionality and connectivity lead to enormous cybersecurity risk. The aim of this research is to explore the significant factors that influence cyber threats on AVs and to examine their level of importance.
   Partial Least Squares path modeling was preferred for research studies for its flexible modeling and identifying key drivers. The data analysis was carried out using ADANCO 2.0.1 to develop and evaluate the structural model and the causal relationships between the variables.
   Correlation of in-vehicular network vulnerabilities with trust and the correlation between the "workload of the driverless system" with cyber-attacks and cyber threats to AVs are two relations but have not been touched upon in previous studies. In this research, a modified framework is proposed based on the Cyber Cycle and integrated model of Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis with the Active Cyber Defense Cycle.

AB This paper proposes a vision-based bike trail following approach with obstacle avoidance using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for the UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle). The UAV is controlled to follow a given trail while keeping its position near the center of the trail using the CNN. Also, to return to the original path when the UAV goes out of the path or the camera misses the trail due to disturbances such as wind, the control commands from the CNN are stored for a certain duration of time and used for recovering from such disturbances. To avoid obstacles during the trail navigation, the optical flow computed with another CNN is used to determine the safe maneuver. By combining these methods of i) trail following, ii) disturbance recovery, and iii) obstacle avoidance, the UAV deals with various situations encountered when traveling on the trail. The feasibility and performance of the proposed approach are verified through realistic simulations and flight experiments in real-world environments.

ID SLAM; NAVIGATION; AUV
AB We present a system for automatically building three-dimensional (3-D) maps of underwater terrain fusing visual data from a single camera with range data from multibeam sonar. The six-degree-of-freedom location of the camera relative to the navigation frame is derived as part of the mapping process, as are the attitude offsets of the multibeam head and the onboard velocity sensor. The system uses pose graph optimization and the square root information smoothing and mapping framework to simultaneously solve for the robot's trajectory, the map, and the camera location in the robot's frame. Matched visual features are treated within the pose graph as images of 3-D landmarks, while multibeam bathymetry submap matches are used to impose relative pose constraints linking robot poses from distinct tracklines of the dive trajectory. The navigation and mapping system presented works under a variety of deployment scenarios on robots with diverse sensor suites. The results of using the system to map the structure and the appearance of a section of coral reef are presented using data acquired by the Seabed autonomous underwater vehicle.

AB There are few studies on the ecology of whales in underwater except for small whales (Baird, R., 1996, Otani, S., 1998). It is hoped that through the use of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) new knowledge about whales can be gained. The whale makes sounds, and especially the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) makes a specific sound called "a song". We started our project to develop the technology for AUVs to follow and obsrve humpback whales by analyzing their songs and locating them underwater.
   A small size passive SONAR was designed, fabricated, and fitted on the AUV AQUA EXPLORER 2000. An observation experiment was conducted in March 2001 off the Kerama Islands, Okinawa. Prior to our studies, there were no examples of AM,observations on whales anywhere in the world. This experimental observation was conducted as a joint project of the Underwater Technology Research Center at the Institute of Industrial Science in the University of Tokyo, KDDI Co. Research Institute. and the Okinawa EXPO Aquarium. The AUV succeeded in detecting a humpback whale underwater and approaching it within 50m in this experiment.

AB With rapid growth of self-driving vehicle technologies, policymakers and industry are actively engaging the public to understand attitudes toward smart mobility. As public officials explore implementing connected systems, they may find diverse reactions. We present an important insight using precise technology adoption curves for three age groups within a major initiative in the United Kingdom, going beyond theoretical expectations. Specifically, the adaptation of self driving cars reflects the patterns of adaptation to previous technologies. Furthermore, older participants were more likely to be late adopters of the technology than younger participants. Implications from these insights offer the opportunity to enhance public engagement and optimize the implementation of such systems, thereby maximizing population benefits.

Data were collected using an airborne laser and provided prior to the robot mission. Through extensive and exhaustive field testing, we demonstrate the significance of such data in two areas: robot localization and global path planning. Absolute localization is achieved by registering 3D local ground ladar data with the global 3D aerial data. The same data are used to compute traversability maps that are used by the path planner. Vegetation is filtered both in the ground data and in the aerial data in order to recover the load bearing surface.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, are already an integral part of the equipment used by firefighters to monitor wildfires. They are, however, still typically used only as remotely operated, mobile sensing platforms under direct real-time control of a human pilot. Meanwhile, a substantial body of literature exists that emphasises the potential of autonomous drone swarms in various situational awareness missions, including in the context of environmental protection. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic investigation by means of numerical methods i.e., Monte Carlo simulation. We report our insights into the influence of key parameters such as fire propagation dynamics, surface area under observation and swarm size over the performance of an autonomous drone force operating without human supervision. We limit the use of drones to perform passive sensing operations with the goal to provide real-time situational awareness to the fire fighters on the ground. Therefore, the objective is defined as being able to locate, and then establish a continuous perimeter (cordon) around, a simulated fire event to provide live data feeds such as e.g., video or infra-red. Special emphasis was put on exclusively using simple, robust and realistically implementable distributed decision functions capable of supporting the self-organisation of the swarm in the pursuit of the collective goal. Our results confirm the presence of strong nonlinear effects in the interaction between the aforementioned parameters, which can be closely approximated using an empirical law. These findings could inform the mobilisation of adequate resources on a case-by-case basis, depending on known mission characteristics and acceptable odds (chances of success).

AB The technology of Shared Automated Vehicles (SAVs) has advanced significantly in recent years. However, existing SAV studies primarily focus on the system design, while limited studies have examined the impacts of exogenous variables, especially urban form, on SAV performance. Therefore, it remains unclear what key urban form measurements may influence SAV systems? sustainability. This study fills the research gap by conducting simulation experiments using data collected from 286 cities. This study identifies critical urban form measurements correlated with the simulated SAV performance using fixed effects regression models. The results suggest that SAVs are more efficient and generate less VMT in denser cities with more connected networks and diversified land use development patterns. The model results can provide insights on land use and transportation policies to curb the adverse effects of SAVs in the future and generalize existing SAV simulation results to the rest of U.S. cities.

AB Should self-driving vehicles be prejudiced, e.g., deliberately harm the elderly over young children? When people make such forced-choices on the vehicle's behalf, they exhibit systematic preferences (e.g., favor young children), yet when their options are unconstrained they favor egalitarianism. So, which of these response patterns should guide AV programming and policy? We argue that this debate is missing the public reaction most likely to threaten the industry's life-saving potential: moral outrage. We find that people are more outraged by AVs that kill discriminately than indiscriminately. Crucially, they are even more outraged by an AV that deliberately kills a less preferred group (e.g., an elderly person over a child) than by one that indiscriminately kills a more preferred group (e.g., a child). Thus, at least insofar as the public is concerned, there may be more reason to depict and program AVs as egalitarian.

AB A travel information system (TIS) provides customers with information about transportation, transfers, and routings. A decentralized TIS is composed of autonomous subsystems and a central computer, where local subsystems have full control of their data and there is not a complete database in the central computer about the entire TIS. The transportation vehicles are scheduled. A travel itinerary from one spot to another contains the travel path and the schedule of transportations. The approach presented in this paper is for the central computer to identify the fastest itinerary across autonomous subsystems, based on the incomplete local information provided by the independent subsystems.

AB Passing Sight Distance (PSD) is pivotal for two-lane undivided highways, impacting their safety and operational performance. However, current PSD standards and models are based on simplistic assumptions and do not consider road characteristics and vehicle dynamic response. This study investigates the adequacy of PSD models in practice by comparing them with more realistic values obtained from IPG CarMaker (R), a commercial vehicle and traffic simulation software. Similar test variables are chosen to compare the simulation and standards consistently. Since road gradient and road-tire friction affect the acceleration capabilities of vehicles, their effects on PSD are analysed by configuring the parameters in the simulation. High deviations of up to 94% are observed in the PSD values compared to the existing model under different road conditions. In the paper's second half, the existing model is evaluated for its performance in mixed traffic conditions by comparison with empirical data. Followed by this, an analytical model for PSD is proposed, which considers vehicle dynamic response. This model allows parameter selection and the application of physical vehicle constraints, considering the microscopic behaviour of a vehicle during an overtake. The deviations observed in PSD values obtained from this model are within 5% for the specified test cases simulated in the vehicle dynamics simulator. Furthermore, the model is benchmarked against existing models using field data, demonstrating its superior performance in terms of feasibility and safety. The accurate replication of overtaking manoeuvres by the analytical model will have significant implications for geometric design, traffic operations, advanced driver assistance, autonomous vehicle applications and policymaking.

AB The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) represents the emerging paradigm where vehicles are (almost) always connected to the Internet to deliver and receive information to/from other services so as to augment the knowledge and services the users can benefit from when moving in urban and rural areas by their vehicles, but not only. Furthermore, the exploitation of social networking notions into the IoV has brought to the definition of the Social IoV (SIoV) paradigm, i.e., a social network where every vehicle is capable of establishing social relationships in an autonomous way with other vehicles or road infrastructure equipment. In this paper, we propose an implementation of the SIoV leveraging on an existing cloud-based IoT platform to manage the social activity of the vehicles as defined by the SIoV paradigm. The contribution of the paper is multifold: (i) we define some static and dynamic relationships that can be established between vehicles and road infrastructures taking part to the SIoV; (ii) we show how the proposed system can be integrated into the standard Intelligent Transportation System Station Architecture (ITS SA); (iii) we illustrate an effective low-cost and flexible solution for the On-Board Unit (OBU) to enable every vehicles to participate in the SIoV and create their own relationships; (iv) we show the results of the conducted experimental tests for the creation of social relationships aimed at comparing the performance of Bluetooth, 802.11p and Wi-Fi technologies when used to manage vehicles' radio visibility. Finally, we present two use cases: the Vehicle Diagnostic and the Smart Parking applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hybrid military teams, formed by human warfighters and autonomous artificial agents, represent the technological future of Defence operations. Both the potential and the inherent limitations of current technology are well-known, but the cognitive-behavioral and motivational aspects of human-robot interaction on the battlefield have yet to be systematically investigated. To lay the theoretical and methodological foundation of this scientific investigation, our position paper critically examines how the military personnel's spontaneous tendency to anthropomorphize artificial autonomous agents can affect operations of hybrid military teams in multiple ways. We will argue that the psychological impact of anthropomorphism on military personnel is neither easily avoidable nor necessarily detrimental. Correctly identifying the multi-level cognitive mechanisms that underpin implicit and explicit forms of anthropomorphism allows us to increase the efficacy of human-agent interaction. We will argue that, within hybrid teams, the capability to communicate with teammates, allies, civilians, and adversaries relies on embodied social cognition processes that are inherently geared toward anthropomorphism and leverage its effects. By updating both the design of autonomous artificial agents and the training of human troops to account for these processes, their reciprocal coordination can be augmented.

AB For improving the stability of heterogeneous traffic flow in smart grids, the Multi-Lane MultiVehicle State Information Index Smoothing Fusion Car following model in the context of heterogeneous traffic flow (MLMVISF model) is proposed for CAVs (connected and autonomous vehicles) and HDVs (human driving vehicles). The model takes into account the combined effects of rearview effects, state information (e.g., velocity and acceleration) of multiple preceding vehicles, average velocity information of adjacent lanes, and the perception error headway. Through linear stability analysis, the model's stability criteria were investigated, and the optimal parameters were determined. MLMVISF model improves heterogeneous traffic flow stability based on linear stability and numerical simulation analysis. MLMVISF improves stability by 15.34 % over the FVD model (Full velocity difference) and 10.43 % over the MVISF model (Multi Vehicle Information Smooth Fusion). The study contributes to the design of automated driving strategies for smart grids.

AB This paper proposes a dynamic path planning method based on discrete optimization applied to suburban highways or expressways. We optimize the generated candidate points according to the cost function and then generates a local path through the quintic spline curve. The kinematics and obstacle boundary conditions are set up to improve the reliability of the planned path. Meanwhile, the two-dimensional normal distribution obstacle cost function, comfort cost function and acceleration cost function are designed to evaluate candidate points and speed. Various types of roads scenes, including dynamic and static obstacles, such as straight roads, S- bend, are established to verify the method's feasibility. The simulation shows that the method can efficiently avoid various obstacles and plan an ideal path that complies with traffic laws.

AB The contemporary automotive market is undergoing rapid changes that will inevitably revolutionize the road transportation sector in the years to come. Alongside electric vehicles and sophisticated vehicular communication systems, autonomous driving (AD) is emerging as a game-changing technology of the near future. To enable this cutting-edge functionality, passenger vehicles are equipped with various data acquisition and processing systems that collect information from vehicle surroundings. Onboard sensors, such as cameras, lidar, and radar, produce large data streams that are integrated and interpreted by processing units and subsequently used to generate signals to control car behavior. To ensure an acceptable level of safety in on-road operating conditions, these operations are performed in (near) real time. Additionally, a typical modern vehicle includes a combination of communication, driver assistance, active safety, and sophisticated infotainment devices, each of which is often a state-of-the-art electronic system [1].

AB This paper presents novel data fusion methods that enable teams of vehicles to perform target search tasks without guaranteed communication. Techniques are introduced for merging estimates of a target's position from vehicles that regain contact after long periods of time, and a fully distributed team-planning algorithm is proposed, which utilizes limited shared information as it becomes available. The proposed data fusion techniques are shown to avoid overcounting information, which ensures that combining data from different vehicles will not decrease the performance of the search. Motivated by the underwater search domain, a realistic underwater acoustic communication channel is used to determine the probability of successful data transfer between two locations. The channel model is integrated into a simulation of multiple autonomous vehicles in both open water and harbor environments. The results demonstrate that the proposed distributed coordination techniques provide performance competitive with full communication.

AB To resolve the local path generating problem for unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) in unstructured environments, a method combining a basic path subdivision method for topological maps of local environments and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is proposed in this paper. Based on the basic path subdivision method, topological maps of local environments can be extracted with little expanded nodes, without the constraints of obstacle representation, so meeting the need for autonomous navigation in unstructured environments. Next, to optimize the candidate routes in topological maps and generate a smoother path, an SVM is introduced. The candidate routes boundary points are defined as positive and negative samples, and SVMs are employed to train the separating surface. An original SVM is extended to satisfy extra constraints such as vehicle position and heading constraints. Experimental results show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.

AB A technique is presented for creating continuously parameterized classes of feasible system trajectories. These classes, which are useful for higher-level vehicle motion planners, follow directly from a small collection of user-provided example motions. A dynamically feasible trajectory interpolation algorithm generates a continuous family of vehicle maneuvers across a range of boundary conditions while enforcing nonlinear system equations of motion as well as nonlinear equality and inequality constraints. The scheme is particularly useful for describing motions that deviate widely from the range of linearized dynamics and where satisfactory example motions may be found from off-line nonlinear programming solutions or motion capture of human-piloted flight. The interpolation algorithm is computationally efficient, making it a viable method for real-time maneuver synthesis, particularly when used in concert with a vehicle motion planner. Experimental application to a three-degree-of-freedom rotorcraft test bed demonstrates the essential features of system and trajectory mode ling, maneuver example selection, maneuver class synthesis, and integration into a hybrid system path planner.

AB A short review of electronically controlled pneumatic suspensions for railway application suggests that a better knowledge of the physics involved and how to control them could be of interest. The point of view adopted in this paper is to consider the air spring used in railway vehicle suspension as an autonomous actuator, including in a closed loop arrangement a height sensor, 2 solenoid valves - 1 for supply, 1 for exhaust - driven by DPWM, and electronic controller. Physical modelling of the actuator is developped here, as well as how to obtain a third order control model to be used as a basis for state feedback design. Linear controller is then simulation checked against non linearities as a 1/4 vehicle secondary suspension. At last, full vehicle non linear simulation with unbalanced lateral acceleration sensing and four air springs tilt control leads to conclusion about the global behaviour of the system in a realistic context.

AB A Markov decision process model with two stages of long-distance autonomous guidance and short-distance autonomous tracking of obstacle avoidance was developed in this study, aiming to address the performance problem of multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to ground dynamic target. On this basis, an improved proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm uses long short-term memory (LSTM) network to calculate reward values, update network parameters and perform adaptive optimization iterations through status information, such as the real-time position relationship between the UAV and the target, taking into account the time-sequential data received from the UAV and the environmental context information. Finally, experiment with simulation testing was performed on platform based robot control system species. The results showed that the method proposed in this paper is able to safely and effectively realize autonomous maneuvering during the entire process of the reconnaissance mission. Compared with the traditional PPO algorithm, the introduction of LSTM neural network shortened the model training time, considerably improved the efficiency of tracking and avoiding obstacles, as well as further strengthened the robustness, accuracy, and real-time ability of the algorithm.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Future generations of flight control systems, such as those for unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs), are likely to be more adaptive and intelligent to cope with the extra safety and reliability requirements due to pilotless operations. An efficient fault detection and isolation (FDI) system is paramount and should be capable of monitoring the health status of an aircraft. Historically, hardware redundancy techniques have been used to detect faults. However, duplicating the actuators in an UAV is not ideal due to the high cost and large mass of additional components. Fortunately, aircraft actuator faults can also be detected using analytical redundancy techniques. In this study, a data-driven algorithm using Support Vector Machine (SVM) is designed. The aircraft actuator fault investigated is the loss-of-effectiveness (LOE) fault. The aim of the fault detection algorithm is to classify the feature vector data into a nominal or faulty class based on the health of the actuator. The results show that the SVM algorithm detects the LOE fault almost instantly, with an average accuracy of 99%.

AB Recent reports from the world health organization emphasize the role of human negligence in road accidents worldwide. This asserts the importance of autonomy in transportation systems. Advanced transport systems need effective detecting systems in terms of cost-effectiveness as well as capability of multi-target detection along with small dimensions and low power requirements. To realize such an autonomous vehicle, linear frequency modulated continuous wave photonic radar is recommended that operates in Free Space Optics. We propose FMCW based photonic radar for multiple target detection under adverse weather conditions using Mode Division Multiplexing (MDM). Four Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes namely LG00, LG01, LG02, and LG03 are used to detect four targets in varying atmospheric conditions (up to 75 dB/Km attenuation) over 80 m of distance. The system is also verified for the impact of bandwidth variations upon range resolution of photonic radar with 1 GHz, 2 GHz, and 4 GHz of bandwidth.

AB The integration of electric, shared and autonomous vehicles is shaping new forms of mobility and ultimately the future of the entire automotive industry. Our study addresses the ongoing shift in values and individual customer demand that has to be met by providing innovative concepts for future transport. We call into question what challenges arise when new technological developments and complex societal changes need to be aligned in a socio-technical system. Our qualitative approach is based on the use of semi-structured interviews with representatives from a traditional car manufacturer. By investigating the expectations and actions from an organizational perspective we find important predictions concerning the inevitable changes in customer behavior and organizational strategy. It becomes clear that one of the key challenges is an appropriate steering system to motivate innovation activities and enhance creativity within the organization in order to ensure long-term success in an increasingly competitive market environment.

AB Autonomous vehicles must be able to react in a timely manner to typical and unpredictable situations in urban scenarios. In this connection, motion planning algorithms play a key role as they are responsible of ensuring driving safety and comfort while producing human-like trajectories in a wide range of driving scenarios. Typical approaches for motion planning focus on trajectory optimization by applying computation-intensive algorithms, rather than finding a balance between optimatily and computing time. However, for on-road automated driving at medium and high speeds, determinism is necessary at high sampling rates. This work presents a trajectory planning algorithm that is able to provide safe, human-like and comfortable trajectories by using cost-effective primitives evaluation based on quintic Bezier curves. The proposed method is able to consider the kinodynamic constrains of the vehicle while reactively handling dynamic real environments in real-time. The proposed motion planning strategy has been implemented in a real experimental platform and validated in different real operating environments, successfully overcoming typical urban traffic scenes where both static and dynamic objects are involved.

AB This paper develops a measure-theoretic approach for generating the collective behavior of flocking of planar autonomous vehicles under all-to-all communication scheme. To obtain flocking protocol, we formulate the notion of state of styled-velocity flocking for the target state of a design problem instead of considering solution-ansatzes. This notion captures a broader class of flocking behaviors of non-parallel motions, as well as embodies the two important performances of cohesion maintenance and collision avoidance. To pose a control design problem, a measure-valued transition equation is obtained to induce an auxiliary one-body continuum-model from the exact multi-body particle-model of the collective system. The design problem is then formulated on the auxiliary continuum-model, and a systematic design procedure is presented. The state of styled-velocity flocking of the particle-model under the obtained flocking protocol is then verified with an important result on the continuous dependence on initial data of solutions of the measured-valued transition equation. Application to elliptical flocking of mobile robots is presented to illustrate the novelty of the presented theory.

AB Conventional laboratory studies of deep-sea fish metabolism are not possible as these fish are typically killed during recovery to the surface. As these species are important members of deep-sea communities, the lack of these data represents a significant limitation to our understanding of the functioning of this ecosystem. An autonomous fish respirometer vehicle was developed in order to measure the oxygen consumption of deep-sea fish in situ. This new lander allows measurements to be made without handling or stressing the animals and without the logistical problems and great cost of submersible operations. The design, operation, and measurement methodology are described and preliminary data for Coryphaenoides armatus at 4000 m are presented. These Atlantic data appear to confirm the low metabolic rate measured in this species when compared to other gadid species. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Developing Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship technology is a challenging task as it requires the convergence of technologies in various fields, such as optimal route search algorithm, communication technology, ship maneuvering technology, and onboard equipment. In this study, we developed a Samsung Autonomous Ship (SAS) system for ship collision avoidance. The proposed collision-avoidance algorithm includes collision risk calculation, the isochrone method, and an object function for optimal route searching. The SAS system can visualize the searched optimal route and reflect user parameters in real time. To prove the effectiveness of the SAS system, a sea trial test was conducted using a training ship and tug with lengths of 133 and 38 m, respectively. Experiments in two situations (head-on & crossing situations) were conducted within approximately 15 miles northwest of Gageo Island, Korea. The changes in collision risk, speed, rudder angle, and heading were analyzed. In each experiment, the closest distances between ships were recorded as 1.3 and 1.7 miles, meeting the set value of 1 mile. The maximum cross-track distance was 0.18 miles, and the ship arrived safely at its destination.

ID CUCKOO SEARCH ALGORITHM
AB Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) requirements from cooperative autonomous driving can be characterized as ultra-reliable, low latency, high traffic, and high mobility. These requirements introduce great challenges in the air interface and protocol stack design, resource allocation, network deployment, and all the way up to mobile (or multi-access) edge computing (MEC), cloud and application layer. In this paper, we present a cooperative autonomous driving oriented MEC-aided 5G-V2X prototype system design and the rationale behind the design choices. The prototype system is developed based on a next-generation radio access network (NG-RAN) experimental platform, a cooperative driving vehicle platoon, and an MEC server providing high definition (HD) 3D dynamic map service. Field tests are conducted and the results demonstrate that the combination of 5G-V2X, MEC and cooperative autonomous driving can be pretty powerful. Considering the remaining challenges in the commercial deployment of 5G-V2X networks and future researches, we propose two artificial intelligence (AI) based optimization tools. The first is a deep-learning-based tool called deep spatio-temporal residual networks with a permutation operator (PST-ResNet). By providing city-wide user and network traffic prediction, PST-ResNet can help to reduce the capital expense (CAPEX) and operating expense (OPEX) costs of commercial 5G-V2X networks. The second is a swarm intelligence based optimization tool called subpopulation collaboration based dynamic self-adaption cuckoo Search (SC-DSCS), which can be widely used to solve complex optimization problems in future researches. The effectiveness of proposed optimization tools is verified by real-world data and benchmark functions.

ID GENERATION; DESIGN
AB For real applications of unmanned aerial vehicles, the capability of navigating with full autonomy in unknown environments is a crucial requirement. However, planning a shorter path with less computing time is contradictory. To address this problem, we present a framework with the map planner and point cloud planner running in parallel in this paper. The map planner determines the initial path using the improved jump point search method on the 2D map, and then it tries to optimize the path by considering a possible shorter 3D path. The point cloud planner is executed at a high frequency to generate the motion primitives. It makes the drone follow the solved path and avoid the suddenly appearing obstacles nearby. Thus, vehicles can achieve a short trajectory while reacting quickly to the intruding obstacles. We demonstrate fully autonomous quadrotor flight tests in unknown and complex environments with static and dynamic obstacles to validate the proposed method. In simulation and hardware experiments, the proposed framework shows satisfactorily comprehensive performance.

   segmentation; autonomous vehicles
AB Segmentation of road obstacles, including negative and positive obstacles, is critical to the safe navigation of autonomous vehicles. Recent methods have witnessed an increasing interest in using multi-modal data fusion (e.g., RGB and depth/disparity images). Although improved segmentation accuracy has been achieved by these methods, we still find that their performance could be easily degraded if the two modalities have inconsistent information, for example, distant obstacles that can be viewed in RGB images but cannot be viewed in depth/disparity images. To address this issue, we propose a novel two-encoder-two-decoder RGB-depth/disparity multi-modal network with Residual-Guided Fusion modules. Different from most existing networks that fuse feature maps in encoders, we fuse feature maps in decoder. We also release a large-scale RGB-depth/disparity dataset recorded in both urban and rural environments with manually-labeled ground truth for both negative- and positive-obstacles segmentation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our network achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with other networks.

AB Autonomous vehicles need accurate 3D perception with a decent frame rate and high angular resolution to detect obstacles reliably and avoid collisions. We developed a low-cost scanning multichannel light detection and ranging sensor architecture allowing scalable frame rates by adjusting the number of laser and detector pairs. Scanning is achieved by a pair of micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) mirrors. A control pattern for the MEMS mirrors to maximize the frame rate is presented. A built prototype based on the proposed architecture achieves a frame rate of 11.5 Hz, a field of view of 70 degrees x 30 degrees, and an angular resolution of 0.4 degrees. The distance resolution is 6 cm. Reliable single-shot detection for low-reflective objects up to 19 m indoors and 11 m under direct sunlight expo-sure is achieved. A performance assessment based on the presented measurement system for recently available vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser arrays with power densities up to 1 kW/mm2 shows promising improvement potential.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group

AB Deep reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to the generation of goal-directed behavior in artificial agents. However, existing algorithms are often not designed to reproduce human-like behavior, which may be desired in many environments, such as human-robot collaborations, social robotics and autonomous vehicles. Here we introduce a model-free and easy-to-implement deep reinforcement learning approach to mimic the stochastic behavior of a human expert by learning distributions of task variables from examples. As tractable use-cases, we study static and dynamic obstacle avoidance tasks for an autonomous vehicle on a highway road in simulation (Unity). Our control algorithm receives a feedback signal from two sources: a deterministic (handcrafted) part encoding basic task goals and a stochastic (data-driven) part that incorporates human expert knowledge. Gaussian processes are used to model human state distributions and to assess the similarity between machine and human behavior. Using this generic approach, we demonstrate that the learning agent acquires human-like driving skills and can generalize to new roads and obstacle distributions unseen during training.

AB A thrust vectoring ducted propeller with deflector is a new method for vector propulsion that produces lateral forces and torques and manipulates the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for various movements. In this work, the geometric model of the thrust vectoring ducted propeller is designed. The six degree of freedom (DOF) kinematic and dynamic model of a cylinder-shaped AUV equipped with the thrust vectoring ducted propeller is developed based on Newton's equation and Euler' s equation considering the forces and torques generated by the ducted propeller with deflector. The performance of the ducted propeller is evaluated using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) method. The simulation of pitch motions, yaw motions, pitch and yaw coupled three-dimensional motions and maneuverability analysis are carried out based on the kinematic and dynamic model. The simulation results demonstrate that thrust vectoring ducted propeller with deflector can achieve accurate control on depth, pitch and yaw angle, and has good maneuverability on three-dimensional motion control.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES
AB This paper attempts to address the motion parameter skip problem associated with three-dimensional trajectory tracking of an underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) using backstepping-based control, due to the unsmoothness of tracking trajectory. Through kinematics concepts, a three-dimensional dynamic velocity regulation controller is derived. This controller makes use of the surge and angular velocity errors with bio-inspired models and backstepping techniques. It overcomes the frequently occurring problem of parameter skip at inflection point existing in backstepping tracking control method and increases system robustness. Moreover, the proposed method can effectively avoid the singularity problem in backstepping control of virtual velocity error. The control system is proved to be uniformly ultimately bounded using Lyapunov stability theory. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the developed controller, which can realize accurate three-dimensional trajectory tracking for an underactuated AUV with constant external disturbances.

AB Safe, autonomous navigation by aerial microsystems in less-structured environments is a difficult challenge to overcome with current technology. This paper presents a novel visual-navigation approach that combines bioinspired wide-field processing of optic flow information with control-theoretic tools for synthesis of closed loop systems, resulting in robustness and performance guarantees. Structured singular value analysis is used to synthesize a dynamic controller that provides good tracking performance in uncertain environments without resorting to explicit pose estimation or extraction of a detailed environmental depth map. Experimental results with a quadrotor demonstrate the vehicle's robust obstacle-avoidance behaviour in a straight line corridor, an S-shaped corridor and a corridor with obstacles distributed in the vehicle's path. The computational efficiency and simplicity of the current approach offers a promising alternative to satisfying the payload, power and bandwidth constraints imposed by aerial microsystems.

ID AVOIDANCE
AB We propose a novel sensor-based path-planning and obstacle avoidance algorithm GODZILA for navigation in unknown environments. No prior knowledge of the environment is required. The path-planning algorithm follows a purely local approach using only the current range sensor measurements at each sampling instant and requiring only a small number of stored variables in memory. No map of the environment is built during navigation. This minimizes the memory and computational requirements for implementation of the algorithm, a feature that is especially attractive for small autonomous vehicles. The algorithm utilizes three components: an optimization algorithm, a local straight-line path planner to visible targets, and random navigation. It is proved, for navigation in any finite-dimensional space, that the path-planning algorithm converges in finite time with probability 1. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated through simulations for path-planning in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) spaces. It is seen that a relatively small number of range sensor measurements is sufficient even in complex unknown environments.

AB This work proposes an active collision avoidance between autonomous driving vehicle and pedestrian with motion uncertainty under urban road. A candidate trajectory planning method considering spatial and time sequences is proposed, which combines the polynomial path planning and the velocity planning with variable safety velocity. Then, a pedestrian-vehicle interaction model is constructed, which takes the pedestrian's uncertain motion as a superposition of the Markov process without interference and the motion caused by the vehicle, and predicts the pedestrian's motion probabilistically. On these bases, the optimal trajectory is evaluated from the candidate trajectories by safety, stability, and efficiency, as well as different driving styles. The proposed collision avoidance strategy is verified in conventional and emergency simulation scenarios. Simulation results show that it can effectively plan a safe, stable and efficient trajectory under normal and emergency conditions.

AB The paper investigates the potential for level 2 autonomous vehicle technology to improve four prevailing sustainability issues specifically on highways: high congestion levels, increasing accident rates, high carbon dioxide emissions and poor journey time reliability. Cooperative adaptive cruise control shows potential to achieve high-volume cooperative driving on highways by controlling these parameters and forming vehicle platoons. Accident rates, carbon dioxide emissions and journey times can be reduced as a result. The risks of platooning are discussed and a minimum safe platoon headway is established to mitigate the risk of vehicle platoon collisions. This headway is applied to a real highway case study, demonstrating the potential to increase notional highway design capacity from 3600 vehicles per hour (vph) to 9213 vph, with significant sustainability improvements possible. Recommendations are made to complete a number of policy implementation and technology development tasks aimed to create the best chance of achieving the identified sustainability benefits within a 20-year timeframe.

AB Maintaining a fixed position near the sea floor is a critical capability during the deployment of remotely operated or intelligent (autonomous) undersea vehicles in a variety of missions, including inspection and repair of undersea structures, data collection, and surveillance. We present an automatic optical station-keeping system for application to submersible vehicles in deep waters by exploiting the information in sea floor images. Readily measurable spatio-temporal image gradients are used to detect and compute the vehicle's translational and yaw motions using a direct motion vision technique. The vision system has been implemented on a Windows-NT Pentium platform, and the estimated positions and yaw angles are communicated via a serial link to the control system, running on a PC-386, Accurate stationkeeping is demonstrated in experiments with a three-thruster floating vehicle in a 6-ft x 12-ft x 6-ft water tank.

AB Considering autonomous delivery robots in urban logistics has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. In the meantime, new technology has led to new operational challenges, such as the routing and scheduling of vehicles and delivery robots together that are currently outside the logistics service providers' capability. In this paper, a vehicle routing problem with time windows and delivery robots (VRPTWDR) as a variant of the classical VRP is studied. The investigated problem is concerned with the routing of a set of delivery vans equipped with a number of self-driving parcel delivery robots. To tackle the VRPTWDR, an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search heuristic algorithm is developed. Experiments show the performance and effectiveness of the algorithm for solving the VRPTWDR, and provide insights on the use of self-driving parcel delivery robots as an alternative last mile service.

AB This research develops a system optimal dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) model for mixed traffic of human drivers and automated vehicles (AVs) and investigates network level mobility and energy impacts for different market shares of AVs. A methodology based on vehicle-specific-energy is proposed to estimate the energy consumption from the embedded spatial-queuing traffic flow model within the DTA formulation. Results with a test network indicate that potential travel time and energy consumption reductions are possible with increased AV market share in transportation networks. Results also report a decrease in travel time as high as 49% and energy consumption as high as 28% at the system level. The developed DTA model will be able to assist in transportation planning and the investment decision process by estimating the mobility and energy impacts in future transportation networks with mixed traffic of human drivers and AVs.

AB Driver error and reaction is one of the major causes of road accidents. In-vehicle driver behaviour warning system can help to prevent a significant number of road accidents. However, current technologies struggle to provide satisfactory performance for the underlying data transmission/sharing layer between vehicles and infrastructure to support the system. In this paper, we present our way for approaching the design of such a system. First, we identify the primary contributing factors to road accidents and analyse the data transmission/sharing requirement for tackling them based on the study of historical accident records. We then investigate the feasibility of adopting various RFID technologies as the underlying technology to address those requirements in order to support active accident prevention. Our work demonstrated the effectiveness of RFID technologies in retrieving information from roadside and other vehicles for providing reliable and affordable solutions in future driver warning systems or autonomous vehicle control systems.

AB Traditional models of vehicle dynamics engineered from physical principles are usually simplified and assumed, resulting in the model cannot accurately reflect the actual dynamic characteristics of the vehicle under some working conditions, affecting the control accuracy and even safety. In view of this, inspired by the single-track model, this paper uses the data-driven methods to establish a new high-performance time-delay feedback neural network vehicle dynamics model. The feedback connection of a network can describe complex dynamics. The multi-time-step input of the state and control can include highly nonlinear and strong coupling characteristics of a vehicle. The test results of modeling accuracy show that the proposed model can achieve higher vehicle dynamics prediction accuracy than nonlinear vehicle model. Different from the traditional vehicle dynamics model, the proposed model has long-term memory cells, which can implicitly predict coefficient of friction and can be applied to different road conditions. Then, the trajectory tracking control algorithm is designed based on the proposed vehicle model. According to the steady-state steering assumption, the feedforward front wheel steering angle is calculated, and the steady-state sideslip angle is integrated into the steering feedback according to the reference path to realize the reference trajectory tracking control. Finally, Simulink/CarSim is used to conduct the simulation analysis under the double lane change conditions to evaluate the proposed control algorithm. The analysis results show that the control algorithm based on the proposed model can achieve an accurate tracking control effect of a vehicle at medium and high speeds, providing high-accuracy track tracking and good lateral stability of intelligent vehicles.

AB In the internet of battle vehicles (IoBV), a few unauthorized users may attack and intrude on a network. The attackers who sneak into the network may maliciously occupy invaluable wireless resources that are supposed to serve authorized users. To guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of authorized users, we novelly propose an architecture of secure IoBV through the radio frequency (RF) fingerprint recognition technology and investigate the optimal resource allocation scheme under such an architecture. With few training samples, we propose a meta-transfer-based few-shot learning method for RF fingerprint recognition and an algorithm to optimize the data rate in an IoBV. Compared with a few benchmarks, the analysis results show that our proposed algorithm can improve the overall data rate and reduce the computation time.

AB Automated vehicles are expected to require some form of communication (e.g., via LED strip or display) with vulnerable road users such as pedestrians. However, the passenger inside the automated vehicle could perform gestures or motions which could potentially be interpreted by the pedestrian as contradictory to the outside communication of the car. To explore this conflict, we conducted an online experiment (N = 59) with different message types (no message, intention, command), gestures (no gesture, wave, stop), and user positions (driver, co-driver) and measured the pedestrian's confidence in crossing. Our results show that certain combinations (e.g., car indicates cross while the user in the driver seat gestures stop) confused the pedestrian, resulting in significantly lower confidence to cross. We further show that designing intention-based external communication led to less confusion and a significantly higher intention to cross.

ID SYSTEM
AB The possible applications and benefits of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) use in urban areas are gaining considerable attention. Before these possibilities can be realized, it is essential that UAVs be able to navigate reliably and precisely in urban environments. The most common means of determining the location of a UAV is to utilize position measurements from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). In urban environments, however, GNSS measurements are significantly degraded due to occlusions and multipath. This research analyzes the use of camera Line-of-Sight (LOS) measurements to self-describing fiducials as a replacement for conventional GNSS measurements. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) is developed and validated for the purpose of combining continuous measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) with the discrete LOS measurements to accurately estimate the states of a UAV. The sensitivity of the estimation error covariance to various system parameters is assessed, including IMU grade, fiducial placement, vehicle altitude, and image processing frequency.

AB The number of unmanned vehicles and devices deployed underwater is increasing. New communication systems and networking protocols are required to handle this growth. Underwater free-space optical communication is poised to augment acoustic communication underwater, especially for short-range, mobile, multi-user environments in future underwater systems. Existing systems are typically point-to-point links with strict pointing and tracking requirements.
   In this paper we demonstrate compact smart transmitters and receivers for underwater free-space optical communications. The receivers have segmented wide field of view and are capable of estimating angle of arrival of signals. The transmitters are highly directional with individually addressable LEDs for electronic switched beamsteering, and are capable of estimating water quality from its backscattered light collected by its co-located receiver. Together they form enabling technologies for non-traditional networking schemes in swarms of unmanned vehicles underwater.

ID DATA DISSEMINATION; TRANSMISSION; SCHEME
AB Efficient data sharing in autonomous driving is expected to improve road safety. However, time-varying network topologies, limited roadside unit (RSU) coverage, and communication limitations make efficient data sharing challenging. Therefore, we propose an RSU-assisted hybrid scheduling (RAHC) scheme, including centralised scheduling within the RSU and self-organised scheduling in the RSU blind zone. For centralised scheduling, we model data transmission and transmission conflicts as conflict graph based on real-time network topology, and solve for optimal transmission paths while satisfying communication constraints, and increase the chance for vehicles in RSU blind areas to obtain data by carrying and forwarding data. For self-organised scheduling, we use degree of link similarity (DLS) to cluster vehicles and select the vehicle with the largest service capacity (SC) in the cluster to serve the opposite vehicle. This reduces duplication and redundancy of data transmission and improves sharing efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the solution.

AB For a class of remotely operated vehicle (ROV) systems with thruster constraints, immeasurable states, and unknown nonlinearities, the trajectory tracking control problem was discussed in this paper. The unknown nonlinear functions were approximated by radial basis function (RBF) neural networks. An adaptive state observer based on neural networks was designed and the immeasurable states were estimated. Considering the problem of thruster saturation constraints, an auxiliary system for saturation compensation was designed and a saturation factor was constructed by the auxiliary system state. By applying the backstepping design method, an adaptive neural sliding mode trajectory tracking controller was developed, in which the saturation factor is contained in adaptive laws. It was proved that the uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) of trajectory tracking errors can be obtained. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory tracking control approach was checked by simulations.

AB Consider n doubly infinite chains of kinematic points, where kinematic points can move in a two-dimensional plane; these kinematic points could be vehicles/drones modeled as point masses. In this paper, we analyze the behavior, under bounded perturbations, of such n infinite chains of kinematic points with respect to the immediate-neighbors interaction dynamics. We show that if the initial perturbations are bounded, then such an autonomous system converges to an equilibrium point. Furthermore, under some additional conditions, the autonomous system converges to the same equilibrium point in which it was before the perturbations.

AB This study proposes a unique multimodal underwater observation platform, called all-attitude multimode underwater vehicle (AMUV). AMUV integrates the movement capabilities of Argo buoy, Glider motion modes, and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), enabling comprehensive underwater navigation. To explore the operational rules of individual modes and the changes in actuator and attitude during mode transitions, firstly, a dynamics model of AMUV is established, conforming the operating principles of the Argo buoy, Glider, and AUVs. Secondly, through open-loop simulations of different modes, the feasibility of the dynamic model is verified. Thirdly, through simulation experiments involving three typical mode switching processes, the mechanism of AMUV multi-mode switching is demonstrated. Finally, to examine the ability of the AMUV for multidimensional data acquisition, a simulation task focused on gathering multidimensional data of marine elements is designed. The simulation results indicate that the proposed AMUV has considerable potential for application in monitoring activities requiring the acquisition of multidimensional oceanographic data.

AB Collision avoidance for unmanned aerial vehicles is a main task for autonomous aerial systems. One of the major challenges facing such technology is the existence of a high level of uncertainty in moving objects. In this research study, we chose to work with object's classification and probabilistic models to deal with the system's uncertainty. First, a classification takes place through detecting an object, identifying it using a trained convolutional neural network, and analyzing its velocity. Afterwards, a Bayesian probabilistic model takes inputs of the detected object's type, orientation, and velocity along with the host unmanned aerial vehicle's velocity. It gives an output of the detected object's space occupancy. The simulation results show that the space occupancy clearly changes with respect to the available inputs of the Bayesian model as a function of time; hence, optimizing the space occupancy around the detected object.

AB Autonomous driving technology pledges safety, convenience, and energy efficiency. Its challenges include the unknown intentions of other road users: communication between vehicles and with the road infrastructure is a possible approach to enhance awareness and enable cooperation. Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to disrupt mobility, extending what is possible with driving automation and connectivity alone. Applications include real-time control and planning with increased awareness, routing with micro-scale traffic information, coordinated platooning using traffic signals information, and eco-mobility on demand with guaranteed parking. This paper introduces a control and planning architecture for CAVs, and surveys the state of the art on each functional block therein; the main focus is on techniques to improve energy efficiency. We provide an overview of existing algorithms and their mutual interactions, we present promising optimization based approaches to CAVs control and identify future challenges.

AB Due to parallax and inadequate key points, it is difficult to stitch unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images that are not rich in structure, which is addressed in this letter. Global matching is judged along with local similarity by a trained transformer, which provides the possibility of finding plenty of key points in low-feature regions. A new point matching constraint is designed based on the scores from the transformer. Line protection and distortion resistance are also used in local correction to alleviate global aberrations. The experiment shows that our method outperforms four state-of-the-art algorithms significantly, which reduces the position error by half in stitching inconspicuous features, such as woodland, bare land, and river.

AB This paper describes a decentralized Bayesian approach to the problem of coordinating multiple autonomous sensor platforms searching for a single non-evading target. In this architecture. each decision maker builds an equivalent representation of the probability density function (PDF) of the target state through a general decentralized Bayesian sensor network, enabling them to coordinate their actions without exchanging any information about their plans. The advantage. of the approach is that a high degree of scalability and real-time adaptability can be achieved. The framework is implemented on a real-time high-fidelity, multi-vehicle simulator system. The effectiveness of the. method is demonstrated in different scenarios for a team of airborne search vehicles looting for both a stationary and a drifting target lost at sea.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications are vulnerable to smart attacks, where the attacker can change the attack mode (e.g., eavesdropping and jamming) via smart radio devices. To ensure secure transmissions against hybrid attacks, UAVs may transmit confidential information and misleading information alternately. In this paper, we consider a dynamic anti-hybrid attack framework with trajectory optimization, where both a UAV and an attacker attempt to find their optimal trajectories without knowing the information type and the attack mode of each other. Given the major challenge due to incomplete knowledge (i.e., each agent knows only its own information), we establish an adversarial game with partial-observation feature to formulate an optimization problem, and propose a counterfactual regret minimization learning scheme to achieve the correlated equilibrium for both the UAV and attacker. Simulation results validate the superiority of our scheme over a benchmark in UAV communication scenarios with partial information.

AB The paper deals with the design of nonlinear adaptive cruise controllers for vehicular platoons operating on an open road or a ring road. The constructed feedback controllers are nonlinear functions of the distance between successive vehicles and their speeds. It is shown that the proposed novel controllers guarantee safety (collision avoidance), speed positivity, bounded acceleration, speed limits by explicitly characterising the set of allowable inputs and by leveraging barrier function techniques. Moreover, we guarantee global asymptotic stability of the platoon to the desired configuration, as well as string stability. Certain macroscopic properties are also investigated. The main challenges stem from the fact that all previous objectives must be satisfied simultaneously and the fact that the control systems studied do not evolve in a finite-dimensional linear space but rather on specific sets. The efficiency of the nonlinear adaptive cruise controllers is demonstrated by means of numerical examples.

AB Within the next few years, autonomous vehicles will start being commercialized. In the same time, inter-vehicular communication is emerging. Using these new technologies allows designing new software to make cooperative cars. These cooperatives cars can exchange messages to improve traffic efficiency by, for instance, notifying about the presences of other cars, or managing the right-of-way at intersections. In the context of multi-lane roads, we propose to use the communication between vehicles to design a cooperative intelligence, based on evolutionary optimization where the behavior of each vehicle is regularly updated according to the behavior of surrounding vehicles and a fitness function. This paper presents an automated/cooperative lane-change framework where the parameters of the system are dynamically adjusted using an online evolutionary algorithm. The goal is to make the cars adjust their behavior according to the local traffic conditions. Simulations are carried out showing a performance improvement in terms of traffic fluidity.

AB Several autonomous traffic monitoring systems have been created as a result of the growing number of vehicles in urban areas. Traffic surveillance systems that use roadside cameras, in particular, are becoming widely used for traffic management. For an efficient traffic control and vehicle navigation system, accurate traffic flow information must be obtained based on the vehicles detected in surveillance videos. However, vehicles of various scales are difficult to spot in traffic surveillance videos due to the presence of barricades, other vehicles, and the impact of poor lighting. Also, adverse weather conditions like snow, fog, and heavy rain diminish the visual quality of the surveillance footage. This paper proposes multi-scale dense nested deep CNN (MSDN-DCNN) and regional search grasshopper optimization algorithm (RS-GOA) framework to accurately detect the vehicles, estimate the traffic flow, and find the optimal path with less travel time. First, the surveillance videos are pre-processed, which includes frame conversion, redundancy removal, and image enhancement. The pre-processed frames are given as input to the MSDN-DCNN for multi-scale vehicle detection. The detected results are used for vehicle counting and estimating the traffic flow. Finally, the optimal path is chosen based on the traffic flow information by using the RS-GOA algorithm. The performance of the proposed method is compared with the existing vehicle detection and path selection techniques. The results illustrate that the proposed Deep CNN-RS-GOA framework has improved performance with high detection accuracy (91.03%), high speed (53.9 fps), less running time (1,000 ms), less travel time, and faster convergence.

AB Traffic event detection from vehicles' on-board sensors can detect the road information and improve traffic management and safety. Current sensor-based traffic event detection is mainly based on probe vehicles, test vehicles, or other designated vehicles, which is costly and cannot be deployed on a large scale. With the fast development of on-board equipment, data collection from consumer vehicle sensors is becoming popular and can cover a large geographic scale with almost no equipment or labor cost. However, there are very few studies of the data features and potential for application. This paper presents a pipeline for employing consumer vehicle sensors to detect roadworks. The unique data features and deficiencies of the consumer vehicle sensor are discussed and summarized. A clustering method is employed to distinguish the roadwork sites. A route builder method is proposed to reconstruct the routes of the roadworks and to extract the corresponding start and end locations. Compared with ground truth, roadworks detection from consumer vehicle sensors can cover up to 86% of the roadworks on freeways and over 40% of the roadworks on non-freeway roads. The average offset errors are 4.7% on freeways, and 24.9% on non-freeway roads. Compared with point-based roadworks detection from "ViaMichelin Traffic information," the results from consumer vehicle sensors achieved a matching ratio of nearly 90% and were advantageous in extracting the roadworks route information. This study proves the possibility of employing consumer vehicle sensors for route-based traffic event detection and provides insights for countering uneven distribution and trajectory truncation issues related to privacy protection.

The dynamic model of the miniature quad-rotor is developed using the Newton-Euler approach. A nonlinear controller based on a separated saturation control strategy for a miniature quad-rotor is presented. To validate the theoretical results, an embedded control system for the miniature quad-rotor has been developed. Thus, the analytic results are supported by experimental tests. Experimental results have validated the proposed control strategy.

AB In this paper autonomous formation control for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has been discussed and a real time solution has been put forward by benefiting General Purpose Graphical Processing Units (GPGPU) accelerated potential field approach while ensuring obstacle and collision avoidance in unknown environment by using real-time sensors. GPGPU accelerated real time formation control for UAVs was designed and the basic model of the approach has been explained in our previous work (Cetin and Yilmaz 2014). As the deficiencies of the previous approach, autonomous real time collision and coordinated obstacle avoidance features in unknown environments are also handled while maintaining formation flight conditions in this work. With these features, improved autonomous formation control approach is discussed as a real time solution. The computation is performed by using Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) as parallel computation architectures by benefiting from Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) type parallel algorithms. Classic binary map conversation, connected component labeling and minimum bounding box algorithms which are commonly used for image processing applications, has been evaluated for real time obstacle detection and avoidance features by developing GPGPU suitable parallel algorithms. Real-time solution has been developed by integrated these parallel algorithms with parallel Artificial Potential Field (APF) computation algorithm. Simulation results are proved that this novel autonomous improved formation control approach is successful and it would be used in real time applications like UAV formation flight missions.

AB This paper focuses on depth trajectory tracking control for a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) with dead-zone nonlinearity and saturation nonlinearity of thruster; an adaptive sliding mode control method based on neural network is proposed. Through the analysis of dead-zone nonlinearity and saturation nonlinearity of thruster, the depth trajectory tracking control system model of a ROV which uses thruster control signals as system input has been established. According to the principle of sliding mode control, an adaptive sliding mode depth trajectory tracking controller is built by using three-layer feed-forward neural network for online identification of unknown items. The selection method and update laws of the control parameters are also given. The uniform ultimate boundedness of trajectory tracking error is analysed by Lyapunov theorem. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by simulations.

AB This abstract describes the current research in the area of autonomously driving of a vehicle along different road courses [1]. The focus of this paper are two main aspects: firstly, parameters of the environment are being extracted from a video image coming from one single camera which is installed in or in front of the vehicle which is to drive along the road course; secondly, the incoming images from the camera need to be processed by a computer system that way, that not only Steering Commands for the vehicle are being generated (for accelerator / brake as well as the steering wheel) but the appropriateness of those Steering Commands is being constantly weighed and continuously improved over time. Consequently, the current work focuses on a system which is able to learn and to develop completely on its own the ability to steer different vehicles in different environments and combines research in the areas of Intelligent Image Processing, Machine Learning and Robotics.

AB Research activities concerning automatic guidance of agricultural vehicles - or implements - have led to various solutions. Sensors, including mechanical ones, global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), machine vision, laser triangulation, ultrasonic and geomagnetic, generate position, attitude and direction-of-movement information to supply control algorithms. Actuators, like hydraulic valves, are used to transform guidance information into changes of position and direction. In the European Union, depending on who is funding the project, the systems range from a PC, with a frame grabber or a GNSS receiver used to guide an implement along a predefined path with speeds up to 3 m/s, to a multiprocessor bifocal road recognition system for autonomous cars driving on motorways with a spaed of 130 km/h. Research projects are performed in universities, governmental institutions and manufacturers' laboratories, as well as in national and international consortia. This chapter provides an overview of guidance systems for agricultural vehicles or implements in Europe, without claims to completeness. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE Autonomous car; B-spline; optimal smoothing; road map; road modeling
ID ESTIMATION SYSTEM; GPS; ENVIRONMENTS
AB This paper proposes a map generation algorithm for a precise roadway map designed for autonomous cars. The roadway map generation algorithm is composed of three steps, namely, data acquisition, data processing, and road modeling. In the data acquisition step, raw trajectory and motion data for map generation are acquired through exploration using a probe vehicle equipped with GPS and on-board sensors. The data processing step then processes the acquired trajectory and motion data into roadway geometry data. GPS trajectory data are unsuitable for direct roadway map use by autonomous cars due to signal interruptions and multipath; therefore, motion information from the on-board sensors is applied to refine the GPS trajectory data. A fixed-interval optimal smoothing theory is used for a refinement algorithm that can improve the accuracy, continuity, and reliability of road geometry data. Refined road geometry data are represented into the B-spline road model. A gradual correction algorithm is proposed to accurately represent road geometry with a reduced amount of control parameters. The developed map generation algorithm is verified and evaluated through experimental studies under various road geometry conditions. The results show that the generated roadway map is sufficiently accurate and reliable to utilize for autonomous driving.

DE Micro aerial vehicle; Visual navigation; Autonomous drone race
ID TRAJECTORY GENERATION; QUADROTOR
AB Drone racing is becoming a popular sport where human pilots have to control their drones to fly at high speed through complex environments and pass a number of gates in a pre-defined sequence. In this paper, we develop an autonomous system for drones to race fully autonomously using only onboard resources. Instead of commonly used visual navigation methods, such as simultaneous localization and mapping and visual inertial odometry, which are computationally expensive for micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), we developed the highly efficient snake gate detection algorithm for visual navigation, which can detect the gate at 20 HZ on a Parrot Bebop drone. Then, with the gate detection result, we developed a robust pose estimation algorithm which has better tolerance to detection noise than a state-of-the-art perspective-n-point method. During the race, sometimes the gates are not in the drone's field of view. For this case, a state prediction-based feed-forward control strategy is developed to steer the drone to fly to the next gate. Experiments show that the drone can fly a half-circle with 1.5 m radius within 2 s with only 30 cm error at the end of the circle without any position feedback. Finally, the whole system is tested in a complex environment (a showroom in the faculty of Aerospace Engineering, TU Delft). The result shows that the drone can complete the track of 15 gates with a speed of 1.5 m/s which is faster than the speeds exhibited at the 2016 and 2017 IROS autonomous drone races.

AB Recent technology developments have turned present-day unmanned systems into realistic alternatives to traditional marine animal survey methods. Benefits include longer survey durations, improved mission safety, mission repeatability, and reduced operational costs. We review the present status of unmanned vehicles suitable for marine animal monitoring conducted in relation to industrial offshore activities, highlighting which systems are suitable for three main monitoring types: population, mitigation, and focal animal monitoring. We describe the technical requirements for each of these monitoring types and discuss the operational aspects. The selection of a specific sensor/platform combination depends critically on the target species and its behaviour. The technical specifications of unmanned platforms and sensors also need to be selected based on the surrounding conditions of a particular offshore project, such as the area of interest, the survey requirements and operational constraints.

AB This paper attempts to develop an efficient online algorithm for terrain following in completely unknown rough terrain environments while incorporating aircraft dynamics in the guidance strategy. Unlike most existing works, the proposed algorithm does not generate the flight path directly. The algorithm employs acquired information from the vehicle onboard sensors and rapidly issues appropriate Guidance Commands (GCs) at every point along the way. A suitable dynamic model is developed which takes the lags in the vehicle dynamics into account. The flight path forms gradually as a result of applying the GCs to the vehicle dynamics. Terrain-conforming capability afforded by this approach allows for autonomous and safe low-level flight in unknown mountainous areas. It considerably enhances the autonomy level of the vehicle and in the case of manned aircraft could significantly lead to pilot workload reduction. The proposed scheme is proven to be promising for online applications.

AB This paper presents a challenging panoramic vision and LiDAR dataset collected by an autonomous vehicle at Chungbuk National University campus to facilitate robotics research. The vehicle is equipped with a Point Grey Ladybug 3 camera, 3D-LiDAR, global positioning system (GPS) and inertial measurement unit (IMU). The data are collected while driving in an outdoor environment, which includes various scenes such as parking lot, semi-off road path and the campus road scene with traffic. The data from all sensors mounted on the vehicle are timely registered and synchronized. The dataset includes point clouds from 3D LiDAR, images, GPS and IMU measurement. The vision data contain multiple fisheye images covering 360 field-of-view from individual cameras of Ladybug3 at high resolution and accurately stitched spherical panoramic images. The availability of multiple-fisheye and accurate panoramic images may be used for development and validation of novel multi-fisheye, panoramic, and 3D LiDAR based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems. The dataset is collected to target various applications such as odometry, SLAM, loop closure detection, deep learning based algorithms with vision, inertial, LiDAR and fusion of visual, inertial and 3D information. To evaluate the algorithm, high accuracy RTK GPS measurements are provided for testing and evaluation.

AB Islanded microgrids with high shares of RES are more exposed to frequency disturbances. The largest generator is typically in charge of frequency regulation. This study tries to upgrade this monopoly to a competitive market. A novel framework is proposed to invite prosumers of any kind/size to participate in a local ancillary service market. A multi-criteria decision-maker is developed to select the proper service from the pool of bids. Flexibility Flags and Prosumer Deviation Index are introduced to quantify the behaviors of individuals and the stability of autonomous microgrids. Furthermore, an innovative reward/punishment framework is suggested for the billing of subscribers. In this method, the extra cost of the activated reserved power is solely compensated by disturbance makers rather than the conventional way of blindly charging all subscribers for frequency regulation. An urban microgrid including electric vehicles, micro combined heat/power generator, thermostatic loads, and kinetic energy storage is considered for the performance assessment. The results indicate that electric vehicles and flexible loads are privileged. Also, the bill of the planned loads for the regulation service falls from 46-48% down to 3-6% under the proposed framework while the cost of frequency regulation drops by 59% when the unnecessary reserved power is modified.

AB In order to assess the number of days per year an autonomous vehicle carrying a device to survey the envelope of the armour layer of rubble-mound breakwaters can sail close to the Sines' west breakwater, a general observed wave regime was established at a point in front of the breakwater, over depth contour -35.7m CD. For this, the relevant sea state parameters of 13463 wave records measured at the SINES 1D directional wave buoy were transferred to that point by linear interpolation of the results obtained in a transfer matrix between the measuring point and the point in front of the breakwater. This transfer matrix, specially created for this study, was defined by using the SWAN model for wave propagation assuming that the sea states could be characterized by a JONSWAP spectrum. The SWAN model and the nested grid scheme adopted proved adequate for this region. The results clearly show the influence of wave refraction on the sea states transferred to the point close to the breakwater. Assuming that the operational wave height limit of the autonomous vehicle is a significant wave height of 1.0 in, then from the general observed regime close to the break-water it may be concluded that the vehicle can operate in 27% of the time.

AB The tracking of inner-city intersections under realistic conditions, i.e. dense traffic, increases the number of artefacts, like occluded or distorted objects, compared to the tracking of free country roads or highways. This requires the best possible evaluation of all visible parts of the intersection, as well as of all available sensor data, and the use of as much information as possible about the geometry and relative motion in the intersection with respect to our experimental vehicle. Although occlusion of parts of an intersection by other vehicles has not yet been taken into account, the approach described here proves to be sufficiently reliable to track inner-city intersection models in real time.

AB This article presents a novel flight assistance system, obstacle avoidance system for teleoperation (OAST), whose main role is to make teleoperation of small multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) safer and more efficient in closed spaces. The OAST allows the operator to avoid obstacles while keeping a liberty of movement. The UAV is controlled through a 3-D haptic controller and the OAST amends the user input to increase safety and efficiency of the teleoperation. The design of the OAST is verified in computerized experiments. Moreover, a simulation involving 20 participants is carried out to validate the proposed scheme. This experiment shows that the OAST improves the completion time of the scenarios by 41% on average while reducing the workload of the operator from 57 to 27 points on the NASA Task Load Index test. The number of collisions with the environment is all but eliminated in these scenarios.

AB A coordinated team of mobile wireless sensor and actuator nodes can bring numerous benefits for various applications in the field of cooperative surveillance, mapping unknown areas, disaster management, automated highway and space exploration. This article explores the idea of mobile nodes using vehicles on wheels, augmented with wireless, sensing, and control capabilities. One of the vehicles acts as a leader, being remotely driven by the user, the others represent the followers. Each vehicle has a low-power wireless sensor node attached, featuring a 3D accelerometer and a magnetic compass. Speed and orientation are computed in real time using inertial navigation techniques. The leader periodically transmits these measures to the followers, which implement a lightweight fuzzy logic controller for imitating the leader's movement pattern. We report in detail on all development phases, covering design, simulation, controller tuning, inertial sensor evaluation, calibration, scheduling, fixed-point computation, debugging, benchmarking, field experiments, and lessons learned.

AB In this paper, an approach referred to as IoTsecM is proposed. This proposal is a UML/SysML extension for security requirements modeling within the analysis stage in a waterfall development life cycle in a Model-Based Systems Engineering Approach. IoTsecM allows the security requirements representation in two very well-known modeling languages, UML and SysML. With the utilization of this extension, IoT developers can consider the security requirements from the analysis stage in the design process of IoT systems. IoTsecM allows IoT systems to be designed considering possible threats and the corresponding security requirements analysis. The applicability of IoTsecM is demonstrated through applying it to analyze and represent the security requirements in an IoT real-life system in the context of collaborative autonomous vehicles in smart cities. In this use case, IoTsecM was able to represent the security requirements identified within the system architecture elements, in which all countermeasures identified were depicted using the proposed IoTsecM profile.

AB To solve the problem of existing methods of terrain matching having low precision in the areas with small eigenvalues, this work presents an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle optimal path planning method for seabed terrain matching navigation to avoid these areas. The method demonstrates high matching precision on each match area. This method has built the field map and value map that represents obstacle and matching performance, respectively, and the planning algorithm, which includes dynamic matching algorithm, cost function, search length and min-length, second-goal point and dynamic path planing algorithm, was proposed on basic of A star algorithm. Terrain-entropy and terrain-variance-entropy were introduced as criteria in the cost function to represent the matching performance. Then, joint criteria, which were calculated by a Back Propagation Neural Network, and fuzzy criteria were introduced and proved to be feasible through simulation experiments. The path planning method on the basic of fuzzy criteria, in terms of time consumption, was a more suitable method than the one based on joint criteria for the same terrain matching accuracy.

AB In recent years, there has been significant concern about the impacts of offshore oil spill plumes and harmful algal blooms on the coastal ocean environment and biology, as well as on the human populations adjacent to these coastal regions. Thus, it has become increasingly important to determine the 3D extent of these ocean features ("plumes") and how they evolve over time. The ocean environment is largely inaccessible to sensing directly by humans, motivating the need for robots to intelligently sense the ocean for us. In this paper, we propose the use of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) network to track and predict plume shape and motion, discussing solutions to the challenges of spatiotemporal data aliasing (coverage versus resolution), underwater communication, AUV autonomy, data fusion, and coordination of multiple AUVs. A plume simulation is also developed here as the first step toward implementing behaviors for autonomous, adaptive plume tracking with AUVs, modeling a plume as a sum of Fourier orders and examining the resulting errors. This is then extended to include plume forecasting based on time variations, and future improvements and implementation are discussed.

AB High-resolution velocity and hydrographic measurements, including data acquired by the autonomous underwater vehicle AUTOSUB-2, are used to provide a detailed description of the path of the deep and intermediate overflow waters in the north-west region of the Sicily Strait. There are two branches of the overflow: one passing through the western sill and the other passing through the eastern sill. The western branch of the overflow is seen to circulate around the central bank separating the two sills and head back towards the eastern Mediterranean before turning northwards again. It then follows a path similar to that of the eastern branch but at a deeper level. Although weak, the western branch is still identifiable 60 km downstream of the sills and lies below the eastern branch of the overflow. The net transport is estimated to be 1 Sv which is consistent with other studies. Evidence of tidal and sub-tidal variability in the overflow is also presented. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this article I analyze the emotional logic that urban transport drivers in La Paz assign to their vehicles in their life cycle. I pay attention to the emotive dimension of the "technical rationality" of practices of vehicle renewal, reuse, and maintenance-that is to say, the set of emotions, affections, and, especially, feelings that emerge in keeping the vehicle in good condition or in its possible replacement. This emotional dimension does not emerge as an autonomous sphere of technical rationality but rather is inherent to it. My hypothesis also points to its overflowing and kaleidoscopic character, since it transcends the individual experience by allowing us to analyze other phenomena of social life.

AB A framework for controlling groups of autonomous mobile vehicles to achieve predetermined formations based on a leader-following approach is presented. A three-level hybrid control architecture is proposed to implement both centralised and decentralised cooperative control. Under such architecture, the global-level formation control problem of n vehicles is decomposed into decentralised control problems between n - 1 pairs of follower and their designated leader. In the leader-follower control level, two basic controllers are proposed to make the following robot keep a relative position with respect to the leader and avoid collisions in the presence of obstacles. Then, graph theory is introduced to formalise specified formation patterns in a simple but effective way, and two types of switching between these formations are also proposed. Numerical simulations and physical robot experiments show the effectiveness of our approach.

AB In this article, a switching longitudinal and lateral semi-decoupled active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) strategy is proposed for motion control of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). To characterize the coupling property between longitudinal and lateral dynamics, a switching longitudinal and lateral semicoupled model is first developed. By utilizing the switching method, a so-called "two-stage ADRC" strategy is presented. It has two forms before and after the transition instant such that the boundedness premise for the derivative of the total disturbance can be removed. With the designed two-stage ADRC, a longitudinal and lateral semi-decoupled controller is then suggested to solve the motion control problem of UGVs. Finally, both stability analysis and comparison results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control strategy.

AB Interpretation of common-yet-challenging interaction scenarios can benefit well-founded decisions for autonomous vehicles. Previous research achieved this using their prior knowledge of specific scenarios with predefined models, limiting their adaptive capabilities. This paper describes a Bayesian nonparametric approach that leverages continuous (i.e., Gaussian processes) and discrete (i.e., Dirichlet processes) stochastic processes to reveal underlying interaction patterns of the ego vehicle with other nearby vehicles. Our model relaxes dependency on the number of surrounding vehicles by developing an acceleration-sensitive velocity field based on Gaussian processes. The experiment results demonstrate that the velocity field can represent the spatial interactions between the ego vehicle and its surroundings. A discrete Bayesian nonparametric model, integrating Dirichlet processes and hidden Markov models, is developed to learn the interaction patterns over the temporal space by segmenting and clustering the sequential interaction data into interpretable granular patterns automatically. We then evaluate our approach in the highway discretionary lane-change scenarios using the highD dataset collected from real-world settings. Results demonstrate that our proposed Bayesian nonparametric approach provides an insight into the complicated discretionary lane-change interactions of the ego vehicle with multiple surrounding traffic participants based on the interpretable interaction patterns and their transition properties in temporal relationships. Our proposed approach sheds light on efficiently analyzing other kinds of multi-agent interactions, such as vehicle-pedestrian interactions.

AB Cybertwin is the intelligent data analytics agent of the future that interacts with the Internet of Vehicles using 6G to make intelligent decisions for automotive application reliability. Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a vital component of future cybertwin-driven 6G networks due to its ability to control unfavorable wireless propagation conditions and achieves higher data rates. In this article, we explain the four major advantages that can be gained by using IRS-enabled cybertwin 6G vehicular networks, including overcoming blockages, Doppler mitigation, enhanced localization, and enhanced security. We also provide a case study showing that IRSs can increase the percentage of vehicles with line-of-sight links by 25% in a high traffic density of 60 vehicles/km, compared to the scenario where no IRS is deployed. Finally, we discuss future opportunities and open challenges to realize IRS-enabled cybertwin 6G vehicular networks.

AB Localization plays an important role in autonomous driving since a high level of accuracy in vehicle localization is indispensable for a safe navigation. Most of the motion planning approaches in the literature assume negligible uncertainty in vehicle localization. However, the accuracy of localization systems can be low by design or even can drop depending on the environment in some cases. In these situations, the localization uncertainty can be taken into consideration in motion planning to increase the system reliability. Accordingly, this work presents two main contributions: (i) a probabilistic occupancy grid-based approach for localization uncertainty propagation, and (ii) a motion planning strategy that relies on such occupancy grid. Thus, the proposed motion planning solution for automated driving is able to generate safe human-like trajectories in real time while considering the localization uncertainty, ego-vehicle constrains and obstacles. In order to validate the proposed algorithms, several experiments have been conducted in a real environment.

AB This paper discusses the problem of adaptive trajectory tracking control for remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). Considering thruster dynamics, a third-order state space equation is used to describe the dynamic model of ROVs. For the problem of unknown dynamics and partially known input gain, an adaptive sliding mode control design scheme based on RBF neural networks is developed using a backstepping design technique. Because of the saturation constraints of the thrusters, a first-order auxiliary state system is applied, and subsequently, a saturation factor is constructed for designing adaptive laws to ensure the stability of the adaptive trajectory tracking system when the thrusters are saturated. The proposed controller guaranteed that trajectory tracking errors are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUD). Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified by simulations.

AB Lately, a rising number of incidents between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and airplanes have been reported in airports and airfields. In order to help cope with the problem of unauthorized UAV operations, in this paper we evaluate the use of low cost SDR platforms (software defined radio) for the implementation of a jammer able to generate an effective interfering signal aimed at the GPS navigation system. Using a programmable BladeRF x40 platform from Nuand and the GNU radio software development toolkit, several interference techniques were studied and evaluated, considering the spectral efficiency, energy efficiency and complexity. It was shown that the tested approaches are capable of stopping the reliable reception of the radionavigation signal in real-life scenarios, neutralizing the capacity for autonomous operation of the vehicle.

AB Reflected sunlight can significantly impact the effectiveness of vision-based object detection and tracking algorithms, especially ones developed for an aerial platform operating over a marine environment. These algorithms often fail to detect water surface objects due to sunlight glitter or rapid course corrections of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) generated by the laws of aerodynamics. In this paper, we propose a UAV path planning method that maximizes the stationary or mobile target detection likelihood during localization and tracking by minimizing the sunlight reflection influences. In order to better reduce sunlight reflection effects, an image-based sunlight reflection reception adjustment is also proposed. We validate our method using both stationary and mobile target tracking tests.

AB A main problem in autonomous vehicles in general, and in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in particular, is the determination of the attitude angles. A novel method to estimate these angles using off-the-shelf components is presented. This paper introduces an attitude heading reference system (AHRS) based on the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) using the three-axis attitude determination (TRIAD) algorithm as the observation model. The performance of the method is assessed through simulations and compared to an AHRS based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF). The paper presents field experiment results using a real fixed-wing UAV. The results show good real-time performance with low computational cost in a microcontroller.

AB Autonomous intelligent cruise control design is a very important aspect of automation systems in future traffic patterns. A strategy for automated vehicle tracking is described, which keeps a velocity-dependent distance between the vehicles in order to provide a constant time-headway. As it is based on the principle of feedback linearization, highly structured and organized algorithms can be provided, without using special preferred operating points. Essential nonlinearities ave compensated for in a direct way, and an arbitrary linear behaviour can be imposed on the remaining system. In order to provide a fast transient behaviour and insensitivity to disturbances, the control laws include, besides a proportional part, derivative as well as integral terms. Furthermore, the system is prevented from having an overshoot, and comfort parameters can be adjusted. Owing to its high performance, this control system directly contributes to the enhancement of traffic safety.

AB This paper devotes to design and implement a hybrid artificial intelligent control scheme for a car-like vehicle to perform the task of optimal parking. The parallel parking control scheme addresses three issues: trajectory planner, decisional kernel, and trajectory tracking control. Design of the control scheme consists of several techniques: genetic algorithm, Petri net, and fuzzy logic control. The genetic algorithm is used to determine the feasible parking locations. The Petri net is used to replace the traditional decision flow chart and plan alternative parking routes especially in global space. The parking routine can be re-performed if the initially assigned route is interfered or when the targeted parking space has been occupied. The fuzzy logic controller is used to drive the vehicle along with the optimal parking route. The proposed scheme is put into several scenarios to test and verify its applicability and to manifest its distinguished features.

AB Determining the dynamics of surface vehicles and marine robots is important for developing marine autopilot and autonomous navigation systems. However, this often requires extensive experimental data and intense effort because they are highly nonlinear and involve various uncertainties in real operating conditions. Herein, we propose an efficient data-driven approach for analyzing and predicting the motion of a surface vehicle in a real environment based on deep learning techniques. The proposed multistep model is robust to measurement uncertainty and overcomes compounding errors by eliminating the correlation between the prediction results. Additionally, latent state representation and mixup augmentation are introduced to make the model more consistent and accurate. The performance analysis reveals that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods and is robust against environmental disturbances.

This is actually a problem not only of public health and ethics, but also of big data-not only in terms of all the different data that could be used to inform such decisions, but also in the sense of deciding how wide the scope of data should be. We identify three key different types of data, including basic data, advanced data and preference data, provide an ethical analysis of the use of these different types of data and of different ways of prioritizing between pedestrians and passengers, and propose four rules that can help set ethical priorities for ethical data use and decision making by automated vehicles.

AB This article proposes a coverage-based adversarial swarm defence algorithm. The defender swarm composed of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is assumed to have explosives onboard to intercept an adversarial swarm. The proposed approach consists of the following two steps: first, impact point optimization and, second, model predictive control (MPC)-based impact time control. The impact point optimization periodically optimizes impact points for the corresponding UAVs to maximize the coverage within the hostile swarm while minimizing the common impact time. The optimization domain is limited to a physically reachable area of UAVs with the common impact time. Besides, the MPC-based impact time controller is designed to ensure the multiple UAVs to arrive the generated time-varying impact points simultaneously. Numerical simulations are performed to prove the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed swarm defence algorithm.

AB As an important milestone in the exploration of Mars and small bodies, a new generation space vehicle "Phobos-Grunt" is planned to be launched by the Russian Aviation and Space Agency. The project is optimized around a Phobos sample return mission and follow up missions targeted to study some main asteroid belt bodies, NEOs and short period comets. The principal constraint is use of the "Soyuz-Fregat" rather than the "Proton" launcher to accomplish these challenging goals. The vehicle design incorporates innovative SEP technology involving electrojet engines that allowed us to increase significantly the mission's energetic capabilities, as well as highly autonomous on-board systems. Basic criteria underlining the "Phobos-Grunt" mission scenario, scientific objectives and rationale including Mars observations during the vehicle's insertion into Mars orbit and Phobos approach maneuvers, are discussed and an opportunity for international cooperation is suggested.

AB The emerging sector of offshore kelp aquaculture represents an opportunity to produce biofuel feedstock to help meet growing energy demand. Giant kelp represents an attractive aquaculture crop due to its rapid growth and production, however precision farming over large scales is required to make this crop economically viable. These demands necessitate high frequency monitoring to ensure outplant success, maximum production, and optimum quality of harvested biomass, while the long distance from shore and large necessary scales of production makes in person monitoring impractical. Remote sensing offers a practical monitoring solution and nascent imaging technologies could be leveraged to provide daily products of the kelp canopy and subsurface structures over unprecedented spatial scales. Here, we evaluate the efficacy of remote sensing from satellites and aerial and underwater autonomous vehicles as potential monitoring platforms for offshore kelp aquaculture farms. Decadal-scale analyses of the Southern California Bight showed that high offshore summertime cloud cover restricts the ability of satellite sensors to provide high frequency direct monitoring of these farms. By contrast, daily monitoring of offshore farms using sensors mounted to aerial and underwater drones seems promising. Small Unoccupied Aircraft Systems (sUAS) carrying lightweight optical sensors can provide estimates of canopy area, density, and tissue nitrogen content on the time and space scales necessary for observing changes in this highly dynamic species. Underwater color imagery can be rapidly classified using deep learning models to identify kelp outplants on a longline farm and high acoustic returns of kelp pneumatocysts from side scan sonar imagery signal an ability to monitor the subsurface development of kelp fronds. Current sensing technologies can be used to develop additional machine learning and spectral algorithms to monitor outplant health and canopy macromolecular content, however future developments in vehicle and infrastructure technologies are necessary to reduce costs and transcend operational limitations for continuous deployment in an offshore setting.

AB This paper addresses the stability and tracking control problem of miniature unmanned multirotor aerial vehicle (MUMAV) in the presence of bounded uncertainty. The uncertainty may appear from unmodeled dynamics, underactuated property, input disturbance and flying environment. Nonlinear robust adaptive sliding mode control algorithm is designed by using Lyapunov function. Robust adaptation laws are designed to learn and compensate the bounded parametric uncertainty. Lyapunov analysis shows that the proposed algorithms can guarantee asymptotic stability and tracking control property of the linear and angular dynamics of MUMAV system. Compared with other existing control methods, the proposed design is very simple and easy to implement as it does not require multiple design steps, augmented auxiliary signals and exact bound of the uncertainty. Experimental results on a miniature unmanned quadrotor aerial vehicle are presented to illustrate of effectiveness of the proposed design for real-time applications.

TI Intersection Auctions and Reservation-Based Control in Dynamic Traffic
   Assignment
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is maturing, and AVs are being test-driven on public roads. A promising intersection control policy, tile-based reservation (TBR), proposed by Dresner and Stone in 2004, could improve intersection capacity beyond the capabilities of optimized traffic signals. Although TBR has been studied in several microsimulation models, it has yet to be analyzed under user equilibrium behavior. In this study, TBR was modeled in the dynamic traffic assignment to draw on the extensive literature on vehicle routing behaviors. With the proposed model, TBR can be computationally simulated on large city networks, with the goal of solving the traffic assignment problem. TBR also arbitrarily prioritizes vehicle movement, and high-value-of-time travelers may be able to gain priority through intersection auctions, as suggested by the literature. An in-depth study of simple intersection auctions found that much of the benefit (over first-come, first-served prioritization) resulted from the randomizing effect of auctions giving larger queues of vehicles greater shares of the intersection capacity.

AB Most off-road vehicles employ fluid power to actuate their steering system. Although the actual force that turns the wheels is exerted by hydraulic cylinders, the critical element of a steering control system is the directional control valve. Auto-steering control is typically achieved by sending electrical signals to the valve solenoid drivers. A fuzzy logic controller was designed to create such steering signals. The fuzzy control algorithm was implemented in a hardware-in-the-loop electrohydraulic steering simulator. A set of 25 logic rules was defined to represent the four types of valve characteristic curve observed in different steering operations. The performance of the steering system depended on both the steering signal characteristics and the controller functionalities. The results obtained from this research provided some fundamental information for designing high-performance electrohydraulic steering controllers for autonomous off-road vehicles.

ID LATERAL MOTION CONTROL; AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE; SYSTEM
AB In this paper, a multimodel intelligent hierarchical control (MIHC) algorithm with dual systems is proposed to reduce the performance conflict between a path-tracking motion system and its subsystems during the motion control process of an intelligent vehicle (IV). The working principle of the MIHC algorithm is briefly introduced first, and the dynamic models of IV and the subsystems are constructed. Then, correlation controller models based on MIHC are established. Lastly, the influence of the subsystems on the trajectory tracking of IV is validated through simulations and hardware-in-the-loop test with various condition forms. Results show that the control performance of the automatic steering system has a great influence on the path-tracking accuracy compared with that of the antilock braking system.

AB During missions at sea, underwater vehicles are exposed to changes in the parameters of the system and subject to persistent external disturbances. These issues make the design of a robust controller a quite challenging task. This paper focuses on the design of an adaptive high order sliding mode controller for trajectory tracking. The main feature of the proposed control law is that it preserves the advantages of robust control. Moreover, it does not need the knowledge of the upper bound of the disturbance and it is easy to tune in real applications. Using Lyapunov concept, asymptotic stability of the closed-loop tracking system is ensured. The robustness of the proposed controller for trajectory tracking in depth and yaw dynamics is demonstrated through real-time experiments.

Although this marked a significant step forward in autonomous navigation, the current generation of UGVs are only capable of operating in controlled environments where the dynamics of a scene are well-understood. For example in both of the DARPA Grand Challenges, the participants were given detailed maps and the environment was carefully controlled during the competition. The next generation of UGVs will need to operate in uncontrolled environments where the terrain and infrastructure is uncertain and humans could be present. This paper discusses the challenges and current developments in the areas of sensing, localisation and planning to realise the next generation of UGVs.

AB The problem of trajectory tracking control of an underactuated autonomous underwater robot (AUR) in a three-dimensional (3-D) space is investigated in this paper. The control of an underactuated robot is different from fully actuated robots in many aspects. In particular, these robot systems do not satisfy Brockett's necessary condition for feedback stabilization and no continuous time-invariant state feedback control law exists that makes a specified equilibrium of the closed-loop system asymptotically stable. The uncertainty of hydrodynamic parameters, along with the coupled, nonlinear dynamics of the underwater robot, also makes the navigation and tracking control a difficult task. The proposed hybrid control law is developed by combining sliding mode control (SMC) and classical proportional integral derivative (PID) control methods to reduce the tracking errors arising out of disturbances, as well as variations in vehicle parameters like buoyancy. Here, a trajectory planner computes the body-fixed linear and angular velocities, as well as vehicle orientations corresponding to a given 3-D inertial trajectory, which yields a feasible 6-d.o.f. trajectory. This trajectory is used to compute the control signals for the three available controllable inputs by the hybrid controller. A supervisory controller is used to switch between the SMC and PID control as per a predefined switching law. The switching function parameters are optimized using Taguchi design techniques. The effectiveness and performance of the proposed controller is investigated by comparing numerically with classical SMC and traditional linear control systems in the presence of disturbances. Numerical simulations using the full set of nonlinear equations of motion show that the controller does quite well in dealing with the plant nonlinearity and parameter uncertainties for trajectory tracking. The proposed controller response shows less tracking error without the usually present control chattering. Some practical features of this control law are also discussed.

AB This research monetizes the access benefits of making shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) available to residents of Texas' Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex in the U.S. Residents' willingness to pay for SAV access under different fares and modes was estimated and compared across the region's 5,386 traffic zones, with emphasis on those housing the regions' most vulnerable or access-limited travelers. Assuming a $0.50/mi SAV fare, the average per-person-trip benefit is estimated to be $0.64 per trip. With $0.50/mi SAV fare, HV mode share will be reduced from 92.4% to 40.3%, while SAV will take 55.8% of the share. However, if HVs are then disallowed (removed from everyone s mode choice set) after $0.50/mile SAVs have been added, the average net impact is estimated to be -$0.31 per trip, across the metroplex. If HVs were to be replaced by access to SAVs, the impacts are positive, with region-wide average access benefits ranging from $0.16 to $0.33 per trip, depending on the SAV fare, and urban zones have a greater access benefit than rural zones with low SAV fare. Vulnerable populations and their neighborhoods were identified based on the share of persons living below the poverty level, income per capita, share of persons aged 65 years or older, those with disabilities, those owning no vehicle, and share of persons from a racial minority group. Results suggest that the access benefits of SAVs will be higher in locations/neighborhoods housing more vulnerable populations, but some vulnerabilities (e.g., those over age 65) results in lower levels of access improvement. Across those zones with highest shares of vulnerable persons, the range of differences in welfare impacts, from adding SAVs to travelers mode choice sets, widened as fares rose. As is true with many innovations, careful attention to disadvantaged groups and thoughtful policy (via smart contracting and SAV-user subsidies by public agencies, for example) can better ensure valuable access improvements for those with limited mobility and resources.

AB This letter considers the sub-6GHz downlink communications from base station (BS) to mobile vehicles (MVs), where reconfigurable intelligent surface enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (RIS-UAV) serves as a mobile passive relay. To achieve communication fairness, we aim to maximize the minimum throughput among all the MVs via jointly optimizing RIS passive beamforming, MV scheduling, UAV trajectory and power allocation. The formulated problem is a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem which is intractable to solve. Hence, the original problem is divided into three subproblems, joint passive beamforming and MV scheduling optimization, power allocation optimization, and trajectory optimization, which can be solved by the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. An alternating iterative optimization algorithm of the three subproblems is proposed to obtain the suboptimal solutions. Numerical results demonstrate the remarkable throughput gain of the proposed algorithm against other benchmarks.

AB Significant reduction in fuel consumption and NOx emissions can be achieved just by changing the driving along the road. In this paper, dynamic programming is employed to find two different driving profiles optimized for fuel consumption and NOx creation minimization in a diesel vehicle. Results, show that the fuel reduction driving cycle leads to fuel savings of 4% compared with the average consumption with arbitrary driving. The NOx reduction driving profile improves the emissions of arbitrary driving by a 34.5%. NOx oriented driving profile improves the emissions of the fuel-oriented cycle by a 38% at the expense of a fuel consumption penalty of 10%. This result points out the difficulty of a simultaneous NOx and fuel consumption reduction, stressing the efforts to be done in this field during the following years. Strategies followed and conclusions drawn from this paper are relevant concerning vehicle autonomy integration.

AB In this paper, we present a framework that applies multiple groups of autonomous snowplow robots for efficiently removing the snow from airfields. The main idea is to form temporary coalitions of vehicles, whose size depends on the width of the roads to clean. The robots of a coalition then arrange in formation and accomplish assigned sweeping tasks. In the paper the problem of snow shoveling is divided into the subproblems of task allocation and motion coordination. For the task allocation we propose a multi-agent method designed for the dynamic environment of airports. The motion coordination part focuses on generating trajectories for the vehicle formations based on the output of the task allocation module. Furthermore a specific feedback controller is introduced that achieves optimal breadthwise road coverage even in sharp turns. All components as well as the complete system have been verified in various simulations. Additionally the motion coordination approach was tested in laboratory hardware experiments.

AB Realisation of high-precision trajectory tracking is the key technology to achieve unmanned driving, which has an important impact on vehicle handling stability, safety and comfort. However, many confounding factors seriously restrict tracking performance and pose a great challenge to the design of the controller for tracking the desired trajectory. A comprehensive method that combines feedforward and backstepping sliding mode control is proposed for a four-wheel independent driving-four-wheel independent steering (4WID-4WIS) vehicle, which has the advantages of over-coupling, multiple degrees of freedom and flexible operation. The desired value is the target for the feedforward output of the controller, and the backstepping sliding mode control is used to overcome all kinds of disturbances. A mature and reliable Luenberger observer is designed to achieve good trajectory tracking performance for reducing some sensors. The proposed method is verified via MATLAB/Simulink simulation, which proved that the method has an excellent trajectory tracking performance.

AB A new conception in the development of Electronic Control Units (ECUs), which are also called On-Board Units (OBUs), is discussed in this paper from an ontological vision oriented to the compatibility of vehicles with future technologies in the automotive field. This work also provides a new methodology in the design of On-Board vehicle units. The proposed technique is based on the concept of modular electronic units that can change their functionality depending on the modules they are consisted of. The study was initially designed at the theoretical level, analysing the problems in the sector in the face of the coexistence between vehicles today and those that are bound to appear in the near future, and that will incorporate capabilities making them connected and even autonomous. Additionally, a fully operational prototype has been developed so as to ascertain the possibilities of the proposed solution.

AB Electric Vehicles (EVs) and hybrid Electric vehicles (HEVs) are going to reshape the future of the transportation sector. However, adopting large numbers of EVs and HEVs will impact the electric utilities as well. Managing the charging/discharging of substantial numbers of distributed batteries will be critical for the successful adoption of EVs and HEVs. Therefore, this paper presents a review study about the recent control and optimization strategies for managing the charging/discharging of EVs. The paper covers different control and operation strategies reported in the literature as well as issues related to the real time dispatching of EVs in the smart grids. In addition, challenges related to the stochastic nature of the driving characteristics of EVs are considered. Finally, some open problems related to the energy management of EVs will be presented.

AB The red traffic light running is a very common traffic violation. Nowadays, vehicles running red traffic lights are detected by sensors fixed on the streets. However a very small percentage of all traffic lights are equipped with such sensors. For this reason, this work proposes a red light runner detection to be performed by a system that consists of a camera and a computer embedded in the vehicle. An algorithm is also proposed to process the recorded videos and a prototype was implemented. The prototype's goal is to monitor work vehicles without any intervention in driving, acting only in as an educational tool. Tests are performed with video recorded in the streets of Belo Horizonte during the day and with a benchmark video using the implemented prototype. The results are compared based on the execution time and accuracy. The video processing took less one tenth of the video duration and the accuracy was about 95.8%.

ID SERVO CONTROL; LOCALIZATION
AB Unmanned vehicles are autonomous robotic systems that are fully or partially controlled by an operator remotely from a station. In the last two decades, massive amount of advancements have been observed regarding unmanned vehicles for both military and civilian purposes. Today majority of these vehicles require human guidance even for basic missions, thus, minimising the human intervention on such systems is one of the emerging research topics. To serve this purpose, this study proposes a new trajectory tracking algorithm using Mirage pose estimation method. Mirage employs target pixel errors in two-dimensional image plane and analytically calculates the robot's pose in three-dimensional Euclidean space. Therefore, complex computations are not needed and undesirable Euclidean trajectories are avoided since the vehicle's pose is directly controlled. Both simulations and real experiments were performed to verify the effectiveness of the method. The results show that the proposed method is a feasible alternative for vision-based Euclidean trajectory tracking with high accuracy and low complexity.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB In this paper, we model the autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval system (AVS/RS) as a semi-open queuing network (SOQN) and apply a matrix-geometric method (MGM) for analyzing it. An AVS/RS is an automated material handling system for the high-rise pallet storage area of a warehouse and allows pallets to be stored and retrieved quickly and efficiently from their storage locations. It is an alternative to the traditional crane-based AS/RS (automated storage and retrieval system). A combination of lifts and autonomous vehicles store pallets into and retrieve them out of their respective rack storage locations. The crane based AS/RS typically utilizes aisle-captive, mast-mounted cranes that can access any storage location in an aisle via horizontal movement of the mast and vertical movement of the crane on the mast.
   In an SOQN, it is assumed that an arriving job or customer is paired with another device and the two visit all the stations that must process the job in the appropriate sequence. After all operations are completed on the job, it exits the system, but the device returns back to a device pool and awaits the next customer. Sometimes a job may have to wait for a device to arrive at the pool or a device may have to wait for a job to arrive. Although closed queuing networks (CQNs) and open queuing networks (OQNs) model systems that require pairing of an incoming job with a device, unlike the SOQN, they ignore the time that a device waits for a job or the time that a job waits for a device.
   In the context of an AVS/RS, the jobs correspond to storage/retrieval (S/R) transaction requests and the autonomous vehicles (AVs) correspond to the devices. Because an AV may sometimes have to wait for an S/R transaction or vice versa, we model the AVS/RS as an SOQN. We build the queuing network by deriving general travel times of pre-defined servers. We model the AVS/RS system as a single-class, multiple-server, SOQN. Then, we solve the network using the MGM and obtain its key performance measures. We apply the MGM technique for solving the SOQN model to a warehouse in France that uses AVS/RS. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pipeline systems in naval ships with special combat purposes (such as warships) are frequently exposed to the risk of damage. It is necessary to detect and isolate such unexpected damage quickly via an autonomous recovery system in the pipelines to ensure the ship's survivability. This recovery system employs an autonomously controlled valve, which consists of a valve body, two pressure sensors, an actuator to open/close the valve, and a controller equipped with damage detection capability and a control algorithm. To enhance the reliability of the autonomous recovery system, this study first proposes a multistage control algorithm that can comprehensively consider the various damage scenarios in a naval ship and then suggests the design procedure for the autonomous piping system based on support vector machine (SVM). To design the suggested algorithm, a simulation model for the 1-D real-time flow analysis is first established, and its results for possible damage scenarios are used as training data for the SVM with the valve operation information for recovery of the piping system and to minimize the damaged area. A performance comparison of the representative control algorithms for the autonomous piping system is conducted via flow simulations under three representative damage scenarios. Finally, a real-scale testbed of the firemain in a naval ship is designed and constructed, and the effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated through experiments.

AB In this paper, we studied the effects of using Microsoft HoloLens 2 in a Metaverse-based collaborative mixed reality environment on the driver's social presence while using an autonomous driving system. In (semi-) autonomous vehicles the driver is the system's monitor, and the driving process becomes a secondary task. Our approach is motivated by the advent of Microsoft Mesh XR technology that enables immersion in multi-person, shared mixed reality environments. We conducted a user study comparing the effects on social presence in two scenarios: baseline and mixed reality collaboration. During the baseline condition, participants communicated and interacted with another person using Skype/Meet which was installed on a mobile tablet. In the second scenario the participants used the Microsoft Mesh application installed on HoloLens 2 to collaborate in a mixed reality environment where each user is represented by an augmented 3D avatar. During the experiment, the participant had to perform a social interaction tell-a-lie task and a remote collaborative tic-tac-toe game, while also monitoring the vehicle's behavior. The social presence was measured using the Harms and Biocca questionnaire, one of the most widely used tools for evaluating the user's experience. We found that there are significant statistical differences for Co-presence, Perceived Emotional Interdependence, and Perceived Behavioral Interdependence, and participants were able to easily interact with the avatar in the mixed reality scenario. The proposed study procedure could be taken further to assess the driver's performance during handover procedures, especially when the autonomous driving system encounters a critical situation.

AB Compaction-induced soil degradation is of growing importance as field machinery continues to increase in power and mass. Approaches to managing the impacts of soil compaction include minimisation (reduce load), remediation (tillage) and confinement (control traffic). Integrated 'swarms' of low-mass autonomous machinery have recently been suggested as a means of reducing compaction and an alternative to controlled traffic. In this study, combine and potato harvester machinery relationships were used to predict the specifications of potential low-mass harvesters for use in soil compaction modelling. Results suggested that combine harvester gross vehicle mass (GVM) must be less than 6 Mg to keep the modelled soil bulk density below 1.4 Mg m(-3). With this constraint, 6-9 small harvesters (similar to 50 kW) would be required to replace one Class 9 (>300 kW) harvester. A fleet of this size would require access to unloading facilities every 2.5-3 min for the modelled yield conditions. For root and tuber harvesting, which results in a high degree of soil disturbance, no low-mass harvester option was found that would avoid compacting the soil to unacceptable limits. Avoiding soil compaction while maintaining acceptable productivity will pose considerable design and logistics challenges for low-mass grain, root and tuber vegetable harvest machinery. The integration of controlled traffic farming (CTF) and medium-capacity autonomous machines (similar to 10-20 Mg GVM for combine harvesters) may be a better solution for both soil compaction and operational logistics than low-mass swarm technology.

AB In this work, we present a motion planning framework for automated vehicles to drive safely through intersections despite occlusions and the uncertain behavior of the surrounding vehicles. A context representation based on probably-free gaps is proposed as a means to provide, in occluded scenes, richer information to the motion planner compared to representations only based on observed objects. Our solution builds upon the path-velocity decomposition approach. Path planning is performed with state-of-the-art techniques, while a novel trajectory abstraction is used to reason about speed profiles without explicitly generating sequences of accelerations. To efficiently identify the best safe speed profile for every path candidate, a reachability-based analysis is also formulated. The proposed planning workflow is evaluated in roundabout scenarios. Our simulation study shows that the proposed context representation facilitates the decision-making in occluded scenes and that the reachability-based planning strategy is robust, computationally efficient, and outperforms a simpler reactive strategy.

AB Autonomous systems are expected to maintain a dependable operation without human intervention. They are intended to fulfill the mission for which they were deployed, properly handling the disturbances that may affect them. Underwater robots, such as the UX-1 mine explorer developed in the UNEXMIN project, are paradigmatic examples of this need. Underwater robots are affected by both external and internal disturbances that hamper their capability for autonomous operation. Long-term autonomy requires not only the capability of perceiving and properly acting in open environments but also a sufficient degree of robustness and resilience so as to maintain and recover the operational functionality of the system when disturbed by unexpected events. In this article, we analyze the operational conditions for autonomous underwater robots with a special emphasis on the UX-1 miner explorer. We then describe a knowledge-based self-awareness and metacontrol subsystem that enables the autonomous reconfiguration of the robot subsystems to keep mission-oriented capability. This resilience augmenting solution is based on the deep modeling of the functional architecture of the autonomous robot in combination with ontological reasoning to allow self-diagnosis and reconfiguration during operation. This mechanism can transparently use robot functional redundancy to ensure mission satisfaction, even in the presence of faults.

AB This paper's objective is to analyze the main real time risks in operation of autonomous marine systems, which follow from various levels of autonomy (LoA). High reliability management (HRM) is an established framework for assessing real-time operator performance in complex infrastructures. In this paper, the framework is applied to two cases representing different uses and autonomy levels: one on marine underwater robotics focusing on remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and subsea intervention, and the other addressing operation of a complex marine surface vessel with a dynamic positioning (DP) system. Usually, autonomous systems are associated with unmanned systems, but several manned systems (for example, ships with complex automation and DP systems) have specific control functionality that can be characterized as autonomous. This paper focuses on manned and unmanned systems with different levels of autonomy and major hazard potential. The most important research finding is having identified multiple, different operational states that vary across two or three LoAs, each state of operations having significantly different risks to be managed in real time. The application of the HRM framework highlights the importance of enabling reliable operator control and online risk management in the development of next generation autonomous marine systems.

AB A vision of 6G aims to automate versatile services by eliminating the complexity of human effort for Industry 5.0 applications. This results in an intelligent environment with cognitive and collaborative capabilities of AI conversational orchestration that enable a variety of applications across smart Autonomous Vehicle (AV) networks. In this article, an innovative framework for AI conversational orchestration is proposed by enabling on-the-fly virtual infrastructure service orchestration for Anything-as-a-Service (XaaS) to automate a network service paradigm. The proposed framework will potentially contribute to the growth of 6G conversational orchestration by enabling on-the-fly automation of cloud and network services. The orchestration aspect of the 6G vision is not limited to cognitive collaborative communications, but also extends to context-aware personalized infrastructure for 6G automation. The experimental results of the implemented proof-of-concept framework are presented. These experiments not only affirm the technical capabilities of this framework, but also push into several Industry 5.0 applications.

AB Safety and comfort are the two major requirements for the successful implementation of self-driving cars, which are anticipated to constitute the future generation of transportation. To create safe and effective self-driving car trajectories, a novel behavioral decision model is developed. First, a risk field model for driving activities based on vehicle kinematics and Eulerian solenoids is constructed. From there, the principle of least action is applied to produce the best trajectory points. Finally, nine typical unit scenarios are simulated by matlab's driving scenario designer to verify the feasibility of the decision-making algorithm. This study illustrates how an unified operational risk field can efficiently increase intersection passing efficiency while ensuring safety, utilizing the principle of least action. The experimental results show that in the scenario of unprotected left turn and more than 5 vehicles in the intersection, the decision-making model improves the pass rate by 23% compared with the TTI (Time To Intersection) threshold method.

AB This article presents a novel nonlinear robust wheel slip rate tracking control strategy for autonomous vehicle with actuator dynamics. First, a simple yet effective wheel slip rate dynamic model with the lumped uncertainty is established as the basis of the nonlinear robust wheel slip rate tracking control strategy design. Second, a nonlinear robust wheel slip rate tracking control law with lumped uncertainty observer is derived via the Lyapunov-based method. The lumped uncertainty observer is used to estimate and compensate the lumped uncertainty of the system by combining the radial basis function neural network with the adaptive laws for the unknown optimal weight vector of the radial basis function neural network. Then, a novel tracking differentiator is designed to calculate the derivative of the desired wheel slip rate, which is an essential aspect of the proposed nonlinear robust wheel slip rate tracking control law. Finally, the performance of the proposed control strategy is verified based on straight line braking maneuvers with three typical signals.

AB Path planning is one of the important autonomy abilities for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), whose main purpose is to plan an optimized and safety path autonomously during long-range navigation in an unknown environment. This paper proposes two path planners based on quantum ant colony optimization (QACO) and hybrid QACO for AUV in real time based on a sensor detection window. When AUV detects unknown static obstacles, the online path planners are scheduled to plan out a new path to avoid obstacles in the optimization window. To limit the yaw angle, a nonlinear fitness function is defined. In the hybrid QACO, an adaptive quantum gate and improved rules of pheromone updating are proposed according to the movement characteristic of AUV in the process of obstacle avoidance. A local search method is combined with QACO to improve the quality of the path planned by QACO and obtain a smoother path. Finally, the simulation experiments compare the performance of the proposed path planning methods with ant colony optimization.

AB The implementation of the autonomous unmanned aerial mobility is a game changer for the on-demand delivery service in the crowded urban setting. In this study, the first of its kind commercial unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) urban delivery program in China is targeted. Different from the traditional ground pickup and delivery services, the aerial mode considers not only the time window constraints, but also the spatial conflicts incurred during the take-off and landing operations of UAVs. To obtain the optimal flying routes of the focused problem, a mixed integer programming model is formulated. Due to its inherent complexity, the optimal schedule cannot be attained within acceptable time via the off-the-shelf solvers. To help speed up the solving process, a branch-and-cut based exact algorithm is proposed, together with a series of customized valid inequalities. To further accelerate, a greedy insertion heuristic is designed to secure high-quality initial solutions. In the numerical section, it is observed that the algorithm proposed in this paper can help solve the real-life on-demand UAV delivery problem to near optimum (within 5% optimality gap) within reasonable computation time (in 5 minutes). Note to Practitioners-With the increase of labor cost, the distribution cost increases very rapidly. In the meantime, the employment of automated vehicles for logistics reshapes the landscape of the urban last-mile delivery. As an efficient courier carrier, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is trending the autonomous delivery endeavour. When integrating UAVs into the urban delivery program, practitioners need to pay special attention to the scheduling of UAVs at the operational level in addition to the hardware of the UAVs. To help solve the UAV dispatch problem, we propose an online scheduling scheme, considering the spatial conflict constraints in the actual UAV operations. And an exact algorithm is designed to accelerate the solving process. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve near optimal dispatch plan with 5% optimality gap in 5 minutes. Furthermore, it is discovered that the demand pooling is an essential decision to make for UAV-based delivery. Longer pooling time can increase the UAV efficiency with more realized demand information, but too much pooling could lead to prolonged customer waiting and a low service level.

AB Characterizing evolving ocean environments is important to scientific, renewable energy, and military applications. However, performing meaningful characterizations of these resources is complicated by their spatiotemporal evolution and partial observability. In this work, we specifically consider the use of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with a deployable energy-harvesting kite that enables persistent missions. When the AUV parks itself on the seabed, the kite can deploy, harvesting significant amounts of energy through periodic figure-8 flight. Focusing on a Gulf Stream observational mission, we present a persistent planning algorithm that fuses Gaussian process (GP) modeling with model predictive control (MPC) to optimize AUV charging times to maximize the informativeness of the mission. Based on simulation studies using a mid-Atlantic bight, south Atlantic bight regional ocean model (MAB-SAB-ROM), we demonstrate a 20% reduction in the time required to traverse a given section of the Gulf Stream, which leads to a significant reduction in prediction error.

To cope with this practical problem abstracted from hydrodynamic noise measurement, an adaptive command filtered backstepping method with actuator dead-zone compensation is proposed. By introducing a damped exponential barrier functions, new tracking errors are defined to satisfy the prescribed performance requirements. The path following control method is theoretically based on the command filtered backstepping technique for handling the complexity explosion problem attribute to the repeating derivations. Moreover, the filter compensation mechanism is designed to eliminate the negative effect of the filter errors. To deal with the actuator dead-zone nonlinearity, a fuzzy logic system based dead-zone compensation method is developed that dose not need the inverse of the dead-zones. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the theoretical analysis, and the usefulness and potential of the new design scheme is revealed.

AB Predicting the future trajectories of surrounding agents has become an crucial problem to be solved for the safety of autonomous vehicles. Recent studies based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks have shown powerful abilities to model social interactions. However, many of these approaches focus on spatial interactions of the neighborhood agents but ignore temporal interactions that accompany spatial interactions. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Attention architecture (HSTA), which activates the utilization of spatial interactions with different weights, and jointly considers the temporal interactions across time steps of all agents. More specially, the graph attention mechanism (GAT) is presented to capture spatial interactions, the multi-head attention mechanism (MHA) is conducted to encode temporal correlations of interactions and a state gated fusion (SGF) layer is used to integrate spatial and temporal interactions. We evaluate our proposed method against baselines on both pedestrian and vehicle datasets. The results show that our model is effective and achieves state-of-the-art achievements.

AB The 3D face model of an individual includes a rich amount of information useful in many application sce-narios. Currently, the 3D reconstruction from images is obtained through multiple acquisitions at different distances and angles in a controlled environment. "In the wild' conditions, or inadequate acquisition sys-tems, can make 3D reconstruction a strongly error-prone problem. This paper illustrates a system that creates 3D face models from images taken by unmanned aerial vehicles in a completely automatic way. The proposed method is adaptive, dynamic, and contactless. No human intervention is required for im-age acquisition. Experimental results are described-in particular, the comparison between the ideal 3D reconstructions, obtained in controlled and cooperative conditions, and the reconstructions obtained by the drone during flight at different resolutions. The results show good overlap of the models and a low co-registration error. Given the free mobility of the UAVs, the system is suitable, among other applica-tions, for biometrics and open-air access control over large areas.

ID PERCEPTION
AB This paper describes a novel probabilistic sensor fusion framework aimed at improving obstacle detection accuracy and classification of various targets experienced in the Maritime RobotX Challenge. In both the 2014 and 2016 Maritime RobotX Challenges, it was found that detecting obstacles using LIDAR only and classifying obstacles using vision only can be challenged by environmental conditions, such as glare from the sun or by objects such as the spherical black buoys from the obstacle field that disperses LIDAR rays. In this paper, a new multimodal sensor fusion approach is proposed that combines data streams from perception sensors, such as LIDAR, RADAR, and cameras, to improve the robustness of detection and classification performance over a single sensor method. Using data collected from both the 2014 and 2016 Maritime RobotX Challenges, an evaluation of the perception framework is provided. The proposed detection and classification framework is nowbeing transferred to the queensland university of technology (QUT) autonomous surface vehicle to improve overall mapping accuracy and task execution.

AB In harsh marine environments, small variations in parameters of the underwater wireless charging system would lead to system detuning and dynamic fluctuation of DC output, thereby reducing power transfer efficiency and output performance. To achieve maximum efficiency tracking and DC output stabilizing, a decoupling control scheme bridging frequency tracking and DC output stabilizing for the wireless charging system of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is proposed. To be specific, the primary side of the wireless charging system adopts adaptive frequency tracking control (AFTC) to ensure that the operating frequency can always work near the resonant frequency during the charging process of the lithium battery. The secondary side adopts double closed-loop control of voltage and current based on buck converter such that the DC output can be stabilized for efficiently charging of lithium battery. Experimental results show that the proposed decoupling control scheme can realize frequency tracking on the primary side while the lithium battery can be charged with constant current and constant voltage, under maximum efficiency.

AB This paper suggests an integrated navigation system for an unmanned ground vehicle operating in an unknown cluttered environment. The navigator supports time-critical mobility making it possible for a mobile robot to reach a target from the first attempt without the need for a dedicated exploration and mapping stage. The robot only uses necessary and sufficient egocentric local sensory data collected on its way to the target. The construction of the navigation structure revolves around key properties of the harmonic potential field approach to motion planning. The robot's trajectory is well-behaved and direct-to-the-goal. It contains only the minimum number of detours necessary to accommodate the sensory data and maintain the robot in a safe, goal-oriented state. The navigation structure is developed and its theoretical basis is explained. Extensive experimental validation of its properties and performance is carried-out using the X80 robotic platform.

AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) constitute an automotive development carrying paradigm-shifting potential that may soon be embedded into a dynamically changing urban mobility landscape. The complex machine-led dynamics of CAVs make them more prone to data exploitation and vulnerable to cyber attacks than any of their predecessors increasing the risks of privacy breaches and cyber security violations for their users. This can adversely affect the public acceptability of CAVs, give them a bad reputation at this embryonic stage of their development, create barriers to their adoption and increased use, and complicate the business models of their future operations. Therefore, it is vital to identify and create an in-depth understanding of the cyber security and privacy issues associated with CAVs, and of the way these can be prioritised and addressed. This work employs 36 semi-structured elite interviews to explore the diverse dimensions of user acceptance through the lens of the well-informed CAV experts that already anticipate problems and look for their solutions. Our international interviewee sample represents academia, industry and policy-making so that all the key stakeholder voices are heard. Thematic analysis was used to identify and contextualise the factors that reflect and affect CAV acceptance in relation to the privacy and cyber security agendas. Six core themes emerged: awareness, user and vendor education, safety, responsibility, legislation, and trust. Each of these themes has diverse and distinctive dimensions and are discussed as sub-themes. We recommend that mitigating the cyber security and privacy risks embedded in CAVs require inter-institutional cooperation, awareness campaigns and trials for trust-building purposes, mandatory educational training for manufacturers and perhaps more importantly for end-users, balanced and fair responsibility-sharing, two-way dynamic communication channels and a clear consensus on what constitutes threats and solutions.

AB Most of the existing research on shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and road congestion pricing have studied the short-term impact on traffic flow. These types of studies focused on the influences on mobility and ignored the long-term impacts on regional job accessibility. Given this, from the perspective of land use and transportation integration, this study explored the long-term effects of SAVs and cordon-based congestion pricing on regional land use, transportation, and job accessibility. The contributions of this study have been summarized by the following three purposes. First, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this study was the first attempt to identify the long-term impact of the combination of these two technologies on regional job accessibility. Second, compared to the previous research methodology, this study adopted the land use and transportation integrated model (TRANUS model) and scenario planning to ensure the comprehensiveness and validity of the results. Third, this study analyzed the spatial heterogeneity of the impact of the combination of the two technologies on regional job accessibility in different areas with different built-environment attributes. To realize this purpose, this study quantitatively classified traffic analysis zones (TAZs) using data mining technology, i.e., factor analysis and clustering analysis. Results showed that the introduction of SAVs will contribute to job and population development in the charging zone and reduce the negative effect of road congestion pricing. From the perspective of reducing the average travel time between TAZs, the best strategy will be to implement SAVs alone, followed by integrated use of SAVs and road congestion pricing, while the worst strategy will be to implement the cordon-based congestion pricing policy alone. By comparison, from the perspective of improving regional job accessibility, the effect of introducing SAVs was better than that of road congestion pricing, while the combination of these two technologies was not superior to implementing SAVs alone.

AB Road users and the general population by and large recognise the value of vehicles with automated driving systems and features (otherwise typically known as Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)) in terms of road safety, reduced emissions and convenience, but are still wary of their capability, preferring the 'comfort zone' of human operator intervention. Motorcyclists and cyclists conversely, are vulnerable to human fallibility in driving, with the majority of crashes occurring as a consequence of other drivers' inattention. The transition period associated with the introduction of AVs will require AVs and motorcyclists/ cyclists sharing the road for a number of years yet, so we need to understand motorcyclists'/cyclists' perception of AVs. The question of interest here is whether motorcyclists/cyclists reflect the historical literature in this area by having higher levels of trust for human drivers over AVs, or whether they have higher levels of trust in AVs because it removes the 'human element' that has been proven to be particularly dangerous for them. Here we surveyed motorcyclists and cyclists about their trust in human drivers and AVs, and developed a novel suite of questions designed to interrogate the difference between trust in general versus trust as a concept of their own personal safety. Some of the salient outcomes suggest that motorcyclists have medium to low levels of trust for both human drivers and AVs, but are significantly more likely to believe that AVs are safer in terms of their own personal safety, such as prioritising or detecting the rider, compared to human drivers. This relationship varies with age and crash experience. The results here are consistent with the logic that motorcyclists/cyclists have a heightened sense of vulnerability on the road and welcome the introduction of AVs as a way of mitigating personal risk when riding. This insight will be crucial to the subsequent roll-out of AVs in the future.

AB Introduction: The final failure in the causal chain of events in 94% of crashes is driver error. It is assumed most crashes will be prevented by autonomous vehicles (AVs), but AVs will still crash if they make the same mistakes as humans. By identifying the distribution of crashes among various contributing factors, this study provides guidance on the roles AVs must perform and errors they must avoid to realize their safety potential. Method: Using the NMVCCS database, five categories of driver-related contributing factors were assigned to crashes: (1) sensing/perceiving (i.e., not recognizing hazards); (2) predicting (i.e., misjudging behavior of other vehicles); (3) planning/deciding (i.e., poor decision-making behind traffic law adherence and defensive driving); (4) execution/performance (i.e., inappropriate vehicle control); and (5) incapacitation (i.e., alcohol-impaired or otherwise incapacitated driver). Assuming AVs would have superior perception and be incapable of incapacitation, we determined how many crashes would persist beyond those with incapacitation or exclusively sensing/perceiving factors. Results: Thirty-three percent of crashes involved only sensing/perceiving factors (23%) or incapacitation (10%). If they could be prevented by AVs, 67% could remain, many with planning/deciding (41%), execution/performance (23%), and predicting (17%) factors. Crashes with planning/deciding factors often involved speeding (23%) or illegal maneuvers (15%). Conclusions: Errors in choosing evasive maneuvers, predicting actions of other road users, and traveling at speeds suitable for conditions will persist if designers program AVs to make errors similar to those of today's human drivers. Planning/deciding factors, such as speeding and disobeying traffic laws, reflect driver preferences, and AV design philosophies will need to be consistent with safety rather than occupant preferences when they conflict. Practical applications: This study illustrates the complex roles AVs will have to perform and the risks arising from occupant preferences that AV designers and regulators must address if AVs will realize their potential to eliminate most crashes.

AB Truck platooning and related autonomous vehicle coordination concepts have been proposed as sustainable ways to increase profits and improve service quality. Recently the concept of truck caravanning, a hybrid truck platooning with only one truck driver required per platoon, has been proposed in the literature. This paper describes the research effort in developing a model that can estimate the cost savings of truck caravanning. The motivation of the proposed model is to investigate if substantial monetary savings exist to justify the initial capital investment (both in equipment and infrastructure) required for the implementation of the truck caravanning concept. A linear programming model is developed and used to evaluate different size networks. Results from numerical experiments indicate that a caravan size of four trucks or greater is needed for significant cost savings to be achieved and that driver compensation is the most critical factor dictating profitability.

AB A new analytical model of air-to-ground (A2G) channel between a low altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a mobile station is derived. It is proposed for the dense urban environment at frequencies of (1, 2 and 5.8) GHz. The model terms are determined on the basis of ray-tracing simulation analysis for A2G channel and knife-edge diffraction theory. The model is compared with the other A2G model and shows better results of standard error and confidence interval validation. Furthermore, the effects of changing the frequency and UAV height on path loss and probability of line of sight are discussed. Therefore, the proposed model provides a simple and good estimation compared to the complicity of ray-tracing simulation.

AB This paper presents a novel approach to enhance unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomous navigation, without adding extra load to the vehicle. The proposed approach employs the UAV vehicle dynamic model to aid the navigation, estimation in a Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)-denied environment, without the need to model any part of the UAV, and avoids the requirement for special equipment during the modeling procedures typically required for vehicle dynamic model-aided navigation. Taking advantage of the available information from previous flights during availability of GNSS, and with the aid of a hybrid machine learning approach, the proposed technique is able to enhance the navigation accuracy during GNSS outage, despite the massive drift occurring from utilizing a low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU) during the outage period. Different scenarios are investigated to prove the robustness of the proposed technique, and the results are compared to two types of IMUs with the aid of an inverse mechanization IMU simulator.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle mounted base stations (UAV-BSs) are expected to become an integral component of future intelligent transportation systems, which can provide seamless coverage for vehicles on highways with poor cellular infrastructures. Motivated by the above, this paper proposes an aerial-ground integrated vehicular networking architecture, based on which a UAV-vehicle collaboration perspective is proposed. Specifically, an emerging vehicle-to-UAV (V2U) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) collaboration framework is first presented to facilitate diverse vehicular applications. Next, we investigate the coverage radius maximization problem by optimizing the UAV-BS altitude. Meanwhile, by taking the channel state information (CSI) feedback delay into account, we formulate a V2U communication sum rate maximization problem by optimizing the power control and spectrum allocation, which is constrained by the capacity and reliability requirements. Then, we derive the closed-form expression of optimal UAV-BS altitude. Afterwards, we decouple the formulated sum rate maximization problem, and devise an efficient algorithm with polynomial complexity, where the optimal power control and spectrum sharing are solved. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the maximum coverage radius and optimal UAV-BS altitude can be achieved by our proposed scheme in different urban environments. In addition, our designed scheme can effectively improve the V2U communication sum rate in comparison with the current works.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AV) aim to absolve humans from cumbersome performance of tasks and eliminate them from being of a hazard source. Some state that AV will become reality soon, diffuse faster than classical automotive innovations, others are even afraid of hype. Platoons on highways and public transport vehicles coping with limited driving situations at low speed will lead the way, rather than general-purpose fully-automated cars; a combination of driverless and human-driven cars over decades is foreseeable. AV are expected to provide various benefits for users and our society. Although significantly improved traffic safety is expected severe crashes will happen, rejecting the vision of "zero risk". Benefits are confronted by some "buts": Potentially new stress due to blind reliance on algorithms and loss of control; wireless communication channels between vehicles and infrastructure may introduce systemic failures and new entry points for hacker-attacks to safety-critical features and thus new high-profile risks. AV with systems, operating precisely in a dynamic environment including unpredictable behavior of others, represent an unprecedented technological challenge and level of complexity. They need to be understood as entire system; test-driving in dedicated fields and real environments, in particular, needs to be complemented by alternative ways and validated methods. Regarding release to public roads, two paradigms are pursued - "self-certification" or "type permission". Autonomous driving will involve a multiplicity of parties including new decision-making entities like learning algorithms and will enable innovative collective mobility concepts with vanishing traditional boundaries. Besides purely technological aspects, environmental, legal, socio-political and ethical issues need to be highlighted. Potential risks are double-sided and systemic by nature; they are coined by high complexity, uncertainty and ambiguity and multiple influencing factors. A stepwise governance approach with enlarged stakeholder participation seems to be advisable. As part of the process the public needs to be better informed and sensitized; expected benefits and concerns need to be balanced, safety targets to be fixed and verified. As commonly agreed transparency and communication should play a central role within the process.

ID AUTOMATION
AB Intelligent highly-automated systems (HASs) are increasingly being created and deployed at scale with a broad range of purposes and operational environments. In uncertain or safety-critical environments, HASs are frequently designed to seamlessly co-operate with humans, thus, forming human-machine teams (HMTs) to achieve collective goals. Trust plays an important role in this dynamic: humans need to be able to develop an appropriate level of trust in their HAS teammate(s) to form an HMT capable of safely and effectively working towards goal completion. Using Autonomous Ground Vehicles (AGVs) as an example of an HAS used in dynamic social contexts, we explore interdependent teaming and communication between humans and AGVs in different contexts and examine the role of trust and communication in these teams. Drawing on lessons from the AGV example for the design of an HAS used for an HMT more broadly, we argue that trust is experienced and built differently in different contexts, necessitating context-specific approaches to designing for trust in such systems.

AB Static area coverage of the heterogeneous autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) group is widely used in many fields. With the use of the centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) algorithm, the coverage problem can be resolved. However, the CVT method, which is optimized with the location evaluation function, cannot consider the heterogeneity of AUVs when the group performs the static area coverage task and will cause a waste of resources. In this paper, considering different AUVs' task requirements and detection capabilities comprehensively, we propose a coverage control optimization algorithm based on a biological competition mechanism (BCM). By using BCM, the task load of each AUV can be distributed consistently. In addition, we provide strict proof of the consistency of the algorithm based on the Lyapunov method. Simulation results demonstrate that with the proposed algorithm, the location distribution of the heterogeneous AUV group for area coverage is close to the balanced value, and the performance is better than the CVT algorithm for static area coverage.

AB This article addresses a dilemma about autonomous vehicles: how to respond to trade-off scenarios in which all possible responses involve the loss of life but there is a choice about whose life or lives are lost. I consider four options: kill fewer people, protect passengers, equal concern for survival, and recognize everyone's interests. I solve this dilemma via what I call the new trolley problem, which seeks a rationale for the intuition that it is unethical to kill a smaller number of people to avoid killing a greater number of people based on numbers alone. I argue that killing a smaller number of people to avoid killing a greater number of people based on numbers alone is unethical because it disrespects the humanity of the individuals in the smaller-numbered group. I defend the recognize-everyone's-interests algorithm, which will probably kill fewer people but will not do so based on numbers alone.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
ID STABILIZATION
AB Autonomous driving is an appealing research topic for integrating advanced intelligent algorithms to transform automotive industries and human commuting. This paper focuses on a hybrid model predictive controller (MPC) design for an adaptive cruise. The driving modes are divided into following and cruising, and the MPC algorithm based on simplified dual neural network (SDNN) and proportional-integral-derivative (PID) based on single neuron (SN) are applied to the following mode and the cruising mode, respectively. SDNN is used to accelerate the solution of the quadratic programming (QP) problem of the proposed MPC algorithm to improve the computation efficiency, while PID based on SN performs well in the nonlinear and time-varying conditions in the ACC system. Moreover, lateral dynamics control is integrated into the designed system to fulfill cruise control in the curved road conditions. Furthermore, to improve the energy efficiency of the electric vehicle, an energy feedback strategy is proposed. The simulation results show that the proposed ACC system is effective on both straight roads and curved roads.

   segmentation; ship navigation
AB Among various sensors used to recognize obstacles in marine environments, vision sensors are the most basic. Vision sensors are significantly affected by the surrounding environment and cannot recognize distant objects. However, despite these drawbacks, they can detect objects that radars cannot detect in nearby regions. They can also recognize small obstacles such as boats that are not equipped with an automatic identification system (AIS) or buoys. Thus, vision sensors and radar can be used in a complementary manner. This paper proposes a vision sensor-based model, called Skip-ENet, for recognizing obstacles in real time. Compared with ENet, the amount of computation is not significantly higher. Further, Skip-ENet can segment complex marine obstacles effectively by increasing the values for the class accuracy and mean Intersection of Union (mIoU). Moreover, this model enables even low-cost embedded systems to compute 10 or more frames per second (fps). The superiority of the proposed model was verified by comparing its performance with that of the conventional segmentation models, MobileNet, ENet, and DeeplabV3+.

AB Following the previous work on work-piece optimization and thermal analysis for flash-less cold forging of front and back hubs of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) propeller, the present study aims to obtain the optimum work-piece dimensions for the propeller blade. The work-piece used is of AISI AL6061 and the die material is die steel (AISI D2). The modeling and simulations are performed by using SOLID WORKS SP47.2007 and DEFORM-F3 3D, respectively. First, the work-piece thickness is optimized by keeping the area constant; then the area and flash thickness are varied and optimized. The result is successfully verified by thermal analysis and experiment. It is found that, for the present case, the optimum work-piece area, thickness, and flash thickness are 342.21 mm(2), 3 mm and 0.2 mm, respectively, and by using this work-piece, the trimming operation could be avoided in the actual forging operation which is done on a 100-ton C-type machine.

DE Fault detection; Fault diagnosis; Longitudinal control; Distributed

AB This paper presents a fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) method to enhance the reliability and safety for longitudinal control of an autonomous all-terrain vehicle (ATV). An integrated approach using decentralized and centralized FDD is proposed to optimize the tradeoff between sensitivity and robustness. While the decentralized approach is suitable for detecting faults in actuators and sensors directly connected to a single processor, it is sensitive to noises and disturbances and thus may result in false alarms. On the other hand, the centralized approach is based on information communicated between multiple processors, and it detects and diagnoses faults through analyzing concurrent computations of multiple hardware modules. However, its performance is still limited to isolating faults specifically in terms of components in the single hardware. To incorporate the advantages of both FDD approaches, a two-layered structure integrating both decentralized and centralized FDD is proposed and allows us to perform more robust fault detection as well as more detailed fault isolation. Finally, the proposed method is validated experimentally via field tests of an ATV.

AB It is often important to obtain the real-time location of a small-sized ground robotic vehicle when it performs autonomous tasks either indoors or outdoors. We propose and implement LOBOT, a low-cost, self-contained localization system for small-sized ground robotic vehicles. LOBOT provides accurate real-time, 3D positions in both indoor and outdoor environments. Unlike other localization schemes, LOBOT does not require external reference facilities, expensive hardware, careful tuning or strict calibration, and is capable of operating under various indoor and outdoor environments. LOBOT identifies the local relative movement through a set of integrated inexpensive sensors and well corrects the localization drift by infrequent GPS-augmentation. Our empirical experiments in various temporal and spatial scales show that LOBOT keeps the positioning error well under an accepted threshold.

AB This paper develops a novel approach to addressing the distributed situation awareness (SA) consensus problem for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm systems. SA consensus is an important condition for gaining decision-making superiority. However, because of the complexity and antagonism of the mission environment, the widely employed centralized architectures are unable to reach a distributed consensus. We address this urgent issue by proposing a systematic distributed SA consensus scheme, including a distributed optimization-based consensus reaching model, dual-loop decision-making framework, and novel coordination algorithm. Necessarily, we conduct convergence analysis on the proposed algorithm. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are verified by comparative simulations.

AB The current maintenance of railway infrastructure replies heavily on human involvement, requiring possession of the track section during maintenance, resulting in high costs and inefficient execution. This paper proposes an autonomous rail-road amphibious robotic system for railway inspection and maintenance tasks. By virtue of its road and rail-autonomous mobility, it is able to execute the complete maintenance execution flow in multiple phases. The system provides flexible track job location access, low-cost maintenance execution, and reduced track network possession. The payload mobile manipulator and sensor fusion enhance the system's capabilities for multiple types of inspection and repair. The design of a command and control system was guided by a rule-based expert system strategy to enable remote operation of the whole system. The developed demonstrator of a track wheel accompanied unmanned ground vehicle was integrated and demonstrated in both operational and realistic track environments with multiple testing activities of remote operation, navigation, accurate job detection, inspection, and repair, confirming effective job completion and logical human interaction. The proposed method produces an outstanding hardware-software integrated robotic inspection and repair system with a high level of technological readiness for autonomous railway maintenance and intelligent railway asset management.

AB A distributed cooperative control algorithm of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with directed topology is investigated in this brief. To overcome the actuator faults and external disturbance, incremental sliding mode formation controller is developed to realize the distributed coordination of the UAVs system, where an adaptive mechanism is utilized to deal with the chattering problem. Moreover, to reduce the adverse influence of input saturation, an auxiliary system is introduced to regulate the control signals. It is shown by Lyapunov method that the stability of the proposed algorithm can be guaranteed. A numerical example is given to illustrate that all follower UAVs can track the leader UAV.

AB This paper is focused on the intelligent control of vehicles with nonholonomic constraints. A new method to compute a fuzzy perception of the environment is presented, dealing with the uncertainties and imprecisions from the sensorial system and taking into account nonholonomic constraints of the vehicle. This fuzzy perception is used, both in the design of each reactive behavior and solving the problem of behavior combination, to implement a fuzzy behavior-based control architecture. Furthermore, teleoperation and planned behaviors, together with their combination with reactive ones, are considered; improving the capabilities of the intelligent control system and its practical application. Experimental results, of an application to control the ROMEO-3R autonomous vehicle, demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The system consists of two parts, a real-world part and an imaginary-world part. The real-world part is a feedback control system for the actual robot. In the imaginary-world part, the model of robot and the controller are adjusted continuously in order to deal with changes of dynamic properties caused by disturbances and so on. The system is designed to be suitable for a computer system with parallel processing ability. In this paper, the adaptability of the controller system is investigated by heading-keeping and path-following experiments in conditions where unpredictable disturbances are applied to the robot.

AB Underwater mobile sensor network (UWMSN) has become a promising ocean sampling and exploration technology. Various ocean phenomena can be effectively studied using these networks. This paper proposes a topology formation and networking using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for surveying the phenomena called plumes. The multi-AUV network considers a dimension similar to the plume spread and discusses the data collection by multiple AUVs from a required region of interest (RoI). The AUVs traverse in lawn mower patterns and communicate at predetermined points to send the collected data to a sink node on the ocean surface. This work develops a geographical location-based time division medium access (TDMA) protocol and various physical layer parameters. It further implements the topology and protocol stack using UnetStack software developed by the Acoustic Research Laboratory at the National University of Singapore. The simulated network scans the area of (30 km x 10 km) using five AUVs and performs link analysis to calculate packet delivery ratio (PDR), hop-by-hop delay, and throughput using UnetStack.

AB In this study, a finite-time velocity-free position consensus tracking control method is investigated for multiple autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) systems with heterogeneous uncertain dynamics. First, two distributed finite-time observers are developed for each follower AUV to estimate the state information of the leader and follower-AUVs' own. Subsequently, via the sliding mode control technique, a consensus tracking control algorithm based on the estimated information is designed, such that each follower AUV can track the leader's position trajectory within a finite-time, even in the absence of velocity measurement. Second, for the situation involving uncertain model parameters, a parameter adaptive sliding mode-based control algorithm is proposed to improve the performance of the closed-loop AUV system. The two controllers only require the position information of the AUVs. Finally, two numerical simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the two proposed control protocols.

AB The recent boom of autonomous driving nowadays has made object detection in traffic scenes a hot topic of research. Designed to classify and locate instances in the image, this is a basic but challenging task in the computer vision field. With its powerful feature extraction abilities, which are vital for object detection, deep learning has expanded its application areas to this field during the past several years and thus achieved break-throughs. However, even with such powerful approaches, traffic scenarios have their own specific challenges, such as real-time detection, changeable weather, and complex lighting conditions. This survey is dedicated to summarizing research and papers on applying deep learning to the transportation environment in recent years. More than 100 research papers are covered, and different aspects such as key generic object detection frameworks, categorized object detection applications in traffic scenario, evaluation metrics, and classified datasets are included. Some open research fields are also provided. We believe that it is the first survey focusing on deep learning-based object detection in traffic scenario.

DE Visual odometry; motion decoupling; bucketing; feature screening
AB Visual odometry uses image information to estimate the ego-motion of a camera and is a practical technique for the navigation of autonomous vehicles. This paper presents a novel stereo-based ego-motion estimation method for this purpose. The proposed method employs a motion decoupling strategy that uses a set of distant feature points to estimate the camera's rotation and a set of close feature points to estimate the translation. The set of feature points used for the motion estimation is carefully screened with bucketing plus aging techniques by considering their spatial distribution and temporal evolution. It has been found that the age of the tracked features has a significant impact on motion estimation. Older features generate less tracking error and should he selected for motion estimation. The proposed method is tested on the KITTI benchmark dataset and evaluated by comparing it with the existing visual odometry systems. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the calculation efficiency and, meanwhile, guarantee a satisfactory accuracy.

ID LOCALIZATION; NAVIGATION
AB Spatial information on the seabed is largely obtained by different methods of hydrographic survey. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are agile and generate high-quality survey data. Positional accuracy of AUVs is based on deployment of a combination of satellite positioning sensors and attitude sensors, as well as subsea acoustic positioning, platform, and hydrographic survey sensors. Establishing mathematical models to determine the coordinates and respective propagation of the uncertainties among these sensors is necessary to define the potential applicability of AUV hydrographic surveys. The objective of our study was to develop, evaluate, and apply a propagation algorithm for uncertainties associated with the spatial information generated by AUV hydrographic surveys. The results show that the critical components of the propagation model are the acoustic positioning performed via ultrashort baseline (USBL). Selection of the correct configuration of sensors and equipment can ensure that AUV hydrographic surveys meet the International Hydrographic Organization's (IHO's) specifications for total horizontal uncertainty (THU) associated with the precision required for minimum standards for hydrographic surveys.

AB In the present paper, in order to investigate the effect of free surface on drag and lift coefficients of an Autonomous Underwater vehicle,1 two phase flow Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations were solved using computational fluid dynamics. The numerical results were compared with those obtained from both numerical single phase flow simulations and the experiments conducted in the towing tank of the Subsea R&D Center at Isfahan University of Technology, using a 1:1 scale model of AUV developed in this center. The study was conducted at various submergence depths ranging from 0.87 to 5.22 of the AUV diameter and at the speeds of 1.5 and 2.5 m/s (corresponding to Reynolds numbers of 1.9 and 3.17 million, respectively). The variation of drag and lift coefficients of the AUV with the submergence depth were shown to be very sensitive to the AUV speed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the case of a natural disaster such as an earthquake, a micro air vehicle (MAV) would be very effective for surveying the site and environment in dangerous areas or narrow spaces that humans cannot access safely. In addition, it would be helpful for preventing secondary disaster. This paper discusses autonomous hovering control and guidance control of a micro flying robot (mu FR). Since a mu FR is very small and light, sensors such as a global positioning system (GPS) cannot be carried. So, the three-dimensional position of a mu FR is measured by using one charge coupled device (CCD) camera to recognize a marker attached to the mu FR. We adopted proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control because its performance can be increased by tuning, even when there is no model. Nevertheless, it is not easy to find the gain of the PID controller for the X and Y directions. Therefore, the first step that we took is modeling based on system identification and then we designed a model-based controller.

TI Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) mapping reveals coral mound

ID BAHAMA BANK
AB To make progress in understanding the distribution and genesis of coral mounds in cold and dark water, maps of morphology and oceanographic conditions resolving features at the 1-10 m scale are needed. An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) cruising 40 m above the seafloor surveyed a 48 km(2) coral mound field in 600-800 m water depth at the base of slope of Great Bahama Bank. The AUV acquired 1-3 meter resolution acoustic backscatter and bathymetry together with current vectors, salinity, and temperature. The multibeam bathymetry resolved more than 200 coral mounds reaching up to 90 m height. Mound morphology is surprisingly diverse and mound distribution follows E-W oriented off-bank ridges. Bottom currents reverse every 6 hours indicating tidal flow decoupled from the north flowing surface current. The AUV data fill the gap between low-resolution surface-based mapping and visual observations on the seafloor, revealing the dynamic environment and spatial relationships of an entire coral mound field.

TI Synthetic baseline navigation using phase-coherent acoustic

SO JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
LA English
DT Article
ID FILTER
AB The development of a synthetic baseline navigation technique that self-localizes an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) using intermittent acoustic communications signals received by a single transducer is described, along with field results from in-ocean tests. The method uses the phase measurement at the output of a second-order phase-locked loop to create fine-scale pseudorange estimates in addition to, or in the absence of, a one-way travel time measurement based on the arrival time of the acoustic data packet. These range measurements are incorporated by an adaptive particle filter. This technique allows the vehicle navigation system to take advantage of multiple phase-derived range measurements made over the duration of a communication packet. These measurements, when incorporated with an appropriate filter and vehicle kinematic model, improve vehicle navigation at no additional cost in navigation-specific acoustic transmissions. This approach was demonstrated and evaluated with data collected at-sea using a REMUS 100 AUV (Hydroid, Inc., Pocasset, MA). (C) 2019 Acoustical Society of America.

DE Adaptive control; collision avoidance; cooperative systems; motion
   control; parameter estimation; predictive control
AB In the presence of measurement noises and potential sensor malfunctioning, road condition identification by a single vehicle may not be reliable for motion planning and control of autonomous/intelligent vehicles. In this paper, we propose a distributed cooperative road condition estimation scheme for vehicular networks, involving a dynamic consensus algorithm to increase the reliability and accuracy of estimation. In this scheme, each vehicle individually estimates the road condition parameter using an online recursive least squares estimator, and disseminates it through the network to fuse the individual estimates through a consensus algorithm. It is shown that the proposed scheme well adapts to the variations in the road condition, improves the road condition estimation accuracy even with limited number of vehicles, and reduces the sensitivity to measurement noises. Simulation results demonstrate that estimation of the road condition using the proposed scheme improves the performance of maneuver planning for collision avoidance in slippery road conditions.

   Siamese network
AB Video object segmentation (VOS) is an essential part of autonomous vehicle navigation. Besides the accuracy metric, the real-time speed is very important for the algorithms of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised real-time method based on the Siamese network using a new polar representation. The input of bounding boxes are initialized rather than the object masks, which are applied to the video object detection tasks. The polar representation could reduce the parameters for encoding masks with subtle accuracy loss, so that the algorithm speed can be improved significantly. An asymmetric siamese network is also developed to extract the features from different spatial scales. Moreover, the peeling convolution is proposed to reduce the antagonism among the branches of the polar head. The repeated cross-correlation and semi-FPN are designed based on this idea. The experimental results on the DAVIS2016 dataset and other public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In cooperative localization for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), the practical stochastic noise may be heavy-tailed, and nonstationary distributed because of acoustic speed variation, multipath effect of acoustic channel, and changeable underwater environment. To address such noise, a novel heavy-tailed mixture (HTM) distribution is first proposed in this article, and then expressed as a hierarchical Gaussian form by employing a categorical distributed auxiliary vector. Based on that, a novel HTM distribution based robust Kalman filter is proposed, where the one-step prediction, and measurement likelihood probability density functions are, respectively, modeled as an HTM distribution, and a Normal-Gamma-inverse Wishart distribution. The proposed filter is verified by a lake experiment about cooperative localization for AUVs. Compared with the cutting-edge filter, the proposed filter has been improved by 50.27% in localization error but no more than twice computational time is required.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) mostly relies on an integrated navigation system, which consists of a strap-down inertial navigation system (SINS) and Doppler velocity log (DVL). The integrated system provides continuous and accurate navigation information when compared to stand-alone SINS or DVL. However, the dependence of DVL signals on the acoustic environment may cause any DVL malfunction due to marine organisms or strong wave-absorbing material. This article introduces a novel method utilizing Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory augmented by least squares support vector machines (LSSVMs) known as DS-LSSVM. The SINS and DVL data fusion are designed by DS theory whereas LSSVM models the SINS error. The virtual DVL is built by the proposed DS-LSSVM method, which makes AUV navigation purposes possible during the long-term DVL outage. The test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed virtual DVL signal estimation method. In addition, the positioning accuracy of the proposed method outperforms that of the LSSVM method.

AB A controller for an underwater glider is presented. Considered underwater glider is a torpedo-shaped autonomous underwater vehicle installing adjustable buoyancy bag and movable battery in it. The controller is composed of an LQR controller to maintain zigzag vertical movement for gliding and two PD controllers to control elevator/rudder angles. The LQR controller controls the pumping speed into the buoyancy bag and the moving speed to locate the battery. One of the PD controller controls the elevator angle to assist the LQR controller, and the other controls the rudder angle to adjust the direction of the underwater glider. A reduced order Luenberger observer is adopted to estimates the center of gravity of the glider and the buoyancy mass that are essential but cannot be measured. Mathematical simulation using Matlab proved the validity of the proposed controller to obtain better performance than conventional LQR only controller under the influence of sea current.

AB Quantitating explosive materials at trace concentrations in real-time on-site within the marine environment may prove critical to protecting civilians, waterways, and military personnel during this era of increased threat of widespread terroristic activity. Presented herein are results from recent field trials that demonstrate detection and quantitation of small nitroaromatic molecules using novel high-throughput microfluidic immunosensors (HTMI) to perform displacement-based immunoassays onboard a HYDROID REMUS100 autonomous underwater vehicle. Missions were conducted 2-3 m above the sea floor, and no HTMI failures were observed due to clogging from biomass infiltration. Additionally, no device leaks were observed during the trials. HTMIs maintained immunoassay functionality during 2 h deployments, while continuously sampling seawater absent without any pretreatment at a flow rate of 2 mL/min. This 20-fold increase in the nominal flow rate of the assay resulted in an order of magnitude reduction in both lag and assay times. Contaminated seawater that contained 20-175 ppb trinitrotoluene was analyzed.

TI Double degeneracy and chaos in a rate gyro with feedback control
SO JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION
LA English
DT Article
ID STABILITY
AB The analysis of a single-axis rate gyro subjected to feedback control mounted on a space vehicle that is spinning with uncertain angular velocity omega(2) about its spin of the gyro is presented. For the autonomous case in which omega(2) is steady, we examine the dynamics of the resulting system on the center manifold near the double-zero degenerate point by using center manifold and normal form methods. There exist a few kinds of bifurcations in the autonomous case such as pitchfork and Hopf bifurcations for local bifurcation analyses, and a saddle-connection bifurcation for global analyses. As singular velocity omega(2) of the space vehicle is harmonic, the Melnikov technique was used to give criteria for the existence of chaos in the gyro motion. The numerical simulations are performed to verify the analytical results in the form of phase portraits, bifurcation diagrams and Lyapunov exponents. In addition, chaotic motions of this system can be changed into regular motions by a small parametric perturbation with Lyapunov exponent calculations. (C) 1998 Academic Press Limited.

AB This letter presents a precise navigation technique for a scuba diver using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) as a positioning aid. We develop and evaluate the state estimation algorithms and communication architecture for diver navigation based on subsurface human-AUV teaming with no requirement for ocean current data or exact diver speeds. By depending on acoustic communication and commercial AUV navigation capabilities, our method provides a unique capability for localizing a diver's position during an extended mission, without the requirement to maintain visual contact with the diver during the mission, or to deploy acoustic beacons. We utilize the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Micromodem 2 for range-only single-beacon navigation between two kayaks serving as proxies for the diver and REMUS 100 AUV. Range and odometry measurements are fused in a factor graph using incremental smoothing and mapping 2 (iSAM2) with appropriate motion and measurement models to provide real-time diver position estimates given unknown ocean currents. Field experiments demonstrate an average online endpoint error of 4.53 meters after 400-meter transits.

AB This paper investigates the collision avoidance problem for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with limited detection range via deep reinforcement learning method in an unknown underwater environment. Firstly, to deal with both unknown static and dynamic obstacles, we introduce two different event-triggered mechanism to generate obstacle-related states and reward the safe collision avoidance action of AUV, respectively. Secondly, the complete state space is customized by combining the state of AUV itself and the state related to a target area. In addition, considering the task requirement of reaching a target area with the shortest path, the complete reward function is designed. Then, we propose a novel event-triggered soft actor-critic (ET-SAC) algorithm for AUV collision avoidance, and give its detailed pseudo code and implementation architecture. Finally, training and evaluation are carried out in the simulation platform we designed, including unknown static obstacle environment and unknown dynamic obstacle environment in 2D/3D space, and the results confirm that the proposed algorithm of this paper is feasible and effective for AUV to avoid collision safely.

AB Energy-efficient management and highly reliable communication and transmission mechanisms are major issues in Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSN) due to the limited battery power of UWSN nodes within an harsh underwater environment. In this paper, we integrate the three main techniques that have been used for managing Transmission Power-based Sparsity-conscious Energy-Efficient Clustering (CTP-SEEC) in UWSNs. These incorporate the adaptive power control mechanism that converts to a suitable Transmission Power Level (TPL), and deploys collaboration mobile sinks or Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to gather information locally to achieve energy and data management efficiency (Security) in the WSN. The proposed protocol is rigorously evaluated through extensive simulations and is validated by comparing it with state-of-the-art UWSN protocols. The simulation results are based on the static environmental condition, which shows that the proposed protocol performs well in terms of network lifetime, packet delivery, and throughput.

AB In the last few years, driver assistance systems are increasingly being investigated in the automotive field to provide a higher degree of safety and comfort. Lane position determination plays a critical role toward the development of autonomous and computer-aided driving. This paper presents an accurate and robust method for detecting road markings with applications to autonomous vehicles and driver support. Much like other lane detection systems, ours is based on computer vision and Hough transform. The proposed approach, however, is unique in that it uses fuzzy reasoning to combine adaptively geometrical and intensity information of the scene in order to handle varying driving and environmental conditions. Since our system uses fuzzy logic operations for lane detection and tracking, we call it "FLane." This paper also presents a method for building the initial lane model in real time, during vehicle motion, and without any a priori information. Details of the main components of the FLane system are presented along with experimental results obtained in the field under different lighting and road conditions. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4003091]

AB Inspecting and monitoring oil-gas pipelines, roads, rivers, and canals are very important in ensuring the reliability and life expectancy of these civil systems. An autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can decrease the operational costs, expedite the monitoring process, and be used in situations where a manned inspection is not possible. This paper addresses the problem of monitoring these systems using an autonomous UAV based on visual feedback. A single structure detection algorithm that can identify and localize various structures including highways, roads, and canals is presented in the paper. A fast learning algorithm that requires minimal supervision is applied to obtain detection parameters. The real time detection algorithm runs at 5 Hz or more with the onboard video collected by the UAV. Both hardware simulations and flight results of the vision-based control algorithm are presented in this paper. A fixed wing UAV equipped with a camera onboard was able to track a 700 m canal based on vision several times with an average cross-track error of around 10 m.

AB Track-before-detect (TBD) algorithms have been proven to circumvent the challenges of measurement-to-track association and have excellent robustness under harsh conditions. These benefits are aptly relevant for devel-oping unmanned passive sonar tracking systems deployed on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). This work considers the optimal maneuver problem exclusively for passive sonar TBD bearing-only localization al-gorithms, which is essential for an AUV to enhance observability autonomously. To solve this problem, we derive the Fisher information matrix (FIM) of the TBD algorithms, whose determinant reflects the observability. The determinant of the FIM is utilized as a cost function to design an optimal maneuver strategy (OMS). Although the cost function is nonconvex, we demonstrate that the optimal global solution maximizing the cost function can be analytically established. In addition, the designed OMS is extended to the condition with a course constraint to consider physical limitations in practical applications. Finally, simulated and real experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the designed OMS.

AB New approaches to 3D vision are enabling new advances in artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles, a better understanding of how animals navigate the 3D world, and new insights into human perception in virtual and augmented reality. Whilst traditional approaches to 3D vision in computer vision (SLAM: simultaneous localization and mapping), animal navigation (cognitive maps), and human vision (optimal cue integration) start from the assumption that the aim of 3D vision is to provide an accurate 3D model of the world, the new approaches to 3D vision explored in this issue challenge this assumption. Instead, they investigate the possibility that computer vision, animal navigation, and human vision can rely on partial or distorted models or no model at all. This issue also highlights the implications for artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, human perception in virtual and augmented reality, and the treatment of visual disorders, all of which are explored by individual articles.

AB Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors utilize a near-infrared (NIR) laser with a wavelength of 905 nm. However, LiDAR sensors have weakness in detecting black or dark-tone materials with light-absorbing properties. In this study, SiO2/black TiO2 core/shell nanoparticles (SBT CSNs) were designed as LiDAR-detectable black materials. The SBT CSNs, with sizes of 140, 170, and 200 nm, were fabricated by a series of Stober, TTIP sol-gel, and modified NaBH4 reduction methods. These SBT CSNs are detectable by a LiDAR sensor and, owing to their core/shell structure with intrapores on the shell (ca. 2-6 nm), they can effectively function as both color and NIR-reflective materials. Moreover, the LiDAR-detectable SBT CSNs exhibited high NIR reflectance (28.2 R%) in a monolayer system and true blackness (L* < 20), along with ecofriendliness and hydrophilicity, making them highly suitable for use in autonomous vehicles.

AB Distribution centers, which are essential to our society, are becoming increasingly important. Although the efficiency of an AVS/RS (Autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval system) makes it a promising system, there is still much to be studied regarding its effective use and design. This paper proposes a method of designing AVS/RSs through a quantitative consideration of group constraint by utilizing probability theory. The proposed algorithm also deals with the problem of designing the sizes of several buffers, and considers the effect of load fluctuations, which are important for real-world operation, by use of queuing network theory. Effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is shown with simulations of various number of groups, those of various safety factors for fluctuations, and those of various evasion rates for buffer overflow. The design results are shown to be much different from those which do not consider those factors. The results prove that the proposed method provides an accurate quantitative assessment of the AVS/RS's constraints.

AB Autonomous vehicles have to be able to predict whether a human driver will wait at an unregulated inner city narrow passage or not to adapt its behaviour accordingly. To this end, a driving simulator study was conducted in which participiants were subjected to different cooperation behaviours during their approach to a narrow passage. They were asked to rate their intention afterwards. From the recorded trajectories, features which are specific to the scenario are derived. Therewith, Random Forest and Conditional Random Field classifiers for both intention and behaviour prediction are trained. The results show that robust prediction of driver intention and behaviour is possible.

AB In foggy weather scenarios, the scattering and absorption of light by water droplets and particulate matter cause object features in images to become blurred or lost, presenting a significant challenge for target detection in autonomous driving vehicles. To tackle this problem, this study proposes a foggy weather detection method, YOLOv5s-Fog, based on the YOLOv5s framework. The model enhances the feature extraction and expression capabilities of YOLOv5s by introducing a novel target detection layer, SwinFocus. Additionally, this research incorporates decoupled head into the model and replaces the conventional non-maximum suppression method with Soft-NMS. Experimental results demonstrate that these improvements effectively enhance the detection performance for blurry objects and small targets in foggy weather conditions. Compared to the baseline model YOLOv5s, YOLOv5s-Fog achieves a 5.4% increase in mAP on the RTTS dataset, reaching 73.4%. This method provides technical support for rapid and accurate target detection in adverse weather conditions, such as foggy weather, for autonomous driving vehicles.

AB Underwater acoustic sensor networks are the efficient way to realize marine applications, which greatly rely on reliable data collection from underwater sensors. For this purpose, we exploit an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) as a mobile relay to reduce communication errors, and propose a frame error rate (FER)-based AUV relay algorithm. This algorithm will allow the AUV to avoid visiting the sensors that have sufficiently low FER to reduce cruising journey. For high-FER sensors, the AUV moves to the minimum-FER relay positions to relay their data. By analyzing the solution structure, we transform the FER minimization problem into an equation set to obtain the optimal relay position. The simulation verifies the validity of the equation set. Using the calculated optimal relay position, the FER-based relay achieves a lower average FER of data collection and lower energy consumption than the existing energy-consumption based relay algorithm.

TI Viewpoint: Turning streets into housing
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND LAND USE
LA English
DT Article
ID PARKING; VEHICLES
AB I argue that wide residential streets in US cities are both a contributor to homelessness and a potential strategy to provide more affordable housing. In residential neighborhoods, subdivision ordinances typically set binding standards for street width, far in excess of what is economically optimal or what private developers and residents would likely prefer. These street width standards are one contributor to high housing costs and supply restrictions, which exacerbate the housing affordability crisis in high-cost cities. Planning for autonomous vehicles highlights the overprovision of streets in urban areas. Because they can evade municipal anti-camping restrictions that restrict the use of streets by unhoused people, autonomous camper vans have the ability to blur the distinction between land for housing and land for streets. I propose two strategies through which excess street space can accommodate housing in a formalized way. First, cities could permit camper van parking on the rightof-way, analogous to liveaboard canal boats that provide housing options in some UK cities. Second, extending private residential lots into the right-of-way would create space for front-yard accessory dwelling units.

AB Biology is a useful tool when applied to engineering challenges that have been solved in nature. Here, the emulous goal of creating an insect-sized, truly micro air vehicle is addressed by first exploring biological principles. These principles give insights on how to generate sufficient thrust to sustain flight for centimeter-scale vehicles. Here, it is shown how novel manufacturing paradigms enable the creation of the mechanical and aeromechanical subsystems of a microrobotic device that is capable of Diptera-like wing trajectories. The results are a unique microrobot: a 60 mg robotic insect that can produce sufficient thrust to accelerate vertically. Although still externally powered, this micromechanical device represents significant progress toward the creation of autonomous insect-sized micro air vehicles.

DE Adaptive velocity region; Velocity region reconstruction; Potential
   velocity region
AB Path planning is the research hotspot of automatic driving technology. However, it is hard to ensure path safety for autonomous vehicle (AV) under multiple obstacles with various velocities. To solve this problem, an adaptive velocity region-based path planning system (AVR-PPS) which includes two parts, an adaptive velocity region controller (AVRC) and a path fusion controller (PFC), is presented in this work. The AVRC is designed to improve the velocity adaptivity through two units, a velocity region reconstruction unit (VRRU) and a potential field construction unit (PFCU). The VRRU restructures new velocity region to obtain the constraints of velocities, and the PFCU establishes an uniform potential field for the reconstructed velocity region to get the objective function for evaluating different velocities. The PFC is designed to generate the optimal path for obstacle avoidance using the constraints of multiple obstacles and the objective function derived from the AVRC. The path planning performance of the AVR-PPS is verified through simulation experiments on the MATLAB-CarSim simulation platform.

AB Todays' Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications majorly depend on either limited neighbouring traffic data or crowd sourced stale traffic data. Enabling big traffic data analytics in ITS environments is a step closer towards utilizing significant traffic patterns and trends for making more precise and intelligent decisions particularly in connected autonomous vehicular environments. Towards this end, this paper presents a Traffic Aware Data Offloading (TRADING) approach for big traffic data centric ITS applications in connected autonomous vehicular environments. Specifically, TRADING balances offloading data traffic among gateways focusing on vehicular traffic and network status in the vicinity of gateways. In addition, TRADING mitigates the effect of gateway advertisement overhead to liberate the transmission channels for traffic big data transmission. The performance of TRADING is comparatively evaluated in a realistic simulation environment by considering gateway access overhead, load distribution among gateways, data offloading delay, and data offloading success ratio. The comparative performance evaluation results show some significant developments towards enabling big traffic data centric ITS.

DT Article
AB Initiatives all around the world, funded by industries and governments, have devoted tremendous efforts to develop connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Nowadays, different CAV prototypes are being tested on the roads. The natural next step in the evolution of this area will be the provisioning of infotainment applications for enjoyable commutes and trips. In this article, we discuss the motivation for vehicular clouds for content delivery aimed to support applications for CAVs. First, we review the main concepts of vehicular clouds. Consequently, we discuss the needs of vehicular clouds to support content distribution for applications in CAV scenarios. In addition, we highlight fundamental challenges regarding vehicular cloud that need to be tackled: self-organization, service discovery and management, and resource discovery and allocation. By doing so, we analyze the current works in the literature and portray their limitations. Moreover, we provide some guidelines to deal with the challenges of vehicular clouds for CAV applications. Finally, we present future research directions that might be considered for the design of large-scale vehicular cloud infrastructures for CAV applications.

AB This paper presents an active disturbances rejecter controller (ADRC) for position and path following control of a fully actuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The unmodeled, undesirable dynamics and disturbances reduce the performances of classical controllers and complicate the design of appropriate and efficient controllers. In the proposed approach, the different modeling complexities; such as uncertain parameters, non-linearities, and external disturbances are considered all as a part of disturbance which is estimated in real-time by the extended state observer ESO, and effectively compensated from the control law. The ESO is also able to estimate the position and velocity of the system in real-time, in case where the full state measurement of the AUV is not possible during experiments. Computer simulations demonstrate the high ability of the AUV tracking control based on ADRC, to follow the desired trajectory in the horizontal plane and space with high precision, and showed high robustness and efficiency in rejecting the external and internal disturbances caused by significant changes in parameters of the system, and the added position disturbances.

AB This paper proposes a positioning strategy for a fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) airlifting wireless base stations driven by communication constraints. First, two schedulers that model the distribution of resources among users within a single cell are analyzed. Then, an UAV autonomous positioning strategy is developed, based on a fair distribution of the radio resources among all the users of all the cells in a given scenario, in such a way that the user bitrate is the same regardless the users' distribution and spatial density. Moreover, two realistic constraints are added related to capacity of the backhaul link among the UAVs and the ground station: the bitrate delivered per UAV and the total backhaul bandwidth shared among all the UAVs. Additionally, an energy consumption model is considered to evaluate the efficiency and viability of the proposed strategy. Finally, numerical results in different scenarios are provided to assess both the schedulers performance and the proposed coordinated positioning strategy for the UAVs.

AB Vision-based trail detection and autonomous scene understanding play a key role for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) working in complex outdoor environments such as isolated disaster sites. This paper investigates the problems associated with trail detection and tracking, as well as autonomous scene understanding using a quadrotor UAV. A framework that integrates support vector machine-based trail detection with a trail tracker is proposed to accomplish trail direction estimation and tracking at a low cost of computation and in real time. To accurately perform online parameter estimation, a performance test is designed and implemented to evaluate the accuracy. Moreover, the simple linear iterative clustering superpixel segmentation algorithm is utilized in the proposed system framework to guarantee the scene segmentation accuracy. Visual detection for significant objects or people is implemented by using single shot multibox detector algorithm. A series of experiments are conducted by using a quadrotor platform DJI M100 and experimental results show the validity and practicality of the proposed approach.

ID DOA ESTIMATION; REVERBERATION
AB Port-starboard ambiguity is an important issue in underwater tracking systems with anti-submarine warfare applications, especially for wireless sensor networks based upon autonomous underwater vehicles. In monostatic systems this ambiguity leads to a ghost track of the target symmetrically displaced with respect to the sensor. Removal of such artifacts is usually made by rough and heuristic approaches. In the context of Bayesian filtering approximated by means of particle filtering techniques, we show that optimal disambiguation can be pursued by deriving the full Bayesian posterior distribution of the target state. The analysis is corroborated by simulations that show the effectiveness of the particle-filtering tracking. A full validation of the approach relies upon real-world experiments conducted by the NATO Science and Technology Organization - Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation during the sea trials Generic Littoral Interoperable Network Technology 2011 and Exercise Proud Manta 2012, results which are also reported.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are increasingly being used in missions involving submarine cable detection, underwater archaeology, pipeline inspection, military reconnaissance, and so on. It is very important to realize AUV path tracking to accomplish these missions. In this paper, a fuzzy controller based on the established kinematic and dynamic models of AUV systems is presented to solve the AUV path-tracking problem. In order to design the fuzzy controller to exhibit good performance, we select the path length, smoothness, and cross-track position error as the multiple optimization performance indexes for the fuzzy controller. We propose the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to determine the parameters of the membership functions. Different scenarios are presented to test the performance of the proposed algorithm, including the straight line, sine curve, half-moon shape, Archimedean spiral, and practical paths. The results are given to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the fuzzy controller with the optimization of multiple performance indexes.

AB In this paper, the target tracking control problem is investigated for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the presence of actuator faults and external disturbances based on event-triggered mechanism. Firstly, the five degrees-of-freedom kinematic and dynamic models are constructed for an underactuated AUV, where the backstepping method is introduced as the major control framework. Then, radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and adaptive control method are made full use of estimating and compensating the influences of uncertain information and actuator faults. Besides, the relative threshold event-triggered strategy is integrated into the tracking control to further reduce communication burden from the controller to the actuator. Moreover, through Lyapunov analysis, it is proved that the designed controllers guarantee that the tracking error variables of the underactuated AUV are uniformly ultimately bounded and can converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. Finally, the effectiveness and reasonableness of the designed tracking controllers are illustrated by comparative simulations.

AB The widespread availability of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) will likely affect social change in terms of how people travel. Traditional methods of travel demand and land use modeling require vast amounts of data that could be expensive to obtain. Such models use complex software that requires trained professionals to configure and hours to run a single scenario. Alternative closed-form models that can quickly assess trends in potential CAV impact on the regional demand for shopping, entertainment, or dining land use does not exist. This research developed a closed-form model that considers the potential mode shift towards CAVs, possible changes in the propensity to travel, shopping trip avoidance from e-commerce, and greater accessibility for non-drivers. Model parameter estimation based on statistics from the greater Toronto area found that population growth from 2017 to 2050 alone could increase the demand for shopping, entertainment, or dining land use by nearly 60%. However, CAVs could double or triple that demand-implicating dynamic planning and environmental considerations.

DE Autonomous underwater vehicle; localization; mechanical scanning sonar;

ID AUV NAVIGATION; SLAM
AB This paper proposes a novel localization algorithm for an autonomous underwater vehicle equipped with a mechanical scanning sonar that has a slow frequency of data sampling. The proposed approach incrementally constructs a pose graph and conducts graph optimization to correct the robot poses. The construction of a pose graph has three stages: 1) scan generation which incorporates an extended Kalman filter-based dead reckoning algorithm that takes the robot motion into account while eliminating the sonar scan distortion caused by the motion; 2) data association which is based on Mahanalobis distance and shape matching for determining loop closures; and 3) scan matching which calculates constraints constructs pose graph. The constructed pose graph is then fed into a graph optimizer to find the optimal poses corresponding to each scan. A trajectory correction module uses these optimized poses to correct intermediate poses during the process of scan generation. Both simulation and practical experiments are conducted to verify the viability and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.

AB Terrain perception technology using passive sensors plays a key role in enhancing autonomous mobility for military unmanned ground vehicles in off-road environments. In this paper, an effective method for classifying terrain cover based on color and texture features of an image is presented. Discrete wavelet transform coefficients are used to extract those features. Furthermore, spatial coordinates, where a terrain class is located in the image, are also adopted as additional features. Considering real-time applications, we applied a neural network as classifier and it is trained using real off-road terrain images. Through comparison of the classification performance according to applied feature sets and color space changes, we can find that the feature vectors with spatial coordinates extracted using the Daub2 wavelet in the HSI color space have the best classification performance. Experiments show that using the wavelet features and spatial coordinates features improves the terrain cover classification performance. The proposed algorithm has a promising results and potential applications for autonomous navigation.

AB We quantify the value-at-risk of intervehicle collision and detachment for a class of platoons, in presence of communication time-delay and stochastic noise. Closed-form expressions for the risk measures are obtained as functions of Laplacian eigen-spectrum as well as their explicit approximations. We quantify several hard limits and fundamental tradeoffs among the risk measures, network connectivity, communication time-delay, and statistics of exogenous stochastic noise. Simultaneous presence of noise and time-delay in a platoon reveals an idiosyncratic behavior risk of collision and detachment, for instance, weakening (improving) network connectivity may result in lower (higher) levels of risk. We support our theoretical findings via multiple simulations.

AB In developing technologies of ultrafast (within 5 min) electric vehicle charging, problems occur related to the power supply. The charging station, an analog of a refueling station, should have an extremely irregular load with a high peak power. It might be located far from the possible point of connection to the power grid and should represent an object of decentralized power generation by means of an electrical energy storage system. We consider and compare an autonomous gas-turbine facility and a lead-acid battery as the possible power supply. We found an averaged statistically optimal relation between the gas turbine power (or the contracted power) and the battery capacity providing for minimum expenses, reduced to the service life, for creation and exploitation of the station of ultrafast charging of a given number of electric vehicles per day.

AB Navigators, shipping companies, port authorities and government maritime bureaus are interested in understanding the navigational risks of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) in order to decide how to develop port facilities and make navigational safety regulations for MASS in the future. Unfortunately, so far there are no historical data of actual marine accidents of MASS. Most of the autonomous ship researches focused on small autonomous boats in the past, few discussed the navigational risks of large MASS. Therefore, this study proposes a novel model for forecasting objectively and quantitatively the navigational risks of MASS. Firstly, this study constructs an analytical hierarchy frame for forecasting the navigational risk of MASS. Secondly, a novel computing method is developed to integrate the subjective navigator judgment of MASS and objective actual marine accident data of crewed merchant vessels, and then to measure the navigational risk of MASS. The results showed that the navigational risk of mechanical malfunction accident is the largest when oceangoing at sea; the navigational risk of collision is the largest when entering/exiting a port. The findings could be given for a reference while making policies in the future.

AB Path-tracking control of autonomous agricultural vehicles (AAVs) is a challenging issue, which is particularly true in highly unstructured field environments due to various uncertainties such as unknown bound magnitudes. For the purpose of tackling these uncertainties and increasing tracking accuracy, this brief designs a novel control approach for AAVs. To this end, the barrier function-based nonsingular terminal sliding mode (BFNTSM) is developed. The designed barrier function is incorporated into the controller to eliminate chattering and avoid gain overestimation. Furthermore, the adaptive barrier method guarantees that the sliding variable eventually converges to a predetermined region around zero within a finite time. Finally, a tractor-like experimental vehicle is built and experiments verified the superiority of the proposed technique.

In this work, we present the study of the dynamics of a USV (Unmanned Surface Vehicle) under the presence of two simulated environmental perturbations: marine induced waves and currents. The mathematical model of the vehicle is studied and the equations that describe the behavior of environmental perturbations are also described. A numerical simulation of the model considering the effects of these perturbations is carried out in three degrees of freedom. Also, a strategy of robust control-based Sliding Mode Control (SMC) is developed for counteracting the effects of the perturbations over the trajectory of the USV.

The paper first discusses the Trinity Robot Study Team, which has been responsible for developing ALVIN. We then illustrate the four generations of ALVIN, focusing on improvements made as the result of performance shortcomings and outright failures. The discussion considers the robot's body design, drive system, sensors, navigation algorithms, and vision systems. We focus especially on the vision and navigation systems developed for Trinity's fourth-generation IGVC robot, ALVIN IV. The paper concludes with a plan for future work on ALVIN and with a discussion of educational outcomes resulting from the ALVIN project. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB For underwater target exploration, multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have shown significant advantages over single AUVs. Aiming at Multi-AUV task allocation, which is an important issue for collaborative work in underwater environments, this paper proposes a Multi-AUV task allocation method based on the Differential Evolutionary Gray Wolf Optimization (DE-GWO) algorithm. Firstly, the working process of the Multi-AUV system was analyzed, and the allocation model and objective function were established. Then, we combined the advantages of the strong global search capability of the Differential Evolutionary (DE) algorithm and the excellent convergence performance of Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO) to solve the task assignment of the Multi-AUV system. Finally, a reassignment mechanism was used to solve the problem of AUV failures during the task's execution. In the simulation comparison experiments, the DE-GWO, GWO, DE, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms were carried out for different AUV execution capabilities, respectively.

ID DECOMPOSITION; DIAGNOSIS
AB Weak thruster fault feature extraction and fault severity identification methods for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) are studied in this paper. One of the traditional methods of fault feature extraction is based on wavelet transformation + modified Bayes (MB), then the grey relation analysis (GRA) method is used to identify the fault severity of the thruster. Above methods are efficient for strong fault of thruster, but for weak fault, problems exist in these methods are the ratio of fault eigenvalues to noise eigenvalues of the extracted feature is low and the identification accuracy of fault is not satisfactory. To overcome the above deficiencies, resonance-based sparse signal decomposition (RSSD) together with stochastic resonance (SR) + MB is proposed for thruster weak fault feature extraction. Euclidean distance together with grey relation (GR) method is proposed to promote the identification accuracy of weak thruster fault. Finally, the pool experiments are performed on Beaver II AUV, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in comparison.

AB This paper proposes an optimal approach for state estimation based on the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) Kalman filter using measurement sensors and rough pose obtained from LIDAR scan end-points matching. To obtain stable and optimal TS Kalman gain for estimator design, a linear matrix inequality (LMI) is optimized which is constructed from Lyapunov stability criteria and dual linear quadratic regulator (LQR). The technique utilizes a Takagi-Sugeno (TS) representation of the system, which allows modeling the complex nonlinear dynamics in such a way that linearization is not required for the estimator or controller design. In addition, the TS fuzzy representation is exploited to obtain a real-time Kalman gain, avoiding the expensive optimization of LMIs at every step. The estimation schema is integrated with a nonlinear model-predictive control (NMPC) that is in charge of controlling the vehicle. For the demonstration, the approach is tested in the simulation, and for practical validity, a small-scale autonomous car is used.

ID DESIGN
AB In this article, a multiload wireless power transfer (WPT) system is proposed for the power supply of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) cluster system. The segmented arc solenoid transmitter coil is designed to generate the concentrated magnetic field. The adjacent transmitter coils are reversely wound to form the strengthened magnetic field, which can improve the coupling between the transmitter and the receiver. The proposed coil structure is verified via finite element analysis based on ANSYS Maxwell. The transfer performance is analyzed and it is found that the transfer efficiency can be maximized against the voltage gain under the two-receiver case, which can also be extended to multiple-receiver case. An LCC-LCC compensated multiload WPT prototype was established and the experimental results verified the theoretical analysis and simulations. The output power of each receiver and the system efficiency can reach 500 W and 90% under the different angles between any two receivers.

SO IEEE ACCESS

DE Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs); learning fixed height histogram
   (LFHH); estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA); dynamic
   environments; path planning
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are robots that require path planning to complete missions in different kinds of underwater environments. The goal of path planning is to find a feasible path from the start-point to the target-point in a given environment. In most practical applications, environments have dynamic factors, such as ocean flows and moving obstacles, which make the AUV path planning more challenging. This paper proposes an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) based approach, termed as learning fixed-height histogram (LFHH) to solve path planning problems for AUVs in dynamic environment. The LFHH uses a learning transformation strategy (LTS) to improve its accuracy and convergence speed. Besides, a smooth method is employed to accelerate the speed of finding feasible paths. Moreover, a planning window is adopted to help handle dynamic factors. LFHH is tested in both complex 2-D and 3-D environments with time-variant dynamic factors, and experimental results validate the effectiveness of LFHH.

AB The development of marine petroleum exploitation becomes an important part of marine economy development gradually. Ocean bottom flying node (OBFN) is a kind of autonomous underwater vehicle which can explore marine petroleum and natural gas in large-scale deployment. This paper investigates the prescribed performance fault-tolerant trajectory tracking control method for an OBFN in presence of modeling uncertainties, ocean current disturbances, and thruster faults. By using a new performance function and an error transformation scheme, the proposed controller is able to achieve the desired tracking performance and the maximum convergence time is known as a priori. A disturbance observer is designed to deal with the influence of the modeling uncertainties, ocean disturbances, and thruster faults. The stability of the closed-loop OBFN system is proved by using Lyapunov theory. Finally, simulation results under different types of thruster faults illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed disturbance-observer-based prescribed performance fault-tolerant trajectory tracking controller.

AB The AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) is a dynamically stable platform for visual and acoustic observation of the deep sea floor. It can automatically take images of seafloor in high resolution. Two examples of observation carried out by the AUVs r2D4 and Tuna-Sand show significant advantage of the AUV and give us various ideas of AUV application. The first example is the dive to Kuroshima Koll by the hovering type AUV Tuna-Sand in June 2010 following the results of survey by the cruising type AUV r2D4 in January 2010. AUV Tuna-sand brought us photo images of the seafloor where unusual features in the side scanning sonar image captured by the AUV r2D4 were found. Second example is twelve dives over the gas-hydrate field in Toyama bay and took about 7,000 pictures from 2.2 meters above the floor in 1,000 meter depth. One of the mosaic shows that there are 3,500 snow crabs (Chionoecetes japonicas) in a 40 meters by 20 meters area.

They give several amusing examples: In the 16th century, we were told that all this new information being available to us now that books could be mass produced would overwhelm and flood our brains. In the 19th century, we were told that traveling above 30 km/h (18.6 mph) was unnatural and would lead to vomiting. A little later in the same century, we were told that the phone was a devil's invention, and will attract thunder, lightning, and evil spirits. Finally, in the 1950s, the TV was said to hypnotize its viewers and make them do insane things.

AB Recent studies have highlighted the need to improve our understanding of the relationship between glacial-front bathymetry and oceanography in order to better predict the behaviour of tidewater glaciers. The glaciomarine fjords of western Svalbard are strongly influenced by temperate Atlantic Water advected from the West Spitsbergen Current. Marine terminating (tidewater) glaciers locally influence many Svalbard fjords through fluxes of sediments, nutrients and freshwater, however their response to ocean warming and the imprint left by their recent retreat on the seabed remains unresolved. Here we present glacial front data collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) from four tidewater glaciers; Fjortende Julibreen (Krossfjorden), Conwaybreen, Kongsbreen and Kronebreen (Kongsfjorden). The seabed adjacent to the glacial terminus has been mapped providing high-resolution bathymetry (0.5 m-1.0 m grid cell size), side-scan and photographs with additional simultaneous oceanographic observations. The aim being to survey the glacial front submarine landforms, to identify the water mass structure and to observe any melt water plume activity. The bathymetry data displays a diverse assemblage of glacial landforms including numerous retreat moraines, glacial lineations, crevasse-squeeze ridges and sediment debris flows reflecting the dynamic depositional environment of the glacial front. The age of the features and the annual rate of retreat have been estimated using satellite remote sensing imagery to digitise the glacial front positions over time. The glacial landforms have been produced by the last few years of retreat as these glaciers gradually become land-terminating. The AUV also observed in-situ subglacial meltwater plumes at the two most active glaciers (Kongsbreen and Kronebreen) and an associated signature of warm Atlantic Water occurring at the glacier face. The presence of relatively warm, oceanic waters enhances subsurface melting, accelerating the ablation rate, while fresh (melt) water injection at depth influences local water mass structure and the wider fjord circulation. At the glacial fronts of Kongsbreen and Kronebreen sedimentation from subglacial meltwater plumes dominate the ice-proximal zone and settling from suspension is more prevalent away from the glacier. This study shows how sensitive dynamic glaciomarine systems are to change in the local marine environment and how the use of autonomous vehicles can greatly aid in the monitoring of glacial change by collecting simultaneous high-resolution in-situ datasets where vessel based observations are lacking.

AB We present Vehicle Energy Dataset (VED), a large-scale dataset of fuel and energy data collected from 383 personal cars in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA. This open dataset captures GPS trajectories of vehicles along with their time-series data of fuel, energy, speed, and auxiliary power usage. A diverse fleet consisting of 264 gasoline vehicles, 92 HEVs, and 27 PHEV/EVs drove in real-world from Nov, 2017 to Nov, 2018, where the data were collected through onboard OBD-II loggers. Driving scenarios range from highways to traffic-dense downtown area in various driving conditions and seasons. In total, VED accumulates approximately 374,000 miles. We discuss participant privacy protection and develop a method to de-identify personally identifiable information while preserving the quality of the data. We present a number of case studies with the dataset to demonstrate how VED can be utilized for vehicle energy and behavior studies. The case studies investigate the impacts of factors known to affect fuel economy and identify energy-saving opportunities that hybrid-electric vehicles and eco-driving techniques can provide. Potential research opportunities include data-driven vehicle energy consumption modeling, driver behavior modeling, calibration of traffic simulators, optimal route choice modeling, prediction of human driver behaviors, and decision making of self-driving cars. We believe that VED can be an instrumental asset to the development of future automotive technologies. The dataset can be accessed at https://github.com/gsoh/VED.

AB Road friction coefficient estimation is an important task in the perception system of autonomous driving vehicles. It enables the vehicle to perceive upcoming road friction conditions and helps the decision-making system to adjust the driving styles accordingly in case of potential traffic accidents caused by tire slip. However, to our knowledge, there is currently no recognized image benchmark dataset in this field with enough weather diversity for this task. And many existing methods are measured under different standards. In this work, we present a road friction coefficient estimation dataset that includes all-weather traffic conditions, which is called the winter road friction (WRF) dataset. Then, a novel friction coefficient estimation model based on multi-task distillation attention network (MDAN) is proposed to solve this task in an end-to-end way. The proposed model surpasses existing methods in this field and reaches 86.53% Acc on the WRF dataset. The WRF dataset will be made publicly available at https://github.com/blackholeLFL/The-WRF-dataset soon.

ID HYDRODYNAMIC OPTIMIZATION; PARAMETERS; DESIGN
AB This paper presents an optimization method for the design of the layout of an autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) fleet to minimize the drag force. The layout of the AUV fleet is defined by two nondimensional parameters. Firstly, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed on the fleets with different layout parameters and detailed information on the hydrodynamic forces and flow structures around the AUVs is obtained. Then, based on the CFD data, a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) method is used to describe the relationship between the layout parameters and the drag of the fleet. Finally, a genetic algorithm (GA) is chosen to obtain the optimal layout parameters which correspond to the minimum drag. The optimization results show that (1) the total drag of the AUV fleet can be reduced by 12% when the follower AUV is located directly behind the leader AUV and (2) the drag of the follower AUV can be reduced by 66% when it is by the side of the leader AUV.

AB PETREL, a winged hybrid-driven underwater glider is a novel and practical marine survey platform which combines the features of legacy underwater glider and conventional AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle). It can be treated as a multi-rigid-body system with a floating base and a particular hydrodynamic profile. In this paper, theorems on linear and angular momentum are used to establish the dynamic equations of motion of each rigid body and the effect of translational and rotational motion of internal masses on the attitude control are taken into consideration. In addition, due to the unique external shape with fixed wings and deflectable rudders and the dual-drive operation in thrust and glide modes, the approaches of building dynamic model of conventional AUV and hydrodynamic model of submarine are introduced, and the tailored dynamic equations of the hybrid glider are formulated. Moreover, the behaviors of motion in glide and thrust operation are analyzed based on the simulation and he feasibility of the dynamic model is validated by data from lake field trials.

AB Millimeter-wave(mmWave) communication is a key technology that enables autonomous vehicles and roadside units to collaborate in environment perception, thereby improving traffic efficiency and safety to a new level. Some recent works have focused on relay-based solutions to overcome inherent defects of mmWave, such as severe path loss and high sensitivity to obstacles. However, they both neglect the selfish behaviors of vehicles. Considering the application-oriented nature of vehicular communication, we propose an information value-based relay strategy in this article to characterize the selfishness of vehicles, which enables vehicles to make relay decisions through the value assessment of messages. Specifically, an extensible relay probability model is introduced to evaluate the information value based on the required awareness range of vehicles. By using stochastic geometry (SG), we construct an integrated three-dimensional (3D) system model for the vehicular relay-based vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) mmWave downlink, and derive the exact expressions of both blockage and outage probabilities. Simulations verify the analytical results and reveal the highest connection reliability of the vehicle exists and relies on both network- and application-related parameters. Moreover, the selfishness of vehicles deteriorates the connection reliability, especially under the conditions of the small information value of forwarded messages. These results laid the foundation for the further expansion of the information value-based relay strategies to a wider range of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) applications.

AB Power technology has long been the main problem that has plagued the realization of ocean exploration by autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). This paper introduces a new wave energy conversion device for AUV, which is sealed inside a closed floating body to avoid interaction with the marine environment. The system uses the gyroscopic effect to continuously convert the pitching motion of waves into electrical energy through flywheel rotation, and thus theoretically extend the endurance time of AUVs. In this paper, a mathematical model of the power generation device is established, and the effects caused by different parameters on the system behavior and energy output are analyzed. In order to reduce the cost of experiments, the energy conversion device is installed on an experimental platform that can simulate wave motion to observe its energy generation performance. The experimental results show that the established mathematical model can accurately reflect the real behavior of the power generation device on the platform under different wave conditions, and the energy output error is only 9.91%.

AB Power efficiency is a big concern in the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT). The power consumption of underwater acoustic communications is typically in the scale of watts, which may drain the battery of underwater devices quickly. Whereas, the power consumption of underwater magnetic induction (MI) wireless communications is in the scale of milliwatt. Therefore, this article devotes to combine the underwater MI and acoustic communications to form a power-efficient underwater hybrid wireless network. Specifically, we investigate the power-efficient autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) data collection schemes in an underwater MI and acoustic hybrid sensor network. We propose an alternating anchor nodes selection and flow routing (AANSFR) AUV data collection method, which alternately optimizes the AUV path planning and network data flow routing. The simulation results show that the proposed hybrid data collection scheme can significantly prolong the lifespan of underwater sensor networks.

AB For autonomous driving, it is important to obtain precise and high-frequency localization information. This paper proposes a novel method in which the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), wheel encoder, and lidar odometry are utilized together to estimate the ego-motion of an unmanned ground vehicle. The IMU is fused with the wheel encoder to obtain the motion prior, and it is involved in three levels of the lidar odometry: Firstly, we use the IMU information to rectify the intra-frame distortion of the lidar scan, which is caused by the vehicle's own movement; secondly, the IMU provides a better initial guess for the lidar odometry; and thirdly, the IMU is fused with the lidar odometry in an Extended Kalman filter framework. In addition, an efficient method for hand-eye calibration between the IMU and the lidar is proposed. To evaluate the performance of our method, extensive experiments are performed and our system can output stable, accurate, and high-frequency localization results in diverse environment without any prior information.

AB Dynamic soaring is an effective method to extract energy from wind shear to reduce energy consumption and extend flight duration. However, the design of the guidance-strategy for autonomous dynamic soaring is still suffering from the heavy computation load. In order to solve this problem, the aim of this paper is to propose a simple method to generate the guidance-strategy for autonomous dynamic soaring. Firstly, the flight path of dynamic soaring is modeled and solved by an open source optimal software named GPOPS. Secondly, the cycle of dynamic soaring is divided into four piecewise trajectories, and the characteristics of each are determined by some simple equations. Thirdly, the guidance-strategy based on the results of these equations is summarized. Simulation results indicate that the proposed guidance-strategy can present the characteristics of optimal flight very well, and it is practical and easy to be implemented by the on-board computer of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for its simplicity.

AB Mapping stationary objects is essential for autonomous vehicles and many autonomous functions in vehicles. In this contribution the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter framework is applied to automotive imagery sensor data for constructing such a map, where the main advantages are that it avoids the detection, the data association and the track handling problems in conventional multiple-target tracking, and that it gives a parsimonious representation of the map in contrast to grid based methods. Two original contributions address the inherent complexity issues of the algorithm: First, a data clustering algorithm is suggested to group the components of the PHD into different clusters, which structures the description of the prior and considerably improves the measurement update in the PHD filter. Second, a merging step is proposed to simplify the map representation in the PHD filter. The algorithm is applied to multi-sensor radar data collected on public roads, and the resulting map is shown to well describe the environment as a human perceives it.

AB The objective of vehicle search is to locate and identify vehicles in uncropped, real-world images, which is the combination of two tasks: vehicle detection and re-identification (Re-ID). As an emerging research topic, vehicle search plays a significant role in the perception of cooperative autonomous vehicles and road driving in the distant future and has become a trend in the future development of intelligent driving. However, there is no suitable dataset for this study. The Tsinghua University DAIR-V2X dataset is utilized to create the first cross-camera vehicle search dataset, DAIR-V2XSearch, which combines the cameras at both ends of the vehicle and the road in real-world scenes. The primary purpose of the current search network is to address the pedestrian issue. Due to varying task scenarios, it is necessary to re-establish the network in order to resolve the problem of vast differences in different perspectives caused by vehicle searches. A phased feature extraction network (PFE-Net) is proposed as a solution to the cross-camera vehicle search problem. Initially, the anchor-free YOLOX framework is selected as the backbone network, which not only improves the network's performance but also eliminates the fuzzy situation in which multiple anchor boxes correspond to a single vehicle ID in the Re-ID branch. Second, for the vehicle Re-ID branch, a camera grouping module is proposed to effectively address issues such as sudden changes in perspective and disparities in shooting under different cameras. Finally, a cross-level feature fusion module is designed to enhance the model's ability to extract subtle vehicle features and the Re-ID's precision. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed PFE-Net achieves the highest precision in the DAIR-V2XSearch dataset.

AB Introduction: Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) technology has deeply integrated advanced technologies in various fields, providing an effective way to improve traffic safety. However, it would take time for vehicles on the road to vehicles from human-driven vehicles (HDVs) progress to CAVs. Moreover, the Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) vehicle would degrade into the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) vehicle due to communication failure. Method: First, the different car-following models are used to capture characteristics of different types of vehicles (e.g., HDVs, CACC, and ACC). Second, the stability of mixed traffic flow is analyzed under different penetration rates of CAVs. Then, multiple safety measures, such as standard deviation of vehicle speed (SD), time exposed rear-end crash risk (TER), time exposed time-to-collision (TET), and time-integrated time-to-collision (TIT) are used to evaluate the safety of mixed traffic flow on expressways. Finally, the sensitivity of traffic demand, the threshold of time-to-collision (TTC), and the parameters of car-following models are analyzed based on a numerical simulation. Results: The results show that the ACC vehicle has no significant impact on the SD of mixed traffic flows, but it leads to the deterioration of TET and TIT, making the reduction proportion of TER slower. When the penetration rate exceeds 50%, the increase of CACC vehicles reduces traffic safety risks significantly. Furthermore, the increase in traffic demand and car-following parameters worsens traffic safety on expressways. Conclusions: This paper suggests that the CACC vehicles degenerate into ACC vehicles due to communication failure, and the safety risk of mixed traffic flow increases significantly. Practical Applications: The application of CAVs can improve the stability and safety of traffic flow. (C) 2020 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To standardize definitions and guide the design, regulation, and policy related to automated transportation, the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has established a taxonomy consisting of six levels of vehicle automation. The SAE taxonomy defines each level based on the capabilities of the automated system. It does not fully consider the infrastructure support required for each level. This can be considered a critical gap in the practice because the existing taxonomy does not account for the fact that the operational design domain (ODD) of any system must describe the specific conditions, including infrastructure, under which the system can function. In this paper, we argue that the ambient road infrastructure plays a critical role in characterizing the capabilities of autonomous vehicles (AVs) including mapping, perception, and motion planning, and therefore, the current taxonomy needs enhancement. To throw more light and stimulate discussion on this issue, this paper reviews, analyzes, and proposes a supplement to the existing SAE levels of automation from a road infrastructure perspective, considering the infrastructure support required for automated driving at each level of automation. Specifically, we focus on Level 4 because it is expected to be the most likely level of automation that will be deployed soon. Through an analysis of driving scenarios and state-of-the-art infrastructure technologies, we propose five sub-levels for Level 4 automated driving systems: Level 4-A (Dedicated Guideway Level), Level 4-B (Expressway Level), Level 4-C (Well-Structured Road Level), Level 4-D (Limited-Structured road Level), and Level 4-E (Disorganized Area Level). These sublevels reflect a progression from highly structured environments with robust infrastructure support to less structured environments with limited or no infrastructure support. The proposed supplement to the SAE taxonomy is expected to benefit both potential AV consumers and manufacturers through defining clear expectations of AV performance in different environments and infrastructure settings. In addition, transportation agencies may gain insights from this research towards their planning regarding future infrastructure improvements needed to support the emerging era of driving automation.

AB A real-time system focusing on lane sensing for autonomous vehicle guidance is described which runs on commercial hardware. For safe and comfortable vehicle control even on winding roads with bumpy surfaces, the ego-state of the vehicle as well as lane geometry needs to be known. This information is needed with high precision and reliability. For the sake of safety, two redundant sensor systems are employed. The first is a video camera that tracks visual lane boundaries such as white or yellow road markers. The second is a high precision location system using DGPS (Differential Global Positioning System) combined with an INS (Inertial Navigation System) for ego-state recognition. The achieved information is related to a high precision digital map. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article describes a novel scheme for autonomous component health management (ACHM) with failed actuator detection and identification and failed sensor detection, identification, and avoidance. This new scheme has features that are very superior to those with triple redundant sensing and voting, yet requires fewer sensors; it can be applied to any system with redundant sensing. Relevant background to the ACHM scheme is provided in this article. Simulation results for its application to a single-axis spacecraft attitude control system with a third-order plant and dual-redundant measurements of the system states are presented. The ACHM scheme fulfills key functions needed by an integrated vehicle health monitoring (IVHM) system. It is autonomous; is adaptive; works in real time; provides optimal state estimation; identifies failed components; avoids failed components; reconfigures for multiple failures, reconfigures for intermittent failures; works for hard-over, soft, and zero-output failures; and works for both open- and closed-loop systems. The ACHM scheme combines a prefilter that generates preliminary estimates of the system states, detects and identifies failed sensors and actuators, and avoids failed sensors in generating preliminary estimates of the system states with a fixed-gain Kalman filter that provides model-based state estimates, which are utilized in the failure detection logic, and generates optimal estimates for the system states. The simulation results show that ACHM can successfully detect, identify, and avoid sensor failures that are single or multiple; persistent and intermittent; and hard-over, soft, and zero-output types. It is now ready to be tested on a computer model of an actual system.

AB Civil infrastructure systems, such as harbors and airports, support transportation between international communities. Inspection of facilities in a large area is labor-intensive and time-consuming work, and the result can sometimes be inaccurate due to humans' limitations and inexperience. In this study, an autonomous aerial platform with a functional multipoint patrol module is developed to acquire images of inspected targets. It integrates a high-definition digital surface model (DSM) and a route-searching algorithm to optimize flying route planning. The collected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images are then subjected to a matching technique that automatically detects exposure positions and corrects image distortions. Finally, target facilities are extracted from multitemporal images using object detection techniques so that the status of the inspected targets can be tracked and evaluated. Case studies in real-world settings have been conducted. As this proposed approach refines the efficiency and reliability of the facility inspection task, significant improvements are expected to deal with wide area monitoring and flexibility management.

AB Being able to anticipate upcoming motion is known to potentially mitigate sickness resulting from provocative motion. We investigated whether auditory cues could increase anticipation and subsequently reduce motion sickness. Participants (N = 20) were exposed on a sled on a rail track to two 15-min conditions. Both were identical in terms of motion, being composed of the same repeated 9 m fore-aft displacements, with a semi-random timing of pauses and direction. The auditory cues were either 1) informative on the timing and direction of the upcoming motion, or 2) non-informative. Illness ratings were recorded at 1-min intervals using a 11-point scale. After exposure, average illness ratings were significantly lower for the condition that contained informative auditory cues, as compared to the condition without informative cues. This knowledge, i.e. that auditory signals can improve anticipation to motion, could be of importance in reducing carsickness in domains such as that of autonomous vehicles.

AB The introduction of multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems into agriculture causes an increase in work efficiency and a decrease in operator fatigue. However, systems that are commonly used in agriculture perform tasks using a single UAV with a centralized controller. In this study, we develop a multi-UAV system for agriculture using the distributed swarm control algorithm and evaluate the performance of the system. The performance of the proposed agricultural multi-UAV system is quantitatively evaluated and analyzed through four experimental cases: single UAV with autonomous control, multiple UAVs with autonomous control, single UAV with remote control, and multiple UAVs with remote control. Moreover, the performance of each system was analyzed through seven performance metrics: total time, setup time, flight time, battery consumption, inaccuracy of land, haptic control effort, and coverage ratio. Experimental results indicate that the performance of the multi-UAV system is significantly superior to the single-UAV system.

AB Path planning is an important issue for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) underwater mission. In this paper, an optimized fuzzy control algorithm is proposed for three-dimensional (3D) AUV path planning. Based on the sonar model, it can be used for path planning in the complex underwater environment. First, the path planning is established based on the two sonars arranged on the horizontal plane and vertical plane. On the environment information collected by sonars, the virtual acceleration and velocity of AUV in the three-dimensional space can be obtained through the fuzzy system with accelerate/break module which enables AUV to avoid dynamic obstacles automatically. Considering the fuzzy boundary choice has great subjectivity, the generated path cannot guarantee to be optimal. Therefore, in order to deal with this problem, two optimized methods are compared to do the optimization of the fuzzy set. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method can generate an optimal 3D path under three-dimensional underwater environment and can be used in real case in the future.

AB This paper presents the design and implementation of a turtle hydrofoil for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The final design of the AUV must have navigation performance like a turtle, which has also been the biomimetic inspiration for the design of the hydrofoil and propulsion system. The hydrofoil design is based on a National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) 0014 hydrodynamic profile. During the design stage, four different propulsion systems were compared in terms of propulsion path, compactness, sealing and required power. The final implementation is based on a ball-and-socket mechanism because it is very compact and provides three degrees of freedom (DoF) to the hydrofoil with very few restrictions on the propulsion path. The propulsion obtained with the final implementation of the hydrofoil has been empirically evaluated in a water channel comparing different motion strategies. The results obtained have confirmed that the proposed turtle hydrofoil controlled with a mechanism with three DoF generates can be used in the future implementation of the planned AUV.

AB The prototype of the on-board Obstacle Detection System (ODS), for GoA2 freight trains, was developed in the frame of H2020 project SMART. The developed prototype uses vision-based sensors, for environmental perception and obstacle detection. As severe image distortions while capturing imaging data can occur due to vibrations of the moving vehicle, the ODS of autonomous rail vehicles must be isolated from vibrations transmitting from the vehicle to have reliable image acquisition and post process analysis. The passive vibration isolation system was specially designed for suppression of moving rail vehicle vibrations during development of the ODS prototype. The paper presents the designed passive vibration system, as well as, experimental verification of its performance in operational conditions. Furthermore, two viscoelastic constitutive models, Voigt-Kelvin and Voigt-Maxwell, were applied to predict the dynamic response of vibration isolated ODS by using the real experimental data as system excitation.

AB In a two-autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) system, the hydrodynamic interaction between the two vehicles can have both beneficial and harmful impact on the system. In an aim to investigate the factors that have impact on the hydrodynamic interaction, spacing, appendages effect, drift angle of the smaller vehicle and depth from the water surface were chosen as the simulation variables. Results showed that the tandem configuration in which the larger vehicle led the system can have a combined drag reduction. The appendages can have a favourable effect on the follower and the whole system. The positions where the hydrodynamic interaction had largest and least impact on the system were also discussed. When the system sailed near the water surface, the hydrodynamic interaction was aggravated owing to the water surface impact. This paper can provide a guidance for the design of AUV configuration and manoeuvring strategy of a two-AUV system.

AB Steer-by-Wire system (SbW), in which the conventional mechanical linkages between the steering wheel and the front wheel are removed, is suited to active steering control, improving vehicle stability, dynamics and maneuverability. And SbW is implemented to autonomous steering control to assist the driver. However, the SbW vehicle contains unsolved important problems about fault tolerant function. For example, it is the detection of sensor fault and multiplicative fault simultaneously. Fault detection and isolation (FDI) is essential in fault-tolerant problems, and conventional FDI for SbW was based on Kalman filter. But this method has weak robustness and cannot detect sensor fault and multiplicative fault simultaneously. We propose a novel model-based fault detection and isolation method using sliding mode observer in the SbW vehicle, which contains measurement of sensor fault and multiplicative fault. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulations.

AB The conventional autonomous cruise and tracking system cannot transition and change its motion mode ac-cording to the underwater environment during operation, so it is of great significance to study the multi-mode switching of cruise control for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). In this paper, a Multi-Mode Adaptive Switching (MMAS) strategy for the Spherical Underwater Robot with Hybrid Thruster (HPSUR) was proposed, which provided the possibility for the robot to choose optimal control mode according to the unpredictable operating environment. Then, the dynamic and force of the hybrid thruster are analyzed to improve the accuracy of multi-mode switching, and the MMAS strategy is developed linking the attitude adjustment and switching problems. Furthermore, a series of multi-mode switching experiments were conducted using water-jet mode, propeller mode and hybrid mode. Finally, the experimental result was discussed, which verified the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed MMAS strategy. The proposed control strategy has a certain reference value for the multi-mode switching of propulsion devices.

SO OPTICS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
ID FRAMEWORK
AB A smart vector-inspired optical vision guiding (VIOVG) method for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) docking and formation is proposed. Unlike traditional optical guiding methods based on LED arrays, the method is inspired by a vector, and uses four laser diodes to form a wing-light pattern to realize smart optical guiding for AUVs. Due to the light scattering effect from water, the four laser diodes can emit four bright and slim laser beams in water, which can be captured by underwater cameras. The intersections of the laser beams form wing-lights as markers for AUV distance and pose estimation. The wing-light pattern is easily tuned and extended by changing the propagation direction and the power of the laser beams beyond the limitation of the physical size of the AUV or docking station. The simulations and experiments show that the proposed method can achieve high precision positioning. A relative distance error of 3.35% is achieved in a positioning experiment at similar to 10 m. It has great potential for AUV docking and formation, especially for small AUVs. (C) 2022 Optica Publishing Group

AB How does the spatial context shape early innovation trajectories and how will this influence the directionality of transitions? We elaborate these questions for the case of transitions in personal mobility, focusing on emerging trajectories of electric vehicles and autonomous driving. We analyze how the dynamics depend on whether innovation and transition strategies are primarily geared towards urban or rural contexts. In order to identify potentially diverging trajectories, we specify socio-technical regime structures at two levels: the level of service regimes (i.e. rules that relate to specific means of transport, like the car) and the level of the sectoral regime (i.e. rules that regulate the interplay between the different service regimes). We will show that depending on whether the early innovation strategies are oriented at rural or urban contexts, quite different directionalities can result both regarding the technological trajectory of the new service option, but also regarding the overall sector configuration.

AB The hydrodynamic characteristics of multi-propeller autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) is usually complicated and it is difficult to obtain an accurate mathematical model. A modeling method based on CFD calculation and maximum likelihood identification algorithm is proposed for this problem. Firstly, rough hydrodynamic parameters of AUV hull are obtained by CFD calculation. Secondly, on the basis of rough parameters, a maximum likelihood identification algorithm is proposed to adjust the parameters and improve the model precision. Besides, the method to improve the convergence of identification algorithm is analyzed by considering the characteristics of AUV model structure. Finally, the identification algorithm and identification results were validated with experimental data. It was found that this method has good convergence and adaptability. In particular, the identification results of turning force and torque parameters are highly consistent in different identification experiments, which indicates that this method can well extract the maneuvering characteristics of AUVs, thus contributing to the controller design of AUVs. The research of this paper has potential application for the modeling and control of multi-propeller AUVs.

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method has been used to model the CWC tests. The hydrodynamic coefficients estimated by CFD are compared with the prediction of experiments to verify the accuracy of simulations. In order to study the effect of side wall on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the AUV in full scale captive model tests, this paper uses the CWC non-dimensional width parameters to quantify the correlation between the CWC width and hydrodynamic coefficients of the chosen model. The result shows that the hydrodynamic coefficients tend to be constant with the CWC width parameters increasing. Moreover, the side wall has a greater effect than the struts.

AB Robust object tracking and maneuver estimation methods play significant role in the design of advanced driver assistant systems and self-driving cars. As an input to situation understanding and awareness, the performance of such algorithms influences the overall effectiveness of motion planning and plays high role in safety. The paper examines the suitability of different probabilistic state estimation methods, namely, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the more general Particle Filter (PF) with the addition of the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) approach. These algorithms are not capable of predicting motion for long term in road traffic conditions, though their robustness and model classification capability are essential for the overall system. The performance is evaluated in road traffic scenarios where the tracked object imitates the motion characteristics of a road vehicle and is observed from a stationary sensor. The measurements are generated according to standard automotive radar models. The analysis conducted along two aspects emphasizes the different performance and scaling properties of the examined state estimation algorithms. The presented evaluation framework serves as a customizable method to test and develop advanced autonomous functions.

AB Path planning and formation structure forming are two of the most important problems for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to collaborate with each other. In this work, a dynamic formation model was proposed, in which several algorithms were developed for the complex underwater environment. Dimension changeable particle swarm algorithm was used to find an optimized path by dynamically adjusting the number and the distribution of the path nodes. Position relationship based obstacle avoidance algorithm was designed to detour along the edges of obstacles. Virtual potential point based formation-keeping algorithm was employed by incorporating dynamic strategies which were decided by the current states of the formation. The virtual potential point was used to keep the formation structure when the AUV or the formation was deviated. Simulation results show that an optimal path can be dynamically planned with fewer path nodes and smaller fitness, even with a concave obstacle. It has been also proven that different formation-keeping strategies can be adaptively selected and the formation can change its structure in a narrow area and restore back after passing the obstacle.

TI Visual Inspection of Hydroelectric Dams Using an Autonomous Underwater
   Vehicle
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents an automated solution to the visual inspection problem of hydroelectric dams. A small autonomous underwater vehicle, controllable in four degrees of freedom (surge, sway, heave, and yaw), is used for autonomously exploring the wall of a dam. The robot is easily programmed using a mission control language. Missions are executed by an intelligent control architecture that guides the robot to follow a predefined path surveying the wall. During the mission, the robot gathers onboard navigation data synchronized with optical imagery, sonar, and absolute navigation data, obtained from a moored buoy equipped with an ultra-short baseline system. After the mission, the images of the wall are used to build a photomosaic of the inspected area. First, image features are matched over the image sequence. Then, navigation data and interimage correspondences are optimized together using bundle adjustment techniques. Thus, a georeferenced globally aligned set of images is obtained. Finally, a blending algorithm is used to obtain smooth seam transitions among the different images that constitute the mosaic, compensating for light artifacts and improving the visual perception of the scene.

AB The traditional conflict resolution algorithm is designed for automated vehicles based on the premise of the right of way, but there is an unclear road right of way at unsignalized intersections, which brings trouble to the decision making of automated vehicles. The objective of this work is to provide our system with evolving cooperative and non-cooperative decisions. We achieve this by integrating game theory into the decision making. When the system decides to drive cooperatively, the joint action is planned to optimize the overall revenue of multi-vehicles based on the cooperative game, considering the conflict relationship with its neighboring vehicles. When the system fails to perform cooperative driving or response timeout, the vehicle-mounted unit would take non-cooperative driving to optimize the trajectory considering only its individual benefit. The proposed model can provide our system with stability and robustness, which effectively solved the conflict resolution problem when the right of way was not clear at intersections. We have implemented some simulation experiments of cooperative and non-cooperative conflict resolution, the results show that the revenue among various interest groups is more balanced with a cooperative conflict resolution method. Compared with the non-collaborative driving decision, the conflict resolution time is shortened, and the average delay of each vehicle at intersections is reduced by 1 similar to 2 s, with an average reduction of approximately 5%. The research can provide a reference for collaborative driving of automated vehicles at unsignalized intersections.

AB This paper aims to develop an intelligent autonomous surveillance system for the safety surveillance of indoor environments with the integration of techniques such as sensory information fusion, internet of things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI). We have developed the following four subsystems to implement the intelligent autonomous surveillance system: (1) an autonomous surveillance vehicle (ASV) to be placed on the track to detect environmental sensory information in indoor environments (such as environmental temperature, flame, CO concentration, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) concentration) and the movement information of the ASV (such as position coordinates and movement speed); (2) an intelligent fire detection algorithm to be used for identification of disaster statuses in indoor environments; (3) a visible human-machine interface to instantaneously display the environmental sensory information and ASV movement information, and show the environmental disaster information (such as disaster statuses, disaster images, image capture times, and disaster positions); (4) a remote server composed of a database server, file servers, a web server, and responsive web pages to store and display the recorded environmental sensory information, ASV movement information, and environmental disaster information. Furthermore, a 3D experimental track testbed was constructed to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the intelligent autonomous surveillance system. Our experimental results have successfully validated that the intelligent autonomous surveillance system can detect disaster events in a variety of conditions.

TI Idle-parked vehicles assisted collaborative resource allocation in VEC

SO AD HOC NETWORKS

DT Article
DE Resource allocation; Stackelberg game; Dynamic offloading
AB With the advent of autonomous vehicles, how to meet the computing demands of vehicles with computing -intensive and latency-sensitive tasks becomes a challenge. Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) is an advanced computing paradigm that improves the Quality of Service (QoS) of vehicles by offloading tasks to VEC servers. However, the computing resources of the VEC server are limited and thus cannot meet the offloading needs of the vehicle. This paper proposes to use idle-parked vehicles to assist the VEC server to offload computing tasks, which increases the resource capacity and expands the communication range. Firstly, we propose an idle-parked vehicle-assisted VEC model, which incentivizes idle-parked vehicles to assist VEC server computing tasks by obtaining rewards from VEC servers. Secondly, this paper proposes a more flexible dynamic offloading scheme based on comprehensive consideration of the selection strategy and pricing strategy. Then, based on the Stackelberg game, the interaction between the VEC server and the idle-parked vehicle is analyzed, and utilize backward induction to prove that there is a unique Nash equilibrium in this game. Finally, an improved joint selection decision and pricing decision algorithm based on the Branch and Bound (JSPBB) algorithm is proposed, which achieves the optimal pricing under the condition of maximizing the utility of idle-parked vehicles and each VEC server under this pricing optimal offloading strategy to maximize system utility. The simulation results can show that the proposed algorithm can solve the problem effectively and has good performance so that the system can obtain higher benefits.

AB To provide coordinate information for the use of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs), the global positioning system (GPS) is commonly used in vehicle localization as a cheap and easily accessible solution for global positioning. However, several factors contribute to GPS errors, decreasing the safety and precision of AV and ITS applications, respectively. Extensive research has been conducted to address this problem. More specifically, several optimization-based cooperative vehicle localization algorithms have been developed to improve the localization results by exchanging information with neighboring vehicles to acquire additional information. Nevertheless, existing optimization-based algorithms still suffer from an unacceptable performance and poor scalability. In this study, we investigated the development of deep learning (DL) based cooperative vehicle localization algorithms to provide GPS refinement solutions with low complexity, high performance, and flexibility. Specifically, we propose three DL models to address the problem of interest by emphasizing the temporal and spatial correlations of the extra given information. The simulation results confirm that the developed algorithms outperform existing optimization-based algorithms in terms of refined error statistics. Moreover, a comparison of the three proposed algorithms also demonstrates that the proposed graph convolution network-based cooperative vehicle localization algorithm can effectively utilize temporal and spatial correlations in the extra information, leading to a better performance and lower training overhead.

AB The paper focuses on video monitoring of a moving ground target using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The aim is to navigate the UAV so that it is able to monitor the target while concealing its apparent motion in respect to the target's visual system. A computationally simple sliding mode closed-loop control algorithm mimicking motion camouflage stealth behavior observed in some attacking animals is developed. The proposed guidance law is based on bearing only measurements and does not require any information on the targets' velocity and the distance to the target. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

ID TARGET LOCALIZATION; ONLY MEASUREMENTS; UNDERWATER; NAVIGATION
AB Self-positioning of submerged Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is a challenging task due to nonavailability of GPS signals. One of the most recent solutions for this is the use of surface vehicles (sensors) for cooperative localization of the underwater vehicles (targets) by measuring their relative positions. However, correct placement of the surface sensors is very critical as their geometric configuration affects their observability and hence availability of their relative positions information to the targets. In this paper, a comparative survey of sensors' optimal formation techniques for cooperative localization of AUVs has been presented. Introduction to the basic cooperative localization techniques and background theory of optimal sensor placements have been provided. This paper can also serve as a fundamental reading material for students and researchers pursuing research on optimal sensor placement for cooperative localization.

This paper provided an intuitive modeling and simulation approach to obtain the hydrodynamic damping and added mass coefficients of an open-frame ROV using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) approach in the preliminary design stage where extensive hydrodynamic test facilities are not available. The software MATLAB (TM), STAR CCM+(TM) and WAMIT (TM) are employed to compute the hydrodynamic damping coefficients and added mass coefficients of the ROV for control system design and virtual reality. Experimental validation for the heave and yaw responses in a water tank shows a close relation and insight to the simulation results for subsequent control system design.

AB The development of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has revolutionized the traditional reliance on a single, costly AUV for conducting underwater surveys. This shift has garnered increasing interest among marine researchers. Communication between AUV fleets is an urgent concern due to the data rate limitation of underwater acoustic communication. Laser-based underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) is a potential solution once the link-establishing requirement between AUVs can be met. Due to the limited coverage area of the laser beam, the previous pointing, acquisition, and tracking (PAT) method is to quickly adjust the beam direction and search for the target according to the set scanning path. In response to these challenges, we propose a scalable laser-based link establishment method that combines the maneuvering of the AUV, the acoustic position-ing, and the control of the optical system. Our proposed approach has consistently outperformed the existing PAT method in simulated environments, effectively establishing laser links. Importantly, we have successfully imple-mented our approach in machine experiments, confirming its practical applicability. (c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group

AB With the continuous increase in motor vehicle ownership in recent times, traditional transportation has been unable to meet people's travel needs. Research on autonomous driving technology will help solve a series of problems associated with driving, such as traffic accidents, traffic congestion, energy consumption, and environmental pollution. In this paper, an improved artificial potential field method is proposed to complete the planning of automatic driving trajectories by adding the distance adjustment factor, dynamic road repulsive field, velocity repulsive field, and acceleration repulsive field. The invasive weed algorithm is introduced to solve the defects associated with the traditional artificial potential field method. The prediction model-for which corresponding constraint variables were set and an optimal objective function was established to build up the MPC model controller to achieve the goal of trajectory tracking-was linearized and discretized from a vehicle dynamics model. Finally, co-simulation based on MATLAB and CarSim was used to verify the practicability of the model.

AB We present herein a three-dimensional (3D) mapping method in one-way rectilinear scanning with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with a forward looking sonar (FLS) and a profiling sonar (PS). Three-dimensional reconstruction using sonar with a finite beam width is an ill-posed problem, and additional constraints also need to be considered. Our approach involves an additional sonar and fuse acoustic measurements provided by the two sonar sensors. The FLS has a high resolution in the horizontal scan but has a uncertainty in the vertical scan. Meanwhile, the PS provides a reliable vertical profile, but its beam width is extremely narrow. An initial map is generated by the FLS and refined by combining the PS vertical scan data. To demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted tests in a water tank and also at sea. Finally, we presented the results of the proposed method gathered by an AUV in the tests.

AB We provide a framework of alternative underlying explanations and hypotheses related to the value of travel time changes caused by the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs). This framework supports a scenario-based approach for infrastructure planning based on various assumptions about the value of AV travel time. The main focus of this paper is on how the value of time may remain unchanged or even increase with the advent of AVs. This is in sharp contrast to existing views about how meaningful positive utility will be associated with traveling in AVs. In future, as field data reveals behavioral changes related to AV adoption, the most appropriate hypothesis within the framework will be validated and refined for future planning and system management. The framework proposed in this paper is supported by justifications from existing and emerging theoretical concepts and hypotheses, as well as a meta-analysis extracted from contemporary but isolated reports in the literature about the possibility that AV use will increase the value of travel time.

AB In this paper, a tracking controller is proposed to navigate the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) within a specific region with known constant input delay. The unit quaternion representation is used for attitude control to avoid singularity problem encountered with Euler Angles. However, compensation of actuator delay is a challenging problem to handle with the nonlinear dynamics of an AUV. A predictor based term is thus considered to cancel the input delay term in the open loop dynamics. Nevertheless for some application of an AUV like pipeline inspection or survey it is more practical to define a region as desired position than a specific point. Thus the proposed region tracking controller guarantees an AUV to move within a region for the mission duration. A Lyapunov based stability analysis using Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is provided to prove uniformly ultimately bounded stability of the closed loop system. Numerical simulations considering a six DOF model of an AUV validate the proposed controller. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Good understanding of relationship between parameters of vehicle, terrain and interaction at the interface is required to develop effective navigation and motion control algorithms for autonomous wheeled mobile robots (AWMR) in rough terrain. A model and analysis of relationship among wheel slippage (S), rotation angle (theta), sinkage (z) and wheel radius (r) are presented. It is found that wheel rotation angle, sinkage and radius have some influence on wheel slippage. A multi-objective optimization problem with slippage as utility function was formulated and solved in MATLAB. The results reveal the optimal values of wheel-terrain parameters required to achieve optimum slippage on dry sandy terrain. A method of slippage estimation for a five-wheeled mobile robot was presented through comparing the odometric measurements of the powered wheels with those of the fifth non-powered wheel. The experimental result shows that this method is feasible and can be used for online slippage estimation in a sandy terrain.

ID DESIGN
AB Tracked vehicles are frequently used as search-and-rescue robots for exploring disaster areas. To enhance their ability to traverse rough terrain, some of these robots are equipped with swingable subtracks. However, manual control of such subtracks also increases the operator's workload, particularly in teleoperation with limited camera views. To eliminate this trade-off, we have developed a shared autonomy system using an autonomous controller for subtracks that is based on continuous three-dimensional terrain scanning. Using this system, the operator has only to specify the direction of travel to the robot, following which the robot traverses rough terrain using autonomously generated subtrack motions. In our system, real-time terrain slices near the robot are obtained using two or three LIDAR (laser imaging detection and ranging) sensors, and these terrain slices are integrated to generate three-dimensional terrain information. In this paper, we introduce an autonomous controller for subtracks and validate the reliability of a shared autonomy system on actual rough terrains through experimental results.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) require multiple tasks in their seamless maneuverings. Some essential tasks that require simultaneous management and actions are motion planning, traffic prediction, traffic intersection management, etc. A few of them are complex in nature. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) can solve complex problems involving simultaneous controls. Recently, many researchers applied MARL in such applications. However, there is a lack of extensive surveys on the ongoing research to identify the current problems, proposed methods, and future research directions in MARL for CAVs. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on MARL for CAVs. A classification-based paper analysis is performed to identify the current developments and highlight the various existing research directions. Finally, the challenges in current works are discussed, and some potential areas are given for exploration to overcome those challenges. Future readers will benefit from this survey and can apply the ideas and findings in their research to solve complex problems.

AB For underactuated underwater vehicles, a real-time hybrid design of dynamic tracking control law is proposed for trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance. In recent works, sliding mode control (SMC) law has been presented and experimentally implemented for position tracking of an underactuated autonomous surface vessel. It is extended to the underactuated underwater vehicle case and finds it still work for trajectory tracking problem. The thruster saturation problem is considered for the real case. The major innovation is the solution of how to deal with obstacle avoidance in the predefined trajectory tracking mission. In order to deal with this problem, a hybrid control strategy is proposed for static and dynamic obstacle case respectively. Then, to show the effectiveness of the proposed method, trajectory tracking control under different conditions are conducted including static and dynamic obstacles. The experiment results show that the proposed method can deal with tracking and obstacle avoidance quite well.

AB By 2020, over 100 countries had expanded electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (EV/PHEV) technologies, with global sales surpassing 7 million units. Governments are adopting cleaner vehicle technologies due to the proven environmental and health implications of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), as evidenced by the recent COP26 meeting. This article proposes an agent-based model of vehicle activity as a tool for quantifying energy consumption by simulating a fleet of EV/PHEVs within an urban street network at various spatio-temporal resolutions. Driver behaviour plays a significant role in energy consumption; thus, simulating various levels of individual behaviour and enhancing heterogeneity should provide more accurate results of potential energy demand in cities. The study found that (1) energy consumption is lowest when speed limit adherence increases (low variance in behaviour) and is highest when acceleration/deceleration patterns vary (high variance in behaviour); (2) vehicles that travel for shorter distances while abiding by speed limit rules are more energy efficient compared to those that speed and travel for longer; and (3) on average, for tested vehicles, EV/PHEVs were 233.13 pound cheaper to run than ICEVs across all experiment conditions. The difference in the average fuel costs (electricity and petrol) shrinks at the vehicle level as driver behaviour is less varied (more homogeneous). This research should allow policymakers to quantify the demand for energy and subsequent fuel costs in cities.

AB In this study, an update code using vehicles joint unmanned aerial vehicle (UC-VU) scheme is proposed to disseminate code for smart sensing devices (SSDs) in the smart city. The innovations of the UC-VU scheme are as follows. (i) The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is adopted to disseminate code at the beginning of code dissemination for the SSDs which are difficult to get code through mobile vehicles. Thus, the average delay required for SSDs to get code can be reduced. (ii) k Smart storage devices are selected as interim code stations and the strategy of selecting interim code stations' location and number for code dissemination is proposed to disseminate code efficiently. This makes mobile vehicles can get code from k + 1 code station for code dissemination which changed the situation where code dissemination is slow due to only one code station disseminates code. (iii) This study also gives the optimisation strategy of the UAV flight trajectory to optimise the flight distance. The key performance indicators such as code dissemination rate compared to previous strategies increases 34.6%, the average dissemination time, the time that all SSDs get the code and the UAV flight trajectory's path decrease by 26.27, 25.30, and 71.67%, respectively.

AB The penetration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is an essential and important link in modern warfare. Enhancing UAV's ability of autonomous penetration through machine learning has become a research hotspot. However, the current generation of autonomous penetration strategies for UAVs faces the problem of excessive sample demand. To reduce the sample demand, this paper proposes a combination policy learning (CPL) algorithm that combines distributed reinforcement learning and demonstrations. Innovatively, the action of the CPL algorithm is jointly determined by the initial policy obtained from demonstrations and the target policy in the asynchronous advantage actor-critic network, thus retaining the guiding role of demonstrations in the initial training. In a complex and unknown dynamic environment, 1000 training experiments and 500 test experiments were conducted for the CPL algorithm and related baseline algorithms. The results show that the CPL algorithm has the smallest sample demand, the highest convergence efficiency, and the highest success rate of penetration among all the algorithms, and has strong robustness in dynamic environments.

AB The performance of smart vehicle (SV) applications like autonomous driving and in-vehicle augmented reality based traffic information system depends on the Field of View (FoV) and the timely processing of the SVs sensor data. Vehicular networking (VN) technology can enhance the performance of these applications by enabling a SV to access the sensing and processing capabilities of other neighbouring SVs. The processing and storage capacity of a SV is limited compared to cloud servers and the communication link between two SVs is unreliable due to their mobility and the nature of wireless channels. Hence, developing efficient processing and sensing schemes for SVs and VNs can help in optimizing the performance of SV applications. In this paper, we propose Contextual Bandits (CB), Markov decision process (MDP) and deep Q-network (DQN) based sensing and processing schemes for VNs. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes outperform the baseline schemes in a variety of scenarios.

ID FLIGHT CONTROL; POPULATION; RISK
AB Autonomous operation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires development of technologies that allow for safer flight control and response to various flight anomalies. Software for autonomous control should allow the UAV to detect and avoid potential hazards, as well as respond to critical failures midflight without input from a human operator. This paper develops a ground impact and hazard mitigation (GIHM) module that integrates the following: 1) consideration of engine and control surface failure flight modes, 2) generation of feasible ground impact footprints based on glide equations, 3) selection of safest response ground impact sites based on a high-resolution LandScan USA population dataset, and 4) controlled descent to a selected site. For a sample population distribution, integration of GIHM with standard UAV flight software shows a maximum casualty expectation reduction of 97% compared to the flight software without GIHM near highly populated areas. Incorporation of this hazard mitigation module is successful in reducing fatalities per flight hour, bringing UAVs closer to being safe enough for integration into the National Airspace System.

AB The ocean bottom flying node (OBFN) is a novel autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) system which could explore the oil and gas resources in deep water. This paper investigates the distributed finite-time chattering reduction containment control problem for multiple OBFNs under directed communication topology. The model uncertainties and external disturbances are considered. By defining the containment error variables and selecting high-order sliding variable properly, a distributed finite-time containment control strategy is developed. The discontinuous sign function is contained in the derivative of the control protocol so as to eliminate the chattering phenomenon. An adaptive law is designed to make efficiency estimation and compensation for the upper bounds of model uncertainties and external disturbances. Combined with the graph theory and matrix theory, the Lyapunov method is utilized to demonstrate that the follower OBFNs could enter the convex hull formed by the leader OBFNs in finite time. Numerical simulation is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can map water conditions at high spatial (horizontal and vertical) and temporal resolution, including under cloudy conditions when satellite and airborne remote sensing are not feasible. As part of the RADYO program, we deployed a passive radiometer on an AUV in the Santa Barbara Channel and off the coast of Hawaii to apply existing bio-optical algorithms for characterizing the optical constituents of coastal seawater (i.e., dissolved organic material, algal biomass, and other particles). The spectral differences between attenuation coefficients were computed from ratios of downwelling irradiance measured at depth and used to provide estimates of the in-water optical constituents. There was generally good agreement between derived values of absorption and concurrent measurements of this inherent optical property in Santa Barbara Channel. Wave focusing, cloud cover, and low attenuation coefficients influenced results off the coast of Hawaii and are used to evaluate the larger-scale application of these methods in the near surface coastal oceans.

AB Fuzzy-logic-based inference techniques provide efficient solutions for control problems in classical and emerging applications. However, the lack of specific design tools and systematic approaches for hardware implementation of complex fuzzy controllers limits the applicability of these techniques in modern microelectronics products. This paper discusses a design strategy that eases the implementation of embedded fuzzy controllers as systems on programmable chips. The development of the controllers is carried out by means of a reconfigurable platform based on field-programmable gate arrays. This platform combines specific hardware to implement fuzzy inference modules with a general-purpose processor, thus allowing the realization of hybrid hardware/soffivare solutions. As happens to the components of the processing system, the specific fuzzy elements are conceived as configurable intellectual property modules in order to accelerate the controller design cycle. The design methodology and tool chain presented in this paper have been applied to the realization of a control system for solving the navigation tasks of an autonomous vehicle.

AB Siamese object tracking has facilitated diversified applications for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, they are typically trained on general images with relatively large objects instead of small objects observed from UAV. The gap on object scale between the training and inference phases is prone to suboptimal tracking performance or even failure. To solve the gap issue and tailor general Siamese trackers for UAV tracking, this work proposes a novel scale-aware domain adaptation framework, i.e., ScaleAwareDA. Specifically, a contrastive learning-inspired network is proposed to guide the training phase of Transformer-based feature alignment for small objects. In this network, feature projection module is designed to avoid information loss of small objects. Feature prediction module is developed to drive the aforementioned training phase in a self-supervised way. In addition, to construct the target domain, training datasets with UAV-specific attributes are obtained by downsampling general training datasets. Consequently, this novel training approach can assist a tracker to represent objects in UAV scenarios more powerfully and thus maintain its robustness. Extensive experiments on three authoritative challenging UAV tracking benchmarks have demonstrated the superior tracking performance of ScaleAwareDA. In addition, quantitative real-world tests further attest to its practicality.

AB This paper investigates the leader-follower formation control problem of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles. To solve the issues of inputs constraint and partial communication blocked between the leader and the followers, a novel consensus-based model predictive control scheme with optimized line-of-sight guidance is proposed. A desired optimal heading is generated by the line-of-sight guidance with reference governor, which is instrumented to compensate for the lack of actuator in sway direction. The reference governor is employed to prescribe the increment of desired optimal heading by balancing the line-of-sight guidance law and current heading. The information from the leader and neighbors is integrated using graph theory based on consensus scheme, which reduces the dependency of the leader compared to traditional leader-follower formation methods. The relative distances between followers are used to design state constraints for collision avoidance. Meanwhile, when the communication between the leader and the followers is partially blocked, the proposed controller can still generate the optimal control inputs and guarantee the formation tracking performance relying on the neighbors' state. An auxiliary Lyapunov-based contraction constraint is implemented to guarantee the stability. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller.

AB This paper addresses the cooperative path following the problem of ring-networked under-actuated autonomous surface vehicles on a closed curve. A cooperative guidance law is proposed at the kinematic level such that a symmetric formation pattern is achieved. Specifically, individual guidance laws of surge speed and angular rate are developed by using a backstepping technique and a line-of-sight guidance method. Then, a coordination design is proposed to update the path variables under a ring-networked topology. The equilibrium point of the closed-loop system has been proven to be globally asymptotically stable. The result is extended to the cooperative path following the lack of sharing of a global reference velocity, and a distributed observer is designed to recover the reference velocity to each vehicle. Moreover, the cooperative path following the presence of an unknown sideslip is considered, and an extended state observer is developed to compensate for the effect of the unknown sideslip. Both simulation and experimental results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative guidance law for the path following over a closed curve.

ID UAV COMMUNICATIONS; DRONES
AB Within the last decade, Swarm Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (SUAVs) are booming and growing at a surprisingly rapid pace. From military combat, environmental surveillance, and air transport to the blossoming public entertainment sector, there is a wide range of UAV applications. For these above use cases, the accurate location of the target of interest can be requested/queried, which is very important for their mission accomplishment. In the case of GPS-armed SUAVs, this is an easy task. However, the GPS signal can be obscured, affected by environmental conditions, or suppressive jamming. Therefore, location information needs to be improved/assisted by some other localization techniques, which constitutes the main scope of this article. Besides, with the advancements in localization, guidance, and communication technologies; future SUAVs will be operating autonomously by distributing tasks and coordinating the operation of many UAVs. Thus, UAV to UAV communication is presented as it constitutes the SUAV's autonomous coordination ability. In addition, future research directions and open challenges that need to be addressed, including autonomous SUAVs, are also discussed.

AB This paper presents a novel (SPC) scheme for the path following of autonomous vehicles (AVs) subject to denial of service (DoS) attacks. First, by considering the energy constraints of DoS attacks, bounded but arbitrary packet dropouts is used to characterize the effects of DoS attacks. Then, a switched control system model is established to describe the path following control of AVs under DoS attacks. In what follows, the SPC scheme, which depends on the detection of packet dropout from actuator side, is developed to compensate the packet dropout while there are no feedback measurements available. The main advantage of the proposed SPC scheme is that the predictive control design only depends on the latest available measurement and not affected by external disturbance. This is important to the control of networked systems under DoS attacks. At last, the corresponding experiments on path following control of the AVs are carried out in order to verify the validity of theory results.

AB Network slicing offers numerous benefits, particularly the ability to deliver highly customizable services to new industry sectors that have been unserved or inadequately served by current mobile network operators. Among new industry use cases that are targeted by the fifth generation (5G) mobile systems, there exist scenarios that go beyond what the current device-centric mobility approaches can support. The mobility of low latency communication services, shared by a group of moving devices, e.g., autonomous vehicles that share sensor data, is a prime example of these cases. These use cases' demands for ultra-low latency can be addressed by leveraging the Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) concept, techniques for live migration of virtual resources, Software Defined Networking (SDN), and network slicing. In this article, we define different slice mobility patterns, different methods for grouping users, and different triggers for network slice mobility. Furthermore, we evaluate the mobility of services and network slices based on the simultaneous migrations of multiple containers.

AB The control of mobile sensor networks uses sensor measurements to update a model of an unknown or estimated process, which in turn guides the collection of subsequent measurements-a feedback control framework called adaptive sampling. Applications for adaptive sampling exist in a wide range of settings, especially for unmanned or autonomous vehicles that can be deployed cheaply and in cooperative groups. The dynamics of mobile sensor platforms are often simplified to planar self-propelled particles subject to the ambient flow of the surrounding fluid. Sensor measurements are assimilated into continuous or discrete models of the process of interest, which in general can vary in space and time. The variability of the estimated process is one metric to score future candidate sampling trajectories, along with information- and uncertainty-based metrics. Sampling tasks are allocated to the network using centralized or decentralized optimization, in order to avoid redundant measurements and observational gaps.

AB This article introduces Periodically Controlled Hybrid Automata (PCHA) for modular specification of embedded control systems. In a PCHA, control actions that change the control input to the plant occur roughly periodically, while other actions that update the state of the controller may occur in the interim. Such actions could model, for example, sensor updates and information received from higher-level planning modules that change the set point of the controller. Based on periodicity and subtangential conditions, a new sufficient condition for verifying invariant properties of PCHAs is presented. For PCHAs with polynomial continuous vector fields, it is possible to check these conditions automatically using, for example, quantifier elimination or sum of squares decomposition. We examine the feasibility of this automatic approach on a small example. The proposed technique is also used to manually verify safety and progress properties of a fairly complex planner-controller subsystem of an autonomous ground vehicle. Geometric properties of planner-generated paths are derived which guarantee that such paths can be safely followed by the controller.

AB The problem of classifying targets in sonar images from multiple views is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). This model allows one to adaptively determine which additional views of an object would be most beneficial in reducing the classification uncertainty. Acquiring these additional views is made possible by employing an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with a side-looking imaging sonar. The components of the multiview target classification POMDP are specified. The observation model for a target is specified by the degree of similarity between the image under consideration and a number of precomputed templates. The POMDP is validated using real synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) data gathered during experiments at sea carried out by the NATO Undersea Research Centre, and results show that the accuracy of the proposed method outperforms an approach using a number of predetermined view aspects. The approach provides an elegant way to fully exploit multiview information and AUV maneuver-ability in a methodical manner.

ID PERCEPTION; ROBOT
AB Occupancy grid maps (OGMs) are fundamental to most systems for autonomous robotic navigation. However, CPU-based implementations struggle to keep up with data rates from modern 3D lidar sensors, and provide little capacity for modern extensions which maintain richer voxel representations. This article presents Occupancy Homogenous Mapping (OHM), our open source, GPU-based OGM framework. We show how the algorithms can be mapped to GPU resources, resolving difficulties with contention to obtain a successful implementation. The implementation supports many modern OGM algorithms including Normal Distributions Transform-Occupancy Maps (NDT-OM), Normal Distributions Transform-Traversability Maps (NDT-TM), decay-rate and Truncated Sign Distance Function (TSDF). A thorough performance evaluation is presented based on tracked and quadruped Uncrewed Ground Vehicle (UGV) platforms and UAVs, and data sets from both outdoor and subterranean environments. The results demonstrate excellent performance improvements both offline, and for online processing in embedded platforms. Finally, we describe how OHM was a key enabler for the UGV navigation solution for our entry in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Subterranean Challenge, which placed second at the Final Event.

AB AV technologies have the potential to transform urban landscapes and existing transport systems and networks. Yet, the utopian imaginary of reduced automobile ownership and a new shared economic future sits in tension with suggestions that car dependency, urban sprawl and transport inaccessibility will be exacerbated. The issues are situated in a complex governance landscape involving an influential private sector who are increasingly setting the agenda. The public sector may be forced into reacting to the new innovations by information technology and automobile companies as they are introduced into existing built environments. Drawing on an extensive literature base and interviews with public sector planners, this paper reveals the conceptual gaps in the framing of AV technology - the prospects and limits - and how these are conceived. The paper raises questions about the role urban planning can play in the rollout of AVs in order to anticipate and mediate unwanted built environment and socio-spatial impacts, as well as reconciling the ambition of transport innovation with the public purpose of planning.

AB This paper addresses the formation control problem for a group of mechanical systems with nonlinear uncertain dynamics under the virtual leader-following framework. New cooperative deterministic learning-based adaptive formation control algorithms are proposed. Specifically, the virtual leader dynamics is constructed as a linear system subject to unknown bounded inputs, so as to produce more diverse reference signals for formation tracking control. A cooperative discontinuous nonlinear estimation protocol is first proposed to estimate the leader's state information. Based on this, a cooperative deterministic learning formation control protocol is developed using artificial neural networks, such that formation tracking control and locally-accurate nonlinear identification with learning knowledge consensus can be achieved simultaneously. Finally, by utilizing the learned knowledge represented by constant neural networks, an experience-based distributed control protocol is further proposed to enable position-swappable formation control. Numerical simulations using a group of autonomous underwater vehicles have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed results.

AB The problem of developing a reliable system for sensing and controlling the hover of a Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) using visual snapshots is considered. The current problem is part of a larger project, which is developing an autonomous MAV, controlled by vision only information. A new algorithm is proposed that uses a stored image of the ground, a snapshot taken of the ground directly under the MAV, as a visual anchor point. The absolute translation of the aircraft and its velocity are then calculated by comparing the subsequent frames with the stored image and fed into the position controller. In order to increase the performance, several issues, such as effects of scale uncertainty on the closed loop stability of the platform are investigated. For controller design and testing purposes, we analytically derive a complete model of a small size helicopter with no stabilizing bar (flybar). The simulation results for 2D and 3D snapshots confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB Multi-platooning is an important management strategy for autonomous driving technology. The backbone vehicles in a multi-platoon adopt the IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF) mechanism to transmit vehicles' kinematics information through inter-platoon communications, and then forward the information to the member vehicles through intra-platoon communications. In this case, each vehicle in a multi-platoon can acquire the kinematics information of other vehicles. The parameters of DCF, the hidden terminal problem and the number of neighbors may incur a long and unbalanced one-hop delay of inter-platoon communications, which would further prolong end-to-end delay of inter-platoon communications. In this case, some vehicles within a multi-platoon cannot acquire the emergency changes of other vehicles' kinematics within a limited time duration and take prompt action accordingly to keep a multi-platoon formation. Unlike other related works, this paper proposes a swarming approach to optimize the one-hop delay of inter-platoon communications in a multi-platoon scenario. Specifically, the minimum contention window size of each backbone vehicle is adjusted to enable the one-hop delay of each backbone vehicle to get close to the minimum average one-hop delay. The simulation results indicate that, the one-hop delay of the proposed approach is reduced by 12% as compared to the DCF mechanism with the IEEE standard contention window size. Moreover, the end-to-end delay, one-hop throughput, end-to-end throughput and transmission probability have been significantly improved.

AB Polar marine environments host a complex assemblage of cold-adapted auto- and heterotrophic microorganisms that affect water biogeochemistry and ecosystem functions. However, due to logistical difficulties, remote regions like those in close proximity to glaciers have received little attention, resulting in a paucity of microbiological data. To fill these gaps and obtain novel insights into microbial structure and function in Arctic regions, a survey of microbial communities in an area close to the Blomstrandbreen glacier in Kongsfjorden (Svalbard Archipelago; Arctic Ocean) was carried out during an early summer period. An Unmanned Autonomous Vehicle designed to safely obtain seawater samples from offshore-glacier transects (PROTEUS, Portable RObotic Technology for Unmanned Surveys) was equipped with an automatic remotely-controlled water multi-sampler so that it could sample just beneath the glacier, where access from the sea is difficult and dangerous. The samples were analysed by image analysis for the abundance of total prokaryotes, viable and respiring cells, their morphological traits and biomass; by flow cytometry for autotrophic and prokaryotic cells (with high and low nucleic acid contents) as well as virus-like particle counts; by BIOLOG ECOPLATES for potential community metabolism; and by fluorimetry for potential enzymatic activity rates on organic polymers. Contextually, the main physical and chemical (temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and nutrients) parameters were detected. Altogether, besides the PROTEUS vehicle's suitability for collecting samples from otherwise inaccessible sites, the multivariate analysis of the overall dataset allowed the identification of three main sub-regions differently affected by the haline gradient (close to the glacier) or terrigenous inputs coming from the coast. A complex microbiological scenario was depicted by different patterns of microbial abundance and metabolism among the transects, suggesting that ice melting and Atlantic water inflow differently supported microbial growth.

AB The authors interest in this work is to perform a precise real-time flocking of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A consensus-based flocking algorithm that ensures a precise security distance between UAVs is proposed. By using Lyapunov theoretical analysis, the authors propose a flocking algorithm that ensures the ultimate boundedness of multiple-UAV system solutions. Moreover, this algorithm is enhanced by a distributed integral control that renders the inter-distances between UAVs more precise. Finally, experimental results are provided to prove and show the efficiency of these algorithms.

AB Monocular 3D vehicle localization is an important task for vehicle behaviour analysis, traffic flow parameter estimation and autonomous driving in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) and Cooperative Vehicle Infrastructure System (CVIS), which is usually achieved by monocular 3D vehicle detection. However, monocular cameras cannot obtain depth information directly due to the inherent imaging mechanism, resulting in more challenging monocular 3D tasks. Currently, most of the monocular 3D vehicle detection methods still rely on 2D detectors and additional geometric constraint modules to recover 3D vehicle information, which reduces the efficiency. At the same time, most of the research is based on datasets of onboard scenes, instead of roadside perspective, which is limited in large-scale 3D perception. Therefore, we focus on 3D vehicle detection without 2D detectors in roadside scenes. We propose a 3D vehicle localization network CenterLoc3D for roadside monocular cameras, which directly predicts centroid and eight vertexes in image space, and the dimension of 3D bounding boxes without 2D detectors. To improve the precision of 3D vehicle localization, we propose a multi-scale weighted-fusion module and a loss with spatial constraints embedded in CenterLoc3D. Firstly, the transformation matrix between 2D image space and 3D world space is solved by camera calibration. Secondly, vehicle type, centroid, eight vertexes, and the dimension of 3D vehicle bounding boxes are obtained by CenterLoc3D. Finally, centroid in 3D world space can be obtained by camera calibration and CenterLoc3D for 3D vehicle localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of 3D vehicle localization for roadside monocular cameras. Hence, we also propose a benchmark for this application including a dataset (SVLD-3D), an annotation tool (LabelImg-3D), and evaluation metrics. Through experimental validation, the proposed method achieves high accuracy with AP(3D) of 51.30%, average 3D localization precision of 98%, average 3D dimension precision of 85% and real-time performance with FPS of 41.18.

AB Concept of symmetry covers physical link between road profile form, vehicle dynamic characteristics, and speed conjunction. Symmetry frame between these items is asymmetric itself and has no direct expression, but it affects a vibration level on the vehicle and driving comfort. Usually, we can change only the vehicle's speed to achieve desired vibrations level of the driver and passengers. Recently, vehicle dynamic characteristics can be changed depending on its damping system structure, but these solutions are limited by construction and control possibilities and evidently represented by symmetric dependency between road input and the resulting acceleration of the vehicle. The main limitation of this process is to have a reliable value of the existing road profile that is mainly defined by road category but unpredictable for each road distance. Functional road profile calculations are provided in this article, where power spectral density (further-PSD) and waviness of the road play the main role in delineating road profile parameters. Furthermore, the transfer function system was created using full car dynamic model analysis. Values on vehicle suspension's effects on acceleration were obtained from vehicle speed and road roughness. Acceleration values and transfer function were used to calculate PSD value quickly and practically. This calculated result can be formed as a control value to the vehicle damping control. In addition, the provided methodology became useful to determine road quality for adjustment of vehicle suspension parameters and set safe driving characteristics, which became part of driver assistant systems or autonomous driving mode.

AB In this article, a hybrid thruster for spherical underwater robots (SURs) was developed and its performance was evaluated. The objective of this work was to improve the execution efficiency, multimodality, and maneuverability of the autonomous underwater robot (AUV). First, using meshing method, the open-water performance and flow field of individual water-jet and propeller thruster were analyzed. Numerical simulations were calculated and verified using experimental data. Then, the interaction between the hybrid thrusters was discussed, and the flow field characteristics and hydrodynamic performance of the hybrid propulsion system were validated through streamline and pressure distribution. Finally, the hybrid propulsion system was designed; the thrust measurement experiments and the basic motion experiments for SUR using a hybrid thruster were carried out, including water-jet mode, propeller mode, and hybrid mode. The experimental results further verified the performance of the hybrid propulsion system, which meet the requirements of rapidity and flexibility, as well as the feasibility of underwater applications.

AB The factors affecting the acceptance of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) in Saudi Arabia were examined by conducting a stated choice survey among 500 participants. Descriptive analysis showed that the participants believed that using AVs will decrease the risk of car crashes and help them safely reach their destination. Parametric analysis and prediction models showed a wide variation in public opinion regarding willingness to use AVs, despite an average high score on this factor. The study found that the trust in AVs was low, and women favored AVs more than men. Prediction models showed that age, trust, and being tech-savvy determine the willingness to use AVs. As younger participants had a high willingness to use AVs, we recommended focusing on changing the perception of older drivers to increase overall AV acceptance by increasing their trust in this new technology and highlighting the features of AVs. From the findings of this study, it is expected that wide-scale adoption of AV depends upon its competitiveness with the traditional and its performance in terms of enhancing road safety.

AB Orientation-sensitive trajectory tracking (OSTT) claims that both position and orientation of the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are regulated to the reference. This article addresses the OSTT controller design problem for AUVs with separate forces or torques for surge, heave, roll, and yaw, in the presence of hydrodynamic uncertainties and external disturbances. In the kinematic stage, these AUVs are capable of moving sideways by exploiting the nonzero angle of the roll, so that the position tracking can be handled while the steering tracks the referenced yaw angle. As for the kinetic stage, a robust nonsmooth controller is implemented to guarantee the exponential convergence of velocity tracking errors. Trajectories are planned for the docking task and bridge pier inspection task. It is shown that the position tracking error can converge to a neighborhood about zero, and the yaw angle tracking error converges to zero exponentially as well. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by both simulation results and experimental results.

AB In this paper, a bio-inspired path planning algorithm in 3D space is proposed. The algorithm imitates the basic mechanisms of plant growth, including phototropism, negative geotropism and branching. The algorithm proposed in this paper solves the dynamic obstacle avoidance path planning problem of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in the case of unknown environment maps. Compared with other path planning algorithms, the algorithm has the advantages of fast path planning speed and fewer route points, and can achieve the effect of low delay real-time path planning. The feasibility of the algorithm is verified in the Gazebo simulator based on the Robot Operating System (ROS) platform. Finally, an actual UAV autonomous obstacle avoidance path planning experimental platform is built, and a UAV obstacle avoidance path planning flight test is carried out based on this actual environment.

AB Wave glider is a new wave-powered autonomous marine vehicle, which is composed of a submerged glider connected to a surface floater via a tether. Such an advanced vessel is designed to harvest energy in ocean surface waves to generate forward thrust. Equipped with solar panel and battery as well as some dedicated sensors, the wave glider is able to achieve long duration missions via sea-side control. In this paper, a 4-DOF (degree-of-freedom) mathematical model of the wave glider is established using Newton-Euler approach. The second-order wave drift force on the horizontal plane and the first order wave force on the vertical direction are considered. The hydrodynamic parameters were calculated using the potential flow theory and empirical formula. Furthermore, motion simulation of the wave glider with respect to the sensitivity analysis to some key environmental factors and the heading control ability is conducted. The simulation results are presented and discussed in detail, which provides theoretical guidance and reference for wave glider design. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This work focuses on the attitude control problem for hypersonic morphing vehicles (HMVs) with uncertainties. A span-morphing HMV model is first established with lumped disturbances. Based on fixed-time technique, a disturbance observer with fuzzy logic system (FLS) is proposed to enhance the robustness by estimating the unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances in fixed settling time. The multivariable fixed-time sliding mode manifold is applied to the transformed control system, which guarantees a direct control input design from attitude command and decent tracking performance. Then, the control system degenerates into an autonomous system, and the closed-loop fixed-time stability is ensured via Lyapunov synthesis and homogeneity theory. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB This paper investigates the problem of distributed dynamic event-triggered formation control for multiple unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) subject to external disturbances. Firstly, a novel event-based distributed formation control scheme is proposed, under an undirected communication graph. Wherein, a dynamic event-triggered data transmission mechanism is designed for communication resource reduction. The time-varying dynamic parameter ensures fewer triggering instants and a larger triggering time interval compared with the traditional static one. The adaptive laws are incorporated into the formation control scheme to address the effects of external disturbances and uncertainties. Subsequent to the theoretical analysis, it can be concluded that the relative tracking errors can converge to the origin, and all closed-loop signals are bounded. Moreover, it is proved that the triggering time sequences do not exhibit Zeno behavior. Finally, a numerical simulation is performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed distributed formation controller.

In this work, we aim to find an optimal solution for the association problem between the wireless access points (WAPs) and UAVs, which allow us to maximize the total weighted sum rate. This optimization is subjected to quality of service (QoS), a number of links, available bandwidth, fairness, and coverage constraints. We propose a centralized algorithm to solve the association problem. Our results show that the proposed algorithm excels for the counterpart suboptimal and approaches the optimal solution with very reduced complexity.

AB Connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies attracted extensive attention in the past decade. As CAV brings convenience to travel, people's travel behaviors and patterns might change significantly. Existing models, however, cannot comprehensively evaluate the impacts on transportation systems. This study adopted an activity-based approach to evaluate the comprehensive CAV impacts on the transportation system in Southern California. A stated-preference survey was conducted, and captured people's behavior changes associated with CAV deployment. The model prediction demonstrated that the total trip number increased by 9%, with an 13% growth in total car-like mode travel distance. Among all trip purposes, work trips contributed to 49% of total trip number growth and 75% of the increased car-like mode travel distance. The advanced CAV technology alone wouldn't directly benefit future transportation systems and it is still critical to have appropriate policy interventions in place.

AB Measuring the roll angle of single-track vehicles has always been a challenging task; however, accurate and reliable measurements of this magnitude are paramount for controlling the stability of these vehicles, both for autonomous riding and for safety reasons. A roll angle estimation is also useful in other situations, such as tests to perform the identification of the parameters of the rider control. In this work, a new algorithm is presented for estimating the roll angle of bicycles. This estimator, based on the well-known Kalman filter, employs a wheel speed sensor to approximate the speed of the vehicle, and three angular rate sensors, which are currently small and affordable sensors. The proposed method was implemented in a microcontroller and tested in a bicycle and the results were compared with measurements obtained with optical sensors, showing a good correlation. Although it has not been tested in motorcycles, comparable results are expected.

AB This technical note addresses the second-order consensus problem of multiple underactuated thrust-propelled vehicles (TPVs) on directed graphs containing a directed spanning tree. We propose an adaptive control approach to resolve this problem, and the proposed controller does not rely on the commonly used backstepping methodology and the exact knowledge of the mass properties of the TPVs. In addition, the resultant complexity is reduced and the requirement on the interaction graph is relaxed. Using an input-output analysis, we show that the proposed controller realizes the second-order consensus of the TPVs, i. e., the position and velocity consensus errors between the TPVs converge to zero, and moreover the velocities of the TPVs converge to the weighted average of their initial values. The performance of the proposed control approach is shown by a numerical simulation.

AB Future smaller and maneuverable aerial vehicles have a need of high levels of autonomy and independence. This gives rise to the necessity for integrated navigation systems that supply reliable and accurate navigation parameters (position, velocity and attitude) in small and cost effective manner. In this paper we propose a new solution that provides aiding information to inertial navigation from pure vision means. Using single video camera and with no a priori knowledge of the environment we show that it is possible to constrain the inertial navigation position, velocity and attitude divergence while moving in vicinity of a map point. Novel observation model of implicit form is developed and used in the paper. It is shown that such an integrated navigation system has a need for further integration with the guidance and control measurements and the vehicle motion to achieve better navigation accuracy.

ID ATTENTION
AB Purpose Humans are required to respond to a vehicle's request to take-over anytime even when they are not responsible for monitoring driving environments in automated driving, e.g., a SAE level-3 vehicle. Thus, a safe and effective delivery of a take-over request from an automated vehicle to a human is critical for the successful commercialization of automated vehicles. Methods In the current study, a set of human-in-the-loop experiments was conducted to compare diverse warning combinations by applying visual, auditory, and haptic modalities under systematically classified take-over request scenarios in conditionally automated driving. Forty-one volunteers consisting of 16 females and 25 males participated in the study. Vehicle and human data on response to take-over request were collected in two take-over scenarios, i.e., a disabled vehicle on the road ahead and a highway exit. Results Visual-auditory-haptic modal combination showed the best performance in both human behavioral and physiological data and visual-auditory warning in vehicle data. Visual-auditory-haptic warning combination showed the best performance when considering all performance indices. Meanwhile, visual-only warning, which is considered as a basic modality in manual driving, performed the worst in the conditionally automated driving situation. Conclusions These findings imply that the warning design in automated vehicles must be clearly differentiated from that of conventional manual driving vehicles. Future work shall include a follow-up experiment to verify the study results and compare more diverse multimodal combinations.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely applied in military and civilian fields due to their flexibility and effectiveness. As a vital component of UAVs, the vision system has taken on great significance in different applications (e.g., autonomous landing, traffic surveillance, and disaster rescue) to attract widespread attention in recent years. Therefore, the automatic understanding of visual data collected from these air platforms becomes urgently needed in UAV systems. In this review, we revisit and summarize the recent techniques and developments for several typical UAV applications, including object detection, object tracking, and semantic segmentation. In addition, we also highlight the difficulties and subsequent orientations from different perspectives, which may stimulate future research and applications in the UAV vision era.

AB Platooning is the application of autonomous driving technology to provide a freight transportation solution. It can improve the efficiency of freight transportation, save energy and reduce consumption, which are the major concerns of freight transportation. Configuration strategies are sets of rules for vehicles joining a platoon. Two types of configuration strategies are proposed in this paper, namely fixed platoon configuration strategies (Fixed-PCS) and flexible platoon configuration strategies (Flexible-PCS). In order to verify the impact of these strategies on freight efficiency and energy reductions, an energy consumption model is designed and performed. A discussion about the maximum platoon length and a design of platoon configuration strategies in connected and autonomous driving scenarios are presented. For freight vehicles, an agent-based simulation model is established, in which the efficiency and consumption evaluation indicators are used to measure the platooning effect under different traffic densities. The results show that in low-density traffic flow, the application of Flexible-PCS can improve the average speed on freeway in addition to reducing the average number of lane changes. The relationship between platoon length and energy consumption at different traffic flow densities are plotted, and recommendations on the optimal platoon lengths under different traffic flow densities are proposed.

AB Smart cities and autonomous vehicles have been emerging to be predominant and key players in today's cutting-edge technology. Their emergence has been rapidly escalated with the advancements of concepts of Internet of Things (IoTs). IoTs are characterized by nodes and agents which help in effective collection of vital information, relaying the information to adjacent nodes to the destination thus incorporating smartness into existing systems. Localization of these nodes and agents is a challenging issue especially in the applications such smart vehicles, autonomous vehicles etc. which are continuously in the mobile state. Continuous monitoring of their position and coordinates dictates the overall efficiency and precision of the IoT based system. A cooperative localization scheme for determination of these coordinates is proposed based on the Factor Graph-based Fisher Information Matrix theory. The Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) derived for the proposed model is utilized in the Bayesian Paradigm to compute the default prior or the relative density of nodes as a weight function. Finally, the Crammer Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) model is used to compute best set of neighboring nodes which help in triangulating the position of the target node. The proposed work has been tested for its efficiency against benchmark methods to validate the superiority of proposed work.

AB In this article, a hierarchical algorithm was developed for autonomous formation flying, communication, and task assignment for cooperating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and Dudek's taxonomy was used to evaluate the performance of the autonomous UAV group cooperating in mission execution against a group of enemy agents in an unknown environment. The authors showed that increasing the number of UAVs in the group proves to be beneficial as it allows the group to react to more enemy events, even if the overall search and detect capabilities remain invariant with the number of UAVs. It is also showed that, in general, using communication improves the cooperation among the flock members; however, using infinite communication range or infinite communication bandwidth results in considerable computational complexity. In conclusion, it is sufficient to use finite-bandwidth communication, keeping the computational complexity constant with the number of UAVs in the group, thus allowing the group to be scalable to large numbers of UAVs. The authors use a behavioural flocking algorithm to control the movement of the UAVs when searching, and show that flocking assists the UAVs in dispersing in the environment and improves the overall detection probability of the flock. Finally, it is showed that using flocking improves the group performance only if the group is capable of mission task collaboration.

AB Due to the flourishing development of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications and autonomous driving, interference between radar sensing and communication signals becomes a challenging issue. We propose a transmit beamforming based spectrum sharing scheme to achieve peaceful coexistence between automotive multiple-input multiple-out (MIMO) radar and communication systems. Our objective is to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the automotive radar receiver subject to the communication capacity and the transmitted power budget constraints to optimize both the communication covariance matrix and the radar transmit precoder. The formulated optimization problem is non-convex, which is converted to convex by introducing a new slack variable and then solving it using the block coordinate descent, also called alternation optimization, approach. Additionally, the ellipsoid sub-gradient method is then employed to reduce the computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms the conventional schemes.

AB This paper proposes a novel adaptive dynamical sliding mode control based methodology to design control algorithms for the trajectory tracking of underactuated unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). The main advantage of the approach is that the combination of backstepping and sliding mode control enhances the robustness of an UUV in the presence of systematical uncertainty and environmental disturbances. The position and attitude dynamical equations of an underactuated UUV are first represented and analyzed using coordinate transformation with the aid of backstepping technique. Subsequently, the output feedback problem is tackled by employing adaptive sliding mode control to estimate the systematical uncertain states required by the stable velocity tracking controller. The final controlled system can be proved to be globally asymptotically stable based on Lyapunov stability theory. Simulations performed on an underactuated UUV demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper focuses on the problem of decision-making and control in an autonomous driving application for highways. By considering the decision-making and control problem as an obstacle avoidance path planning problem, the paper proposes a novel approach to path planning, which exploits the structured environment of one-way roads. As such, the obstacle avoidance path planning problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem within a receding horizon control framework, as the minimization of the deviation from a desired velocity and lane, subject to a set of constraints introduced to avoid collision with surrounding vehicles, stay within the road boundaries, and abide the physical limitations of the vehicle dynamics. The ability of the proposed approach to generate appropriate traffic dependent maneuvers is demonstrated in simulations concerning traffic scenarios on a two-lane, one-way road with one and two surrounding vehicles.

AB In underwater sensor networks, nodes are usually sparsely arranged, and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are often used to collect data by moving. However, it is a key problem for AUVs to shorten the path as much as possible to guarantee whole-network data acquisition. Aiming to solve this problem, this paper proposes an AUV underwater data collection method based on affinity propagation clustering. First, this clustering theory is used to select the nodes with large residual energy as cluster head nodes, and the clustering results are dynamically adjusted according to the communication radius of nodes to obtain the final clustering results. Finally, the cluster head nodes of the clusters are sequentially traversed using the traveling salesman problem, and an optimal path of AUV is planned to complete data collection for the whole network. A large number of simulation experiments verify that this method can effectively plan the mobile path of AUVs.

AB The transition from academic training to professional life is not an easy task. In recent years, various learning enhancement methodologies have emerged to reduce this gap, which focuses on both soft and technical skills. Specifically, Competition-Based Learning (CBL) seeks to improve learning and motivation through the competitive component, which has detractors and defenders. In this framework, the present work proposes a national competition, CIC2022, within the field of control engineering that uses a testbed with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for helping to link theory and practice. The main objective is to analyze the results of CBL on learning. In addition to explaining the characteristics of the competition and the academic results obtained, a survey answered by participants provides conclusions on the effectiveness of the methodology and other issues related to the contest. Greater motivation and teamwork promoted the active learning of students and improved the autonomous acquisition of technical skills.

AB Automated guided vehicles (AGV), which are frequently used to reduce the workload of employees in production systems, are now being used in service systems. AGV has been widely used in the field of healthcare and is well suited to transporting. This study aims to provide AGV is being used in different areas of healthcare today within the scope of Industry 4.0. In recent years, the use of AGV has started to increase to reduce the workload and contamination risk of healthcare workers. In this study, it was aimed that AGVs would distribute autonomous drugs by processing patient information such as age, drug type, frequency of use and so forth. The information obtained from the internal diseases department of a university hospital was transferred to a computer simulation environment and the current situation and the proposed situation were analyzed separately, and the results were compared. The statistically verified results show that an autonomous AGV that will process patient information and distribute drugs reduced the workload of nurses by 14% in approximately a month.

AB In this paper, we generated intelligent self-driving policies that minimize the injury severity in unexpected traffic signal violation scenarios at an intersection using the deep reinforcement learning. We provided guidance on reward engineering in terms of the multiplicity of objective function. We used a deep deterministic policy gradient method in the simulated environment to train self-driving agents. We designed two agents, one with a single-objective reward function of collision avoidance and the other with a multi-objective reward function of both collision avoidance and goal-approaching. We evaluated their performances by comparing the percentages of collision avoidance and the average injury severity against those of human drivers and an autonomous emergency braking (AEB) system. The percentage of collision avoidance of our agents were 78.89 & x0025; higher than human drivers and 84.70 & x0025; higher than the AEB system. The average injury severity score of our agents were only 8.92 & x0025; of human drivers and 6.25 & x0025; of the AEB system.

AB In this paper, we propose a robust visual detection-learning-tracking framework for autonomous aerial refueling of unmanned aerial vehicles. Two classifiers (D-classifier and T-classifier) are defined in the proposed framework. The D-classifier is a robust linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained offline for detecting the drogue object of aerial refueling and a low-dimensional normalized robust local binary pattern feature is proposed to describe the drogue object in the D-classifier. The T-classifier is a state-based structured SVM classifier trained online for tracking the drogue object. A combination strategy between the D-classifier and the T-classifier is proposed in the framework. The D-classifier is used to assess if some positive support vectors in the T-classifier are required to be replaced by positive examples with density peaks. The experimental results on several challenging video sequences validate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed framework.

AB Autonomous mobile vehicles are becoming commoner in outdoor scenarios for agricultural applications. They must be equipped with a robot navigation system for sensing, mapping, localization, path planning, and obstacle avoidance. In autonomous vehicles, safety becomes a major challenge where unexpected obstacles in the working area must be conveniently addressed. Of particular interest are, people or animals crossing in front of the vehicle or fixed/moving uncatalogued elements in specific positions. Detection of unexpected obstacles or elements on video sequences acquired with a machine vision system on-board a tractor moving in cornfields makes the main contribution to this research. We propose a new strategy for automatic video analysis to detect static/dynamic obstacles in agricultural environments via spatial-temporal analysis. At a first stage obstacles are detected by using spatial information based on spectral colour analysis and texture data. At a second stage temporal information is used to detect moving objects/obstacles at the scene, which is of particular interest in camouflaged elements within the environment. A main feature of our method is that it does not require any training process. Another feature of our approach consists in the spatial analysis to obtain an initial segmentation of interesting objects; afterwards, temporal information is used for discriminating between moving and static objects. To the best of our knowledge in the field of agricultural image analysis, classical approaches make use of either spatial or temporal information, but not both at the same time, making an important contribution. Our method shows favourable results when tested in different outdoor scenarios in agricultural environments, which are really complex, mainly due to the high variability in the illumination conditions, causing undesired effects such as shadows and alternating lighted and dark areas. Dynamic background, camera vibrations and static and dynamic objects are also factors complicating the situation. The results are comparable to those obtained with other state-of-art techniques reported in literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The trajectory tracking of Intervention-Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (I-AUV) under hydrodynamic, uncertainties, disturbances and dynamic interaction is studied in this paper. A robust adaptive finite-time control is proposed to attain the high tracking accuracy and strong robustness. Firstly, to enhance the dynamical performance, a continuous terminal sliding mode surface is designed to guarantee that surface and errors are stable finite-time convergent to origin. Second, a feedback control term is developed to depict the hydrodynamic, uncertainties and disturbance estimation error. Then, an adaptive nested estimation technology is developed to approach the disturbance, in which a virtual torque is tuned by the low-pass filtering, and dual nested adaptive laws are provided to approximate this virtual torque and its time derivative, which can constrain the residual error to a small elliptic domain. The validity of our proposed control is verified by Lyapunov stability theory, and its reliability is proved in the simulation cases.

ID SLAM
AB Autonomous navigation requires both a precise and robust mapping and localization solution. In this context, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a very well-suited solution. SLAM is used for many applications including mobile robotics, self-driving cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, or autonomous underwater vehicles. In these domains, both visual and visual-IMU SLAM are well studied, and improvements are regularly proposed in the literature. However, LiDAR-SLAM techniques seem to be relatively the same as ten or twenty years ago. Moreover, few research works focus on vision-LiDAR approaches, whereas such a fusion would have many advantages. Indeed, hybridized solutions offer improvements in the performance of SLAM, especially with respect to aggressive motion, lack of light, or lack of visual features. This study provides a comprehensive survey on visual-LiDAR SLAM. After a summary of the basic idea of SLAM and its implementation, we give a complete review of the state-of-the-art of SLAM research, focusing on solutions using vision, LiDAR, and a sensor fusion of both modalities.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM
AB Manufacturing automation, especially through implementation of autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) technology, has been under intensive study due to increased productivity and reduced variations. The objective of this paper is to present an algorithm on scheduling of an AGV that traverses desired locations on a manufacturing floor. Although many algorithms have been developed to achieve this objective, most of them rely on exhaustive search, which is time-consuming. A novel two-step algorithm that generates "good," but not necessarily optimal, solutions for relatively large data sets (similar to 1000 points) is proposed, taking into account time constraints. A tradeoff analysis of computational expense versus algorithm performance is discussed. The algorithm enables the AGV to find a tour, which is as good as possible within the time constraint, using which it can travel through all given coordinates before returning to the starting location or a specified end point. Compared to exhaustive search methods, this algorithm generates results within a stipulated computation time of 30 s on a laptop personal computer.

AB Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) equipped with various sensors are able to carry out autonomous flights. However, the self-localization of autonomous agents is mostly dependent on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). In order to provide an accurate navigation solution in absence of GNSS signals, this article presents a hybrid sensor. The hybrid sensor is a deep integration of a monocular camera and a 2D laser rangefinder so that the motion of the MAV is estimated. This realization is expected to be more flexible in terms of environments compared to laser-scan-matching approaches. The estimated ego-motion is then integrated in the MAV's navigation system. However, first, the knowledge about the pose between both sensors is obtained by proposing an improved calibration method. For both calibration and ego-motion estimation, 3D-to-2D correspondences are used and the Perspective-3-Point (P3P) problem is solved. Moreover, the covariance estimation of the relative motion is presented. The experiments show very accurate calibration and navigation results.

AB The on-ramp area has been a hot spot for research as a bottleneck area. In this paper, an on-ramp cooperative merging control strategy is proposed to make full use of active cooperative vehicles, and alleviate the negative influence of merging on the main road. First, a two-stage framework is proposed to illustrate the merging strategy. At the vehicle level, the cooperative merging controllers of vehicles are designed based on an optimization algorithm that considers the penalty function. At the traffic level, the cooperative distance of the upstream and downstream vehicles at the main road target merging position are optimized to improve merging efficiency. Meanwhile, to ensure the implementation of the proposed strategy in mixed traffic, we propose a method to determine the lead vehicles based on the proximity principle. Numerical experiments were performed to verify the fully proactive and cooperative merging (FPCM) strategy, the effectiveness of the vehicle cooperative controllers, the necessity of optimizing the cooperative distance, the effect of different velocities on the main road and ramp, and the effectiveness of determining the lead vehicles. In the case of multivehicle merging, the proposed strategy can improve merging efficiency by 44.42% and save fuel consumption by 39.11%. In the case of a single merging vehicle, the optimized proposed strategy can improve merging efficiency by 48.4% and save fuel consumption by 31.4%. Finally, the simulation experiments for the different maximum speeds of vehicles show that a sufficient speed adjustment range can improve the advantages of the strategy.

AB This paper presents two distributed stochastic source seeking controllers to navigate multiple vehicles to seek the signal source, using the measurements of the signal field at their own positions and information of their neighbors. The first controller utilizes neighbors' measurements of the signal field and the second controller utilizes relative positions between neighbors. The effectiveness of the proposed two controllers is proved by the stochastic averaging theory. The convergence speed of the source seeking system can be calculated for the first controller and it is proved that the convergence speed under the second controller is not slower than that under the first controller. In particular, the distributed controllers are effective for both connected and unconnected graph. Numerical simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the controllers.

DE Semantic Scene Understanding; Deep Learning Methods
AB Fine-grained scene understanding is essential for autonomous driving. The context around a vehicle can change drastically while navigating, making it hard to identify and understand the different objects that may appear. Although recent efforts on semantic and panoptic segmentation pushed the field of scene understanding forward, it is still a challenging task. Current methods depend on annotations provided before deployment and are bound by the labeled classes, ignoring long-tailed classes not annotated in the training data due to the scarcity of examples. However, those long-tailed classes, such as baby strollers or unknown animals, can be crucial when interpreting the vehicle surroundings, e.g., for safe interaction. We address the problem of class-agnostic instance segmentation in this paper that also tackles the long-tailed classes. We propose a novel approach and a benchmark for class-agnostic instance segmentation and a thorough evaluation of our method on real-world data. Our method relies on a self-supervised trained network to extract point-wise features to build a graph representation of the point cloud. Then, we use GraphCut to perform foreground and background separation, achieving instance segmentation without requiring any label. Our results show that our approach is able to achieve instance segmentation and a competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art supervised methods.

AB Negative obstacles have long been a challenging aspect of autonomous navigation for ground vehicles. However, as terrestrial lidar sensors have become lighter and less costly, they have increasingly been deployed on small, low-flying UAV, affording an opportunity to use these sensors to aid in autonomous navigation. In this work, we develop an analytical model for predicting the ability of UAV or UGV mounted lidar sensors to detect negative obstacles. This analytical model improves upon past work in this area because it takes the sensor rotation rate and vehicle speed into account, as well as being valid for both large and small view angles. This analytical model is used to predict the influence of velocity on detection range for a negative obstacle and determine a limiting speed when accounting for vehicle stopping distance. Finally, the analytical model is validated with a physics-based simulator in realistic terrain. The results indicate that the analytical model is valid for altitudes above 10 m and show that there are drastic improvements in negative obstacle detection when using a UAV-mounted lidar. It is shown that negative obstacle detection ranges for various UAV-mounted lidar are 60-110 m, depending on the speed of the UAV and the type of lidar used. In contrast, detection ranges for UGV mounted lidar are found to be less than 10 m.

AB In this paper, we propose a vision-based feature tracker for the autonomous hovering of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and present an area-efficient hardware architecture for its integration into a flight control system-on-chip, which is essential for small UAVs. The proposed feature tracker is based on the Shi-Tomasi algorithm for feature detection and the pyramidal Lucas-Kanade (PLK) algorithm for feature tracking. By applying an efficient hardware structure that leverages the common computations between the Shi-Tomasi and PLK algorithms, the proposed feature tracker offers good tracking performance with fewer hardware resources than existing feature tracker implementations. To evaluate the tracking performance of the proposed feature tracker, we compared it with the GPS-based trajectories of a drone in various flight environments, such as lawn, asphalt, and sidewalk blocks. The proposed tracker exhibited an average accuracy of 0.039 in terms of normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE). The proposed feature tracker was designed using the Verilog hardware description language and implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The proposed feature tracker has 2744 slices, 25 DSPs, and 93 Kbit memory and can support the real-time processing at 417 FPS and an operating frequency of 130 MHz for 640 x 480 VGA images.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm autonomous cooperation method is the basis of UAV swarm intelligent decision-making and cooperative engagement. Due to the complexity and antagonism of the mission environment, usually UAV swarm works in a distributed architecture. However, the process of situation awareness (SA) and the uncertainty of situation information have not been considered carefully by existing distributed cooperation methods. This paper proposes UAV swarm distributed cooperation method based on SA consensus and its information processing mechanism. Firstly, combined with the characteristics of swarm cooperative engagement, we analyze the essence of swarm distributed cooperation methods and propose swarm distributed cooperation method based on SA consensus, which can be further classified into situation perception consensus and situation comprehension consensus. Then, based on different types of consensus model of group decision making (GDM), we regard the UAVs which have a certain autonomous intelligence as intelligent decision-makers and establish the corresponding information processing mechanisms of proposed distributed cooperation methods. Finally, theoretical analysis and case study are used to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method, which is more suitable for complex and antagonistic mission environment.

ID INJURY REDUCTION
AB There are over four million miles of roads in the United States, and the prioritization of locations to perform maintenance activities typically relies on human inspection or semi-automated dedicated vehicles. Pavement markings are used to delineate the boundaries of the lane the vehicle is driving within. These markings are also used by original equipment manufacturers (OEM) for implementing advanced safety features such as lane keep assist (LKA) and eventually autonomous operation. However, pavement markings deteriorate over time due to the fact of weather and wear from tires and snowplow operations. Furthermore, their performance varies depending upon lighting (day/night) as well as surface conditions (wet/dry). This paper presents a case study in Indiana where over 5000 miles of interstate were driven and LKA was used to classify pavement markings. Longitudinal comparisons between 2020 and 2021 showed that the percentage of lanes with both lines detected increased from 80.2% to 92.3%. This information can be used for various applications such as developing or updating standards for pavement marking materials (infrastructure), quantifying performance measures that can be used by automotive OEMs to warn drivers of potential problems with identifying pavement markings, and prioritizing agency pavement marking maintenance activities.

AB Road boundary detection is essential for autonomous vehicle localization and decision-making, especially under GPS signal loss and lane discontinuities. For road boundary detection in structural environments, obstacle occlusions and large road curvature are two significant challenges. However, an effective and fast solution for these problems has remained elusive. To solve these problems, a speed and accuracy tradeoff method for LiDAR-based road boundary detection in structured environments is proposed. The proposed method consists of three main stages: 1) a multi-feature based method is applied to extract feature points; 2) a road-segmentation-line-based method is proposed for classifying left and right feature points; 3) an iterative Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is employed for filtering out false points and extracting boundary points. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, KITTI datasets is used for comprehensive experiments, and the performance of our approach is tested under different road conditions. Comprehensive experiments show the roadsegmentation-line-based method can classify left, and right feature points on structured curved roads, and the proposed iterative Gaussian Process Regression can extract road boundary points on varied road shapes and traffic conditions. Meanwhile, the proposed road boundary detection method can achieve real-time performance with an average of 70.5 ms per frame.

AB In this paper, we investigate device-to-device (D2D) communication networks which are one of the key technologies for next-generation mobile communication networks and many other applications such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), and Internet of things (IoT). The overlay D2D communication networks that are considered in our study use dedicated radio resources separate from what cellular networks use and there exists co-channel interference in D2D networks without cross-channel interference between two networks. We propose a new transmission scheme for overlay D2D networks that uses a dueling deep reinforcement learning (DRL) architecture. The DRL is especially effective in environments where actions do not affect subsequent states as in wireless communication networks. The main contribution of this paper is that the proposed architecture is designed to utilize only information that each D2D devices can easily obtain by measuring channels. The proposed scheme thus enables D2D devices to train their own neural networks and to decide autonomously whether to transmit data without any intervention from infrastructures. The performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed in terms of average sum-rates and is compared to three baseline schemes. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve almost optimal sum-rates with low signal-to-noise (SNR) values without any intervention from infrastructure.

AB Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) will spread as environmental awareness continues to grow. As a result, many PEV batteries are likely to be charged in residential areas overnight, but this will cause a significant voltage decrease in the distribution network. As a countermeasure that does not require capital investment to strengthen the network, this paper proposes an autonomous decentralized voltage control scheme using a PEV battery charger. The scheme can continuously estimate household loads consumption and calculate the reactive power required for compensating the voltage decreases caused by household load consumption and PEV charging. Because only the measured voltage and current at the connecting point of the PEV battery and the impedance between this point and the nearest distributing substation are required to calculate the necessary amount of reactive power compensation, the control scheme can be implemented merely by modifying the control logic circuit built into the PEV battery charger at almost no extra cost. A realistic model of the distribution network and the standard daily demand curve in residential areas in Japan are used to validate the performance of the new scheme.

AB Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) are at the forefront of advancements in transportation, offering enhanced efficiency, safety, and environmental friendliness. To enable ITSs, autonomous systems play a pivotal role, contributing to the development of autonomous driving, data-driven modeling, and multiagent control strategies to establish sustainable and coordinated traffic management. The integration of networked and automated vehicles has garnered significant attention as a potential solution for alleviating traffic congestion and improving fuel economy, achieved through global route optimization and cooperative driving. This study focuses on a predictive control perspective to address the cooperative cruise control problem. Online decision making is employed during the driving process, utilizing information gathered from the network. By employing bargaining games to establish an operating agreement among vehicles, we formalize a synchronization approach based on predictive control theory. Ultimately, these findings are put to the test in an emulation environment within a hardware-in-the-loop system. The results revealed that the proposed cruise control successfully achieved convergence toward the desired reference signal. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving synchronized platoon behavior and correct bargaining outcomes. These findings underscore the effectiveness and potential of DMPC with bargaining games in coordinating and optimizing vehicular networks. This paves the way for future research and development in this promising area.

AB Road boundary estimation is an essential task for autonomous vehicles and intelligent driving assistants. It is considerably straightforward to attain the task when roads are marked properly with indicators. However, estimating road boundary reliably without prior knowledge of the road, such as road markings, is extremely difficult. This paper proposes a method to estimate road boundaries in different environments with deep learning-based semantic segmentation, and without any predefined road markings. The proposed method employed an encoder-decoder-based DeepLab architecture for segmentation with different types of backbone networks such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101 while handling the class imbalance problem by weighing the loss contribution of the model's different outputs. The performance of the proposed method is verified using the 'ICCV09DATA' dataset. The method outperformed other existing methods and achieved the accuracy, precision, recall, f-measure of 0.9596 +/- 0.0097, 0.9453 +/- 0.0118, 0.9369 +/- 0.0149, and 0.9408 +/- 0.0135 respectively while using RestNet-101 as a backbone network and Dice Coefficient as a loss function. The detailed experimental analysis confirms the feasibility of the proposed method for road boundary estimation in different challenging environments.

AB This paper describes a novel manoeuvre planning method to attenuate disturbances acting on occupants of autonomous cars as a result of driving behaviour. New research findings suggested that the passengers in autonomous cars might be more prone to motion sickness and thus overall discomfort. The proposed approach is based on a recently developed novel continuous B-spline path smoothing algorithm for car-like steered robots. Two algorithms are designed for urban driving scenarios and steering between two predefined poses. The resulting paths avoid abrupt changes in steering and longitudinal velocity, by maintaining curvature and its high order continuity. We show that this lead to reduced high frequency disturbances in steering and resulting load disturbances on passengers. The presented novel B-spline manoeuvres outperform other planning methods by reducing lateral acceleration and yaw disturbances. New approach was verified by rigorous simulations, numerical and field experimentation. Tests were repeated for a number of different paths and velocities. The reported results are the first spline based parameterisation methods practically applied for autonomous cars planning and re-planning, then validated using both noisy actuation simulations and field experiments.

AB Overspeed information monitoring and collecting becomes increasingly important with the rapid development of intelligent transportation, but current overspeed monitoring technologies are constrained by traditional power-supply for large-scale use. Herein, we proposed a self-powered overspeed wake-up alarm system (SOWAS) based on triboelectric nanogenerators. The SOWAS consists of an energy harvesting triboelectric nanogenerator (E-TENG), an energy management module (EMM), an overspeed sensing triboelectric nanogenerator (S-TENG), a power-switch module (PSM) and a wireless transceiver module (WTM). The E-TENG and EMM are used for mechanical energy harvesting, management, and powering for the SOWAS, while the S-TENG, PSM and WTM are employed for active overspeed monitoring and alarm signals transmitting. When the vehicle speed exceeds the setting threshold, the PSM will be activated, and the WTM will send alarm signals with the harvested energy. The response characteristics dependence of the SOWAS on various working parameters were investigated in detail. The developed SOWAS could work sustainably in unattended traffic environment without external power supply for autonomous overspeed monitoring and alarming. Meanwhile, intelligent monitoring of overspeed and improved energy utilization were achieved. This work has enormous potentials and promising prospects for TENG in intelligent transportation, Internet of Vehicles and autonomous driving.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) perform various applications such as seafloor mapping and underwater structure health monitoring. Commonly, an inertial navigation system aided by a Doppler velocity log (DVL) is used to provide the vehicle's navigation solution. In such fusion, the DVL provides the velocity vector of the AUV, which determines the navigation solution's accuracy and helps estimate the navigation states. This paper proposes BeamsNet, an end-to-end deep learning framework to regress the estimated DVL velocity vector that improves the accuracy of the velocity vector estimate, and could replace the model-based approach. Two versions of BeamsNet, differing in their input to the network, are suggested. The first uses the current DVL beam measurements and inertial sensor data, while the other utilizes only DVL data, taking the current and past DVL measurements for the regression process. Both simulation and sea experiments were made to validate the proposed learning approach relative to the model-based approach. Sea experiments were made with the Snapir AUV in the Mediterranean Sea, collecting approximately four and a half hours of DVL and inertial sensor data. Our results show that the proposed approach achieved an improvement of more than 60% in estimating the DVL velocity vector.

AB To ensure trajectory tracking accuracy and driving safety, this paper presents a real time nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) method for autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) to avoid dangerous load transfer effect in carrying heavy equipment. The AGV with a four-wheel-steering four-wheel-driving (4WS4WD) structure is controlled with a steer and velocity input for each wheel. The tracking problem is implemented by the standard NMPC framework and the referenced trajectory is planned by the Reeds-Shepp algorithm. A Large load creates a considerable load transfer effect which is dangerous for the wheels; hence, the controller limits the lateral acceleration to reduce load transfer. To realize online numerical computation for NMPC, the continuation/generalized minimal residual (C/GMRES) method is applied. A semismooth transformation based on the Chen-Harker-Kanzow-Smale (CHKS) function is introduced to handle inequality constraints since C/GMRES only solves standard equality forms. Trajectory tracking simulations are carried out in contrast to the quadratic programming method without lateral load transfer optimization, and practical experiments on an AGV carrying 13 tons of steel are also performed. The results indicate the accuracy, efficiency, safety and applicability of the proposed method on heavy-duty AGVs.

TI AV futures or futures with AVs? Bridging sociotechnical imaginaries and

SO HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS

AB Current depictions of autonomous vehicle (AV) futures are produced primarily by automobile manufacturers that largely reflect and reinforce existing sociotechnical systems in a 'business as usual' model that frames this technology within a narrative of crisis and technological salvation. This article argues for a more complex analysis of AV futures in which images are understood as vessels for sociotechnical imaginaries that direct and delimit what we think is possible in the future. Through an analytical framework incorporating automobility, transitions, and imaginaries, I explore how depictions of AVs frame the technology as responding to various system pressures over time through a comparative analysis of two actors. The analysis suggests that regime actors deploy visual discursive material as a tool of regime stability or change to benefit their own agendas. The intention of the article is not to anticipate current trajectories but is a methodological exploration of how policymakers and planners can interpret AV visualisations. Therefore, the paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these imaginaries for future transportation systems. It further suggests that policymakers and planners need to take a more active role in the development of AV futures by paying much more attention to the latent meanings behind AV visualisations and working collaboratively with those who produce them.

AB Adaptive cruise control of autonomous vehicles can be posed as a multi-objective optimization problem where several conflicting criteria, e. g., fuel economy, tracking capability, ride comfort, and safety, need to be satisfied simultaneously. In order to reconcile these conflicting criteria, this paper presents a novel multi-objective predictive cruise control (MOPCC) approach in the feasible perturbation-based real-time iterative optimization framework. The longitudinal dynamics of vehicles are described as nonlinear cartracking models. The new cost function for MOPCC is defined as the distance of the criteria vector to the vector of separately minimized criteria (i.e., a utopia point of the criteria). The weight-free MOPCC is then obtained by solving a constrained nonlinear optimal control problem in receding horizon fashion. Due to the difficulty in solving the optimization problem, the integrated perturbation analysis and sequential quadratic programming (InPA-SQP) is employed to compute the cruise controller. The merit of the proposed MOPCC is that it can systematically handle different cruise scenarios regardless of the weights of the predictive cruise control (PCC) criteria. Several driving cases are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed approach via comparing to weighted PCC approaches.

AB Relationships among seep community biomass, diversity, and physiographic controls such as underlying geology are not well understood. Previous efforts to constrain these relationships at the Blake Ridge Diapir were limited to observations from piloted deep-submergence vehicles. In August 2012, the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Sentry collected geophysical and photographic data over a 0.131 km(2) area at the Blake Ridge Diapir seeps. A nested survey approach was used that began with a regional or reconnaissance-style survey using sub-bottom mapping systems to locate and identify seeps and underlying conduits. This survey was followed by AUV-mounted sidescan sonar and multibeam echosounder systems mapping on a mesoscale to characterize the seabed physiography. At the most detailed survey level, digital photographic imaging was used to resolve sub-meter characteristics of the biology. Four pockmarks (25-70 m diameter) were documented, each supporting chemosynthetic communities. Concentric zonation of mussels and clams suggests the influence of chemical gradients on megafaunal distribution. Data collection and analytical techniques used here yield high-resolution habitat maps that can serve as baselines to constrain temporal evolution of seafloor seeps, and to inform ecological niche modeling and resource management.

AB Introduction: In highly autonomous driving scenarios, it is critical to identify strategies to accelerate reaction times since drivers may take too long to take over control of the vehicle. Previous studies reported that an Acoustic Startling Pre-Stimulus (ASPS, i.e., a loud warning preceding an action) accelerated reaction times in simple ankle flexion exercises.
   Methods: In this study, we examined if an ASPS warning leads to shorter takeover reaction times in a sled-simulated evasive swerving maneuver. Twenty-eight participants (seven male adults, seven male teenagers, seven female adults, and seven female teenagers) were instructed to align a marker on the steering wheel with a marker on a lateral post as fast as they could as soon as the lateral sled perturbation (0.75 g) started. Four conditions were examined: with and without an ASPS (105 dB, played 250 ms before sled perturbation for 40 ms), and with and without a secondary task (i.e., texting). A catch trial (ASPS only) was used to minimize anticipation. Human kinematics were captured with an 8-camera 3D motion capture system.
   Results: Results showed that the drivers' hands lifted towards the steering wheel more quickly with the ASPS (169 +/- 55 ms) than without (194 +/- 46 ms; p = 0.01), and that adult drivers touched the steering wheel quicker with the ASPS (435 +/- 54 ms) than without (470 +/- 33 ms; p = 0.01). Similar findings were not observed for the teen drivers. Additionally, female drivers were found to lift their hands towards the steering wheel faster than male drivers (166 +/- 58 ms vs. 199 +/- 36 ms; p = 0.009).
   Discussion: Our findings suggest that the ASPS may be beneficial to accelerate driver reaction times during the initiation of a correction maneuver, and that autonomous vehicle warnings may need to be tailored to the age and sex of the driver.

AB Modern wireless communication systems are limited to line-of-sight (LoS) links due to high path loss and blockage issues in millimeter wave (5G) and beyond in optical/visible light communication networks. This letter proposes utilizing (optical) reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-equipped UAV (RISeUAV) to support indirect aerial LoS (ALoS) links for mobile vehicles that deliver critical metropolitan emergency/security services. The RISeUAV performs as an aerial transponder and reflects optical and wireless communication signals in dense urban areas. The navigation problem of the RISeUAV is nontrivial where RISeUAV should be autonomously navigated through an energy-efficient obstacle-free path. Notably, the flight altitude should be relatively low to ensure the quality of ALoS service while the maximum possible ALoS links for vehicles are provided in an obstructed environment. However, designing the flight path for rendering valid ALoS service is an NP-hard problem that is not feasible in real-time for autonomous navigation. We model the RISeUAV navigation as an optimization problem and propose an efficient technique to make the problem computationally tractable in real-time using Benders' decomposition method and sequential convex programming. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB In this paper, we envision an emerging Mixed Operation Zone (MOZ) where both autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs) are present for on-demand ride services. This paper aims to size and operate a fleet of AVs and HVs in the presence of MOZs and to investigate the impact of MOZs on on-demand ride services. Considering the demand uncertainty, we propose a demand-oriented robust minimum fleet problem (RMFP) and employ a two-stage robust optimization (RO) to model the decision-making. Fluctuant demand is bounded by distribution-free uncertainty sets. For the convenience of solving RO models, we reformulate the second-stage recourse problem with an equivalent mathematical programming formulation. A tailored column-and-constraint generation algorithm is developed to solve the RMFP exactly. The algorithm is proved to converge in a finite number of iterations. Extensive experiments are conducted on the instances based on a real-world on-demand ride service in Chengdu. The developed algorithm performs better than the state-of-the-art Benders decomposition approach. Numerical results imply huge potential benefits from MOZs on improving service performance for ride service platforms.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE; LATIN HYPERCUBE DESIGN; ALGORITHM
AB This paper proposes a bio-inspired hull shape (BHS) for AUV by studying and modeling the body shape of humpback whales. Among factors affecting hydrodynamic characteristics, this paper considers both the hull drag and displacement volume to optimize the BHS, which profitably improve the space utilization and voyage of the AUV. The optimization is conducted by a surrogate model using response surface methodology (RSM), during which the translational propagation Latin hypercube design (TPLHD) is adopted to obtain sampling points. In order to verify the optimization results of BHS, the drag computations for BHS and eight typical hull shapes of existing typical or bionic AUVs are performed for comparison under conditions of similar volume, wet surface area, body length and attachments. A scaled-down model of BHS with attachments is then designed, manufactured and carried out a towing tank test. The drag measured in the towing tank test is basically the same as the simulation result, with the average relative error of 3.68% at 4m/s. The result of the shape optimization performed with the RSM is effective. Furthermore, the proposed BHS is highly suitable for underwater vehicles with requirements for longer distance, higher speed or better sensor carrying capacity.

DT Editorial Material
AB Intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) are usually expected to run a huge number of emerging smart applications (e.g., autonomous driving, safety early warning, natural language processing, etc.) for assisting both the drivers and passengers in vehicular environments. These kinds of applications typically require significant computing power to perform computation-intensive and latency-sensitive tasks generated by the vehicle sensors for low-latency response. However, the limited computation capacity of on-board computers makes it difficult to satisfy the computation requirements of quality-of-experience (QoE)-demanding applications. To tackle the challenge, fog/edge computing is proposed as innovative computing paradigms to extend computing capacity to the network edge to meet the requirements. This Special Section in IEEE Access focuses on innovative technologies and solutions enabled communication and edge computing toward ICVs.

AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) with their evolving data gathering capabilities will play a significant role in road safety and efficiency applications supported by Intelligent Transport Systems (ITSs), such as Traffic Signal Control (TSC) for urban traffic congestion management. However, their involvement will expand the space of security vulnerabilities and create larger threat vectors. In this article, we perform the first detailed security analysis and implementation of a new cyber-physical attack category carried out by the network of CAVs against Adaptive Multi-Agent Traffic Signal Control (AMATSC), namely, coordinated Sybil attacks, where vehicles with forged or fake identities try to alter the data collected by the AMATSC algorithms to sabotage their decisions. Consequently, a novel, game-theoretic mitigation approach at the application layer is proposed to minimize the impact of such sophisticated data corruption attacks. The devised minimax game model enables the AMATSC algorithm to generate optimal decisions under a suspected attack, improving its resilience. Extensive experimentation is performed on a traffic dataset provided by the city of Montreal under real-world intersection settings to evaluate the attack impact. Our results improved time loss on attacked intersections by approximately 48.9%. Substantial benefits can be gained from the mitigation, yielding more robust adaptive control of traffic across networked intersections.

ID SAFETY ASSESSMENT
AB Autonomous driving has attracted considerable attention from research and industry communities. Although prototypes of automated vehicles (AVs) are developed, remaining safety issues and functional insufficiencies hinder their market introduction. To obtain reasonably foreseeable scenarios and study human driving policies, many naturalistic driving datasets are proposed. However, no open-source dataset filled with congestion scenarios is publicly available. The paper presents the Aerial Dataset for China's Congested Highways & Expressways (AD4CHE). It contains 5.12 hours of aerial survey data from four different cities in China, with a total driving distance of 6540.7 km. Moreover, overlap and non-overlap cut-in scenarios are distinguished to better describe driver behavior in congestion scenarios. Both types of cut-in scenarios are extracted and parameterized. The Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) is utilized to generate parameter distributions for the scenario-based testing method. Furthermore, the driving behavior in overlap cut-in scenarios is intensively analyzed. The results reveal that the drivers have an evasive maneuver during overlap cut-in of challenging vehicles, and the preferred following distance varies with the relative longitudinal velocity. Both scenario parameterization and driving behavior analysis can contribute to developing and verifying Traffic Jam Pilot (TJP) systems deployed in Chinese traffic situations.

DE Motion prediction; uncertainty estimation; deep ensemble learning;
   decision-making; driving safety
AB Motion prediction is the fundamental input for decision-making in autonomous vehicles. The current motion prediction solutions are designed with a strong reliance on black box predictions based on neural networks (NNs), which is unacceptable for safety-critical applications. Motion prediction with high uncertainty can cause conflicting decisions and even catastrophic results. To address this issue, an uncertainty estimation approach based on the deep ensemble technique is proposed for motion prediction in this paper. Subsequently, the estimated uncertainty is considered in the decision-making module to improve driving safety. Firstly, a motion prediction model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) is built and the deep ensemble technique is utilized to obtain both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty of the prediction model. Besides, an uncertainty-aware potential field is developed to process the prediction uncertainty. Furthermore, a decision-making framework is proposed based on the model predictive control algorithm that considers the uncertainty-aware potential field, road boundaries, and multiple constraints of vehicle dynamics. Finally, the public available NGSIM, HighD and INTERACTION datasets are used to evaluate the proposed motion prediction model. More importantly, two traffic scenarios are also extracted from NGSIM and INTERACTION datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed decision-making method and in particular, its real-time performance is shown by employing a hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) experiment bench.

AB In this paper, a collision avoidance guidance and control (CAGC) scheme for fully autonomous unmanned surface vehicle (USV) according to the guidance, navigation and control (GNC) architecture is studied. The CAGC scheme is divided into guidance layer and control layer. To avoid the possibility of collision in tracking guidance, the proposed guidance layer needs remove the tracking guidance and realize the direct guidance to the control layer, which is designed according to the theory of finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) with control ability. Next, to balance the contradiction between calculation and guidance accuracy, the methods of delay compensation and control set normal distribution are designed. In addition, in the control layer, the vector propulsion USV as the control object is non-minimum phase system because of its small size and significant sway thrust, so the virtual control point is used to solve this system, and the relationship between virtual control point and vessel speed is determined by zero-dynamics stability analysis. And the control layer adopts adaptive sliding mode control theory to resist the influence of strong disturbances. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the efficacy of the CAGC scheme.

AB This paper investigates a performance-guaranteed formation tracking problem of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) under uncertain environments. Especially, model uncertainties, external disturbances and actuator faults exist simultaneously. Based on graph theory and adaptive techniques, a novel two-layer robust adaptive fault tolerant formation scheme is developed. In kinematic layer, a transformation is made to get a performance unconstrained problem and an adaptive control strategy is incorporated to stabilize transformed errors. In kinetic layer, two types of robust adaptive fault-tolerant formation controllers, i.e. the fault-based one and the fault-unknown one, are designed for different fault scenarios. These controllers share the same structure of single-parameter updating laws to adjust adaptive parameters. It is shown that: 1) using the proposed formation scheme with either designed fault-tolerant controller, desired formation configurations of ASVs are achieved if the interaction topology is connected and control parameters satisfy given conditions; 2) prescribed formation tracking performance can be ensured and all error signals are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded; 3) a trade-off between two designed controllers exists, that is although the assumption for fault-unknown controller is weaker, larger control parameters are required to behave like fault-based one. Simulations and comparisons are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of theoretical results.

AB Covid-19 seriously impacts and endangers lives of millions worldwide. To fight the spread of the virus, governments have taken various restricting measures including stay at home orders. Ultimately, the home delivery volume increased significantly, which still bears the risk of human-human infection during the final delivery. From a logisticians perspective, autonomous delivery vehicles (ADVs), which are a contactless delivery solution, have the potential to radically change the way groceries are delivered to customer homes and help to stop the spread of the virus. However, to date, research on user acceptance of ADVs is rare. This paper theoretically extends the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) including gender as a moderator. The study is based on quantitative data collected in Germany through an online questionnaire (n = 501). Data were analysed using structural equation modelling. The results indicate that trust in technology, price sensitivity, innovativeness, performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, social influence, and perceived risk determine behavioural intention. However, some constructs are only significant for women. The findings of this paper have theoretical, managerial and policy contributions and implications within the areas of last-mile delivery and technology acceptance.

AB The overall architectural complexity of autonomous underwater vehicles continuous to increase, enlarging the probability of fault occurrence in subsystems. Estimating the thrust loss by particle filter provided a useful method to detect the fault in propeller subsystem. In order to detect the fault in propellers as early as possible, the particle filter direct prediction method could amplify the fault trend and detect the fault earlier, but at the same time increase the possibility of false diagnosis. Therefore, a more accurate fault diagnosis method was required to discover the fault early and decrease the occurrence of false diagnosis. In this paper, an improved particle filter prediction method was proposed, combining the advantage of grey prediction to forecast the motion state, reducing the uncertainty in particle filter direct prediction process. Besides, the Gaussian kernel function was applied to judge the credibility of the prediction result, decreasing the possibility of the false diagnosis. In the experiments with simulated working conditions data and a section of actual sea trial data with propeller fault, the proposed method detected the fault earlier compared with the original particle filter method, and reduced the false diagnosis rate compared with the particle filter direct prediction method. The results show that the proposed method is effective in detecting the fault early with low false diagnosis.

AB For a 3-D underwater workspace with a variable ocean current, an integrated multiple autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) dynamic task assignment and path planning algorithm is proposed by combing the improved self-organizing map (SOM) neural network and a novel velocity synthesis approach. The goal is to control a team of AUVs to reach all appointed target locations for only one time on the premise of workload balance and energy sufficiency while guaranteeing the least total and individual consumption in the presence of the variable ocean current. First, the SOM neuron network is developed to assign a team of AUVs to achieve multiple target locations in 3-D ocean environment. The working process involves special definition of the initial neural weights of the SOM network, the rule to select the winner, the computation of the neighborhood function, and the method to update weights. Then, the velocity synthesis approach is applied to plan the shortest path for each AUV to visit the corresponding target in a dynamic environment subject to the ocean current being variable and targets being movable. Lastly, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, simulation results are given in this paper.

TI Cable route surveys utilizing autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs)
SO MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Detailed geophysical surveys are required in both deep and shallow water to avoid potential hazards and to provide for the installation and safety of fiber optic telecommunication cables. Unfortunately data obtained in potential burial zones with existing technology are slow and often data accuracy may be questionable. Towing cabled or tethered survey systems, from a project perspective, is time consuming and provides marginally adequate data. Additionally, a launch is usually required to survey between the surf and the safe working limits of the survey ship. This requires additional equipment that is weather sensitive and subject to failure.
   To address this problem, C & C Technologies, Inc. of Lafayette, Louisiana, USA has contracted with Kongsberg Simrad for the construction of a Hugin 3000 autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). C & C Technologies' Hugin 3000 AUV, which is to be delivered in July of 2000, will be integrated with a variety of sensors including high frequency multibeam swath bathymetry and imagery. Other survey sensors include chirp side scan sonar; chirp subbottom profiler, and magnetometer. Vehicle positioning will be provided by a USBL acoustic positioning system, integrated with Doppler speed log, an inertial navigation system, and for surface operations, DGPS. AW power will be delivered by aluminum oxygen fuel cells.
   This paper will address AW operations, platform performance, sensor specifications and integration, project milestones, and system economics with regards to cable route surveys.

AB When negotiating bends car drivers perform gaze polling: their gaze shifts between guiding fixations (GFs; gaze directed 1-2 s ahead) and look-ahead fixations (LAFs; longer time headway). How might this behavior change in autonomous vehicles where the need for constant active visual guidance is removed? In this driving simulator study, we analyzed this gaze behavior both when the driver was in charge of steering or when steering was delegated to automation, separately for bend approach (straight line) and the entry of the bend (turn), and at various speeds. The analysis of gaze distributions relative to bend sections and driving conditions indicate that visual anticipation (through LAFs) is most prominent before entering the bend. Passive driving increased the proportion of LAFs with a concomitant decrease of GFs, and increased the gaze polling frequency. Gaze polling frequency also increased at higher speeds, in particular during the bend approach when steering was not performed. LAFs encompassed a wide range of eccentricities. To account for this heterogeneity two sub-categories serving distinct information requirements are proposed: mid-eccentricity LAFs could be more useful for anticipatory planning of steering actions, and far-eccentricity LAFs for monitoring potential hazards. The results support the idea that gaze and steering coordination may be strongly impacted in autonomous vehicles.

AB Public datasets are becoming extremely important for the scientific and industrial community to accelerate the development of new approaches and to guarantee identical testing conditions for comparing methods proposed by different researchers. This research presents the Urban@CRAS dataset that captures several scenarios of one iconic region at Porto Portugal These scenario presents a multiplicity of conditions and urban situations including, vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-human interactions, cross-sides, turn-around, roundabouts and different traffic conditions. Data from these scenarios are timestamped, calibrated and acquired at 10 to 200 Hz by through a set of heterogeneous sensors installed in a roof of a car. These sensors include a 3D LIDAR, high-resolution color cameras, a high-precision IMU and a GPS navigation system. In addition, positioning information obtained from a real-time kinematic satellite navigation system (with 0.05m of error) is also included as ground-truth. Moreover, a benchmarking process for some typical methods for visual odometry and SLAM is also included in this research, where qualitative and quantitative performance indicators are used to discuss the advantages and particularities of each implementation. Thus, this research fosters new advances on the perception and navigation approaches of autonomous robots (and driving). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) can operate automatically with a small number of humans and requires few resources when compared to a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). The pipeline inspection with the use of an AUV can be significantly cheaper than those of an ROV. Successful deployment of AUVs relies on accurate pipeline detection and extraction that can automatically locate and track a pipeline direction in real time. We proposed to use forward-looking sonar images to locate and extract pipeline paths since sonar can easily image through turbulence and small particles, commonly found in underwater environments. However, sonar images are prone to disturbance from the environment. Thus, as a superior alternative, we developed a pipeline detection algorithm by considering that a pipeline has a piecewise linear shape. Next, the self-organizing map (SOM) is employed to join the labeled segments together to form a pipeline track to extract the pipeline path for the navigation of an AUV since SOM can map a 2-D image of pipeline into a 1-D line. In our experiment, data obtained from the Gulf of Thailand are used for the performance analysis, and we are able to extract and describe a pipeline direction with accuracies between 90% and 97%.

ID DYNAMIC WINDOW APPROACH; NAVIGATION
AB Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are important autonomous marine robots that have been extensively studied and gradually applied. However, the autonomy of USVs is still restricted by the performance of autonomous navigation technology. At present, various local obstacle avoidance algorithms have been proposed for USVs. However, the majority of algorithm results have only been verified by simulations, with only a few demonstrated by low-speed USVs (<= 5 knots) in the sea. Therefore, the issues of obstacle avoidance for high-speed USVs in complicated obstacles environments have to be studied. This paper presents a novel general local reactive obstacle avoidance algorithm for high-speed USVs. In this algorithm, the direction steady-state model and the translational velocity model are proposed for the base normal motion and base motion control characteristics of high-speed vessels. During navigation, USV motion depends on the guidance angle and guidance translational velocity. The validity of the proposed algorithm is verified by experiments in simulations and sea trials on a high-speed USV (>= 20 knots) in real marine environments. Results show that the algorithm adapts to the characteristics of high-speed USVs and can guide high-speed USVs (>= 20 knots) in realizing safe navigation in real marine environments.

AB A scarcity of wintertime observations of surface ocean carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO(2)) in and near the Gulf Stream creates uncertainty in the magnitude of the regional carbon sink and its controlling mechanisms. Recent observations from an Uncrewed Surface Vehicle (USV), outfitted with a payload to measure surface ocean and lower atmosphere pCO(2), revealed sharp gradients in ocean pCO(2) across the Gulf Stream. Surface ocean pCO(2) was lower by similar to 50 mu atm relative to the atmosphere in the subtropical mode water (STMW) formation region. This undersaturation combined with strong wintertime winds allowed for rapid ocean uptake of CO2, averaging -11.5 mmol m(-2) day(-1) during the February 2019 USV mission. The unique timing of this mission revealed active STMW formation. The USV proved to be a useful tool for CO2 flux quantification in the poorly observed, dynamic western boundary current environment.

TI Boosting Real-Time Driving Scene Parsing With Shared Semantics

AB Real-time scene parsing is a fundamental feature for autonomous driving vehicles with multiple cameras. In this letter we demonstrate that sharing semantics between cameras with different perspectives and overlapping views can boost the parsing performance when compared with traditional methods, which individually process the frames from each camera. Our framework is based on a deep neural network for semantic segmentation but with two kinds of additional modules for sharing and fusing semantics. On the one hand, a semantics sharing module is designed to establish the pixel-wise mapping between the input images. Features as well as semantics are shared by the map to reduce duplicated workload, which leads to more efficient computation. On the other hand, feature fusion modules are designed to combine different modalities of semantic features, which leverages the information from both inputs for better accuracy. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we have applied our network to a dual-camera vision system for driving scene parsing. Experimental results show that our network outperforms the baseline method on the parsing accuracy with comparable computations.

AB Although maritime transport is the backbone of world commerce, its digitalization lags significantly behind when we consider some basic facts. This work verifies the state-of-the-art as it currently applies to eight digital domains: Autonomous vehicles and robotics; artificial intelligence; big data; virtual reality, augmented and mixed reality; internet of things; the cloud and edge computing; digital security; and 3D printing and additive engineering. It also provides insight into each of the three sectors into which this industry has been divided: Ship design and shipbuilding; shipping; and ports. The work, based on a systematic literature review, demonstrates that there are domains on which almost no formal study has been done thus far and concludes that there are major areas that require attention in terms of research. It also illustrates the increasing interest on the subject, arising from the necessity of raising the maritime transport industry to the same level of digitalization as other industries.

Specifically, three types of CF models are considered: basic, time-delayed, and multi-anticipative/cooperative CF models. For each type, notable methods in the literature for analysing its local stability and string stability have been reviewed in detail, including the characteristic equation based method (e.g., root extracting, the root locus method, the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, the Nyquist criterion and the Hopf bifurcation method), Lyapunov criterion, the direct transfer function based method, and the Laplace transform based method. In addition, consistency and applicability of stability criteria obtained using some of these methods are objectively compared with the simulation result from a series of numerical experiments. Finally, issues, challenges, and research needs of CF models' stability analysis in the era of connected and autonomous vehicles are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Predicting the trajectories of surrounding vehicles is an essential task in autonomous driving, especially in a highway setting, where minor deviations in motion can cause serious road accidents. The future trajectory prediction is often not only based on historical trajectories but also on a representation of the interaction between neighbouring vehicles. Current state-of-the-art methods have extensively utilized RNNs, CNNs and GNNs to model this interaction and predict future trajectories, relying on a very popular dataset known as NGSIM, which, however, has been criticized for being noisy and prone to overfitting issues. Moreover, transformers, which gained popularity from their benchmark performance in various NLP tasks, have hardly been explored in this problem, presumably due to the accumulative errors in their autoregressive decoding nature of time-series forecasting. Therefore, we propose MALS-Net, a Multi-Head Attention-based LSTM Sequence-to-Sequence model that makes use of the transformer's mechanism without suffering from accumulative errors by utilizing an attention-based LSTM encoder-decoder architecture. The proposed model was then evaluated in BLVD, a more practical dataset without the overfitting issue of NGSIM. Compared to other relevant approaches, our model exhibits state-of-the-art performance for both short and long-term prediction.

AB Surrogate safety measures (SSM) are used to assess the risk for autonomous emergency braking system (AEBS). Developing appropriate SSM and accurately executing the braking request are the key issues. Time-to-collision (TTC) is a typical time-based SSM with limitations. By analyzing the braking process, this paper proposes a new SSM based on deceleration rate to avoid collision (DRAC). As the brake actuator, vehicle electronic stability control (ESC) system has many problems, such as large overshoot and pressure fluctuation. Considering the model of hydraulic control unit (HCU) and vehicle, a deceleration controller based on non-linear model predictive control (NMPC) is proposed. Based on this, a layered AEBS architecture is proposed. The upper-layer AEBS controller calculates the expected deceleration based on modified DRAC (MDRAC), and transmits it to the lower-layer NMPC deceleration controller. Finally, the simulation and experimental tests are carried out. The results show that the system has a fast and stable response. In addition, the performance of the proposed AEBS strategy is tested according to the Euro-NCAP test protocol. Comparing the results with the TTC method, the proposed method can improve the stability of the distance margin by more than 0.55 m, which ensures the safety and improves the stability of the vehicle.

AB The international space community has become comfortable over the years with a model of operations based on verbal delegation of operations control from a mission control center based on Earth. This model requires near-constant telemetry regarding the status of the vehicle, as well as tasks on-board. The future long-duration exploration missions being considered will require significant changes in this operational paradigm, adjusting to situational realities, capitalizing on the evolution that has occurred in vehicle autonomous health management, and maximizing the time crew members can devote to exploration.
   NASA has created an exploration strategy aimed at multiple destinations, utilizing multiple assets during operations, and increasing both the distance to exploration objectives and the duration of exploration flights. While developing the Lunar Malapert Excursion as a reference mission, our team began to understand that transitioning the world's space operations community from the current paradigm of near constant and all-inclusive vehicle status and task reporting, to a more autonomous self-management paradigm, would take both time and clear explanation of the benefits of the new approach.
   The new paradigm will take advantage of advances in health management systems and operational planning tools that allow on-board operators the ability to self-manage a significant set of decision parameters, allowing crew the independence to set priorities and adapt their exploration activities as necessary for their situation.

AB Imaging and mapping sonars such as forward-looking sonars (FLS) and side-scan sonars (SSS) are sensors frequently used onboard autonomous underwater vehicles. To acquire information from around the vehicle, it is desirable for these sonar systems to insonify a large area; thus, the sonar transmit beampattern should have a wide field of view. In this work, we study the problem of the optimization of wide transmission beampatterns. We consider the conventional phased-array beampattern design problem where all array elements transmit an identical waveform. The complex weight vector is adjusted to create the desired beampattern shape. In our experiments, we consider wide transmission beampatterns (>= 20 degrees) with uniform output power. In this paper, we introduce a new iterative-convex optimization method for narrowband linear phased arrays and compare it to existing approaches for convex and concave-convex optimization. In the iterative-convex method, the phase of the weight parameters is allowed to be complex as in disciplined convex-concave programming (DCCP). Comparing the iterative-convex optimization method and DCCP to the standard convex optimization, we see that the former methods archive optimized beampatterns closer to the desired beampatterns. Furthermore, for the same number of iterations, the proposed iterative-convex method achieves optimized beampatterns, which are closer to the desired beampattern than the beampatterns achieved by optimization with DCCP.

AB Accurate recognition of traffic lights in public roads is a critical step to deploy automated driving systems. Camera sensors are widely used for the object detection task. It might seem natural to employ them to traffic signal detection. However, images as captured by cameras contain a broad number of unrelated objects, causing a significant reduction in the detection accuracy. This paper presents an innovative, yet reliable method to recognize the state of traffic lights in images. With the help of accurate 3D maps and a self-localization technique in it, elements already being used in autonomous driving systems, we propose a method to improve the traffic light detection accuracy. Using the current location and looking for the traffic signals in the road, we extract the region related only to the traffic light (ROI, region of interest) in images captured by a vehicle-mounted camera, then we feed the ROIs to custom classifiers to recognize the state. Evaluation of our method was carried out in two datasets recorded during our urban public driving experiments, one taken during day light and the other obtained during sunset. The quantitative evaluations indicate that our method achieved over 97% average precision for each state and approximately 90% recall as far as 90 meters under preferable condition.

AB In this study, the stochastic nonlinear system-based trajectory tracking control problem of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is studied. We investigate the time-varying gain adaptive control method to find possible approaches to reduce the excessive computational burden. Enhanced adaptive algorithms are devised by considering the dynamic characteristics of AUV motion. By transforming the original controller design problems into parameter selection problems and subsequently solving them using the functional time-varying observer technical theorem, we can achieve optimal control performance. The control system is shown to constrain system state error due to stochastic disturbances within arbitrarily small domains. A coordinate transformation is proposed for all system states to meet boundedness conditions. We show that the closed-loop stability is confirmed, the system is asymptotically probabilistically stable, and contraction limits given in the stability analysis may be used to certify the convergence of the AUV trajectory errors. A large number of simulation studies using an underwater vehicle model have proved the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. A real-time, time-varying gain constructive control strategy is further developed for the hardware-in-the-loop simulation; the effectiveness of the controller design is confirmed by introducing the controller into the AUV actuator model.

AB Autonomous driving (AD), including single-vehicle intelligent AD and vehicle-infrastructure cooperative AD, has become a current research hot spot in academia and industry, and multi-sensor fusion is a fundamental task for AD system perception. However, the multi-sensor fusion process faces the problem of differences in the type and dimensionality of sensory data acquired using different sensors (cameras, lidar, millimeter-wave radar, and so on) as well as differences in the performance of environmental perception caused by using different fusion strategies. In this article, we study multiple papers on multi-sensor fusion in the field of AD and address the problem that the category division in current multi-sensor fusion perception is not detailed and clear enough and is more subjective, which makes the classification strategies differ significantly among similar algorithms. We innovatively propose a multi-sensor fusion taxonomy, which divides the fusion perception classification strategies into two categories-symmetric fusion and asymmetric fusion-and seven subcategories of strategy combinations, such as data, features, and results. In addition, the reliability of current AD perception is limited by its insufficient environment perception capability and the robustness of data-driven methods in dealing with extreme situations (e.g., blind areas). This article also summarizes the innovative applications of multi-sensor fusion classification strategies in AD cooperative perception.

AB In the present day, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology is being used for a multitude of inspection operations, including those in offshore structures such as wind-farms. Due to the distance of these structures to the coast, drones need to be carried to these structures via ship. To achieve a completely autonomous operation, the UAV can greatly benefit from an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) to transport the UAV to the operation location and coordinate a successful landing between the two. This work presents the concept of a four-link parallel platform to perform wave-motion synchronization to facilitate UAV landings. The parallel platform consists of two base floaters connected with rigid rods, linked by linear actuators to a top mobile platform for the landing of a UAV. Using an inverse kinematics approach, a study of the position of the cylinders for greater range of motion and a workspace analysis is achieved. The platform makes use of a feedback controller to reduce the total motion of the landing platform. Using the robotic operating system (ROS) and Gazebo to emulate wave motions and represent the physical model and actuator system, the platform control system was successfully validated.

AB For many years, tremendous effort has been dedicated to developing new industrial tuna fisheries, while their adverse impacts on threatened marine species have received relatively little attention. In tuna fisheries, bycatch is the major anthropogenic threat to marine megafauna in general, particularly sharks. Research on the development of gear technology for bycatch reduction and potential mitigation measures helped tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations adopt bycatch reduction management measures. After reviewing past research on the development of mitigation measures for pelagic longline and tropical purse seine fisheries based on pelagic species' behaviours, we describe promising new approaches integrating recent technological breakthroughs. New innovations include autonomous underwater vehicles carrying cameras along with miniaturized sensors, aerial drones, computer simulation of fishing gear geometry, environmental DNA assays, computer visualizations and deep learning. The successful application of such tools and methods promises to improve our understanding of factors that influence capture, escape and stress of caught species. Moreover, results emerging from recent ethological research explaining the power of social connection and learning in the "fish world" such as social learning from congeners, habituation to deterrents, and how past fishery interactions affect responses to fishing gear should be taken into account when developing technical mitigation measures.

ID VANISHING POINT DETECTION
AB In striving to achieve autonomous navigation, the guidance system plays an essential role. In this article, the authors present two recently developed vision-based methods to estimate the heading angle of the vehicle. The authors propose a real-time guidance application based on edge and color information using an omnidirectional image. First, line segments were extracted. Second, the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) curve fitting method was implemented. Third, the set of intersection points for each pair of curves was extracted. Finally, by implementing the Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithms, the heading angle was computed. The main contribution of this work is in the evaluation of the methods applied, which included the "edge-based extraction in road scenes" method, which uses the spatial density information around the vehicle (curbs, barrier, gutters, side strip areas), and the "edge-based lane marking segmentation." Both of these methods were evaluated in terms of the performance assessment of the length of the line segments in relation to the heading angle measurement. In that sense, the experiments were conducted for the purpose of testing the processing time and the number of extracted line segments. The preliminary results were gathered and tested on a group of consecutive frames to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

AB The oceans cover more than 71% of the Earth's surface and have a surging amount of data. It is of great significance to seek energy-effective and ultrareliable communication and transmission mechanism for effectively gathering abundant maritime data. In this article, we propose an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-assisted data gathering scheme based on clustering and matrix completion (ACMC) to improve the data gathering efficiency in the underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN). Specifically, we first improve the K-means algorithm by adopting the Elbow method to determine the optimal K and setting a distance threshold to select the separate initial cluster centers. Then, we introduce a two-phase AUV trajectory optimization mechanism to effectively reduce the trajectory length of the AUV. In the first phase, the optimized trajectory of the AUV is planned by adopting the greedy algorithm. In the second phase, the ordinary nodes close to the AUV trajectory are selected as secondary cluster heads to share the workload of cluster heads. Finally, we present an in-cluster data collection mechanism based on matrix completion. An extensive experiment validates the effectiveness of our proposed scheme in terms of energy and data collection delay.

AB Transoceanic Gliders are Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for which there is a developing and expanding range of applications in open-seas research, technology and underwater clean transport. Mature glider autonomy, operating depth (0-1000 meters) and low energy consumption without a CO2 footprint enable evolutionary access across ocean basins. Pursuant to the first successful transatlantic glider crossing in December 2009, the Challenger Mission has opened the door to long-term, long-distance routine transoceanic AUV missions. These vehicles, which glide through the water column between 0 and 1000 meters depth, are highly sensitive to the ocean current field. Consequently, it is essential to exploit the complex space-time structure of the ocean current field in order to plan a path that optimizes scientific payoff and navigation efficiency. This letter demonstrates the capability of dynamical system theory for achieving this goal by realizing the real-time navigation strategy for the transoceanic AUV named Silbo, which is a Slocum deep-glider (0-1000 m), that crossed the North Atlantic from April 2016 to March 2017. Path planning in real time based on this approach has facilitated an impressive speed up of the AUV to unprecedented velocities resulting in major battery savings on the mission, offering the potential for routine transoceanic long duration missions.

AB In this paper we present an extension to the hybrid A* (HA*) path planner. This extension allows autonomous underwater vehicle (AUVs) to plan paths in 3-dimensional (3D) environments. The proposed approach enables the robot to operate in a safe manner by accounting for the vehicle's motion constraints, thus avoiding collisions and ensuring that the calculated paths are feasible. Secondly, we propose an improvement for operations in unexplored or partially known environments by endowing the planner with a tree pruning procedure, which maintains a valid and feasible search-tree during operation. When the robot senses new obstacles in the environment that invalidate its current path, the planner prunes the tree of branches which collides with the environment. The path planning algorithm is then initialised with the pruned tree, enabling it to find a solution in a lower time than replanning from scratch. We present results obtained through simulation which show that HA* performs better in known underwater environments than compared algorithms in regards to planning time, path length and success rate. For unknown environments, we show that the tree pruning procedure reduces the total planning time needed in a variety of environments compared to running the full planning algorithm during replanning.

ID NAVIGATION
AB An increasing number of drivers are relying on digital map navigation systems in vehicles or mobile phones to select optimal driving routes in order to save time and improve safety. In the near future, digital map navigation systems are expected to play more important roles in transportation systems. In order to extend current navigation systems to more applications, two fundamental problems must be resolved: the lane-level map model and lane-level route planning. This study proposes solutions to both problems. The current limitation of the lane-level map model is not its accuracy but its flexibility; this study proposes a novel seven-layer map structure, called as Tsinghua map model, which is able to support autonomous driving in a flexible and efficient way. For lane-level route planning, we propose a hierarchical route-searching algorithm to accelerate the planning process, even in the presence of complicated lane networks. In addition, we model the travel costs allocated for lane-level road networks by analyzing vehicle maneuvers in traversing lanes, changing lanes, and turning at intersections. Tests were performed on both a grid network and a real lane-level road network to demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2019 THE AUTHORS.

AB Due to the escalating transportation demand and the significant ramifications of traffic congestion, there is an imperative to investigate the sources of congestion, known as "congestion bottlenecks". The implementation of control methods ahead of the occurrence of congestion is crucial. Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have a high potential within the field of traffic control. CAVs are exceptionally controllable and facilitate management feasibility. This study utilizes the high compliance of CAVs to provide an effective solution for the congestion management problem at the network level when mixed traffic flows are saturated. A linear programming model to reduce average travel time over the road network is developed. By utilizing a genetic algorithm, the optimal traffic demand regulation scheme can be obtained and the departure time of CAVs optimized. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulation across various road network scales, CAVs penetration rates, and controlled CAV proportions. The proposed method can only control a specific amount of CAVs, which, according to an analysis of the simulation results, significantly improves the performance of the transportation system. The importance of employing advanced control methods to improve the sustainability of urban transportation development and the travel experience is underscored in the conclusion.

AB Anticipating pedestrian crossing behavior in urban scenarios is a challenging task for autonomous vehicles. Early this year, a benchmark comprising JAAD and PIE datasets have been released. In the benchmark, several state-of-the-art methods have been ranked. However, most of the ranked temporal models rely on recurrent architectures. In our case, we propose, as far as we are concerned, the first self-attention alternative, based on transformer architecture, which has had enormous success in natural language processing (NLP) and recently in computer vision. Our architecture is composed of various branches which fuse video and kinematic data. The video branch is based on two possible architectures: RubiksNet and TimeSformer. The kinematic branch is based on different configurations of transformer encoder. Several experiments have been performed mainly focusing on pre-processing input data, highlighting problems with two kinematic data sources: pose keypoints and ego-vehicle speed. Our proposed model results are comparable to PCPA, the best performing model in the benchmark reaching an F1 Score of nearly 0.78 against 0.77. Furthermore, by using only bounding box coordinates and image data, our model surpasses PCPA by a larger margin (F1=0.75 vs. F1=0.72). Our model has proven to be a valid alternative to recurrent architectures, providing advantages such as parallelization and whole sequence processing, learning relationships between samples not possible with recurrent architectures.

TI Gaze-Head Input: Examining Potential Interaction with Immediate
   Experience Sampling in an Autonomous Vehicle

AB Autonomous vehicles (AV) increasingly allow drivers to engage in secondary tasks such as eating or working on a laptop and thus require easy and reliable interaction inputs to facilitate communication between the driver and the vehicle. However, drivers report feeling less in control when driving is no longer the primary task, which suggests that novel approaches for assessing satisfaction regarding AV decision-making are needed. Therefore, we propose an immediate experience sampling method (IESM) that learns driver preferences for AV actions. We also suggest gaze-head input (G-HI) as a novel input in an AV. G-HI provides a hands-free, remote, and intuitive input modality that allows drivers to interact with the AV while continuing to engage in non-driving related tasks. We compare G-HI with voice and touch inputs via IESM for two simulated driving scenarios. Our results report the differences among the three inputs in terms of system usability, reaction time, and perceived workload. It also reveals that G-HI is a promising candidate for AV input interaction, which could replace voice or touch inputs where those inputs could not be utilized. Variation in driver satisfaction and expectations for AV actions confirms the effectiveness of using IESM to increase drivers' sense of control.

ID COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY
AB As a core component of the Internet of Vehicles, reasoning about the trajectory of pedestrians or vehicles in complex road conditions plays a critical role in autonomous driving and socially aware robotic navigation. Most existing methods do not adequately consider the effects of heterogeneous traffic agents. Toward this end, we propose the traffic trajectory prediction algorithm based on the convolutional attention network (TraGCAN) to predict the trajectories of heterogeneous traffic agents in dense traffic. The algorithm of the proposed method examines the behavior of different traffic agents in terms of both time and space dimensions to identify their movement patterns and interactions. We construct the spatial relationship of traffic agents as a graph structure and introduce a graph convolutional network to extract spatial interactions. In addition, we design a spatial attention mechanism to adaptively calculate weights for all spatial interactions to capture different influences from neighboring agents. To improve the accuracy of trajectory prediction, the algorithm considers the influence of the heterogeneous characteristics of traffic agents on their motion behaviors. We evaluated the performance of the proposed TraGCAN on heterogeneous traffic data sets, and the results demonstrate that the error of TraGCAN is reduced by 15% compared to existing methods.

AB Developing autonomous vehicles (AVs) helps improve the road safety and traffic efficiency of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Accurately predicting the trajectories of traffic participants is essential to the decision-making and motion planning of AVs in interactive scenarios. Recently, learning-based trajectory predictors have shown state-of-the-art performance in highway or urban areas. However, most existing learning-based models trained with fixed datasets may perform poorly in continuously changing scenarios. Specifically, they may not perform well in learned scenarios after learning the new one. This phenomenon is called "catastrophic forgetting". Few studies investigate trajectory predictions in continuous scenarios, where catastrophic forgetting may happen. To handle this problem, first, a novel continual learning (CL) approach for vehicle trajectory prediction is proposed in this paper. Then, inspired by brain science, a dynamic memory mechanism is developed by utilizing the measurement of traffic divergence between scenarios, which balances the performance and training efficiency of the proposed CL approach. Finally, datasets collected from different locations are used to design continual training and testing methods in experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves consistently high prediction accuracy in continuous scenarios without re-training, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting compared to non-CL approaches. The implementation of the proposed approach is publicly available at https://github.com/BIT-Jack/D-GSM.

AB The advances in agile micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) have shown great potential in replacing humans for labor-intensive or dangerous indoor investigation, such as warehouse management and fire rescue. However, the design of a state estimation system that enables autonomous flight poses fundamental challenges in such dim or smoky environments. Current dominated computer-vision based solutions only work in well-lighted texture-rich environments. This paper addresses the challenge by proposing Marvel, an RF backscatter-based state estimation system with online initialization and calibration. Marvel is nonintrusive to commercial MAVs by attaching backscatter tags to their landing gears without internal hardware modifications, and works in a plug-and-play fashion with an automatic initialization module. Marvel is enabled by three new designs, a backscatter-based pose sensing module, an online initialization and calibration module, and a backscatter-inertial super-accuracy state estimation algorithm. We demonstrate our design by programming a commercial MAV to autonomously fly in different trajectories. The results show that Marvel supports navigation within a range of 50 m or through three concrete walls, with an accuracy of 34 cm for localization and 4.99 degrees for orientation estimation. We further demonstrate our online initialization and calibration by comparing to the perfect initial parameter measurements from burdensome manual operations.

AB Aquaculture net pens inspection and monitoring are important to ensure net stability and fish health in the fish farms. Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) offer a low-cost and sophisticated solution for the regular inspection of the underwater fish net pens due to their ability of visual sensing and autonomy in a challenging and dynamic aquaculture environment. In this paper, we report the integration of an ROV with a visual servoing scheme for regular inspection and tracking of the net pens. We propose a vision-based positioning scheme that consists of an object detector, a pose generator, and a closed-loop controller. The system employs a modular approach that first utilizes two easily identifiable parallel ropes attached to the net for image processing through traditional computer vision methods. Second, the reference positions of the ROV relative to the net plane are extracted on the basis of a vision triangulation method. Third, a closed-loop control law is employed to instruct the vehicle to traverse from top to bottom along the net plane to inspect its status. The proposed vision-based scheme has been implemented and tested both through simulations and field experiments. The extensive experimental results have allowed the assessment of the performance of the scheme that resulted satisfactorily and can supplement the traditional aquaculture net pens inspection and tracking systems.

AB Knowledge of the ego-vehicle's motion state is essential for assessing the collision risk in advanced driver assistance systems or autonomous driving. Vision-based methods for estimating the ego-motion of vehicle, i.e., visual odometry, face a number of challenges in uncontrolled realistic urban environments. Existing solutions fail to achieve a good tradeoff between high accuracy and low computational complexity. In this paper, a framework for ego-motion estimation that integrates runtime-efficient strategies with robust techniques at various core stages in visual odometry is proposed. First, a pruning method is employed to reduce the computational complexity of Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) feature detection without compromising on the quality of the features. Next, three strategies, i.e., smooth motion constraint, adaptive integration window technique, and automatic tracking failure detection scheme, are introduced into the conventional KLT tracker to facilitate generation of feature correspondences in a robust and runtime efficient way. Finally, an early termination condition for the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm is integrated with the Gauss-Newton optimization scheme to enable rapid convergence of the motion estimation process while achieving robustness. Experimental results based on the KITTI odometry data set show that the proposed technique outperforms the state-of-the-art visual odometry methods by producing more accurate ego-motion estimation in notably lesser amount of time.

AB Cooperation as a problem-solving strategy is widely used to build methods addressing complex hard optimization problems. It involves a set of highly autonomous programs (agents), each implementing a particular solution method, and a cooperation scheme combining these autonomous programs into a single problem-solving strategy. Possible form of such cooperation may be based, for example, on adaptive memory methods, where partial elements of good solutions are stored and next combined to create new complete solutions. Alternative approach is based on central memory, where complete elite solutions are exchanged among various agents and/or heuristics. Moreover, cooperatively solving a task is often combined with learning mechanism, where agents adapt their behavior to the new states of environment during the process of solving the problem.
   The main goal of the paper is to evaluate to what extent a mode of cooperation (synchronous or asynchronous) between a number of optimization agents cooperating through sharing a central memory influences the quality of solutions while solving instances of the Vehicle Routing Problem. The investigated search modes are evaluated using a dedicated cooperative multi-agent system allowing for various modes of cooperation and with the reinforcement learning mechanism implemented in it.

ID VISUAL ODOMETRY
AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) navigation and control modules often integrate as much sensory data as possible to increase accuracy in estimating pose and velocity. Visual odometry can be a good complement for robot localization when it navigates in challenging underwater scenarios, such as those colonized with seagrass or algae. Thanks to the wide variety of cameras available on the market, their increased performance and moderated cost; this type of sensor now can be used in marine robots. The work proposed in this paper increases the robustness of contemporary feature-based visual odometers for application in such environments by evolving a state-of-the-art approach; ensuring the tracking of visual keypoints that are geometrically and photometrically invariant, highly distinguishable, and exhibit strong repeatability. Experimental results, obtained from visual datasets captured by a stereoscopic camera installed on an AUV while performing different missions in large areas of the Balearic Islands with special ecological interest, show the improvement of this proposal with respect to other approaches already available and its feasibility to be used online.

AB Target search for moving and invisible objects has always been considered a challenge, as the floating objects drift with the flows. This study focuses on target search by multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) and investigates a multi-agent target search method (MATSMI) for moving and invisible objects. In the MATSMI algorithm, based on the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) method, we add spatial and temporal information to the reinforcement learning state and set up specialized rewards in conjunction with a maritime target search scenario. Additionally, we construct a simulation environment to simulate a multi-AUV search for the floating object. The simulation results show that the MATSMI method has about 20% higher search success rate and about 70 steps shorter search time than the traditional search method. In addition, the MATSMI method converges faster than the MADDPG method. This paper provides a novel and effective method for solving the maritime target search problem.

ID FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; OBSERVERS
AB Models of dynamic systems are considered with regard to the tasks of diagnosing real-time complex information processing and control systems. The problem of diagnosing is one of the most important in the practice of development technical systems. It is important to note that symmetry principles are used in this work, in particular, to formulate the basic approach to diagnosing complex systems. This approach assumes that the components of a system are allocated to the levels based on inclusion relations. In this case, level-based diagnostic tools with their own models can be synthesized, and the relations between them are characterized by the symmetry feature. Problems of both functional and test-based diagnostic methods are discussed. Particular diagnostic methods may also involve symmetry principles since, in a certain sense, they operate with symmetric notions of observability and controllability of a dynamic system. The implementation of the proposed methods is illustrated by an example of their application to a navigation system of an autonomous underwater vehicle.

TI MOBILE-EDGE-PLATOONING CLOUD: A LIGHTWEIGHT CLOUD IN VEHICULAR NETWORKS
SO IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB The lack of overall consideration for the efficiency of the transportation system and security situation led to the research on single-vehicle intelligence facing a dilemma. Especially in remote areas without roadside infrastructure deployment or network coverage, all or part of the functions of intelligent services are confronted with failure. Additionally, expensive deployment costs and service charges lead to lower user acceptance and penetration of edge servers. Consequently, a novel autonomous driving paradigm and cloud service architecture urgently need to be raised. Fortunately, platoons' emergence alleviates the inflexibility and shortage of single-vehicle intelligence with its inherited superiority in available resources and adaptive coordination. Given the polymerization, shareability, and economy of platoon resources, the platoon can be regarded as a mobile-edge-platooning cloud (MEPC) platform to provide aggregated resources of computing, storage, communication, and intellectualization. MEPC is a technologically feasible and economically viable cloud for resource sharing, task scheduling, and autonomous traffic. Along with meeting the resource demand of burgeoning vehicular applications, MEPC can empower the traditional cloud-edge-end architecture based on current and developing technologies, such as AI and blockchain.

TI Stepwise Goal-Driven Networks for Trajectory Prediction
SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Autonomous vehicle navigation; autonomous agents; trajectory prediction
AB We propose to predict the future trajectories of observed agents (e.g., pedestrians or vehicles) by estimating and using their goals at multiple time scales. We argue that the goal of a moving agent may change over time, and modeling goals continuously provides more accurate and detailed information for future trajectory estimation. To this end, we present a recurrent network for trajectory prediction, called Stepwise Goal-Driven Network (SGNet). Unlike prior work that models only a single, long-term goal, SGNet estimates and uses goals at multiple temporal scales. In particular, it incorporates an encoder that captures historical information, a stepwise goal estimator that predicts successive goals into the future, and a decoder that predicts future trajectory. We evaluate our model on three first-person traffic datasets (HEV-I, JAAD, and PIE) as well as on three bird's eye view datasets (NuScenes, ETH, and UCY), and show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on all datasets. Code has been made available at: https://github.com/ChuhuaW/SGNet.pytorch.
